Children's health has been compromised by the undue delays and in many cases, optimal outcomes have not been achieved as a result of the delays.  Getting the surgery on time is critical not only to full recovery but to the proper, full development of a child's potential.  On 1 September on the "Late Late Show" there were very revealing stories told, particularly by Megan Halvey Ryan who waited 18 months for an operation.  As a result of the long delay, she had to have full spinal surgery and has less flexibility because of the nature of the operation she had to have as a result of the long delay.  The Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, said it would be an absolute priority that those on the waiting list would not have to wait longer than four months and that would be the case by the end of 2017.  However, that was in March and the situation as of last month is that those waiting list targets have been missed.  The number of children waiting for more than four months has increased from 124 to 145 and for some of those it is much longer than four months.  I am dealing with a case of a young boy aged 15 years who has been diagnosed as needing urgent surgery.  In August 2016, he was put on the surgical waiting list.  The surgeon is saying it is urgent.  He has complications caused by other conditions such as spina bifida.  He is in a wheelchair.  I have spoken to his mother, who emailed me this morning saying that humanity, empathy and compassion need to be taken into account when dealing with her son's case.  She is at her wit's end.  She is totally stressed as a result of the lack of progress on the waiting time.  There is also the fear that if it does not happen on time, his health will be further compromised.  In his case and others, what has been going on for the past three to four years has been quite shocking and represents a failure in providing resources.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that the waiting list target - the absolute priority set by his predecessor - will be met by the end of this year and that urgency will continue to be attached to cases such as that of the young man I referenced and about whom I have communicated with the Minister and others?</p><p>It is quite shocking to have to go back to the mother of such a child.  The mother is relatively helpless in progressing the case further.  Can the Taoiseach give a firm commitment that waiting target will be achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, which is very close to my heart.  I took an interest in it, both as a doctor and as Minister for Health.  We can all accept that far too many people in Ireland are waiting far too long for treatment.  People are well aware that about 600,000 people are on one form of waiting list or another.  More than half of those people will be seen in less than six months and about a third of people are seen in less than three months.  However, many people are still waiting more than three months and more than six months, which is not something we want to continue or to stand over.</p>  <p>  The waiting lists for surgery for inpatient and day-case treatment are starting to fall.  The most recent figures from August show a fall of 2,000 in the number of people waiting for surgery - waiting for procedures or operations.  That is due in part to additional investment in the health service with a record budget this year and additional funds provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  Dealing with scoliosis in particular, as the Deputy knows, the Government has a scoliosis action plan in place.  When I was Minister for Health I met the surgeons who perform these operations and met representatives of some of the interest groups.  One of their big requests was that a new theatre be provided in Crumlin hospital.  That cost about &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  That new theatre is now in place and open.  Quite a number of cases are now being outsourced to other hospitals including, for example, to Blackrock and Stanmore in London.  The number of operations has increased.  It is a good sign that more people are being treated and having their surgery, but people are still waiting a very long time.</p>  <p>  The four-month target was set by the director general of the Health Service Executive, which is funded to meet that target.  I will certainly be calling on the HSE to deliver on that target.  I discussed it with the Minister for Health in the past couple of days and it is intended to have a treatment plan and a treatment offer for every child who is waiting for scoliosis surgery.  It may not be possible to perform all operations in Crumlin by the surgeon of choice, but certainly people will be given the offer of treatment abroad if they are waiting more than four to six months on the surgical waiting list for that.  Of course we understand that some parents will - for totally legitimate reasons - prefer to have the treatment in their own country rather than going abroad, but the treatment abroad option will be there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600004#B00300"><p>If the Taoiseach is honest, he will admit the only reason progress was made was because the Government was shamed into it by television programmes and ones on RTE in particular, which highlighter earlier this year the long waiting times for young people with scoliosis in particular.  It took that kind of media profile to get action from the Government because in 2014, 2015 and 2016 the resources were not provided and the scoliosis waiting lists were allowed to grow far too long.  Parents will say that whoever gets on the media gets a better chance of getting an operation which is obviously not the route to take.  The Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to adopt the National Treatment Purchase Fund as a strategy to reduce waiting times.  It is belated and has been too slow in implementation.</p>  <p>  On the scoliosis question, it is the Minister for Health who is responsible to ensure this happens.  The Taoiseach cannot keep passing the buck and trying to detach himself and the Government from the reality on the ground as it affects young children's health and, crucially, their outcomes.  We want an optimal outcome for these children.  Because of the complications that apply in certain cases, not every child will be in a position to go overseas for an operation.  It is vital that every action is taken.  We need ministerial and Government oversight to ensure what the Ombudsman for Children has declared to be a contravention of children's rights is rectified and that children in this case get their operations on time to ensure they get an optimal outcome as a result of the treatment of their condition.</p></speech>

All of us in Ireland and in this society should be ashamed that children have to wait such a prolonged period for operations.</p><p>Sadly, this is a problem that exists for as long as I can remember.  When I was a medical student, there were long waits for scoliosis surgery.  I believe Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was the Minister for Health and Children at that particular time.  The waiting lists might not have been as long as they are now but they certainly were very long.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600005#C00300"><p>This is an issue that has been a problem for us certainly as long as I can remember.  The question I want to answer and the one I think is the most important to be answered is what are we doing about it.  The new theatre in Crumlin is now open.  The additional nurses are now in post in Crumlin and Temple Street and an additional orthopaedic surgeon will commence work in Crumlin in early October.  A total of 226 surgeries have taken place in Crumlin and Temple Street so far this year, which is a significant increase already on last year.  A total of 23 cases have been outsourced to the Mater, Cappagh and Stanmore and the HSE has also completed an international tender for paediatric spinal fusion procedures to take place in three other hospitals.  Those hospitals will commence patient reviews immediately with a view to commencing treatment in October 2017.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that we are pulling out all the stops and doing everything we can to make sure more children have the surgery they need within an acceptable time period, and if that involves offering people treatment abroad, we will fund that but we understand and accept that for perfectly legitimate reasons every parent may not wish to accept the offer of treatment abroad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600005#C00400"><p>The forthcoming budget represents a genuine opportunity to deliver for those who are struggling to make ends meet.  The Taoiseach says he represents those who get up early in the morning.  I can tell him that nobody gets up earlier in the morning than those who are raising young children.  While Fine Gael and their friends in Fianna F&aacute;il engage in a sham fight over tax cuts, and hammer out a budget that will disproportionately benefit the well-off in society, young families in Ireland are faced with some of the highest child care costs in the world.  In his so-called republic of opportunity, many parents are paying what amounts to a second mortgage to ensure that their children are looked after.  The reason for that rests squarely at the feet of successive Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments which completely failed to invest in the early years sector.</p>  <p>  Announcing measly tax cuts that will put loose change in the pockets of those families is no good.  They will not be so easily bought off.  By signalling a preference for tax cuts over the necessity to build decent public services, the Government is choosing to abandon those families.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have also made a choice.  We have chosen to stand on the side of the struggling families.  We want to see a budget that puts their interests first through the proper funding and resourcing of the early years sector.  High quality affordable child care is an essential public service.  It allows parents return to work and avoid poverty traps and it provides employment.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach needs to wake up to the pressures young families are facing today.  They are hanging on by their finger nails.  He must commit to providing high quality, affordable child care throughout the State.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in proposes an increase in the universal child care subsidy &ndash; from 50 cent an hour to &euro;2.50 an hour.  That is a fivefold increase.  This measure would put &euro;420 a month, per child, into the pockets of struggling families.  It would make a real difference not only for parents, but also for child care providers who are prevented from reinvesting in their services as they operate on a break-even basis.  My question to the Taoiseach is very simple.  Will he adopt this proposal in budget 2018 and give those families a real break?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600005#C00500"><p>First, I would like to restate the budget priorities that I have stated now on a number of occasions but I will do it again in the House so that everyone can hear it.  My first priority in this budget is to balance the books, and to do so for the first time in ten years.  What that means, roughly speaking, is for the first time in ten years the amount that we take in in terms of revenue will match what goes out in spending.  That is the prudent thing to do.  I am pleased to hear that the party opposite, Fianna F&aacute;il, support that.  I would like to hear from Sinn F&eacute;in as to whether it will also support our policy of balancing the books and doing so for the first time because that is the prudent thing to do and that is the thing that matters most for children because they are the ones who bear the consequences in the future of bad economic policy and they are the ones who would bear the consequence of us continuing to increase our debt.</p><p>We are not going to do that.  We are going to balance the books and reduce the debt.  That is the right thing to do for families and particularly for children.  They are the ones who bear the long-term consequences of bad economic policies. </p> <p> Our second priority is additional funding for public services and infrastructure.  We anticipate spending increases of between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion next year.  Most of that is down to demographics.  Most of it is commitments already made.  There will not be huge scope for additional announcements on budget day but there will still be a significant increase in public spending next year, to improve public services and infrastructure.  After that, we will find some space to improve the take-home pay and living standards of people in Ireland who go to work, namely, the 1.4 million taxpayers.  I think they deserve something because it is the work they do and the taxes they pay that allow everything else to be possible.</p> <p> In terms of what we have done for families - I am not just talking about Fine Gael here - successive Governments of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and Independents have brought child benefit to one of the highest rates in Europe.  We brought in a free pre-school year and then brought in a second one.  We increased the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance by 25% in the most recent summer period.  For the first time, we brought in subsidies for child care, which took effect in September.  The Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, who is in the Chamber, led the initiative on that.  We also brought in GP care without any charge for children aged under six.  We are going to build on that as well.  That is just by way of example of the kind of things that every other party in this House has done for young families.  What has Sinn F&eacute;in ever done for young families?</p></speech>

I see around me Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Independents, and the Green Party who can all say that they did something practical and useful for young people.  When Deputy McDonald says she has made a choice and that she stands with young families, that is totally bogus.  Sinn F&eacute;in made a choice to opt out of Government.  It does not want to be in government here.  Its MPs do not want to take their seats at Westminster.  It does not want to be in government in Northern Ireland, or at least it appears that way.  In local authorities, its councillors take decisions all the time that are not in the interests of the public but are just populist.  In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party in this House that has never done anything for children.</p></speech>

While I regard that as something of a personal endeavour, it also puts me, like so many others, in a position to understand that all of the cant and empty rhetoric about balancing the books is not worth a fig to struggling families.  To couples at work or individuals on their own who have to provide care for their children, lofty words about balancing the books from An Taoiseach in that dismissive way are of no use.  Children are all too familiar with the hardship of the messed up economic policies that the Taoiseach and his friends have pursued.  Hundreds of them are now in emergency accommodation courtesy of those economic endeavours.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach a question and expect a response to it.  I have said that we need to increase funding and that we need to do so in such a way as to put an additional &euro;420 a month into the pockets of struggling families.  It should be done through the universal child care subsidy.  The resources are there.  We have the fiscal space.  In a full year, our proposal would cost the Exchequer &euro;116 million.  I cannot imagine a better spend of that sum.</p>  <p>  With all due respect to the Taoiseach, he should answer the questions.  He should not dream of attacking us on the basis of our care or otherwise for children.  Given the record of his Government and successive Governments, he has considerable neck to advance that position.</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach is interested in doing this country a massive favour by deciding to tackle something that no one before him has tackled, he should start by no longer listening to those who have a vested financial interest, including the likes of the Construction Industry Federation, the people who control the real estate investment trusts and the developers.  Many developers do not even build any more; they are just working the money.  The development land market is controlled by investors rather than builders.  Combined Government measures have encouraged investors to purchase and hold large tracts of serviced residential land.  In 2012, the Government introduced incentives to get private investors to buy assets at firesale prices and hold them for seven years.  It was an incentive not to build.  In last year's Finance Act, the period in question was reduced to five years in the case of certain funds.  The vacant site levy is a joke.  There are more holes in it than in a sieve.</p>  <p>  There is a multitude of problems with how we supply housing.  The failure to deal with those problems means the next bust is never far away.  Will the Taoiseach consider tackling landbanking, which is at the heart of many of our housing supply problems, in a real and meaningful way in next month's budget?  The private sector does what it does.  It maximises its earning potential in any way possible.  The private sector builds when it likes and where it likes, as is its right.  The State should not depend on the private sector to provide social and affordable housing.  We have tried that approach and it has not worked.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken about repurposing NAMA to solve our housing problems.  NAMA is under investigation in Britain, the US and Ireland.  Just 6% of the land NAMA has sold has been built on.  Just 3,000 out of a potential 50,000 homes have been built on that land.  Why did NAMA sell land to people who had a vested interest in sitting on it?  Why did it sell it at fire-sale prices?  Approximately 8,000 units are being developed in Cherrywood.  NAMA sold the sites for some 3,800 of them to Hines for approximately &euro;27,000 apiece.  Each of those sites is now worth over &euro;100,000.  How clever was that?  In March 2016, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund invested &euro;30 million in Ardstone Homes.  One month later, NAMA sold 120 acres to this developer for &euro;50 million.  In addition to selling large bundles of land on the cheap, the State is putting up the money for private developers.  Although NAMA has neither the expertise nor the personnel with a background in housing to solve this housing crisis, which it helped to create, it still has close to 5,000 acres of land.  None of the NAMA board has any experience in property, not to mention residential property.  I put it to the Taoiseach that it is time to give this land to the local authorities to provide social and affordable housing at a reasonable price.</p></speech>

Of course we will listen to entities that can provide finance.  Of course we will listen to builders who have experience in building homes.  As politicians, our constituents are the people to whom we listen the most.  Everyone on this side of the House is aware that a large number of those who come into our constituency clinics are struggling to hold onto their homes.  Large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s who aspire to own homes for the first time are struggling to do so.  I assure the Deputy they are the people to whom we, as practising politicians, listen most often and most frequently.</p><p> In terms of next year, because of the increases we are seeing in housing activity, in planning permissions coming through, commencements and so on, we expect approximately 20,000 new homes to be built in 2018 - a significant increase on this year - of which 15,000 will be provided by the private sector and in the region of 5,000 by the Government.  It is not the case that we will rely on the private sector to build.  We will ramp up the provision of council houses and apartments to approximately 5,000 next year, with 3,800 to be built directly by local authorities and 1,200 to be acquired - in some cases through bringing long-term voids back into use and through Part V provision in others.</p> <p> In terms of land hoarding and vacant sites not being developed, we have introduced a vacant site levy.  The first step will be to draw up a register of sites that are vacant, establish that they are vacant and then impose the levy in respect of them.  That is a policy that exists already.  We will impose a vacant site levy of 3% on undeveloped sites.  It certainly is not working yet.  The advice we have is that we need to give people notice to develop.  We cannot just impose the levy immediately; people have to be given an opportunity to develop sites.  However, that will start to kick in and we will begin to see some of those sites coming into use.</p></speech>

Every time the price of a house goes up by 10%, the price of the land goes up by a minimum of 30%.  In the past three years, 26 houses have been built in Wexford; that is seven per year.  It is not happening.  The Government has brought out so many measures at this stage we have lost count of them.</p>  <p>  In 2016, NAMA sold Project Abbey, the loan portfolio of developer Harcourt Developments, for &euro;300 million.  Before it did so, NAMA took out 72 acres of the land and boasted at the housing committee that it would be used for housing.  That sounded great, but last week we discovered that it has just turned around and done a deal with the very same developer to build X number of houses.  That developer is getting his land back and he will make a fortune on it.  The houses in question will not be available at an affordable price for people.</p>  <p>  From 2010 to 2016, the average cost of new homes in Dublin increased by 62%, that is, from &euro;284,000 to &euro;461,000.  In November last year, the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, confirmed the cost of a three-bedroom house from the local authority was &euro;205,000 in Dublin and &euro;154,000 outside Dublin.  Where in God's name is the logic of engaging the private sector to supply housing in the private market for people who cannot afford it?  The State can do so.  It has got to use the local authorities much more than it is proposing to do at present.  It is possible to provide social and affordable housing to people who need it.</p></speech>

As the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has just informed me, the number of houses built by local authorities this year will be 2,400.  That is four times as many as they built two years ago.  I appreciate that is coming from a very low base but to increase the number of local authority houses being built fourfold in two years is significant.  We will increase it again next year by another 50% - to approximately 3,800 - so we will ramp up the amount of housing built by local authorities.  Yesterday, the Deputy will have seen on the news that not too far from here, near the Grand Canal in Charlemont Place, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, doing exactly what he said he should do, namely, topping out a new mixed-use development that has commercial-----</p></speech>

There is one glaringly obvious omission from that list, namely, a desperately-needed commitment to amend the Constitution in respect of Article 43.  Article 43, as the Taoiseach knows, acknowledges a natural right to private property above any human-made law.  It goes on to state that this right must be regulated by the principles of social justice and that, on occasion, such rights need to be delimited by the exigencies of the common good.  Notwithstanding these safeguards, regrettably, the superior courts have consistently taken the narrowest view of Article 43 when the exercise of property rights is deemed to be detrimental to the common good.  In the main, the courts have found in favour of the upholding of private property rights or else have ruled that the State must pay prohibitive levels of compensation.  The impact of Article 43 has been most profound and most detrimental in respect of the provision of housing.  Successive Ministers with responsibility for housing have claimed that Article 43 significantly restricts the capacity of government to introduce key measures to deal with the housing crisis.  I refer, for example, to the imposition of a meaningful vacant site levy to address the pressing issue of land-hoarding and not just the meagre little levy that is promised to kick in at some point and which is far lower than the inflation rate of vacant land; measures to tackle the large number of vacant properties; measures to prevent the eviction of families in cases in which a landlord is selling a property; and attempts to implement compulsory purchase orders in respect of unused housing landbanks.  While there are major problems regarding housing and housing land, leading to a crisis of affordability and supply, it seems there is no appetite on the part of the Government to remove the constitutional obstacle that is Article 43.  How on earth is the amending of Article 43 of the Constitution not on the Taoiseach's priority list for a referendum?  Without amending Article 43, how can we achieve social justice and serve the common good in respect of housing?  Will the Taoiseach now commit to an early referendum on Article 43 in order that the housing crisis can be tackled comprehensively and effectively and we get no more excuses from Ministers?</p></speech>

The referendums very much flow from the Citizens' Assembly.  The Citizens' Assembly did make a recommendation regarding economic, social and cultural rights, and I understand that this, as well as a proposal on housing, has been referred for further consideration to the Department of Finance.  The proposal - at least, the indicative proposal - is to have a stand-alone referendum on the eighth amendment in May or June next year.  That will very much follow on from the recommendations of the all-party committee that is considering the matter and which has a deadline to report by Christmas.  Further referendums are to be held concurrent with the presidential election, whether or not the position is contested, in winter of 2018, dealing with women in the home, blasphemy and the possibility of plebiscites on directly elected mayors.  Then, in summer 2019, concurrent with the local and European elections, referendums are to be held to extend the franchise to citizens abroad to vote in presidential elections and to liberalise the divorce laws on foot of Deputy Madigan's Bill.</p>  <p>  I dislike the term "property rights".  It implies that properties have rights.  Properties do not have rights; individuals have rights.  If one owns a farm, one has a certain right to deal with that farm, manage it and do what one likes with it.  If one has a business, one has certain rights over that business.</p><p>If one has a home, one has a right to live in it.  Of course, if one has an investment property and it is one's pension, one has certain rights to it too.  When we talk about diluting or removing property rights, we should not make the mistake of thinking we are removing rights from properties; we are removing rights from people.  I would like to understand better from those who advocate diluting those rights exactly which individual rights they want to take away from which individual people - specifically what and why.</p> <p> Nonetheless, the protection of property rights in the Constitution can actually be over-egged.  We have a vacant site levy.  We brought that in notwithstanding property rights, and it is now in place.  We have brought in the rent pressure zones, putting caps on rent increases.  Again, some people said that was a violation of property rights but it turned out it was not.  It is also the case that local authorities can use CPOs to CPO vacant properties and, in fact, Louth County Council has done that on dozens of occasions.  People often hold up property rights as an excuse for things not being done but we have shown, on a number of occasions, that we can do those things without breaching property rights.</p></speech>

One would have to ask how many homeless does it take for the Taoiseach to recognise the obstacle that is Article 43, and it is most profound, obviously, in regard to housing.  The Taoiseach clearly is not listening to the points that are made very strongly by the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and previous Ministers for housing in respect of the obstacle Article 43 has put in their way.  In addition to the whole area of housing, Article 43 has been a long-standing impediment to fair and balanced legislation in many different areas.  For example, we know that, in 1996, the Supreme Court ruled that the Employment Equality Bill was unconstitutional because it put too much of a cost burden on employers.  We know that the risk of unconstitutionality was also cited as the reason that the last Government reneged on its promise to abolish upward-only rent reviews.  We know that, in this Government, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has indicated that Article 43 is an impediment to legislating to address the over-concentration of media ownership in this country.  For all of these reasons, but particularly in regard to the housing crisis, I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his priorities and commit to a referendum to amend Article 43 of the Constitution.</p></speech>

I am listening, although that is not necessarily the same thing as agreeing.  As I have already said, we have, on a number of occasions, considered the balance of property rights and the public interest.  Property rights in Ireland are not exclusive; they are not without limitation and are limited by the public interest.  We have used that public interest test to bring in rent caps, which have kept rents down in large parts of the country.  CPOs are used regularly to CPO land for everything from housing to roads, and we have also brought in the vacant sites levy.

The programme for Government gives clear commitments on utilising various agencies and mechanisms, especially the Irish credit union movement.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to:</p><blockquote>recognise the potential role that Credit Unions can play in housing finance ... [and to] lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.  To investigate what role the Credit Union movement can play in the development of new housing, the Department of Finance will engage with the League of Credit Unions to help them develop their housing proposals.</blockquote><p>That was a target action for the first 100 days within the programme for Government.  For the last three to four years the credit union movement has been saying to the Government that, essentially, it has substantial money on deposit and available to utilise through some vehicle for social house construction.  They have not been taken seriously by Government and nothing has emanated-----</p></speech>

I regularly receive complaints about bins not being picked up, a general lack of understanding of the new system and in some areas, waste collectors that behave as though they were a law unto themselves.  We also know that parts of the country have yet to receive brown bins and people are being charged black bin prices for brown bin waste.

I am particularly interested in hearing the amount the Government intends to raise in new or increased taxes it already has referred to, such as the sugar tax and excise duties and so on, to allow and provide for spending increases.</p><p>The Taoiseach has also spoken at length about a concept termed "hidden fiscal space".  What is that and how much hidden fiscal space has now been identified?  In the context of the budget, a lot of people are worried about what will happen regarding proposed changes in property taxes, revaluations and, potentially, rates beyond 2019.  People deserve an answer and clarity on that and where they stand, in particular people living on their own in houses and paying out of a pension or social welfare income.</p></speech>

The budget is still under negotiation and discussion and there are many moving parts to it, as with any budget.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate the exact tax measures.  The term "hidden fiscal space" refers to savings and things that had to be paid for in 2017 which might not have to paid for in 2018.  It includes things such as the fall in the live register numbers.  If they continue to fall, that will obviously result in savings.</p></speech>

There has not been one word on what is going on in Ryanair.  When are we going to see legislation before the House to protect workers' rights and bring them up to European levels where the courts have ruled that Belgian pilots are entitled to have their grievances heard in Belgium rather than Dublin because labour laws here are so lax?  When are we going to see protection for workers who endure bogus self-employment contracts and have no access to trade union recognition?  When will the Government challenge the likes of Ryanair, whose boss it has sitting at its pre-budget dinners and eulogises as one of the most decent businessmen in the country?

What is happening in this area?  A recent EUROSTAT report states that over 50% of all economic activity in Ireland is now based in Dublin, the highest rate in any European country.  This is a bad development.  Dublin cannot cope and we badly need economic activity in rural Ireland.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, what will the Taoiseach do to fast-track moving some badly-needed investment to the regions, especially to rural areas?  We can cope with it because we have the road network and everything else.  It cannot all be in Dublin.</p></speech>

Will he tell us the basis for giving that assurance?  Is there a review of the local property tax in the context of the baselines used and the equalisation fund?  The fact that the census of population is not considered at all and that some of the figures used as the basis for property tax date back to the early 2000s makes it a completely flawed model.  What reviews are under way?</p></speech>

The Ministers for Housing, Planning and Local Government and Finance are involved and the group will take into account the content of the Thornhill report with a view to reporting itself sometime next year.  The assurance I gave people yesterday was on foot of a question I was asked in London.  In answering that question, I acknowledged that without a change of policy or in the absence of a Government decision, some people - not just in the greater Dublin area but also in other many parts of the country - would be facing a steep and sudden increase in property tax in 2019.  I gave the assurance that people would not experience a sudden or dramatic increases in their property tax in 2019.</p></speech>

It is almost two and a half years since Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon came back with a series of recommendations, including one to the effect that we should allow asylum seekers who have been in the process without a decision for nine months to work.  It is four months since the Supreme Court gave the Government a six-month window to rectify that matter.</p><p>However, there is nothing in the legislative programme.  How and when does the Taoiseach intend to provide justice for asylum seekers whom the Supreme Court recognised are being treated unconstitutionally?

I am aware of the court judgment and it is the view of the Government that if somebody is waiting for a prolonged period of time for a decision as to whether he or she has the right to remain, he or she should be allowed to have the opportunity to work.  These are people who wish to get up early in the morning to go to work and we currently do not allow them to do so under our laws.  The reason it does not appear in the legislative programme is that we think we can resolve it without using primary legislation, but the Minister for Justice and Equality should be in a position to respond to the court's judgment in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

Over the summer the Irish Postmasters' Union withdrew from the talks with An Post.  It also refused to implement the new smart account.  This was due to sheer frustration at the lack of interest shown by this Government in securing our post office network.  As the Taoiseach knows, the post offices provide a basic and vital service which serves rural communities very well, but 600 post offices are now believed to be under threat.  What action has been taken to address the concerns of the postmasters?  What action will the Taoiseach and the Government take to protect this vital service?  Will the Government implement all the recommendations of the Kerr report?  It is high time the Taoiseach and the Government stood up for rural communities.  We have seen too many services decimated and we will not be treated as second class citizens any longer.</p></speech>

Certainly, the Government acknowledges the important service provided by post offices around the country.  We wish to retain as much of the post office network as possible and to find new business for the post offices.  However, we acknowledge that increasingly services are going online and that as more people have access to high speed broadband fewer of them will use the post office in the way they did in the past.  That will require the post offices to find new business.</p></speech>

There are five Ministers with responsibility for health and any number of HSE managers who are being paid a fortune.  It is difficult for people who are languishing for three, four and five years on waiting lists, to be saved from going blind or for orthodontic treatment, to understand why they must wait so long.  Has the Taoiseach interacted with HSE South about the queries we have been consistently raising?  What answers has he received?  What satisfaction will these poor people get, or will they ever get treatment?  We gave an extra &euro;900 million to the HSE last year.  Where is it being spent?  I plead with the Taoiseach to do something about this.  It is not fair to these people.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, while there are hundreds of thousands of people on waiting lists, the majority, more than 50%, wait less than six months for treatment or an appointment and approximately one third are seen within three months.  Although that is no good to people who are waiting for prolonged periods of time, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of people wait for less than six months.  Due to the funding that has been provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the additional funding provided to the HSE there was a decrease of 2,000 in the number of people waiting for procedures in August.  I hope that will continue.</p></speech>

The key points include that there was a greater focus on achieving savings than providing safe and effective services, allegations of conspiracy were made and between 2012 and 2014, more than &euro;17 million was handed back.  The report found evidence of destructive conflict and extremely low morale at many levels of the service.  To make matters worse, in its conclusion, it stated that services were characterised by an inward-looking orientation, an inadequate consideration for patients' needs, secrecy and the acceptance of poor standards.  I mention only a few of the damning findings in the report.  I submitted a request to discuss this matter in the Topical Issues debate today.

Unfortunately, we are in week four of the school year and many children are being left behind because they cannot avail of the school transport service.  Some children who are not eligible for the service but have been accepted on a concessionary basis cannot board a school bus.  One case in Waterford involves three brothers aged 12, nine and six years who have travelled on the bus together for years.  This year, the six year old cannot use the bus while his brothers still use it.  The youngest boy is not eligible, whereas the other two boys have concessionary tickets.

The advice I have from the Minister, however, is that every child who is entitled to school transport is receiving a service but it is not possible to provide a concessionary seat to everyone who is not entitled to one but may want one.

I do not expect the Taoiseach to do so now, but were he to look at what is written about transport on page 63, he would see it to be very limited in terms of content.  I am raising this matter because, in South Dublin County Council's area, which is my area, there are plans for a new town of Clonburris, with an estimated 8,000 or 8,500 housing units and a projected future population of more than 20,000 people.  While the local authority is the lead agency in developing the plan, it cannot be done in isolation from the Government as regards infrastructure, particularly traffic infrastructure.  Before the Government signs off on its capital plan, will it publish the documents from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and will it facilitate a debate on the capital plan in the House?</p></speech>

I would certainly welcome a debate in the House on the capital plan priorities and the planning framework before they are published.  It would be appropriate for the House to, at the very least, have statements on such an important issue before decisions are made.  As somebody who also represents a west Dublin constituency, I am very aware of the need to upgrade our public transport infrastructure and to electrify it if possible.  However, these things are expensive.</p></speech>

I was searching through it for his vision for education but it was extremely limited.  Blink and you will miss it.  One thing the Taoiseach did commit to was technological universities and he suggested they would be coming as a matter or urgency.  The Taoiseach will recall that this party offered to facilitate the passage of the legislation before the summer break.  That offer still stands but we have had no contact from the Department of Education and Skills since it was made.  We are wondering what is happening.  We will get the substance of this legislation passed provided we are satisfied with it.  With the Government, it is all style and announcements over substance.  There is no substance to this promise, which was made some time ago.</p></speech>

We also want to get it through.  I am very keen to see universities of technology - or technological universities - becoming a reality.  Amendments are being worked on at present.  They follow on from a number of issues, including an agreement with the Teachers Union of Ireland.  I assure the Deputy that those amendments are both substantive and substantial.  If it was just a matter of style, it would have been done by now.</p></speech>

Is the Taoiseach aware of the unavailability of respite care to parents of children with disabilities right throughout the summer months?  There was a commitment that there would be one weekend in every quarter for respite, yet these parents ended up with four days in the entire year.  There is a crisis in respite care, particularly among parents who are entering their later years and trying to look after children with disabilities.  They are at their wit's end.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the crisis?  What does he intend to do about it?</p></speech>

It is something that comes up in my constituency all the time.  I imagine it comes up in the Deputy's as well.  I am also very aware of the lifeline that respite offers to many families.  The fact they get a break from caring for relatives or loved ones is essential to their own mental health and well-being.  It is something in respect of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is developing proposals, with a view to their being included in the budget.  I anticipate that there will be additional funding for respite next year.  It may not be enough to give everyone the respite they need or deserve but it is certainly something the Government wants to prioritise.</p></speech>

Will the targets for children with scoliosis be met this year?  I am not referring to the children who can be sent to have spinal fusion procedures abroad but to the 68 children with complex medical conditions for whom such a course of action may not be appropriate.  In that regard, will the Taoiseach advise us when the theatre in Crumlin, which he spoke about earlier, will be open five days a week?  It is currently only open three days a week.</p></speech>

It is on the State's balance sheet and funding for it will come directly from the central Government Exchequer.  There is a Bill going through the House at the moment.  We have to ensure, in the wording of the Bill, that group water schemes will be protected.  That is essential as we move forward with this.  We are considering how to achieve that at the moment.  My Department is in discussions with the Office of the Attorney General on what that wording might look like.  The Bill is currently on Second Stage and awaiting Committee Stage.  It is a Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>

In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to better connectivity between urban and rural areas.  I welcome the utterances of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and those of the Taoiseach in recent days on the upgrading of a high-speed train between Dublin and Belfast.  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm that and tell the House what work, plan, costings and capacity are envisaged in that regard.</p></speech>

None of us can doubt the benefits that could accrue from much faster line speeds on the rail line between Dublin and Belfast which of course would also benefit Dundalk, Drogheda and Newry.  The question asked by the Deputy represents exactly the kind of work we now need to do to carry out a proper assessment of how feasible it would be to upgrade that line, what it would cost and how long it would take.  That is what we now intend to do.</p></speech>

The Mental Health Parity Bill 2017 addresses the inequality of mental health treatment by placing mental health and physical health at the centre of all the key decisions by the Department of Health.  Serious issues have been identified in our mental health services and these remain to be resolved.  A Vision for Change, first published in 2006, set out the big picture regarding the then state of our mental health services.  Over a decade since its publication, however, many of its key recommendations remain to be implemented.  It is clear that mental health well-being is not treated the same as physical health well-being by key decision makers in our health system.  The Bill we are putting forward aims to address this problem by introducing a new provision which will compel senior decision makers in the Department of Health to treat mental health on a par with physical health.  The most recent report into A Vision for Change, which was published last July, noted the importance of creating a parity of esteem between mental health and physical well-being.  The Bill we are putting forward will help to achieve this.  It recognises that poor mental health generally leads to a greater risk of poor physical health.  It sets out a pathway for addressing staff shortages and other resourcing issues affecting our mental health services.  It is imperative that all organisations within our health system need parity obligations and this Bill will help bring Ireland into line with international standards on the provision of mental health care.</p></speech>

This is obviously an issue for all schools, but it is particularly the case for the Catholic Church given its transphobic teachings.  For example, last year Pope Francis complained that, "Today in schools they are teaching this to children - to children - that everyone can choose their gender."  He also claimed that increased visibility of trans people is due to "ideological colonising", which he described as terrible.</p>  <p>  The Gender Recognition Act, passed in July 2015 formally recognises trans people in their preferred gender.  That includes provision for 16- and 17-year olds to be legally recognised.  According to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, trans people are protected under the Equal Status Act, which protects students or prospective students from discrimination by educational establishments.  Unfortunately, that is not currently taking place.</p>  <p>  A recent survey by TENI found that only 18% of students felt their gender was respected in terms of the use of gender-segregated facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms.  Only 16% were able to wear uniforms specific to their gender identity.  Only 27% reported their name and pronouns were respected by their school or college.</p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach ask the Catholic bishops to outline the steps being taken to ensure the preferred gender of trans students is respected in Catholic schools?</p></speech>

Okay.  I just think it is bad practice to mix everything because then no one gets answers.  I have made that point.</p>  <p>  I could ask the Taoiseach 100 different things.  I believe such structured dialogue is very good.  In any republic there must be clear separations of state and churches.  It is not appropriate for any faith community to expect that the law of the land tallies with its theological view of the world.  We must also respect people's right to practise their faith and that cuts across all denominations - Roman Catholic and others.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to enlighten us as to the discussion he had with the representatives of the Catholic hierarchy in respect of the eighth amendment.  What did they say to him?  What did he say to them?  Were any requests made of the Taoiseach?  Did they lobby him in any way in respect of the position the Government might reach?  Did they suggest not having a referendum?  In the event of a referendum did they promote a particular approach?  What did the Taoiseach tell them?  Did he tell them it is the Government's view to repeal the eighth amendment to protect women?  What was said?</p>  <p>  Did they give the Taoiseach a date for the Pope's visit?  Does the Pope intend to go North?</p></speech>

Did the Taoiseach raise the question of the redress payments due from the church when he met representatives of the Catholic hierarchy?  The latest figures available to us show that &euro;85 million of &euro;700 million, which was promised by the church to fund the redress board, has been paid.  That is 13% of what was committed to.  These figures come from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Did that come up in the discussion?  What did the Taoiseach say to them?  What was their response?</p>  <p>  There is considerable concern about the convergence of a number of events - the World Meeting of Families which is to take place here in Ireland, the Pope's visit which will obviously be very high profile and the referendum on the eighth amendment.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to figure that there may be a connection between these three things and it might be wise to separate out the referendum on the eighth amendment from the other two.  It might be only fair and just to separate these out in order that a clear, unambiguous and balanced debate can take place.  I reiterate the question that was already asked.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the discussion on the timing of these visits and the referendum on this amendment?</p></speech>

Church leaders have made public statements supporting this policy for schools in particular, but also apparently an agreement is in progress relating to the National Maternity Hospital moving to Elm Park.  Divestment is very slow in practice.</p>  <p>  Money was committed in respect of redress in the infamous deal with the then Minister, Dr. Michael Woods, and the then Taoiseach.  Over the summer, it was reported that the Christian Brothers had sold a small number of acres at Clonkeen College in Deansgrange for upwards of &euro;18 million.  Where stands redress in terms of amounts still owing and amounts committed to be paid at this point in time?</p>  <p>  I would like to hear the discussions that took place on the eighth amendment.  Obviously the Catholic Church is a significant institution in Ireland.  I have attended a number of these meetings, which serve a very good purpose.</p></speech>

The media reported that one of the topics in the dialogue with the church hierarchy was the World Meeting of Families to be held in Ireland next August.</p><p>While it is organised by the Dublin diocese, it will involve events throughout the country and thousands of people in its organisation.  Many thousands more will apparently visit Ireland during that particular week.  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government reaffirmed its commitment to assist the organisers to make the event as successful as possible?  Could he also confirm whether that is the occasion when Pope Francis will visit Ireland and attend the event?</p> <p> Separately, it was reported that the Taoiseach discussed the issue of referendums at the meeting.  As was confirmed yet again this morning, the Government has developed a habit of briefing journalists about referenda it intends to hold and when it intends holding them.  To avoid any doubt, will the Taoiseach confirm that he understands the Government cannot call any referendum as doing so is a power which rests in the hands of the Oireachtas.  Every Deputy and every party holds exactly the same right as the Government to propose the holding of a referendum.  This is nothing new.  I recall the Taoiseach's predecessor saying that there would be a referendum day about two years ago, so every now and again the reference to a multiplicity of referendums gets aired.  Could the Taoiseach indicate why he did not consult first with parties in the Oireachtas as to the optimal approach to the holding of referendums and also the prioritisation of the various referendums that are being proposed?</p></speech>

Could the Taoiseach report on the conversation he had with the Catholic Church in this instance in respect of the changes - announced four days ago - Education and Training Boards Ireland proposes to make regarding faith formation within the 12 community primary schools?  I am interested to learn whether the issue was the subject of conversation with Archbishop Eamon Martin and the other attendees at the meeting in question.</p></speech>

The rights of transgender citizens did not come up as a specific issue.  While it did not arise, it may of course be possible to discuss it at a future meeting or bilaterally at meetings that will occur between the Minister for Education and Skills and the Catholic Church.</p>  <p>  The issue of patronage and divestment was discussed.  The Government expressed the view that it would like to see more divestment occurring but that our principal interest involves taking into the account the views of parents and that the most important thing is that divestment should only occur where the parents and prospective parents of children attending those schools want it to occur.</p>  <p>  In the context of the eighth amendment, the Catholic Church gave its view and its view is very clear - I respect its view, which is that the eighth amendment has saved lives, that this is a matter of human rights and that it will oppose any attempt to remove the provision from the Constitution.  That is the church's stated view.  As a Government, we said that we respect that this is its view and that we understand this to be the case.  We also indicated that it is our intention to proceed on the basis of the Constitutional Convention's recommendation that there should be a referendum on the matter and that we will be guided by the outcome of the all-party committee as to what should be wording of the question.</p>  <p>  On the Pope's visit, the date for the World Meeting of Families is 21 to 26 August 2018.  We do not yet know the specific date or dates on which the Holy Father will be in the country and no decision has been made on whether he will travel to the North.  However, I did express my wish that he would consider doing so.  Unfortunately, when he visited Ireland, Pope John Paul II was not able to travel to the North and made his plea for peace from Dublin.  I certainly would like to see that happen.  We indicated to the church authorities that the State will do its best to facilitate any programme that he wants to engage in - in any part of Ireland - and that it will put at his disposal the necessary support from the security forces and other groups that might be able to assist in accommodating his visit.</p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is absolutely correct; the holding of referendums is not a decision for Government, it is one for the Oireachtas.  It is only the Oireachtas that can make a decision to hold a referendum.  What the Government did today was put out a timeline to work towards.  People know that some of these referendums are in the pipeline for years and the Government thought it appropriate to set out a timeline that we can work towards because it is not just a case of having a referendum.  One has to work back from a referendum.  First, there needs to be a wording, the legislation, which must go through the D&aacute;il and Seanad, has to be brought forward and a referendum commission must be established.  There is a minimum period during which a referendum commission can be established and there is also a need to provide a period of at least three or four weeks for a campaign.  It takes time to have referendums.  Assuming that the all-party committee is able to report by 20 December - I am confident it can do so - the earliest possible time at which a referendum could be held would be May or June 2018 as a result of the need to have legislation passed by the two Houses, to facilitate the establishment of the referendum commission and to hold a campaign.  I did not quite understand what Deputies said but if they are suggesting a different date I would be curious to know what that is.  Obviously, the referendum could not be held earlier than May or June 2018.  If, therefore, people are suggesting a later date, I would certainly be interested to find out if that is the case and to understand why.</p>  <p>  Redress was one of the topics discussed.  The view expressed by the Government is that we would like to see the matter concluded.  We would like to see a financial settlement that would involve the payment of many millions of euro to the taxpayer to help us cover the cost of compensation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked about a referendum day.  We decided not to do that.  It had been proposed in the past to have six, seven or eight referendums on the one day but the Government has formed the opinion that having so many questions on the one day could cause confusion.  We decided that the referendum relating to what is probably the most sensitive and controversial issue - namely, the eighth amendment - should be held on a stand-alone basis but that the others, which, perhaps, relate to matters that are a little less controversial, could be held in batches of two or three.  The latter has been done previously.</p>  <p>  In terms of international issues, it is important to point out that this was a dialogue with the Catholic Church, not the hierarchy, so other people were present as well.  It was not just bishops.  Among those present were representatives from Tr&oacute;caire, an agency which, as Members know, does phenomenal work in terms of international development around the world and which receives substantial funding.  Needless to say, part of the discussion was a request that we increase the budget for Catholic organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire and that for overseas development aid in the years to come.</p>  <p>  The issue of Education and Training Boards Ireland and community national schools did not arise specifically and the issue that arose in recent days was not on the agenda at the time.</p>  <p>  I found the meeting to be very useful.  It went on for approximately two hours.  It was a very good engagement, with lots of areas of agreement and disagreement.  I agree with Members that such a dialogue is appropriate.  There will be another meeting but next on the list is a dialogue with the Church of Ireland and the other Protestant denominations.  We are trying to schedule a time for that now.</p></speech>

It was a short congratulatory call, similar to a number of calls I received from Heads of State and Government when I took office.  During our brief conversation, we discussed a number of matters including our support for the resumption of talks on an EU-India free trade agreement and co-operation on increasing partnerships between higher education institutions in Ireland and India.</p><p>We spoke about the strong bilateral relationship between our two countries and agreed on the further potential to further strengthen trade and investment links between them.

Has he extended an invitation to the Prime Minister of India?  I am conscious that India is a country of 1.3 billion people, the largest democracy in the world.  Would the Taoiseach agree that we should expand our relationships there?</p>  <p>  Not long after his appointment, the Taoiseach spoke about a desire to grow the Irish diplomatic presence abroad.  Currently we have an embassy in India as well as four honorary consulates.  In countries with which we have strong relationships, normally at least some of these honorary consulates are transformed into full consulates with full diplomatic representation.  Given the size of India, which is a subcontinent, would the Taoiseach agree that we should seek to expand?</p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss human rights issues as they arise in the context of both India and Ireland?  Such a discussion might include the potential impact of Brexit on immigration from the Indian subcontinent to the UK which, obviously, at this point in time, still includes Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Our two countries have a long tradition of friendship and engagement that goes back for generations, as we know, including during the efforts of India to secure its independence from Britain.  We have much in common.</p>  <p>  What was the substance of the Taoiseach's exchange with Prime Minister Modi in respect of Brexit?  Bilateral trade between India and Ireland touched around $1.2 billion from 2014 to 2015.  While that is considerable, there is massive scope for development.  Currently, our major items of export to India include telecommunications equipment, computer accessories, precision equipment and pharmaceuticals.  Could the Taoiseach give us a flavour of the conversation he had on a sectoral basis, if these issues were discussed?</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach have plans to visit India?  Did he extend an invitation to Prime Minister Modi to return to our shores?  I understand he last visited here in September 2015.</p></speech>

There were very strong links between the former Taoiseach and President, &Eacute;amon de Valera, and Indian politics of the time.  Those links were renewed in recent years, particularly in the area of science policy.  The initial Ireland-India research programme offered considerable opportunities for Irish and Indian researchers to exchange information and pursue opportunities in both countries.  What is the current status of that research programme and what are the Taoiseach's plans for it?</p>  <p>  In respect of Brexit opportunities in India, what extra resources will specifically go to Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland to pursue opportunities within the Indian market?</p></speech>

I certainly did invite him to visit Ireland again and would very much like him to do so.  However, I appreciate that having only visited last year, it might be some time before an Indian Prime Minister is able to visit again.  He did invite me to India and asked that I bring my family with me.  I would certainly like to visit India in the future but no arrangements have been made as yet.  There are, of course, a number of other places that I need to visit, particularly with so many European issues on the agenda.  I have plans to visit a number of European countries over the next couple of months, if I can.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Burton, I agree that we should expand our consulates around the world and expand our diplomatic footprint.  The Deputy mentioned that we have an embassy in Delhi but only honorary consulates in a number of other cities.  One city that springs to mind, in which we could perhaps in future have a consulate, is Mumbai, one of the largest cities in the world and very much India's economic capital.  I imagine it is the kind of place where an Ireland House operation involving IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and a consulate would be very appropriate.</p>  <p>  I have asked a number of Ministers to work together to develop a plan to double our global footprint over the next seven to eight years.  That is not necessarily a doubling of offices, staff or budgets but it is a matter of looking at the entire suite of Irish diplomatic representation - our embassies and consulates, Bord Bia, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and Tourism Ireland - and also our cultural presence around the world, and thinking strategically as to how we can increase that over the next seven or eight years.  This is in part a response to Brexit but even if there was no Brexit it is the kind of thing we should be doing anyway.  We are a small country and we need boots and suits on the ground.  Compared to other countries like Denmark and New Zealand, we are somewhat behind.  If we really do want to be an island at the centre of the world, we are going to need more people out and about around the world representing us.  However, these things should not be done overnight.  They should be done in a planned way and scaled up to make sure we have the right people with good competence doing exactly those things.</p>  <p>  In respect of the other matters, this was a very short, congratulatory call which probably did not go on for more than eight or nine minutes.  While the issues mentioned by Deputies are of course very important, it was not possible to discuss them all in the time we had.</p></speech>

While acknowledging the profound challenges facing the area and its people, the report highlighted a number of significant assets in the area such as its strong community spirit, its proud history, dedicated local projects, and its prime location beside a growing business community.  Building on these positives, the report set out a range of actions to tackle the priority areas of crime and drugs, education, training and employment opportunities, services for families and young people and physical improvements. </p>  <p>  As recommended in the report, a number of new structures have been put in place to drive forward progress on the actions.  These include the programme implementation board comprising statutory, community and business sectors, led by an independent chairperson, Mr. Michael Stone.  The board is being supported in its work by a local programme office which has been established by Dublin City Council in Sean McDermott Street.  The board is responsible for the development and delivery of a detailed implementation plan and oversight of funding. </p>  <p>  The chair of the board is reporting on a regular basis to the oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  This is to ensure continued strong engagement across all Government Departments and agencies and to deal with any structural barriers and issues highlighted by the board.  I will continue to ensure that ministerial oversight and support of this initiative is provided through the Cabinet committee system. </p>  <p>  The programme implementation board has quickly established four sub-groups, which have strong community involvement.  These will help to develop more detailed measures where required to address the actions and recommend steps to overcome particular barriers or gaps in service provision.  While this work is ongoing, the board has agreed a number of proposals across the four priority headings for implementation in 2017 at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  This is in addition to the range of local measures already implemented in 2016, which will cost about &euro;5 million.</p></reply>

I have met with Mr. Stone and have formed the view that he is very much in the business of getting things done, which he will have to be.</p><p>Notwithstanding the work done by Kieran Mulvey, which I also acknowledge, the report essentially amounts to a listing of a number of initiatives that were already in place and a restatement of moneys that were already promised.  While it has some nuggets of truth and there are some interesting parts interlaced in it, I would be misleading the House if I said we are anything other than disappointed and underwhelmed by what has been produced.  Given the scale of what needs to be done here, and in light of the depth of the change and radical innovation that is required, tinkering on the edges will not get us very far.  I would always be the first to welcome and argue in favour of the provision of small amounts of additional money for local projects, many of which are crying out for funding and resources.  The idea that throwing a few bob here and there will sort things or fundamentally change things in this community is just wrong.  The community is well aware of that.  The collaborative and cross-political party work that has been done by the North Inner City Community Coalition forms the basis of the type of analysis, blueprint and vision that is required to move things along.</p> <p> I would like to highlight something that the Taoiseach mentioned in his reply.  I have spoken to Michael Stone about this.  It is an example of how the old thinking still dominates.  It is a mistake to bunch crime and drugs together.  I do not suggest that there is no relationship between drugs and crime, because it is clear that there is such a relationship.  Those who seek to pretend that a criminal justice response will sort out the ravages of drugs in this and other communities - something which is just not true - are missing the essential social dynamic around drug abuse, misuse and addiction.  I thought we had reached a position of political understanding and consensus that this approach is wrong-headed.  There is no doubt that crime issues have to be tackled and that there is a relationship between crime and drugs.  If we are to be radical and real, and if we are to make a serious attempt to get under the bonnet of the north inner city and other communities, our approach must involve looking at drug addiction issues like the relationship between drug dependency and poverty and the absolutely appalling housing conditions in the north inner city.  There are people living in flat complexes in the inner city of Dublin that are really not fit for human occupation.  This is 2017.  People cannot get access to decent work, no matter how hard they try.  If we are serious about changing things, we have to take a radical approach in these areas.  We have not seen such an approach so far.  What is the Taoiseach's personal commitment to this?  He has spoken about officials and Cabinet oversight.  A commitment was given that the Taoiseach of the day would personally oversee this work.  Does that commitment remain?</p></speech>

This area is crying out for action and real activity, rather than spin, statements and ministerial visits.  While Michael Stone has the potential to make a real difference, he will be unable to do so unless he is given an appropriate and dedicated budget that is not coming from other areas of Dublin city or other urban communities across the country.  I would like to follow up on Deputy McDonald's question.  Who is the lead Minister?  Is the Office of the Taoiseach still the lead office in implementing this?  If the Taoiseach is no longer the lead Minister, what metrics has he set to see where this is going?  Who will report back to him?  Will a specific allocation for the north-east inner city be made in the forthcoming capital plan and in next month's budget?</p></speech>

There has been a total lack of apprenticeships for young men and women in the north inner city, particularly since the collapse in construction in 2008.  The apprenticeships offered by famous educational institutions in the north inner city have always represented an important educational transit point in that area, especially for those moving onto further education.  I refer, for example, to DIT Bolton Street, which has a whole school of apprenticeship.  If the Taoiseach is chairing this committee, I strongly recommend that he should go to the Linenhall building in Bolton Street to look at what can be done successfully for young people who want to do apprenticeships rather than staying in school.  Many such people choose not to stay in school because it has been a negative experience or because their family circumstances do not provide for it.  Some of the most qualified engineers in our society came from places like the school of trades in Bolton Street and its counterpart on Kevin Street on the south side.  In addition to inventing new solutions, we need to use some of the existing resources we have.  When I spoke to some of the staff members two weeks ago, they told me they can hardly talk to anybody in government.</p>  <p>  I would like to make another point about these plans.  Large parts of the north inner city are filthy.  I listened with great joy to yesterday's announcement that various towns, villages and suburbs in different parts of Dublin had won prizes in the Tidy Towns competition.  If we are to reinvigorate the north inner city and give concrete opportunities to those who live there, Dublin City Council must respect the places where people are living by helping to clean them up.  We have to address the casual dumping of litter, which is one of the most debilitating things for the self-image of a community.  Deputy McDonald spoke about how old some of the blocks of flats are.  People like living in the north inner city.  As Deputy Calleary said, the people there are very friendly and very positive.  The local authorities are not sufficiently respecting the people who live in the north inner city by improving their environment to the point where those who have pride in their homes can have pride in the overall city centre as well.  Many of those who are paying property tax ask me all the time what they are getting for it and why they are not getting clean streets.</p></speech>

There will be an increase in the level of local garda&iacute; in the community.  A new policing plan will be drawn up.  A single platform will be introduced to streamline education, training and employment activation efforts.  A skills need assessment will inform the training requirements and job and apprenticeship opportunities in the area.  A specialist hub will be developed for highly vulnerable families.  A new model of in-school speech and language therapy will be piloted.  A single youth leadership development programme will be provided.  There will be a comprehensive physical refurbishment plan for the area.  Some very significant things are under way.  There will be some community consultative events, with the first meeting to be held on 19 October.  As I have mentioned, Michael Stone has been appointed as the independent chair of the local programme implementation board, which has already met on three occasions, on 28 June, 2 August and 30 August.  It is scheduled to meet again this week.  As I have said, a community consultative event will be held in October.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald is right when she says that bunching crime and drugs together is wrong-headed.  Addiction, as opposed to recreational drug use, is very much a social issue.  I would rather see it addressed as a health issue than as a criminal justice issue.  Like a number of people in this Chamber, I know the north inner city very well not because of my happy visits there in recent weeks, but because of my regular visits there all the time.  I know because I am there all the time that it is an area where many good things are happening.  I am disappointed that nobody mentioned any of them, so I might mention a few now.  The student accommodation that is coming on stream across the north inner city is a very positive thing.</p></speech>

The Minister published a glossy document at the beginning of September relating to the review of the current plan.  Can he give assurances that this is not more of the Government spin, which has been the hallmark of its first 100 days in office, that there will be substance to this capital plan and that it will make a difference to communities across the country, including those about which we have just spoken?  How does he intend to align it with the national planning framework the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is preparing?</p></reply>

Copies of the documentation and the capital tracker can be found on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>The review of the plan highlights some key themes, which will closely inform and be incorporated into the analysis, which will then lead to the finalisation of the new ten-year national investment plan.  These themes include confirmation of the central role of public capital in underpinning the long-term growth of our economy and society; the need to align public capital investment priorities to a changing society and changing demographics; the critical importance of public capital infrastructure to deliver balanced development across our country; the need to respond to Brexit; the central importance of making sure that money is spent well; and that a solid business case is in place for important public spending.</p><p>Based on this analysis, the review of the plan has identified a number of sectors such as priorities for investment, including transport, education and housing.  The findings of this review will assist Government in selecting priorities for the allocation of &euro;4.1 billion up to the period to 2021.  Consequently, between 2014 and 2021, public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.  The Government will make final decisions on the allocation of this funding in the context of the 2018 Estimates.</p></reply>

How will it align with the work the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing on the national planning framework?  The document the Minister published, the review of the capital plan, highlights broadband as an area for prioritisation.  He may have heard in the last hour or so that SIRO has pulled out of the national broadband tendering process.  Does that suggest to him that a company made up of Vodafone and ESB has no confidence in a process?  What action will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform take to ensure the effectiveness of the national broadband process in light of that?  What action will the Minister take to ensure that all the provisions of the capital plan are implemented in a manner that is effective and efficient and without causing capacity issues for the economy?</p></speech>

Regarding his second point on broadband, the role of my Department has been purely confined to making sure there is enough of a capital allocation to support the tendering process.  Any decisions regarding who is tendering for it and the implementation of that process is for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten.  I will leave it to him to comment on the information the Deputy shared with the House.</p>  <p>  In terms of making sure the capital plan will then be implemented, the reason we are now publishing the capital tracker I referred to earlier is to ensure that in regard to specific projects that have been committed to in the public plan, the public and the Oireachtas can see where they stand in terms of implementation.  We can see the fruits of that in terms of the last plan that is in its final phase of implementation such as the Gort to Tuam road, Luas cross city, progress on the national children's hospital and, for example, the recent progress that has been made in delivering another 14 primary care centres through use of public private partnerships, PPPs.</p></speech>

If the Minister leaves it to each line Minister, who is in charge of making sure he or she does his or her job?  Is it not the Minister's job to make sure that they spend the money and spend it properly?</p>  <p>  Second, the Minister mentioned PPPs.  Does he envisage a role for PPPs and will that role perhaps involve an expansion of the money within the capital plan?</p></speech>

In regard to the policy area for the roll-out of the broadband process, all issues and decisions relating to tendering are a matter for the Minister, Deputy Naughten, although I support and work with him in any way he requires and that I can.</p>  <p>  Regarding public private partnerships, the review we have under way of capital expenditure that will culminate in the ten-year capital plan will include an assessment of the use we may make of public private partnerships in the future.  All of that must be set against the fact that when we used public private partnerships in the past, we did them at a point at which the country was not able to borrow.  Now that we are able to borrow, we have to look at the use of those funding schemes in a new light, which I am currently doing.</p></speech>

It relates to the capital plan.  As opposed to the review in the sectors under most pressure and where capital will be allocated, is the Minister of the view that he will increase the overall envelope in terms of capital more than what has already been outlined in the review using the resources that are available in this year's budget, particularly in view of the fact that capital can be smoothed over a four-year period?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600023#V00100"><p>I will not read out to Deputy Doherty the answer I have just shared with Deputy Calleary.  I will just answer the specific question the former has put to me.  I have already identified that we will seek to make a further &euro;500 million available in 2019, 2020 and 2021 as part of the summer economic statement.  This will take the additional amount of new capital we will be allocating across that period to more than &euro;4 billion.  The total amount of capital funding that will be available between 2018 and 2021 will be approximately &euro;26.8 billion.  At the end of this programme we will be increasing gross voted capital by nearly 85% more than where we stood in 2016.  For those reasons I am not currently planning to increase the level of additional public capital expenditure that will go into those figures because I believe a near doubling of the level of public capital expenditure across those years is a very strong increase and because my judgment is that if we were to look to increase it further beyond that pace, we could get into difficulties regarding value for money and making sure we have the right amount of capacity in the economy to translate those levels of expenditure into the schools, roads, bridges and primary care centres we want to make happen.  For these reasons, I am not at present planning a further change in that capital expenditure figure beyond that which I decided in the summer economic statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600023#V00200"><p>I recognise that there is to be an increased level of capital expenditure over the next number of years.  This will represent an increase from the lowest level in Europe, which is the baseline from which we are working.  When one is at the lowest level in Europe, it is easier to get 60% or 70% increases because one is starting from a very low base.  Nonetheless, there is an increase and it will ramp up as we get closer to 2020-21.  The problem is that we have at this point in time serious crises, as everyone in this Chamber knows, which require capital investment.  For individuals who are either on housing waiting lists or in emergency accommodation, 2020 or 2021 does not mean much to them; they need investment now.  I would argue - and I make this point to the Minister in advance of the budget - that smoothing rules are available.  For example, for every euro the Government cuts in taxes, it could increase capital investment this year by &euro;4.  For every &euro;200 million the Government gives in tax cuts, it could invest &euro;800 million in capital that would be smoothed out over a four-year period in respect of housing.  We are in the middle of an almighty crisis.  As legislators, we do not have the luxury of saying we will reach the mid-term or the higher end of capital investment in four or five years' time after coming through a decade of drought, of underinvestment in capital that was a result of Government decisions and budgetary decisions.  We can argue why those decisions, taken by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, were taken and for what effect, but they resulted in the crises we now have.  We must take decisions now and then, and I acknowledge that we are increasing investment in public housing, but it is not enough.  It does not meet the scale of the crisis we have out there.</p></speech>

I am crystal clear that behind technical phrases such as "public capital expenditure" and "where we are as a percentage of national income" is the reality that we have families who need homes and investment that needs to be made in many parts of our country.  That is the reason we are making the increase in capital expenditure the Deputy has acknowledged.  He can make the case that we should increase it more, as indeed he is doing, and it is obviously a legitimate case to make.  My view is that we can reach a point at which we can deliver more things more quickly if those parts of the economy upon which we depend to build homes - and we will begin to build even more homes ourselves directly, as the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has acknowledged - have confidence that the levels of expenditure I am outlining can be consistently held for a number of years.  That will give companies, local authorities and banks, as well as other sources of investment, confidence that in the future money will be available for which they can plan.  That is what we are looking to do.  As for the approaching budget, while I still have a lot of work to do dealing with spending Departments regarding deciding what the budget will look like, I expect that the percentage increase in capital expenditure that will be seen at the end of this budget will be significantly ahead of the increase in current expenditure.  The reason for that will be the desire to respond next year to the many difficulties I know people have.</p></speech>

There was a massive withdrawal of investment here.  That is why we have a housing crisis, why our roads are now under pressure, why our rail is under pressure, why we do not have adequate broadband, why our flood defences in our communities are flooding and people are being put out of their houses and so on.  Next year the Government intends to spend &euro;70 million on flood defences.  By 2021 the figure will be &euro;100 million.  It is completely inadequate.  I know the Minister must balance all the needs in the budget.  He has heard my articulation of the argument.  I do not believe there is a need for the type of net tax cuts he proposes but I genuinely believe, as politicians, we have a responsibility - not a responsibility to chase votes but to act in the best interests of our citizens.  We know about, we will all talk about and we will all sympathise with the fact that there are 3,000 children going to bed tonight in emergency accommodation.  We have within our gift to ramp up delivery of social housing by using the resources this State has made available to us as politicians to decide where they should go.  The European Union's rules have allowed that for every tax cut, every euro that is cut in tax, the Government can spend four times that much this year on social housing.  I plead to the Minister and beg him to consider, even at this late stage, increasing capital investment out of the fiscal space available in this year.</p></speech>

What always motivates me, as I am sure is the case with the Deputy, is what the long-term best thing is for our country.  The only reason I put the kind of focus I do on economic indicators such as where we are with bond yields, interest rates and so on is to give our country the chance to try to create the resources to deal with the kind of difficulty I know our citizens face because I represent them, just as does the Deputy Doherty.  While he is correct to make the point that capital expenditure decreased for many years, I will make two points.  First, when &euro;10 billion was being spent in the past, it was buying things of poor value to our country.  We should and must move away from asking how we can match a level of expenditure that, even at that time, many in the Oireachtas felt was not delivering good value for the citizen.  What we must do is look at how we can get best value for the taxpayer while increasing expenditure.</p>  <p>  Regarding housing and all the progress we need to make there - and I know we need to make progress - of course, what the Deputy's point did not acknowledge is that 80 citizens per day are now being given solutions to their housing difficulty, whether that be through use of payments available through our social welfare system or new homes being offered to people.  This is happening as a result of decisions that were made in recent years too.  While we have much more difficulty we need to deal with, if it were not for the change in our economic circumstances I would not even have the ability to allocate this additional funding.</p></speech>

Met &Eacute;ireann figures show it was a wetter than average summer.  There were the extraordinary events in Donegal, the debate on which Deputy McConalogue will be leading later, and I know the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, visited Donegal as well.  What plans has the Minister in place to deal with the potential flooding that may arise this winter, particularly given we are going into a winter with river levels much higher than they were this time last year?</p></reply>

I wish to acknowledge the staff of all those organisations who were on the ground dealing with the aftermath of the recent flooding in Donegal.  I saw for myself the devastation that the communities experienced and commend them on their resilience and spirit.  My sincere sympathy goes out to all those affected by the flooding, many of whom I met personally while in Donegal.</p>  <p>  Regarding the wider issue of flood risk management, the Government has approved the interim report of the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, which outlined the range of measures that are addressing Ireland's flood risk for this winter.  The Government has invested &euro;285 million in major flood defence schemes since 1995, which is providing protection to approximately 8,000 properties, with an estimated benefit to the country of damage avoided of more than &euro;1 billion.</p><p>A further investment of &euro;33 million in minor works since 2009 is protecting 6,000 properties across the country.  Since the flooding of 2015, the Government has delivered a number of additional measures that are helping to manage flood risk for this winter.  Significant investment in major and minor flood relief works is continuing, with expenditure of &euro;69 million since the beginning of 2016 and with ten major schemes currently under construction and seven more expected to start in the next 12 months.  A further 25 major schemes are at design and planning stage.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group is trialling the lowering of levels in Lough Allen to complement existing water level protocols in place for Lough Ree.  The OPW and Mayo County Council are progressing an individual property protection pilot project in Crossmolina.  This initiative will provide protection for up to 76 properties and, together with another pilot scheme in Kilkenny, will inform any future assistance by Government to homeowners for individual home flood mitigation.</p> <p> The OPW&rsquo;s proactive flood risk planning through the CFRAM programme in recent years is nearing completion.  By the end of this year I would hope to publish the final flood risk management plans developed under the CFRAM process and to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those plans that will, over the coming years, be taken to detailed design stage in order to protect at-risk communities and properties.</p></speech>

However, he could have given me that answer in June or July.  I want to know what specific new initiatives he has taken to deal with the rainfall levels this summer and their potential impact on the flooding in those communities later this year.  We had the extraordinary event in Donegal but that is now becoming less extraordinary and more the norm.  While the response was eventually very comprehensive, it took some time to organise.  Will the Minister give a guarantee to communities across the country that, in the event of there being a flooding emergency in their community this winter, the response will be immediate and there will not be delays?</p>  <p>  The OPW has spoken of "one in 100-year" flooding events.  Given what happened in Donegal and what happened in 2015 and 2016, are there plans to change how the impact of flooding events is measured?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned Crossmolina.  The scheme there is very welcome and I commend the OPW for using it.  However, we do not want to see it used.  Will the Minister of State give me an update on the long-term plan for Crossmolina?</p></speech>

I visited Donegal and saw first-hand what those people experienced and had to deal with.  However, the question the Deputy asked is whether we are dealing with it, and the answer is that, yes, we are.  Since 24 August we did not have one dry day up to the past two fine days.  Within the system we have, it is very hard to manage the rainfall but, where we can, we are providing money for flood defences and minor works schemes for those communities.  We are working particularly closely with the local authorities.  We have not been found wanting.  On Saturday last I visited the Deputy's area to attend a funeral and saw first-hand what is happening there.  From dealing with the local authorities and talking to the engineers on the ground, I can assure the Deputy that everything that can be done is being done at this time.  Yes, I would like to see a ramp-up of flood defences but, given what I have to spend, I want to spend wisely up to 2021.  Other measures will come through CFRAM, hopefully by the end of this year, and we will be able to ensure the protection of the homes to which the Deputy referred.</p>  <p>  With regard to Crossmolina, a meeting was held in my office last week and I will have a report on that in the not-too-distant future.  Hopefully, it will be a positive one from the Deputy's point of view.</p></speech>

It is the end of September and the level of the River Moy is what it should be at the end of November.  While I do not need a response on that, it gives an indication of the potential challenges this year.  The Minister of State has to ensure that a response is ready to go on the ground in the event of a repeat of what happened in 2015 or in Donegal earlier this year.  I hope it does not happen.  I hope we do not have to use any of those responses but, if we do, let us not come with the poor mouth or come crying afterwards.  We can take action now.</p></speech>

In recent times, however, we have seen downpours happening and nobody, not even anybody in government, could plan for what may come.  However, what we can do is give assurances.  We are working with local authorities and delivering for local communities.  Through CFRAM and further measures that will be taken, we will deliver on schemes and protect those people.  The local authority delivered a very fast response in Donegal and the criticism of its response was unfair.  I met the first responders on the Tuesday and went with them to everywhere that was flooded.  I assure the Deputy that everything that can be done is being done with the local authorities.</p></speech>

The manner in which the public services card has been rolled out has caused a fair deal of concern and there is significant public apprehension and a lack of trust in regard to the use of the card.  I want to know what steps the Minister is taking to address that public concern and whether he intends to introduce further legislation aimed at addressing those concerns and restoring public faith in the public services card.</p></reply>

The underpinning registration process, which is called SAFE 2, involves a 15-minute visit to an INTREO office and is done just once.  This process is used to establish a person's identity to a substantial level of assurance.  This identity assurance level is the highest that is available to the public service.  After going through SAFE 2 registration, the person gets a card and a MyGovID account.  The card can be used for quick and safe access to services in the physical world, whereas MyGovID gives quick and safe access to public services in the online world.</p>  <p>  Going through this registration process gives a number of benefits to the individual.  It can protect a person from identity theft, reduce the potential for someone else to fraudulently access information, save time and effort in providing documentation that has been already provided to verify identity and allow a person to access more public services online.  It also brings us into line with the increasing needs of the digital single market.</p>  <p>  On the question of legality, provision for the information collected during SAFE 2 registration, how that information can be used and the production and use of the card is set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, specifically in section 263.  The process, the data and the card have been discussed as part of the legislative process in the Oireachtas over multiple Bill amendments.  Since the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, successive Governments have discussed and progressed this initiative.  The card has been promoted in successive public service reform plans.  The matter has been subjected to a Comptroller and Auditor General study, published in the annual report of that body and examined by the PAC.  It has gone through an exhaustive process of verification and debate to date, as it should.  I have no plans at this stage to bring in further legislation in regard to the card because of the legislative foundation I have described.</p></speech>

I think it important to point out that my query is not about the merits of expanding the system.  I understand there are very many reasons to introduce a card like the public services card and I readily acknowledge the benefits of wider e-governance.  However, these systems require a level of public trust in order for them to function properly.  At present I think a growing number of people simply do not believe their data are safe and are not sure how their data are going to be used.  That is the issue.  I am not questioning the card itself.  I am questioning the lack of public confidence and trust in the system to maintain people's data safely and to ensure there are proper penalties in place.</p>  <p>  As the Minister said, the public services card was introduced in legislation over a long number of years.</p><p>I believe that it can be traced back some 20 years when it was first discussed and early arrangements were made.  Its function has steadily expanded since then.  As a result of it going on for so long, many people were simply unaware of it until they were told they needed to have one of the cards to apply, for example, for a driver theory test.  The vast majority of the public did not realise that was the case and that in the coming months the public service card was to be required in order to renew a passport, where their identity has already been safely established through holding an initial passport.</p> <p> For the eGovernment strategy to succeed, the public needs to know exactly what their data is being used for, who can access it and what are the penalties for those who abuse that access.  That has not been spelled out.</p></speech>

On the specific questions the Deputy has asked around the use of data, any sharing of data between public bodies has to be consistent with the guidance from the Data Protection Commissioner.  The commissioner has raised a number of matters on the operation of the card and I believe that the answer back to the matters raised by the commissioner will be published shortly, if they have not already been published.  This will be done in public and will deal with any of the matters the commissioner has raised.</p>  <p>  With regard to how we can further buttress the sharing of information and how to make sure the sharing of information is done in a way that meets best standards, this is where the data sharing and governance Bill makes a very important contribution.  The Bill is currently at pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  This legislation looks to make very clear the different kinds of datasets that can be held in organisations and how those datasets can be shared with other organisations in a way that is further supported by law.  I hope that the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas might deal with some of the issues referred to by Deputy Shortall and some of the concerns people have.  The public services card is now held by 2.3 million individuals across the State.  I believe that many of these people understand that at the very least it will allow citizens to get to a point where they only have to share information once to allow them to access multiple services, which will be a big step forward.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner has raised serious concerns.  The commissioner has been waiting some time for responses to those concerns and she has insisted that those responses would be published.  The public has still not seen those responses.  If the system is secure and if it is properly based, why is there such a delay in providing those responses?</p>  <p>  The Minister also raised the data sharing and governance Bill.  The Minister seems to be implying that there was a requirement for the data sharing Bill to be passed and brought into law in order to provide the assurances to people that their data are safe.  Is the Government putting the cart before the horse?</p>  <p>  Apart from the Minister giving sympathy and assurances to people today, he has not been very specific about what exactly are those safeguards and the penalties in place in the event that officials abuse the rules around access of the data, as we have seen before from some officials in government Departments.</p></speech>

I said that very clearly.</p>  <p>  The data sharing and governance Bill is legislation that has been before the Oireachtas for some time.  It recognises there is potential for greater data sharing in the future and, recognising that potential and European Union law in that area, is looking to address issues regarding potential uses that could happen in the future.  This is why the Bill is before the Oireachtas now and I hope the Houses will consider it positively.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issues raised by the Data Protection Commissioner that are being considered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department, we will respond and make our response to all the issues raised fully and publicly available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about penalties.  I do not have available to me what exactly are the penalties.  I will write to the Deputy with that information.  It would be a gravely serious matter, and has been a serious matter, if any public servant uses the information on a public services card for any purpose other than that for which it is intended.  I will make available to the Deputy the information on sanctions but I assure her that they are very serious and proportionate.</p></speech>

Before I move on to Other Questions, I remind Members that there is six and a half minutes in total for each question: 30 seconds for the question to be introduced, the Minister has two minutes to reply, and the Deputy then has one minute to respond.  The Minister can come back with one minute and the Deputy has one last minute, and then the Minister has the final say.  I ask that Members stick to the six and a half minutes because I do not like interrupting people.  The reality is that when a Member goes over their time, another Member who is waiting to get their question answered does not get the time.  Please bear that in mind.</p></speech>

The current minimum wage is set at &euro;9.25 and the third report of the Low Pay Commission recommended that this be increased by 30 cent per hour.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomed that recommendation.   We acknowledge that it is a modest increase but one that is ahead of the rate of inflation and average increases in earnings.  This would be the fourth increase in the minimum wage since 2011, and the second under this Government.  I will consider the consequences of this change in the context of budget 2018.</p>  <p>  In terms of the public service as employer, it should be noted that the recent Public Service Pay Commission report found that lower paid public servants receive a pay premium of 15% compared to their equivalent private sector colleagues.  Based on data available to my Department, more than 94% of public service employees are on salary points in excess of &euro;25,000 per annum.  The suggested wage at &euro;11.70 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;22,589.</p>  <p>  Any of those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;22,589 could be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours, or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage through incremental progression.</p>  <p>  Under the recent public service stability agreement, from January 2018 pay in the public service will be further adjusted.  The pay increases provided for under the agreement are progressively weighted towards the lower paid with benefits ranging from 7.4% to 6.2% over the term to the end of 2020.</p></reply>

It is about people, who are directly employed by the State, who should at the minimum be receiving a living wage that is calculated as the minimum a person requires to live on.  In the view of Sinn F&eacute;in, the minimum wage should be raised to a point where it reaches the living wage and that it should happen incrementally.  There is, however, a point where we can start and we can compare the public service and the Civil Service against the private sector, but I believe that we, the Government Departments and public and civil servants should be taking a lead on the issue.  We are not talking about a huge number of people.  To put it into context we are probably talking about 1% of the Civil Service and 6% of the public service.  There are families, some 3,600 public sector workers, who are reliant on additional State supports such as family income support just to get by.</p><p>Is it the short, medium or even long-term ambition of the Government to ensure that every public sector worker, that is everybody employed directly by the State, will receive, at minimum, a living wage?  Is that something the Minister is willing or able to say?  Does he believe they should at minimum earn a living wage or are we going to hear comparisons between those in the Civil Service and the private sector?</p></speech>

As an employer, the State is already exceeding the level of wages that would be created by the implementation of a living wage policy.  Of the employees of the State, 94% have a salary which is in excess of that.  In relation to those who are earning less than &euro;20,589 and as I pointed out to the Deputy, they will be likely receiving additional payments for shift work and be on a salary scale which will give them the benefit of increments.  The agreement we made recently with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions prioritises those on lower incomes for a faster rate of wage increase.  It is precisely because I recognise that those on lower incomes face great challenges in getting by within our economy and have needs which we have a duty to try to meet that we have made a wage agreement that seeks to give wage increases to them at a faster rate than to those who earn more.  It is cumulatively because of decisions which have been made in this area for decades that we are in a place in which the overwhelming majority of those who work for the State earn more than the living wage.</p></speech>

I simply put the focus on those earning below the living wage, which is 6% in the public sector and 1% in the Civil Service.  It would not require a huge amount of money for the Minister to do this.  He referred to pay deals and all the rest.  Let us look at the pay deals and the upper end.  Let us look at the fact that the additional part of the pay deal for those in the public sector who earn more than &euro;90,000 will cost a total of &euro;55 million.  Let us look at the fact that 489 individuals working in the public sector will get an increase of &euro;11,749 per year.  That is half the living wage.</p>  <p>  The cost of this is in the small few millions.  There would also be net savings because 3,600 of these individuals have to rely on family income supplement payments to get by.  It is almost question of principle and, forgetting about the year on year increments, whether the Minister believes that within two or three years no one working in the public sector should be receiving less from the State in payment than the living wage?  I want to introduce it in this budget and we will show in our alternative budget that it can be done.</p></speech>

That is the reason we have a public service pay agreement.  The Deputy asked me what are my principles.  We are making faster rates of wage increase available to people who earn less.  That is me putting my principles into action.  We need to ensure that those who earn less within the public service and Civil Service have the opportunity to have their wages fully restored.  Perhaps the Deputy has shifted the Sinn F&eacute;in position on this matter, but my understanding is that his party welcomed the ratification of the recent agreement and understood that there are some people who work in our public service and Civil Service who are on higher levels of wages because of the markets in which they operate, for example, hospital consultants and those who provide specialised services.  We must remunerate those people so they continue to provide those services within our State.  That is why they are getting increases that are larger in cash terms than those who earn less.  We are doing so because we need them to work in our State to provide services that matter to our society.  If the Deputy is asking what is my commitment to those on lower pay, I point to the fact that we have a wage agreement in place which will provide them with a path to wage restoration that is not available to many who earn more.</p></speech>

By the standards of the HSE and in my experience of sitting at Cabinet, that is small money.  Is it really going to be held back on &euro;2 billion?  It has also said it needs another &euro;2 billion for extra infrastructure and IT.  I do not know.  We also need additional bed capacity.</p>  <p>  What are we doing in relation to a subject that is close to my heart and that of the Minister, namely electric rail lines, in particular to Maynooth and south Kildare to open up vast additional lands for housing at moderate prices?</p></speech>

I make the point which the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has also made that the level of funding now available to the Department of Health is at the highest it has ever been in the history of the State.  While the Deputy points to needs to which we must respond, including welcome news such as the receipt of planning permission for the National Maternity Hospital, we should acknowledge the progress on the national children's hospital and the new hospital facilities in Portrane.  I am engaging with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to determine the right level of capital funding we can afford as a country to make progress on the priorities Deputy Burton outlined in health.</p>  <p>  The electrification of our rail network to attain higher speeds and capacity is a matter the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, is raising with me.  I am working with him to see what kind of funding we can agree to make progress on a number of priorities, which might include the one referred to by the Deputy.  He is raising many matters with me.</p></speech>

That is based on experience.  These guys know how to ask for a great deal of extra money and they do not move or do anything unless they get it.  Given the clear bed shortage in Irish hospitals and the requirements of the National Maternity Hospital, the Minister's comments today do not fill me with positive hope and expectation.</p><p>Transport and housing in the modern world are intimately linked.  In another country, one can take a train to the capital city, such as London, Paris or Amsterdam, or a major employment area, within an hour.  We could do that if we electrified the Maynooth rail line and the south Kildare rail line as far as Portlaoise.</p> <p> The Government is talking about being up early in the morning.  Hopefully, that produces some sense of vision.  However, there are wonderful towns on the lines in question where thousands of houses could be built at much cheaper prices.  It would release a vast amount of additional housing potential.  It would also bring us into line with what happens on the gold coast in Dublin - the east coast line &ndash; a rail line which Garret FitzGerald electrified more than 30 years ago.  I am urging the Minister to have some vision and ambition with the capital plan.</p></speech>

It is a project for which the Deputy well understands the need.  Funding was set aside for it but additional funding had to be identified and made available to deliver the project, which I did precisely because I recognised the need to support projects such as this.  I understand fully what future investment we may need to make in the national maternity hospital and for additional bed capacity.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy sat around the Cabinet table she understands, as well as I do, that I have a certain amount of money that I have to make available to fund priorities.  I, and other Ministers, have to make choices in it.  If those words and that process do not fill the Deputy with hope or inspire her, I hope she would take account of the fact that we are hoping to allocate a further &euro;4 billion to projects.

It will not even cost him money to do it.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Freedom of Information Act was heralded as ground-breaking and progressive legislation by the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  At the time, we pointed out many problems with it, but they were obviously ignored.  It is three years since the Act was put in place and these problems have now come to fruition in many areas and practice.</p>  <p> What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on the 40 or more agencies that are either fully or partially exempt from freedom of information requests?  What are his views on whether these exemptions are in the public interest with regard to accountability and transparency?

It repealed the 1997 and 2003 freedom of information Acts.  The Act extends freedom of information to all public bodies and automatically includes newly established bodies, unless specifically exempt.</p><p>As part of the analysis and consultation during development of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, the inclusion of bodies such as commercial State bodies and regulatory bodies was considered in consultation with relevant Ministers at the time.</p><p>Part 1 of the first Schedule to the 2014 Act lists the bodies partially included and Part 2 of the first Schedule lists the bodies exempt from the Act. </p><p>The agencies included in Part 1 are largely those with regulatory, quasi-judicial or financial functions where scope of the Act is limited to certain functions only.  Decisions were made on the basis of needing <i>inter alia</i>to protect examinations or investigations, tribunals and dispute resolution functions, as well as to protect personal information and to comply with certain secrecy obligations under EU rules. </p><p>With regard to the commercial State bodies listed in Part 2 of the Schedule, important considerations informed and guided the approach taken.  The assessment was that, in general, and consistent with the approach adopted since this legislation first came into effect in 1998, commercial State bodies should not be subject to freedom of information requirements.  The rationale for this approach is the risk of the uneven competitive market environment that would be created in circumstances in which commercial State bodies operating in a competitive market were subject to freedom of information but their private counterparts were not.  Notwithstanding this, the Government decided that State companies operating in a monopoly market, should be and have been made subject to freedom of information.</p><p>I am satisfied that the reasons for the full or partial exemptions stand and are consistent with the public interest.  I hope the Deputy will acknowledge 600 bodies are now encompassed by this legislation.</p></reply>

The Minister says exemptions are proposed in the public interest so as not to affect a body's ability to perform its core functions and commercial performance.  I am not sure this complies fully with EU rules.  We have been in a battle with Bord na M&oacute;na for several months regarding its employment of Accenture.  It has confirmed to me that it entered into several contractual commitments with Accenture in 2014 but refused to give me the cost of each contract stating they do not come under freedom of information and, accordingly, the company is not obliged to give me the information.  I have checked this with the EU.  An EU procurement directive states contract information, including the cost per contract, of commercial State bodies must be published.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister check whether commercial state bodies which do not disclose cost of contracts are in breach of EU procurement directives?  Sadly, Bord na M&oacute;na stopped talking to me as well.</p></speech>

If I were to play a role in this, it would undermine the whole spirit of the legislation.  I cannot comment on an individual decision made by Bord na M&oacute;na and the inquiry the Deputy put in.  I imagine the reason it made that decision is that the freedom of information unit in Bord na M&oacute;na would have contended that making that information available to the Deputy might have caused commercial difficulty for the organisation and other tendering processes which it has under way, in turn undermining its ability to get good value for the taxpayer.  That is a general principle established in the commercial State sector in tendering and procurement processes.  I expect Bord na M&oacute;na is fully compliant with European Union law in this area.  As I said, its evaluation of commercial sensitivity may have played a role in the decision made.  However, as I said, I play no role nor would seek to play a role in any individual decision made because that would undermine the whole thrust of this legislation.</p></speech>

Will he check it for me because we are of the opinion it is not?</p><p>We put in many freedom of information requests.  Sometimes we get satisfactory answers; sometimes, we do not.  Recently - a while back - I put in a freedom of information request about NAMA&rsquo;s freedom of information system to see how it works on a day-to-day basis.  P&aacute;draig Corkery, the freedom of information manager in NAMA, on a request I put in on Project Eagle stated:</p><blockquote>The freedom of information is from Mick Wallace, so I am trying to close off any angles of attack in advance.</blockquote><p>That does not sound like a State agency that is interested in transparency and accountability.</p><p>In another example, I put in a request to the Central Bank about the Ulster Bank global restructuring group and all emails regarding it from 2016 to the present day.  It charged me &euro;250 to retrieve information.  When the Act was introduced in all its glory by the former Minister, we were told we were getting world-class legislation and it was the best thing since fried bread.  I believe the Minister should have another look at the legislation.  It is not perfect and could be improved in the interests of transparency and accountability, as well as the public interest.</p></speech>

The Deputy named an individual who works for the freedom of information unit in a particular organisation and read out an email he received relating to a decision that organisation was making.  However, there might well be another context or there might be other matters relating to that decision of which I am not aware.  For that reason, I will not comment on an individual decision that has been made.  If the Deputy has concerns about the implementation of the legislation generally or a concern that it is not being implemented in the way the Oireachtas intends, I am open to having a discussion with him about that and hearing his views on the matter, but not about individual decisions because that would not be appropriate to this legislation.</p></speech>

The workers were employed since April or May and still had not received payslips.  Even after I raised the matter with the Minister, which was followed by a raid by the joint investigation unit, JIU - although that raid was a joke - the workers still have not received payslips.  In August, they finally got a notification that they were PAYE workers as of 23 August, but there was no reference to the fact that there was no tax, registration or anything else since their employment began in April or May.  This is a flagrant breach of the law, and this is a public contract.</p>  <p>  I have just returned from the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills at which Western Building Systems, which built six schools in flagrant breach of fire safety standards, was discussed.  Another one that has not come into the public domain is Whitehall College of Further Education, also built during that period, in respect of which, I understand, legal action is being taken by the Office of Public Works over the company's failure to comply with proper standards.  Are these companies seriously going to continue to be awarded public contracts?  It is outrageous.  In the case of the schools, children are being put at risk.  The company signed off, fraudulently in my opinion, on fire safety in those buildings, which were then discovered to be defective on multiple occasions.  Will those companies be get further public contracts?  I do not believe they should.</p></speech>

I should explain that public procurement already includes provisions for the protection of labour rights.  Public procurement is the acquisition, whether under formal contract or not, of works, supplies and services by public bodies.  National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU and national legal requirements and obligations.  Under EU law, public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  In this regard, applicants are required to make declarations relating to their financial standing, legal standing and the payment of taxes and social contributions.  They must also be compliant with relevant labour law.</p>  <p>  Prior to the award of a public works contract, the successful applicant is required to produce a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.</p>  <p>  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of tax, social welfare and employment law are matters for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  With regard to the construction area specifically, I understand the matter Deputy Boyd Barrett raises, or it might be a related matter, is under consideration by our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Breen.  I will bring the Deputy's question to his attention.</p></speech>

I have given two examples of companies that received significant public contracts worth a great deal of money.  There is proof in the case of Western Building Systems and strong evidence in the case of Purcell Construction and Rapid Developments, in the Dolphin's Barn development, that they are breaking the law.  In the refurbishment at Dolphin's Barn they are breaking the law in terms of the tax code and conditions of employment for workers.  It is still happening, even after a raid took place.  The workers still have not received payslips and the employer is now trying to tell them that they were only employed on 23 August even though the workers can show pictures of cheques they received from this company back in May.  This is breaking the law.  When companies are found guilty of that will they continue to get public contracts or will the contracts be taken from them?  Western Building Systems built schools and is building rapid-build houses in Poppintree - God knows what they are like in terms of fire safety.  It was involved in construction at Temple Street hospital, as well as building extensions to Beaumont Hospital.  The company has built all of these things and we have known for at least two years that it was in flagrant breach of fire safety standards.  Will it get more public contracts?</p></speech>

The Deputy is also asking the question, I presume, in the context of legislation that he and his colleagues have proposed.  The Department has serious concerns about the legality of that legislation and that has also been communicated by the Attorney General.  I do not disregard the severity of what the Deputy suggested.  I have no proof of it.  This is not a court of law and it is not a place where we can pass judgment on people or their reputations.  The specific cases to which the Deputy refers should be brought to the attention of the relevant State authority, in this case the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to addressing these challenges, mitigating the impacts and taking the best advantage of available opportunities.  Last May, the Government published a document setting out in detail its approach to Brexit and the structures it had put in place to ensure a strategic and whole-of-Government response to it.  This identified the key priority issues for the negotiations between the European Union and United Kingdom and also mapped out the wider domestic response.</p>  <p>  The significance of the risks arising from Brexit is reflected in the Government's national risk assessment for 2017, which identifies areas where Brexit poses a specific risk, particularly to the economy.  In my Department, this approach is reflected in our statement of strategy for the period from 2016 until 2019 and our risk register.  The challenges posed by Brexit are kept under constant review.  A dedicated Brexit EU North-South unit is responsible for co-ordinating the response to Brexit across the Department and plays a full role in the cross-Department structures that support the work of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is using a highly consultative approach through the all-island civic dialogue process and other stakeholder events.  This has enabled us to hear from stakeholders about the Brexit impacts they are experiencing.</p>  <p>  Across Government, work is continuing on Ireland's wider response to both the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit.  This builds on ongoing research and analysis by all Departments.</p></speech>

Arising from the review and ongoing assessment of the position, has it been possible to balance the positives and negatives of Brexit as part of an effort to ascertain the extent to which it is possible to intervene to meet the challenges?  To what extent has the possibility of infringing state aid rules been considered with a view to dealing with the more sensitive challenges that may present in the shortest term?</p></speech>

While we intend to do this work in any case, the challenge posed by Brexit makes it even more necessary.  We will follow up on the budget with a ten-year national capital plan to be published in December.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what the position was in respect of the balance sheet of potential gains and losses from Brexit.  In recent months, I have noted that the opportunities in financial services and banking arising from Brexit are very significant for the economy.  The entire economy, not only Dublin, can benefit from this development.  I continue to be aware of the great risks posed to the economy and export competitiveness, in particular the risks posed to agriculture by currency shifts and possible future trading arrangements.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to transitional arrangements.  Is it possible that such arrangements will result in a loss of bargaining position that may not be to our advantage at a later stage?</p></speech>

While a significant amount of work remains to be done and there will be difficult negotiations later this year, the renewed focus of the British Prime Minister on a transitional period and its duration and the focus the United Kingdom is now placing on customs policy are important matters for Ireland and the economy.  A longer transitional period and a customs policy that is close to current customs arrangements would mean the opportunities would remain but the risks could begin to decrease.  All of this must be viewed in the context that the overall challenge Brexit poses to the economy will continue.  It is significant that our largest trading partner is exiting the European Union in the manner proposed.  The Government is under no illusion as regards current and potential challenges.</p></speech>

While he addressed the issue earlier, I ask him to make a statement in response to the serious concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.  The Minister referred to the report but did not refer to the issues highlighted in it regarding the serious concerns expressed by the Data Protection Commissioner.  What has the Minister learned from the report and the concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner?  The public services card project commenced in 2004, yet we do not have legislation 13 years afterwards.</p></reply>

The Social Welfare Act to which I referred has been revisited on many occasions and provides the legislative foundation for this Bill.  What I referred to earlier was separate legislation which will address the use and sharing of data in future as the opportunities and need to share them increase.  The Bill has a firm legislative footing in section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which has been revisited by the Oireachtas on many occasions.  As I stated, our responses to the queries raised by the Data Protection Commissioner, in particular with the Department of Social Protection, will be published shortly.</p></speech>

If he were to read the transcript of the relevant meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he would see that no business case was provided for the public services card and the costs of the project or its positives were never evaluated.  The estimated cost of the public services card now stands at &euro;60 million.  I am sure it is a matter of concern to the Minister, given his responsibility for public expenditure, that &euro;60 million will be spent on a project for which no business case was ever provided, which was introduced on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and the implications of which were never discussed.</p><p>On the issue of legislation, while we have the Social Welfare Act to which the Minister referred, we are waiting for the promised Bill on the storage, collection and, more important, sharing of data.  Various answers refer to memorandums of understanding that do not exist. </p><p>I ask the Minister to grasp the seriousness of what has taken place, with an identity card being rolled out without any discussion, honesty or acknowledgement of its implications for privacy and the sharing of data, particularly in view of what emerged in the Committee of Public Accounts. </p></speech>

My understanding of the Deputy's political philosophy is that she favours the State having a role in trying to provide better services for people.  I would, therefore, have expected her to favour the State having a role in trying to provide such services in a more efficient manner.  The Deputy inferred - she more than inferred - that there was no legislative underpinning for the public services card and when I explained clearly that there is such an underpinning, she made the entirely unfounded claim that this was a national identity card.</p>  <p>  As I and other Ministers have explained on many occasions, and I am happy to do again, it is not a national identity card.  People are not required to carry it and it is an offence if such identification is sought from persons.  I thought a Deputy who is in favour of the State playing a bigger role in people's lives and trying to make better use of public services would see the merit of this approach, as opposed to making the entirely unfounded allegations she made.</p></speech>

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General when writing on the public accounts, the &quot;Department commenced work [in 2016] on issues around data sharing, governance and the security of data which will be key elements of legislation currently being developed&quot;.  I have asked the Minister to address the <i>ad hoc</i>nature of this project, which will cost &euro;60 million.  He has not addressed one issue.  He has not addressed the question of why it has taken so long to come up with the legislation to which I have referred, and he has sidetracked onto my political ideology and other matters that are immaterial.</p><p>Will the Minister respond by addressing the issue of &euro;60 million being spent on a project in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner without a business case having been made?  What has he learned from that?  When will the legislation be before the House?  What has the Minister learned from his engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner?  Why do we need this for passports, driving licences and every other service if it is not a national identity card?</p><p>I do not like the word &quot;allegations&quot;.

I can give him a more comprehensive answer shortly.</p>  <p>  In the weeks since being appointed to my role with responsibility for procurement, it has been my concern and that of the Government that we be cognisant of the impact that any procurement guideline, regulation or rule has on the SME sector.  On this basis, the Department's SME leadership group, which is chaired by me and includes representatives of the SME sector, will be convened within the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I have met the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, a number of times and am due to do so again shortly.  I am interested in hearing directly from SMEs, which is why I attended - I am sure that the Deputy has as well - the roadshows held by the OGP across the country.  More are planned where there is an opportunity for the OGP to engage directly with the SME and other sectors.  I am anxious to hear from people like the Deputy about where they believe improvements can be made without impacting on the thrust behind the concept of procurement.</p></speech>

Holding a roadshow in Leinster House - perhaps in the AV room - would be worthwhile so as to brief Members of both Houses.</p>  <p>  I have written to the Minister of State about an issue that has come to my attention, that of small, independent book publishers that are effectively excluded from library tendering.  Library tenders are now being handled by large, wholesale providers.  They can receive significant discounts from publishing houses whereas small, independent book publishers cannot.  Due to the way in which public procurement is handled currently, they are unable to access the library network.  Included among them are local society groups that publish local histories and bring a local flavour to the library service, and Irish companies that publish on behalf of well-known authors and find that, due to the procurement process, they cannot access the library network unless they provide unsustainable discounts.</p>  <p>  Many sectors are affected.  The Minister of State might get a chance at some stage to organise a clinic in the AV room.  All Deputies have cases of people who are struggling with procurement.  Importantly, SMEs are still struggling and are not getting the opportunities that are available.  Such a clinic might assist us all in matching them with opportunities.</p></speech>

That is important.</p><p>The OGP takes a balanced approach to delivering value for the taxpayer and ensures that public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including the SME sector.  This is done in a number of ways, including: undertaking market analysis prior to tendering to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, market developments and innovation, what commercial models are available, the competitive landscape and the specific capabilities of the SME sector; setting proportionate eligibility requirements, for example, insurance and turnover, to support SME participation; breaking tendering competitions into smaller lots, for example, by sector, region, value and so on, to encourage the SME sector to participate and align with the capacity and capability of the marketplace; actively engaging in a range of events to help foster awareness of, and encourage engagement in, the public procurement process; and supporting supplier awareness of the Government's national tendering platform, .</p><p>Circular 10/2014 on initiatives to assist SMEs in public procurement, issued by my Department, sets out the policy in this regard.  The policy is reiterated in the public procurement guidelines issued in July.</p><p>The SME advisory group, which is chaired by me in accordance with the programme for Government, meets on a quarterly basis to address issues concerning SME participation in public procurement.  Representatives include the OGP, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, IBEC, the Small Firms Association, SFA, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, Chambers Ireland and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME.</p><p>It is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement function is discharged in line with the procurement rules and procedures.  The Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis Report 2015, published by the OGP and launched by me on 19 September 2017, indicates that the majority of the spend analysed is with SMEs.</p><p>The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that the winning of Government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p><p>I take on board the Deputy's suggestion about doing something for Members in Leinster House.

The utility and further development of outputs will continue long after the reform plan timeframe. </p> <p> One of the outputs that will require continued maintenance and development is the State property register, which was developed under the delivery plan.  It currently has basic details of over 24,000 properties, which are owned or leased by 94 individual organisations including central Government, local government, the HSE and non-commercial State organisations.  As recently as March of this year, it indicated there were 92 vacant properties.  They were mainly closed Garda stations which are subject to a review that is currently being undertaken by the Policing Authority.  </p> <p> I am reluctant to say that because those properties are vacant they are surplus.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600031#DD00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The aviation sector is a critically important one for a small open economy such as Ireland's.  Key to supporting this industry is ensuring that, as a nation and Government, we have sufficient airport capacity and sufficient infrastructure in place.  We need to have our capacity right and our infrastructure in place to ensure we have sustainable development going forward.  We need to have it in place to enable IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to attract foreign direct investment for the proper and sustainable development of the capital city and the eastern seaboard and all counties served by Dublin Airport, including my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Increased connectivity is extremely important.  The key to all of this is the roll out and construction of the second runway at Dublin Airport.  I am thinking back to a Topical Issue debate initiated by my colleagues, Deputy Daly and Deputy Broughan, in June 2016 about EU regulation and the need for a competent authority to deal with noise regulation at Dublin Airport.  I refer to a priority question I tabled to the Minister on Wednesday, 2 November 2016.  Key to this is that the residents who are affected want to know who is the competent authority dealing with noise regulations.  When I raised this issue in November 2016, the Minister gave me an answer.  He accused me of being alarmist.</p><blockquote>The Deputy is being a little bit alarmist.  There is one certainty.  The runway will be built.  What is uncertain, as the Deputy correctly said, is the exact timeframe because we are not certain that primary legislation will not be required.  It is unlikely, but it is possible.  If this is done by way of a statutory instrument, it will all be over by Christmas.  If primary legislation is by any chance necessary, it will be done very early in the new year.  Those are the certainties.  </blockquote><p>That is what the Minister said to me almost 12 months ago.  We are 12 months on and we still have no certainties.  The lack of progress on this is having a huge impact.  Dublin Airport is at capacity.  It will have severe negative economic impact on the wider area.  Can the Minister confirm to the House when the second runway will be up and operational?  Can he confirm it will be operational, as previously promised, by the first quarter in 2020?  Will he confirm the Irish Aviation Authority remains the Government's choice as the competent authority to deal with noise regulation?  If it is still the Government's choice to deal with it, can he confirm 18 months on whether a statutory instrument will be required?  If so, when will it be published?  If primary legislation is needed, when can we expect to debate it on the floor of the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

I share his frustration about the delay.  It is something I regret enormously but it is very important that we get it right.  We are dependent on legal advice wherever it is coming from but mostly from the Attorney General's office.  We will take that legal advice.  What is important to hear is that we get it right.  I am sure if we got it wrong and there were consequences, Deputy Troy would rightly be the first person to come into the House and say the legislation was rushed and we were to blame for it.  I assure the House we are still working extremely strenuously towards the objectives of which he spoke and that there is absolutely no intention to make any changes.  The route whereby we get there is the matter that is being worked upon very intensely in the Attorney General's office and elsewhere.  That route is slower than we expected but it will be finalised in good time so that the timetable is not in any way knocked.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I have made a number of contributions in the House on this matter over the course of the past 12 months, which is too long.  The Deputy mentioned November 2016 and he is absolutely correct; it is far too long and it is something I regret.  I regret it was not finalised within the timetable which we intended but we are moving as hastily as we possibly can without damaging the chances of the final answer we will come to.  It has also been raised in response to questions by Deputy Clare Daly who has a keen interest in this issue.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Troy rightly said, the residents have a real interest in this issue as well and they have a right to a hearing.  Deputy Troy will be aware I have met many delegations of residents to whom I have listened speak about the difficulties they are facing.  I have every sympathy for them.  That has been passed on to the DAA on every occasion.  I will continue to meet delegations of the residents because people have a right to a certain tranquility and not to be disrupted too much by airlines.  That is why we will have a noise regulator.</p><p>As the Deputy may know, the EU noise regulation, Regulation 598/2014, establishes a set of common rules and procedures to deal with noise issues at airports within all EU member states.  The regulation which came into effect in June of last year, applies to airports of a certain size.  In Ireland, it is only applicable to Dublin Airport.</p> <p> The regulation is an important addition to the EU legal framework for effective environmental management and control.  It seeks to ensure that airport capacity is developed in a measured and balanced way, with due regard to economic growth, jobs, prosperity and the mitigation of environmental impacts.  The main purpose of the regulation is to provide member states with a common framework for applying internationally agreed best practices in the area of aviation noise management.</p> <p> On the one hand, the regulation recognises the importance of aviation connectivity in supporting economic growth, social development and international trade.  On the other hand, it also recognises the need for states to expand airport capacity in a controlled and sensible manner, especially in minimising the impact of aircraft noise in the vicinity of airport sites.  Drawing on methodology agreed at the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is the global body responsible for co-ordinating and developing international aviation, the EU regulation provides a way of ensuring that aircraft noise is managed in a coherent and balanced manner.</p> <p> Under the regulation, which came into effect last year and which is therefore law here, I am required to appoint a competent authority to be responsible for its application.  Such a body shall be responsible for measuring noise and making decisions about how it should be managed by the airport in the context of current and future activity and expansion.  Typically, this would be a relatively straightforward task involving a statutory instrument to nominate the competent authority.  However, as the Deputy will know, it has proven very complex to transfer onto existing Irish planning and development arrangements, and my Department has had to work quite intensively with the Office of the Attorney General over an extended period of time to work through the best way to ensure Ireland is fully compliant. </p></speech>

Will he commit to the runway being operational by the first quarter of 2020?  Will he confirm that the Irish Aviation Authority remains the Government's choice as the competent authority?  Does it require a statutory instrument or primary legislation?  Those are three very simple and basic questions.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he met the residents - fair play.  The residents have met representatives of the DAA on a number of occasions.  They want an independent authority to regulate the noise.  While he can correct me if I am wrong, as of today, the Minister seems unable tell the House what the competent authority is.  If he can, he should share the information with us.  He said he sought legal advice, mostly coming from the Office of the Attorney General.  What other legal advice has he sought?  Has a senior counsel been brought on board?  Has the DAA or the IAA given legal advice to the Department?</p>  <p>  The Minister said he has no intention of making any changes, but the route to get there may change.  He is trying to muddy the waters.  I will ask some very straight questions and I would appreciate if he could answer them.  Does the IAA remain the competent authority?  Does it require a statutory instrument or primary legislation?  Is the Minister committed to having the second runway in operation by the first quarter of 2020?  If it is not the IAA, what body does the Minister consider as the competent authority?  It started off as the EPA and changed to the IAA.  The Minister has led us to believe he has worked on this for more than 18 months and now his reply has left uncertainty as to whether it is the IAA.</p>  <p>  The Minister should not give us the balderdash that we would be critical of him because it would be rushed.  It is far from rushed; it is operating at a snail's pace.  Even the Minister has said he is embarrassed over the pace at which it is operating.  I am not looking for rushed legislation, but detailed answers on the status of this issue.  The airport management needs to know and the residents need to know.  It is down to the Minister to inform us.</p></speech>

I will try to give him the answers as specifically as I possibly can.  On the question of the route for getting there, it is quite simple; it is where the balance between the statutory instrument and primary legislation lies.  That has not yet been decided and has not been fully recommended upon by the Attorney General.  That is why I say the route may vary; the balance may move towards primary legislation and away from statutory instrument depending on the Attorney General's advice.  That is what I mean when I refer to the route by which we get to the same objective.</p></speech>

Whether we get there by primary legislation or statutory instrument or both and in which proportions is a matter we will address as soon as we get the advice from the Attorney General.  The Deputy should recognise that the Attorney General's advice is important here.  If we ignore that advice, we will, of course, be culpable.  That will be a major factor in the decision about the route we take on legislation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the other legal advice.  The other legal advice has come, but I have not seen it.

The so-called magic of Ryanair and Mr. Michael O'Leary has been exposed as nothing more than the vulgar, bootboy tactics of vicious exploitation meted out on its crew and its pilots.  I will not repeat the stories with which people are familiar from the airwaves - the charging of pilots &euro;15 an hour to download an application form; the &euro;30,000 to pay for their own training; and Ryanair taking on people with a couple of hundred hours' training experience.  Is it any wonder that people are leaving it in droves?  Is it any wonder that it is getting away with it given that it is facilitated by the operation of the State in this country?</p>  <p>  Given the enormous safety risk for passengers of having pilots on zero-hour contracts, what is the Minister doing to tighten up the regulation in this area and improving collective bargaining?  Ryanair carries 130 million passengers a year and employs tens of thousands of people under an Irish flag of convenience.  The scam has been perpetuated - the myth, if one likes - by the pretence that crew based all over Europe are Irish crew on Irish contracts with recourse only to Irish courts.  They get away with it because Ireland has no definition of what a self-employed person is.  Therefore, we have agencies such as Brookfield, a tax haven in Gibraltar, and contracts that stipulate the services of a pilot are provided on a required and-or casual basis.  There is no obligation on it to provide work.  The European Cockpit Association blames these contracts for risks and for pilots turning up when sick when it is not safe for them to do so.</p>  <p>  The European Court of Justice has blocked this.  Ryanair is set to appeal.  What is the Government's attitude to this because Ireland has for too long facilitated this appalling vista?</p></speech>

This is social dumping by Ryanair on a grand scale.  There is a scandal in the context of sick pay, holiday pay and zero-hour contracts.</p> <p> This summer, the Revenue, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, organised a joint raid on a building site at Dolphin's Barn to combat bogus self-employment, and rightly so.  Why has that not been done with Ryanair?  I put it to the Minister that it is because the company is protected by the establishment that fetes it, by the parties that invite Michael O'Leary to their think-ins and by the Government, which holds up Ryanair as a glittering symbol and shining example of neoliberal capitalism.  I have two questions for the Minister.  First, does he not feel that symbol has been somewhat tarnished as a result of the events of recent weeks?  What does he say to the proposal I put to him that the State has turned a blind eye to Ryanair's social dumping and is, therefore, part of the problem?  What is the Government going to do to change that?</p></speech>

This is a very serious, pan-European service failing that seems to have arisen at very short notice.  The scale of the Ryanair network has certainly exacerbated the impact.  There is some solace in EU consumer protection provisions, which in Ireland are safeguarded by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  As the designated national body for the enforcement of air passenger rights under Regulation No. 261/2004, I assure the Deputies that as soon as the announcements were made by Ryanair, our aviation regulator was in contact with the company to make sure consumer protection issues were to the fore.  I am advised that those contacts are ongoing.</p><p>The regulator has confirmed that, under EU consumer protections, the carrier is obligated to reroute passengers at the earliest possible opportunity and to provide care and assistance, namely: meals and refreshments; hotel accommodation in cases where an overnight stay becomes necessary; transport between the airport and place of accommodation; and two telephone calls, emails, faxes or telexes.  The airline must also offer the choice of a full refund.  Those are steadfast requirements with which Ryanair will have to comply for all of its affected customers in Ireland.</p><p>The regulator has already advised affected customers to submit claims for refunds and compensation directly to the airline in the first instance.  If consumers are not satisfied with the response of Ryanair, they may make a complaint to the regulator in cases where the cancelled a flight was from Ireland.  Similarly, if a flight was due to depart from another EU member state, the complaint will be handled by the national enforcement body in that jurisdiction.  Further information is available on the regulator's website, <i>www.flightrights.ie</i>.</p><p>As to the causes of this disruption, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and explain.  I have no wish to speculate as to the inner workings of a private company.  I note that a number of factors have been attributed by the company, including adverse weather conditions.  However, in so far as the company has pointed to changes to EU regulations affecting leave arrangements for staff as a factor, I can advise the following: The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is the independent regulator in Ireland responsible for safety regulation, oversight and inspection.  In that role, the IAA is responsible for ensuring that all Irish registered airlines comply with European aviation safety regulations, including those governing so-called flight time limitations.</p><p>Revised European flight time limitations came into effect last year, and Ryanair has transitioned to them.  The limitations restrict the number of pilot and cabin crew hours that are permissible during a 12-month period.  I am advised by the IAA that all Irish airlines have always been and continue to be fully compliant with the regulations governing flight time limitations.  While I appreciate that the Deputies would very much like to instigate a broader debate on pay and conditions of workers, we are talking about a private, commercial company.  I have no remit in this regard.  Matters of staff relations, rosters, remuneration rates and terms and conditions of employment are a matter for the company and its employees.  As I have explained, there are EU laws limiting annual flight times by pilots and crew, and I understand that Ryanair complies with those.</p></speech>

The company will pay a heavy price for its treachery.  It is a case of the chickens coming home to roost.</p>  <p>  There has never been a better time for pilots at Ryanair to organise.  I am shocked when I think back that it is nearly 20 years ago since we stood outside the white house, the Ryanair headquarters at Dublin Airport, to watch Michael O'Leary give the finger to trade unionists who had assembled in support of the right of Ryanair workers to organise.  I am not asking the Minister about the things he cannot control but, rather, about the things he can control.  The Government and that which preceded it have facilitated a process whereby the lack of employment regulation in Ireland has facilitated a European-wide situation whereby Ryanair bases in France and Denmark have been shut down and people have been employed on Irish contracts - bogus self-employment Irish contracts.  We have a responsibility to that end.  We have a responsibility in the context of the European Court of Justice ruling that Ryanair is going to appeal.  What I want to know, in the interest of decent workers rights and safe pilot conditions, is what the Government is doing in order to protect that scenario?</p></speech>

It is run like a corporate dictatorship.  Any worker in Ryanair who stood up and announced that he or she planned to try to unionise his or her fellow workers faced immediate sacking.  I put it to the Minister that the absence of trade union organisation is part of the problem, as is the absence of trade union rights.  If trade unions existed in Ryanair, there would be better wages and better conditions, and, perhaps, this crisis might have been averted.  I hope that part of the legacy of this dispute is that Ryanair pilots - and also cabin crew, baggage handlers and other staff - win trade union rights and recognition.  My question to the Minister is whether he has any comment to make on trade union rights for Ryanair pilots and whether he is willing to meet the Irish Airline Pilots Association to discuss a section 32 examination of the IAA, in other words, issues relating to public safety arising from the way Ryanair operates.</p></speech>

I will meet the Irish Airline Pilots Association.  I would be delighted to meet the pilots.  I will discuss all issues which arise as a result of this situation.  It would be perfectly fair to do that.  I met the pilots already but not in recent weeks.  We had a meeting that was extremely enlightening and interesting.  We agreed to meet again.  I will meet them and discuss any issues they think are relevant.  We may not agree but I think it would be a useful exchange.</p>  <p>  Obviously, I cannot intervene in issues that are before the European Court of Justice or that are being appealed to it.  I do not wish to address that issue here as it would be inappropriate to do so.  In the circumstances, I do not really want to say anything about the absence of trade unions in Ryanair but I have been in touch with Michael O'Leary in the past week and I will be in touch with him again this week.  I expressed the views of the Government and the views of the travelling public that the events of last week should have been foreseen, that we could not understand why they were not foreseen and that what happened was unacceptable.  My Department has been in touch with the Commission on Aviation Regulation and the IAA to ensure that Ryanair is complying with every necessary rule and regulation and that it is compensating passengers accordingly.  Those organisations are satisfied that this is being done down to the last cent.</p><p>If the Deputies wish, I will report back to the House as soon as possible, maybe next week under Priority Questions or Topical Issues.  Mr. O'Leary told me that he would get in touch with me again this week, when he has produced what he believes to be a comprehensive solution to the problem.  I think he will announce that very shortly.  My interest is to ensure that something as unacceptable as this should never happen again and to do so without interfering in the affairs of a private company.</p></speech>

Scoil Mochua is a relatively small school located in Clondalkin, with about 74 pupils.  The children have multiple disabilities including physical and other severe disabilities.  Recently, Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I had an opportunity to visit the school and meet the pupils and their teachers.  We saw the physical condition of the school.  More importantly, we saw the difficulty posed for the children in carrying out their daily activities.  The school's conditions are poor and the accommodations are not appropriately planned.  All of these children have physical disabilities, with walkers, wheelchairs and so forth.  The physical space to manoeuvre is simply not sufficient.  This causes severe hardship on an ongoing and daily basis.  The school is also in a very poor condition in respect of toilet and sanitary facilities and so forth.  It is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that this is not a constituency matter.  While the school is located in Clondalkin, the pupils come from Clondalkin, Lucan, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Naas and other areas.  It is a very particular issue.  Having looked at the facilities in the school, we believe they are grossly inadequate for the needs of the children.  They are children with significant challenges and although the physical condition of the school should not be adding to their daily challenge, unfortunately it is.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that colleagues from other parties are joining to appeal to the Minister that this school simply cannot wait.  The teachers have indicated to us that the Department has informed them that, in the future, there will be a new school building.  We are asking the Minister to consider advancing the date for this specific school.  There is a very significant, immediate adverse impact on the children.  We believe the refurbishments should be advanced more quickly.</p></speech>

Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin is probably unique.  As Deputy Curran said, there are 74 students, most of whom are wheelchair users.  They come from 19 different localities including Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Lucan, as well as counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  It is unique in offering preschool, primary and post-primary facilities.  As Deputy Curran described, the school is very dilapidated and is not fit for purpose in its present form.</p>  <p>  Many good schools have been built in Dublin Mid-West.  The management and students of Scoil Mochua are looking for equality on that basis.  They are in the schools building programme for 2019 to 2021.  The management and students are saying this work cannot wait but needs to be fast-tracked and undertaken as soon as possible.  I could read out a list of issues that the school has.  Some of them are very basic, for example corridors in which two wheelchairs cannot pass each other.  The school building has outlived its purpose and it is time a new school is built.</p></speech>

It is unique in that not only is it a school but also has on-site therapeutic support and interventions provided by the CRC.  There are 74 pupils from a wide range of localities, electoral constituencies and counties.  The pupils are children with special needs including those with multiple disabilities.  I visited the school three times over the last months.  The quality of the effort by the teachers, board and parents is just remarkable.  Deputy Curran and I met three of the pupils, who gave a presentation.  These are remarkable children who are overcoming all sorts of obstacles placed in their way in their everyday lives.  In addition to that, they are in a school in which the conditions are frankly Dickensian.  Not only is there not enough room for the facilities; there are not adequate toilet facilities, cooking or eating facilities or facilities for children to exercise.</p>  <p>  Our request is very simple.  It is that this project be lifted out of the current capital programme up to 2021 and brought forward.  The school has the land and the support from the local authority.  It has support from the local community and cross-party support.  I urge the Minister to visit the school to see for himself at first hand the conditions.</p>  <p>  There is a further frustration.  A number of us in this House have been raising the matter with the Minister through parliamentary questions over the last months, seeking information.  I was told in replies in May, June and September that additional information had been requested from the school by the Department and had yet to arrive.  In case that is going to be part of the Minister's answer today, it is not the case.  The information that I was told was required over the summer had been provided in May.  The information that I was told in September was required by the Department had been provided in August.  The Department has all the information.  The Minister has all the information.  Because of the special needs of these children and the poor state of the school, we are urging the Minister to lift it out of the capital programme and bring it forward to let these children get the quality of education they so rightly deserve.</p></speech>

The school covers four constituencies, including my own with 12 children coming from the Tallaght area.  As other speakers have said, it is not about lobbying for a constituency school; the Minister gets those letters every day of the week and I understand the pressure he is under.  This school is unique in the difficulties that are facing the children.  The children themselves have multiple disabilities in many cases, including physical and other impairments.  In their short lives, they have faced significant challenges and will probably face even more as they move into the future.  The difficulties for electrical equipment and even for two wheelchair users to pass each other in the corridors have been described.  In order to get from one end of the school to the other, some children have to go outside the school altogether, out onto the path.  The school is located down in a back alley or laneway, which makes it difficult to drop off the children at school.  It is made up of prefabs.  There are a lot of problems.</p>  <p>  There is plenty of land and there is agreement with South Dublin County Council.  We are not just looking to serve our own constituencies here.  We are asking the Minister to fast-track the work because of the profound challenges facing these children.  It ticks all the boxes.  I know there is a difficulty for the Minister in that if he does this for one school, the pressure is going to be on for another.  I ask him to seriously consider this case, however.  We have an opportunity to do something positive for these children and their families.  I ask him to reflect on this in his answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600034#GG00700"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.</p><p>The Department is committed to a rebuild on the existing site.  That has been accepted.  As the Deputies have indicated, it is due for commencement between 2019 and 2021.  It is at an early stage of planning within the Department.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, there are issues from the Department's point of view.  It needs additional information.  The rebuild is designed to cater not just for the existing school numbers, but also for projected additional needs.  I understand that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the school are involved in providing the additional information needed to identify the scale of those needs.  The information in question will be an important input into the Department's planning.  In addition, I understand from the Department that mapping and service identification in respect of an adjoining site, which has been put forward prospectively as part of the site on which the development will occur, is not available to it in the detail it needs.  I do not know whether it is an issue for the school or the council to indicate what underground services are there.  Additional information is being sought in respect of water and other issues.</p> <p> I would be sympathetic to the proposal that this should be fast-tracked, if possible.  The sheer growth in school numbers has put severe pressure on my Department.  We are providing 15,000 additional school places every year, driven simply by demographic need.  At the same time, we are trying to provide approximately 5,000 replacement places.  This school would largely fall into the latter category.  As the Deputies will understand, the Department has scheduled its work in accordance with that plan.  It works through projects on a sequential basis.  In light of the unanimity of the Deputies' views, I will explore whether there is scope for this project to be moved forward more quickly than anticipated.</p> <p> The Department seems to need additional information from the school.  I am not sure whether that information is entirely available to the principal or is something we need to source, along with the school, from other agents.  It appears that South Dublin County Council and the NCSE will have roles to play in accurately identifying the scale of the project and determining the suitability of the site.  They will need to ascertain whether any issues pertaining to the site could create delays in planning, design and so on.  That is where it stands.  I will seek additional information on this at a personal level to see whether we can do anything to comply with what the Deputies have said.</p> <p> I have been seeking to prioritise children with special educational needs.  In the past two years, I have been able to provide for 1,500 additional resource teachers and 2,000 additional special needs assistants.  When special classes are needed, they are treated as emergency works.  We are trying to make sure children with special needs are not disadvantaged in any way.  I will explore this further in view of what the Deputies have said to see what is possible.  If they can shed any light on the issues that are holding this up, according to what I have been told, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

We will be glad to work collectively with him to bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible, for example, by working to supply the additional information that is needed to ensure this project goes ahead.  It can advance with the direct help of the Minister.  I commend the students and teachers in the school, who are doing exceptionally well during these difficult and challenging times.  In case anyone thinks we are jumping on the bandwagon at the last moment, I remind the Minister of the findings of a whole-school evaluation that was conducted in the school in March 2010:</p><blockquote>The school wing contains three units, each comprising a shared area with two classroom bases located off it.  This type of school design was prevalent at the time the building was constructed but is not the optimum design for pupils with physical disability.  The classroom bases are small and are restrictive when used for tuition with the whole class group.  Many of the pupils attending the school have physical needs requiring frequent changes to supportive seating or standing equipment.  This necessitates the movement of both pupils and equipment regularly during the day.  As the classroom bases are small, other pupils often have to be moved to facilitate the exit or entrance of their peers.</blockquote><p>In acknowledgment of that evaluation, the board of management of the school replied:</p><blockquote>We welcome inspectors&rsquo; comments about the significant inadequacy of our existing buildings.  The Board of Management will increase its efforts to achieve a building programme through the DES which will fully address the needs of our physically/multiply disabled students.</blockquote><p>The evaluation to which I refer was conducted in March 2010.  This shows that the problem has been around for a long time.  I am glad to hear the Minister's response.  My colleagues and I will work collectively to try to advance this project.</p></speech>

We sometimes get negative news when we come in here.  I hope the issues raised in the Minister's statement can be overcome.  In particular, the issue relating to the land in the local area can be overcome quite quickly by South Dublin County Council.</p>  <p>  I would like to mention some other parallels.  A really good primary school is being built by Stewarts in the Rosse Court area of Lucan.  It will be a state-of-the-art facility for children with special needs, etc.  I hope the parents, the management and the service users can get what they want and the issues can be fast-tracked so that this school gets up and running as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600035#HH00400"><p>I welcome the very positive response from the Minister.  I want to clarify the nature of the information that is being asked for.  An email that was sent by the principal of the school in response to my last parliamentary question on this matter makes it clear that as far as the school understands, the information sought by the Department - a letter from South Dublin County Council with respect to the use of a particular piece of land - was submitted in March 2016 and again in June 2017.</p>  <p>  Future enrolment numbers have also been mentioned.  As the Minister will be aware, because this is not a mainstream school, the sources of enrolment are more complex.  According to the information that has been provided to the Department, it will be built as a 12-teacher school, in line with the current shape and size of the school.</p>  <p>  There have been conversations between the Department and the relevant personnel in the CRC regarding the co-location of the CRC building.  The CRC authorities have confirmed that they are more than happy to work with the Department and to allow it to be the lead design team in producing this development.</p>  <p>  I suggest that the quickest way to get this resolved is to do two things.  First, officials from the Department need to have an on-site meeting with representatives of South Dublin County Council and CRC as a matter of urgency to resolve any outstanding issues.  Second, I recommend that a joint design team, comprising officials from the Department and the CRC, should be put in place to work through the rest of the issues and avoid emails getting lost in transmission between different bodies.  This is happening in housing and there is no reason it cannot happen in the Department of Education and Skills.  If the Minister were to undertake to do those two things - arrange an on-site meeting and establish a design team involving the Department and the CRC - this could be expedited very quickly, something which would meet with universal approval.</p></speech>

I take what the Minister is saying at face value.  I think prioritising schools like this is the right direction for us to take as a society.  As I said in my opening statement, these children face challenges because they are impaired by their disabilities, so society should not be impairing them as well.  They should not have difficulty getting into their schools, which should be safe havens they can enjoy with their colleagues.  If the Minister can fast-track and champion this cause, it will be a positive day's work.  There is huge pressure on the families of these beautiful children to deliver the supports they need.  They are looking for the best for them.  If we have the ability to deliver such services at this school, in particular, we should try to do so.  If the Minister can champion this as a priority, we would appreciate it.</p></speech>

The Department is looking for information on the existence and location of a water main, media underground services and ESB underground cables.</p><p>This is factual information about mapping.  I was not aware that this involved co-location with the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, so I will have to explore whether the suggestion the Deputies are making of undertaking a joint design project with the CRC is something to which the Department would be positively disposed.  I presume the design issues for the CRC will be different from what would be a standard design of the Department but I will explore the issues the Deputies are raising to see if we can make progress.</p></speech>

I intend to keep the operation of the amendment under review to ensure that it does not have a detrimental effect on the effectiveness of the legislation, the fundamental purpose of which is to encourage the use of mediation by people to resolve their disputes rather than going down the costly and often stressful route of court proceedings and all that entails.  Of course, by its very nature, mediation is a voluntary process.  That is spelled out in the definition of mediation in section 2 of the Bill.</p>  <p>  In the interests of speedy enactment and implementation of this important and long-awaited Bill, I am not opposing the amendment agreed by a majority and passed in the Seanad.  However, based on the amendment being made, I would like to formally request a correction of the text of the Bill to move the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; from its current position on line 4 of page 15 to line 7 and to re-designate the original sub-paragraph (d) as sub-paragraph (e). This is necessary to ensure that the text reads correctly.  I do not want to impose any undue complication or difficulty on Members but I believe it is essential that everything we do is clear so I ask the indulgence of Members of the House for this correction in the text of the Bill, which will ensure there is a proper and correct textual context.</p>  <p>  I repeat that court proceedings can be very costly.  They can also be very stressful and time-consuming.  This Mediation Bill will promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to such court proceedings.  Enactment of the Bill will speed up the resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs associated with these disputes and reduce or avoid the stress involved in court proceedings which, by their very nature, are adversarial.</p>  <p>  Once the Bill is passed and enacted, I look forward to receiving submissions from interested parties regarding the publication of codes of practice for mediators under section 9 and the setting up of a scheme to provide mediation information sessions for people involved in family law disputes as provided for under section 23.</p>  <p>  In addition, I repeat my call to various bodies active in the mediation sector to come together to meet, collaborate and submit proposals regarding the setting up of a mediation council as provided for in section 12 of the Bill.  I believe the early establishment of such a body would provide further stimulus to the use of mediation following enactment of the legislation.</p>  <p>  I repeat my thanks to Deputies for their support for this important legislation.  I hope that we could complete debate on this issue in its entirety this evening, but I am in the hands of Deputies in that regard.</p></speech>

I also put on the record that I agree with what the Minister has said in respect of correcting the text and moving around the proposed amendment within the body of the Mediation Bill.</p>  <p>  The amendment that has come from Seanad &Eacute;ireann seeks to ensure that a solicitor or barrister, when advising their client about mediation, recognises that it may not be appropriate in certain instances.  In fairness to the draft legislation that went through this House previously, it is recognised that the Act shall not apply to proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts and under the Child Care Acts.  The Domestic Violence Acts deal with issues where there is domestic violence.  It would be wholly inappropriate for mediation to apply in that context.  Similarly, under the Child Care Acts, there are provisions such as section 12 and other provisions dealing with instances where children are to be taken into custody.  In those instances, it would also not be appropriate.</p>  <p>  One argument would be that on the reading of the Bill as it is at present, it is unnecessary to make the amendment but, nonetheless, there is a benefit in putting an obligation on a solicitor to ensure that if he or she believes it is not an appropriate means of resolving the dispute because of a threat to the safety of the client or the client's children, this should be so advised by the solicitor.  Even if this provision was not contained within the Mediation Bill, any competent and reliable solicitor would recognise that it would be important to advise the client of those particular circumstances.</p>  <p>  We will support the amendment.  It is hoped we can now move quickly to get this legislation passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to recognise, however, that notwithstanding the fact that the amendment probably covers issues that would be referred to as family law issues, mediation is something that should be availed of by practitioners within family law.  It is much more appropriate for people who are married, getting separated or divorced if they try to resolve their differences between themselves with the benefit of mediation rather than having to have a court imposed solution.  One may never get exactly what one wants in every respect, but it is far better if there is an agreement as opposed to an imposition of a solution on the parties.  We will be supporting the amendment.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to respond to me by advising how his change of the numerical order of the amendment will impact on the overall intention of the Senators' amendment.  As I understand it, they recognise that these measures are already in the Bill but that this will copperfasten the idea that legal advice should be given to those to whom mediation is being recommended, that it is not always in their interests to go down that route, and that they might have to reconsider it.</p>  <p>  One of the strongest recommendations for supporting this amendment should come from the fact that it is supported by Women's Aid, an organisation that is working on the ground and has experience over many years of the circumstances of dealing with this horrendous social issue, which is on the increase and is a very worrying response of modern society to both women and children and family life in general.  The question of having no other option but to go into mediation should be considered, and not just on the basis of reducing legal costs, although I accept that is important.</p><p>There are all sorts of ways of reducing costs or making things more efficient.  However, families should not be forced into situations that might be dangerous or not in their best interests or circumstances that might put them in any way at risk.  In addition, mediation should not be forced upon them.  I can certainly think of a few cases I personally know of where mediation would not work and could put women, children or the abused parties at risk, so it is very important that clause is there and is copperfastened in legal language.  I commend the Senators on tabling the amendment but I ask the Minister to explain clearly the impact his moving things around and renaming them will have on the overall intention.</p></speech>

She is more than capable.</p><p>I hope we will be able to do this at different stages as the Brexit negotiations proceed.  It is good to keep the House, the various other forums and the public informed of our position because the enormity of these issues for Ireland in the future is such that this is required.  We will have an all-island forum on Brexit on Thursday and I presume some of the other Deputies will be there.</p><p>I welcome this two-day debate on Brexit.  It is an issue that deserves the attention of this House given the unprecedented economic, political and diplomatic challenges it poses for Ireland.  The Oireachtas is playing a central role in furthering the public debate on Brexit and the implications thereof for this country.  The address by Michel Barnier to the joint sitting of the Houses last May and Guy Verhofstadt's exchange with the joint committees last week were important milestones and provided a positive contribution to our work.  We need to continue to intensify this work in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>The Brexit negotiations are entering a critical and more intensive stage.  Issues unique to Ireland - protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, avoiding a hard border and maintaining the common travel area - are at the heart of the negotiations.  This is the result of a sustained political and diplomatic effort that has won us the support and understanding of our EU partners.  Sufficient progress must be made on these Irish-specific issues, as well as on the questions of citizens' rights and the UK's financial liabilities, before the second-phase negotiations can begin on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  This sequencing was agreed by both sides at the outset and is about building confidence and trust.  It is also about laying foundations for future decisions.  With the exception of the Irish-specific issues, the economic and other sectoral issues of most interest to Ireland will not be addressed until the second phase when we talk about a transition, future trade relationships and so on.  This makes it particularly important that the conditions for moving to the next phase are met.  It will be for the European Council to decide that sufficient progress and when it has been achieved.</p><p>In this regard, the speech last week by Prime Minister May - particularly the constructive tone of her remarks - was welcome, and it is important we state that.  We were pleased to note the Prime Minister's commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area and to avoiding any physical infrastructure at the Border.  That has been said before by the British Government but it was said very forcefully last week in Florence.  The pledge to seek transition arrangements for Brexit - and the acknowledgement that business should only have to plan for one set of changes in the EU-UK relationship - is also very welcome, and that has not been stated in the past as explicitly as it was stated in Florence.  A <i>status quo</i>arrangement which would see the UK remain a member of the Single Market and customs union during this transition, with the associated rights and obligations, would be sensible and would provide much-needed clarity for businesses on the island of Ireland as well as in Britain.  It may well prove necessary for the UK to seek a longer transition phase than the two years suggested by Prime Minister May, considering the amount of work involved in preparing adequately for the consequences of Brexit, but this was a useful update on British thinking nonetheless.</p><p>The broader UK position, and the worthy aspirations I have mentioned, now need to be translated into firm commitments across the negotiating table in Brussels.  I hope real progress can be made in the next two rounds of the negotiations so that we can move into the second phase next month.  However, this very much depends on the UK and its willingness to move on a number of the exit issues.  To be clear, there is no demand or expectation that these issues be settled in their entirety before phase two can begin, but they have to be advanced beyond where they are today.</p> <p> As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, I am co-ordinating the whole-of-Government response to the significant challenges that arise for Ireland.  In this capacity, I am working closely with colleagues across Government with policy responsibility in relevant areas in order to assist affected sectors and regions in dealing with the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This co-operation also involves the appropriate State agencies and, I would like to think, the Opposition political parties too in terms of suggestions, proposals and constructive criticism.  As part of this co-ordination role, I am also stepping up the overall strategic oversight of Brexit-related measures being implemented across Government.  This will involve building upon the extensive cross-Government research, analysis and consultation with stakeholders that has been already carried out, as well as ensuring a co-ordinated approach that facilitates the early identification of potential synergies across Government.  New interdepartmental co-ordination mechanisms are currently being put in place to reflect the enhanced responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this regard.</p> <p> Ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s approach to the ongoing EU-UK negotiations is a central dimension of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit.  In this regard, our overriding objective is to work with our EU 27 partners to achieve the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.  The closer we come to this objective, the fewer negative consequences for Ireland and for the specific sectors to which many in this House are close.</p> <p> Since the referendum last year we have prepared extensively to ensure that our priority issues - namely, protecting the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the common travel area, minimising the impact on our economy and a strong future for the EU itself - are advanced to the maximum extent possible.  There have been three rounds of negotiations to date, with the fourth round taking place this week.  In fact, it is my understanding the negotiations will be focusing on Ireland tomorrow.  As this is the first phase of negotiations, and in line with the agreed sequencing, the focus has been on the withdrawal issues of citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement, more technical separation issues and, as I said, issues unique to Ireland.  Both the EU and UK have used these early rounds of negotiations to clarify their respective positions, highlighting the areas of agreement and divergence.</p> <p> Discussions on several issues have been reasonably constructive to date, with some progress being made in the areas of citizens&rsquo; rights and the other separation issues.  However, it is clear that many difficult and complex issues remain, above all with regard to the financial settlement.  It is in this area that the least amount of progress has been made, at least up until the Florence speech.  The UK has accepted that it will have a financial obligation to honour on its departure and the position set out by Prime Minister May in her speech last Friday will, hopefully, help to advance the issue.  The EU&rsquo;s position is also very clear.  Intensive work is now required around the negotiating table in Brussels to find convergence between the two positions.</p> <p> The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his task force are well prepared for these negotiations, which are based both on the European Council guidelines and the more detailed negotiating directives agreed in the spring.  This is in addition to the extensive and ongoing consultations they are holding with the 27 EU member states.  Our team speaks to the task force virtually on a daily basis, mainly through our ambassador, H. E. Declan Kelleher, in Brussels, but also sometimes from Dublin.  We are appreciative of the level of support that both the task force and our EU partners have shown for Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns, with Mr. Barnier reiterating after his meeting with me on 4 September that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are the EU&rsquo;s interests.  I have been working very closely with Mr. Barnier and his team, as have officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s position is fully reflected in the negotiations.  We will continue to engage closely with them in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p> On the Irish-specific issues, the high-level dialogue between the UK and EU teams is making some headway.  Good progress has been made on the common travel area.  There is a common objective to protect the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and while some progress has been made on this, much more complex work is required.  In truth, when one looks at the Good Friday Agreement, in particular its North-South co-operation elements, the majority of those were written on the assumption, and in some cases refer directly to the assumption, that both North and South on the island of Ireland would be part of the same European Union in terms of the regulatory environment.  What people are beginning to understand is the complexity of full implementation of all of the elements of the Good Friday Agreement while at the same time accepting Brexit.</p> <p> I often give the example of an all-island approach on animal health.  That makes perfect sense when farmers north and south of the Border both operate to the same Common Agricultural Policy, the same cross-compliance obligations, the same protection of the environment and water courses, the same animal health regulations and the same inspection systems.  When Northern Ireland leaves the European Union and decides not to be part of the Common Agricultural Policy, or decides not to maintain equivalence with the Common Agricultural Policy, how do we in practice manage an all-island approach towards animal health in the case of, say, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease that may be just north of the Border but which certainly does not respect any physical border?  These are the kinds of practical issues, and there are many examples like that.  North-South co-operation works because there is a common regulatory model on both sides of the Border and it simply requires political co-operation to make it work in practice.  Once the regulatory environment changes on one side of the Border, it becomes much more complex.  That is why the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to which the British Government is absolutely committed, as are we, is actually much more complicated in practice in the context of Brexit than many people realise.</p> <p> This is all to ensure the full implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU are understood, including on important, tangible areas that affect daily lives on this island, such as the North-South co-operation to which I have just referred, which are the focus of pretty intense discussions currently.  In the last round of negotiations, which concluded on 31 August, the UK presented a paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  While the publication of this paper is welcome, the UK&rsquo;s aspirations and statements of principle need to be backed by substantive commitments by the UK and clear links to workable solutions.  The Government welcomes and supports the task force&rsquo;s paper, "Guiding principles for the Dialogue on Ireland-Northern Ireland", which was published on 7 September.  This paper builds on the European Council guidelines agreed earlier this year and reflects the priority Irish issues identified by the Government.  It also sets out the principles on which solutions have to be based.  The EU will now seek to agree these principles with the UK as a basis for the future discussions on the detailed solutions that are required.  We will continue to work closely with Mr. Barnier and his team to advance Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in this regard.</p> <p> Beyond the negotiating process, the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit will continue to be structured around five principal pillars: first, sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit; second, policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns and to strengthen competitiveness; third, prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected and threatened by Brexit, as has already been happening in the agrifood area; fourth, realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit and helping businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers that may be predicted or may arise; and fifth, making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support for the recognition that Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.</p><p>Policy decisions in support of these objectives will arise across a wide range of policy areas and will continue to fall within the direct responsibility of other Government colleagues, including the annual budgetary process, the forthcoming national planning framework 2040, the new ten-year national capital plan, the review of enterprise 2025 policy, and sectoral policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy.</p> <p> I encourage Members to engage directly with me if they want to, and I encourage them to be very much part of the forums to be set up.  We will have an all-island civic dialogue on Thursday.  We will have sectors meetings, which I know that some Members have been part of, and we will also have stakeholder updates to make sure people are informed.</p> <p> I will not behave in party political way on this issue. I hope that other Members will work with me in a constructive to try to find an outcome for Ireland that is workable in the context of a very complex environment.  I look forward to working with everybody in that regard.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il and I will work to hold the Minister to account where we do not believe the Government is doing enough.  We have every intention of working with the Minister, where we can, to try to get Ireland ready for Brexit and to turn it into an opportunity where possible.</p>  <p>  At the start of a new D&aacute;il term, with the German election just over and having heard Prime Minister May's speech in Florence, it is a good time for Ireland to step back and ask what is at stake for the country when it comes to Brexit.  I will touch on three issues.  First and foremost, jobs are at stake.  Ireland's small and medium enterprises, SMEs, export 40% of their goods and services to the UK.  Critically, those exports represent half of the export-related jobs in the State.  Ireland's SME sector exports only one tenth of our country's exports, because the multinational sector is so big, but it employs the same number of people.  There are as many jobs at risk from Brexit in our indigenous sector as are employed in the entire multinational arena in Ireland.  Certain sectors, obviously, are especially at risk, such as tourism, basic metals, textiles and more.  Agrifood is more exposed, as we know, than any other sector given that the beef and dairy areas are so closely linked to the UK market, east-west and North-South.  Major disruptions such as the WTO tariffs pose what many describe as an existential threat to those sectors.  Many jobs are at stake, particularly outside the main urban centres.  Brexit will hit rural Ireland harder than it will hit urban Ireland and it poses a higher risk for jobs there.</p>  <p>  Northern Ireland issues are also at stake.  Brexit is already pulling the people of Northern Ireland out of the European Union.  The EU identity is very important to both communities, but it is particularly important to the nationalist community.  They live within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, but as part of their identity they can say they are citizens and participants in the European Union.  A senior security officer in Northern Ireland recently gave me his opinion on the potential situation of the nationalist population being pulled out of the EU against its will, combined with the potential for a hard border.  While we will all work to make sure a hard border does not happen, should it happen at the same time that the nationalist community feels that it is being pulled out of the European Union, the community will feel that a fence is being built around them.  This, in the opinion of the security officer, poses a material threat to the peace process and could see a return to violence through the radicalisation of younger disaffected members of the nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We do not talk much about the funding for public services also being put at stake by Brexit.  How is Brexit linked to health care, housing and education in Ireland?  Obviously the &euro;62 billion of trade we do east-west and North-South, and the related jobs, creates very serious Exchequer revenues.  Brexit will affect that trade to some extent and it will affect Exchequer revenues.  At the same time, we will have to invest in infrastructure related to Brexit-proofing the State.  Both of these combined will put serious pressure on Exchequer revenues in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The referendum in the UK took place 15 months ago.  To give time for deliberation, the proposal needs to be in place in about 12 months' time.  To date, progress and negotiations have been slow.  I, and many people, expect the Commission to recommend that the EU does not move to the next phase of the negotiations until at least December, slowing down the process again.  Progress, however, is not just slow in Brussels.  I believe that progress has been far too slow in domestic preparations in getting Ireland ready for Brexit.  This is something that we can do.</p>  <p>  The Government and our diplomats deserve great credit for the diplomacy we have seen between Dublin and Brussels.  The common travel area is being accepted all around.  It is critically important and it may not have happened.  It is easy for us to say that we would always have got that - perhaps we would and perhaps we would not - but the Government deserves credit for putting it front and centre.</p>  <p>  Northern Ireland Issues have also been put front and centre.  Again, perhaps this would have happened anyway, and perhaps it would not, but certainly everything I have heard from Brussels, London and Dublin is that the Government and Ireland's diplomatic corps have done well in putting the interests of Ireland, including the common travel area, front and centre in the first phase of negotiations.  I want to recognise that fact.</p>  <p>  While the Government has done well in that respect, I believe it has failed in other critical areas.  East-west negotiations have been stressed, and I would say this is partly due to some unnecessarily bombastic proclamations by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, at press conferences.  I have been to London recently and they do not help.  Diplomacy means we need to work with our friends.  We need to have honest and tough conversations with them, but that sort of bombast is not useful.  I do not believe that North-South diplomacy has worked well.  We have been waiting since 2011 for a paper on reinvigorating the North-South institutions.  They have not been functioning but we still await that paper.  We must have a reinvigoration of the North-South and the east-west institutions as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning has not started yet, such as making sure there is a back-up energy legal framework should there be a disorderly exit.  The Minister confirmed in the Chamber last week that the committees were meeting for the first time this week.  It is 15 months since the Brexit vote.  It is not good enough that the committees are meeting only now, for the first time, for contingency planning.  I have previously said to the Minister, in the House and privately, that domestic work to support our industry has been lacking.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients but there are many more people who work in Ireland than Enterprise Ireland clients.  What is a company meant to do with a &euro;5,000 Brexit preparation grant?  With the threat facing the agrifood sector, Bord Bia was allowed to hire three people this year.  IDA Ireland was given permission to hire ten people.  At the start of 2017, it had hired one person and the Taoiseach has confirmed to me in the House that this figure has gone up to four.  This is not demonstrating a sense of urgency.  Ireland has great State agencies but they clearly are not operating on Brexit at the level they need to be.</p>  <p>  Nobody is engaging with farmers.  I attended the National Ploughing Championships last week.  I was there to ask farmers and their representatives what they were doing on Brexit, how are they getting ready, how the Government is engaging with them, what supports are being put in place and if the Government is helping farmers to think about the French, German, Austrian, Italian and Spanish markets.  It will take farmers several years to grow into those markets.  The answer, pretty much all around, was "No".</p>  <p>  The Government is not engaging with the tourism industry.</p><p>Tourist numbers are up, which is fantastic, but our biggest market by a country mile is the UK from which, as we all know, the figures are down.  No one is working with hoteliers and those running bed and breakfast accommodation or the tourism sector in Wicklow, Cork or elsewhere to say how we can start to prepare for this.  No one is working with the fishing industry.  I met members of the British Government approximately two weeks ago.  I put it to them that they were looking at taking some of their territorial waters back and, obviously, leaving the Common Fisheries Policy.  The answer was "Yes".  That poses an existential risk to our fishing industry as the Minister and I both know.  Nevertheless, if one asks people in the fishing industry if anyone is helping them start to get ready, the answer is "No".  No one is engaging with small and medium enterprises beyond what Enterprise Ireland is doing.  I put it to the Minister that it is not enough.  It is not that the time for words is over; there must be more words and diplomacy, but the time for action in our own domestic preparations for this must start.</p> <p> As we all know, Brexit is not happening on its own.  It is a threat from the east.  To the west, we have a protectionist USA and to the south east, we have the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, and all sorts of new things going on in Europe.  We face threats on multiple fronts at the same time.  I put it to the Minister that on Brexit, risk mitigation is not enough.  We need to use it as a catalyst to do something new.  In the early 1960s, Lemass and Whitaker worked together on the first programme for economic expansion, which has served all of us well for decades.  It has not all been perfect and some of our friends in the Chamber might say there have been problems with globalisation.  While I agree, it has worked well for us.  Now is the time for a second programme for economic expansion.  There is a great deal of talk about India and China, which is fine, but our product and service offering is ripe for Europe into which we have very low market penetration.</p> <p> If we are going to do this, we will need a national programme.  It is not enough to tinker around the edges.  The entire Government budget for Brexit this year was &euro;5 million.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants to discuss a brave programme for economic expansion, which acknowledges that while we have been well served by the Anglo-Saxon world for many years and will continue to work and trade with it, it is time for us to move beyond it.  That will require adaptation funding, the relaxation of State supports and the upgrading of capabilities across our sectors.  That is what Fianna F&aacute;il wants to see domestically in response to the threats from Brexit, the USA and some of what is happening in Europe.</p></speech>

It is a difficult position.  I have always commended the all-Ireland dialogue, which I have attended to date.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to do so on Thursday as I have other business in Jersey relating to the British-Irish Parliamentary Association.  That said, I note the lack of devolved government in the North.  It is my understanding from dealing with both community groups and the wider sector up there, that this particular dialogue was to be an all-Ireland dialogue.  A previous Taoiseach gave a commitment to take one of those dialogues to the North.  While I accept that some break-outs took place there, the voice of the people in the North of Ireland and their anxieties and concerns should be heard.  In the absence of devolved government, that voice has to come from us.  I suggest some mechanism be found to bring their views to the table.  They expressed them at the ballot box but it is important to note that they feel no one is listening to them.  While I accept that quite a number of people came from the North of Ireland from industry and large organisations, it is the people on the ground who are going to be affected in the fragile peace process alluded to by Deputy Donnelly.  I note also the position of the island communities.  I visited the island community of Rathlin.  Equally, there are island communities around this country who have not had an opportunity to have their say and who will be even more greatly affected than ourselves.</p>  <p>  That said, I want to record my view.  It is not necessarily Fianna F&aacute;il's view, in which regard it is time we had greater debate on this issue and what is happening.  Last Friday, Theresa May gave an historic speech in Florence where she informed the assembled media that the UK would stay in the Single Market and customs union until the middle of 2021.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has suggested it may even be beyond that.  That more or less ties the hand of the EU and puts a stay on Article 50, which would have seen the UK leave the EU in 2019 even if no agreements were in place.  That was the so-called "cliff-edge Brexit".  These is no doubt in my mind that Theresa May knew exactly what she was doing in stating the UK's intention not to leave the EU until mid-2021.  She picked that date because it coincides with her obligation to have an election before 6 May 2021.  What she did in Florence was to guarantee that the British electorate will have a ballot-box decision before any changes happen in the UK's working relationship with the EU.  In my reading of it, that is a seismic change in the political landscape.</p>  <p>  If May has changed the whole ball game, we in Ireland can change our approach and strategy also.  I have said before that it should not be called "Brexit" but rather "Fixit".  Even now, there is an emerging opinion in the UK that they may not leave the EU.  In my opinion that view is gathering momentum.  I have said it and on my head be it.  For some inexplicable reason, Irish politicians do not feel comfortable making statements like "Brexit is not going to happen".  There is a misplaced political decorum that makes us feel we cannot be seen to interfere in British politics.  It is absurd to persist with such a stance.  By voting to leave the EU, the British shot both themselves and us in the foot.  The vote could wreck all the good work achieved in our fragile peace process.  I know that and so do the Border Deputies.  Nevertheless, we stand by and engage in the niceties with our British counterparts.</p>  <p>  What has happened was inevitable and should have been Theresa May's position years ago.  It is at last a solid affirmation that leaving the EU will not be the walk in the park the Leave campaign dishonestly peddled.  Unfortunately, her speech made no advancement in terms of outlining a vision for a final deal nor what the unique solution for Ireland will look like despite the fact that there is barely a year to go before a ratification process.  The invisible border is not an open one.  The one and only way to avoid a hard border is by staying in the customs union.  Another solution may be for Northern Ireland to remain in the Single Market or in the EU or both.  This would be difficult to deal with under world trading rules, but all of these ideas deserve exploration.  Everyone agrees the common travel area must be maintained, but preparation needs to be made now and as a matter of urgency.  We need clarity on what leaving the customs union means for trade.  The Good Friday Agreement and the many strands associated with it, to which the Minister referred, could be used as a mechanism to reach a successful conclusion for all, in particular having regard to our trading issues.</p>  <p>  I note that 98% of businesses are not prepared for Brexit despite the fact that moneys are being offered.  Even the major consulting firms are struggling to sell their advisory work.  If that is happening, there are a large number of people out there who believe it is a "Fixit" that is needed.  We need to get real in that regard.</p></speech>

Certainly, there was a view across the board that David Cameron would deliver on his proposals.  He failed to deliver and is a man of the past.  Last week, there was a significant build-up to Theresa May's speech in Florence.  While the speech was loaded with rhetoric, it seemed very short on specific detail.</p><p>That is frustrating and difficult for anyone trying to follow what direction Britain will go in this regard.  It did not reassure and, more importantly, did not address any of the issues facing Ireland.  This is hardly surprising considering the British Government has consistently failed to address the key issues of avoiding a border, citizens&rsquo; rights and protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  No matter what angle one comes from, it is clear Brexit is bad for Ireland.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland, its people and its economy, North and South.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in's position is crystal clear.  The entire island of Ireland must remain within the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement must be protected in all of its parts by the British and Irish Governments, as well as by the European Union.  We believe, as does the House, that this can be achieved through a special designated status for the North in the European Union.</p> <p> The threat to the Good Friday Agreement can be also averted if it is incorporated in full in a protocol in the British withdrawal agreement.  I urge the Minister to examine this as a possible solution.  There are solutions to many of the challenges facing us but imagination is needed.  I am not sure if that imagination and those solutions will come from Europe.  Many of them will have to come from ourselves.  We are the ones who will have to step up to the plate with those proposals.  It is clear little progress has been made in preventing the return of an economic border on the island.  It is imperative to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.</p> <p> It is a concern that the Government, the EU and Britain are now all talking about avoiding a physical border on the island rather than avoiding border checks of any kind.  Border checkpoints of any kind on the island, be they of goods, services or passports, must not be countenanced in any way.  To build peace in Ireland, we need to remove borders, both physical and psychological.  The Taoiseach must be prepared to use the Government&rsquo;s EU veto against moving on to the trade talks unless the British Government comes up with detailed plans to protect the previously negotiated agreements and ensures there is no EU frontier across the island of Ireland.</p> <p> Brexit will affect the whole of Ireland, not just the North.  It will have a negative effect on companies in Ireland which export to Britain, but also on those which use Britain as a land bridge to ensure their products can reach other EU countries.  We need not just to look at the percentage of our exports to Britain but also the volume.  Mention has been made recently of the figures of 15% and 36% in this regard.  Many of our exports to Britain come from labour-intensive industries.  If they are lost, it will have a significant impact on jobs and local economies.  To adequately respond to Brexit challenges, the Government also needs to update infrastructure, particularly roads and ports, and other significant capital spending.  Again, there seems to be no preplanning on this.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the EU fiscal treaty which imposed harsh fiscal rules on EU countries.  It is clear that to adequately respond to the challenges of Brexit, Ireland needs a derogation from the fiscal rules.  The Minister must urgently seek as a priority the relaxation of the fiscal rules for Ireland.  We need to start articulating this position loudly and clearly across Europe.</p> <p> Yesterday, I attended a meeting of Committee A of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which deals with sovereign matters of relevance for both Britain and Ireland.  Again, the committee examined Brexit.  The Norwegian ambassador to Ireland gave some interesting insights into Norway's imaginative and unique border arrangements with Sweden and Russia.  She spoke of customs co-operation and travel arrangements.  However, the clear evidence is that Norway is not Ireland.  While we can examine all sorts of arrangements, Ireland is not Norway.</p> <p> One theme coming from these meetings we are attending is that there is a complete lack of any preparation by British and Irish companies, and more worryingly by both Governments, on the challenges facing us with Brexit.  I know my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues will discuss the threat to rural Ireland from Brexit later.  However, they are significant and the Government must be more proactive in protecting and supporting rural communities.  The point was made yesterday that Brexit may not impact the east coast, but the further west one goes, the more difficulties people will face.</p> <p> One concern to me about Brexit is the serious threat it poses for health care provision on this island.  We all know partition has been a disaster for this island, not least in the area of health care.  It makes no sense to have two different health care systems on this island.  Instead, we should have one truly public Irish national health service.  It should be a service to provide health care on the basis of need, not on who one is, where one lives or how much money one earns.  It must be a system funded by progressive taxation.  There was a hope the Good Friday Agreement would help develop the whole area of health care with huge strides.  That, however, has not happened.  The majority of people across Ireland realise health care must be developed on an all-Ireland basis.  The growth of shared services is an acknowledgement that it makes sense to operate health care on an all-Ireland basis.  The success of shared services to date is living proof of that.  However, Brexit could derail all of this positive progress.  Brexit means that not only our current shared services are under threat but future services are too, as well as being reliant on negotiations.  We have worked too hard improving such co-operation and services to let a Tory British Government fixated on privatising health care derail all of this and cripple the potential of improving public health provision on this island.  Protecting our health services from Brexit and building a truly public all-Ireland health service should be a priority.</p> <p> We must also look at major reform of the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in remains deeply critical of the EU and the direction it has taken.  We know many people are critical of the EU, which is expressing itself in various ways, not all positive, and in elections across Europe.  The Europe we want to see would be more democratic, demilitarised and a peaceful Union which would embrace economic and social justice, international solidarity while working to end poverty.  However, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, recently outlined the solution to these issues facing the EU, stating we should just carry on doing the same, only faster with less democratic oversight.  He wants a new EU president, EU finance minister and an EU army.  Inexplicably, no one, except an unknown source in Iveagh House, offered any comment on this disturbing and alarming speech.  Several countries spoke up but there was a lack of leadership from Ireland.  If the EU follows this path, it is heading towards a cliff and inevitable breakup.  It will throw a lifeline towards the far right across Europe, which is already growing at an alarming rate in some countries.  While Juncker&rsquo;s European model might be shared by some of the elites in Europe, it will inevitably lead to the breakup of the European Union and a realignment of European politics as we know it.</p></speech>

It is common knowledge that some of the weakest economies on the island are along the Border and, therefore, require the most protection against the negative impacts of Brexit.  I told Mr. Verhofstadt of the palpable fear held by so many that certain sectors, particularly the agrifood sector, will be significantly reduced and jobs lost without solid economic supports.</p>  <p>  Their fears are not unreasonable.  Agrifood sector exports were an estimated &euro;570 million less than they would have been in 2016 as a result of the weakening sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p><p>I asked him if, in solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, the EU would respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises.  His answer was vague, to say the least.  It is on the record of the meeting of the joint committees, which was chaired by the Ceann Comhairle.  It will come as no comfort to those who fear their jobs could be lost in the future.<br/><br/>The ramifications of the Brexit vote are also being felt by local businesses in the Border area as a result of the euro-sterling exchange rate.  Sterling has been down 15% to 20% against the euro since last year&rsquo;s referendum.  The weak pound is driving shoppers north of the Border in search of cheaper prices and this has been to the detriment of local retailers and businesses.  That is not unique to Cavan and Monaghan and I am sure my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, will be able to confirm it from the Louth perspective.  A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>reported a car dealer north of the Border saying that there has been an 18% increase in used car sales to customers from the South.  This is another indication of the trend and the traffic.<br/><br/>The disastrous consequences of Britain&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU are limitless.  It is important to recognise that its impact is already being felt in Border communities.  Certainly, the future ramifications are stark.  However, I believe it is incumbent on the Government to push for EU assistance and supports for Irish enterprises that are already struggling.  If we wait until after the conclusion of negotiations, as Mr. Verhofstadt appeared to indicate last week, and then examine the situation that is presented, many of these businesses will already have gone.  Theresa May&rsquo;s speech in Florence last week came as no comfort and confirmed that the British Government does not have any solutions to the issues affecting Ireland as a result of Britain's decision to leave the EU.  In that context, the Government should not allow the Brexit negotiations to move to the next phase.  We must hammer this down, step by step.<br/><br/>It has been said time and again that Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and the rights of Irish citizens in the North.  It will undermine our economy and is already doing so.  It is worrying to note that the narrative has now changed to talk about avoiding a &quot;physical border&quot; as opposed to avoiding border checks of any kind.  Sinn F&eacute;in has provided solutions.  We have consistently called for the North to be given special designated status within the EU.  We are also calling for the Good Friday Agreement to be inserted as a protocol in the final withdrawal agreement.  This would provide legal protection for the agreement, which was so hard won.  The effort to implement the agreement in its entirety has been strenuously and eagerly pursued over the almost 20 years since it was signed.<br/><br/>None of this will be achieved if the Taoiseach and the Government do not up the ante.  They have a responsibility to stand up for the interests of Irish citizens.  The Taoiseach must harness European and Irish support, stand up for Ireland and argue for designated status for the North within the EU.  I commend such an approach to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600042#PP00200"><p>It is evident that there is a new sacred cow in Irish politics.  The traditional sacred cow of the establishment has been our corporation tax rate.  It could not be touched and was the cornerstone of anything good that happened in this country.  The new sacred cow is the received wisdom among the political parties and political commentators that Brexit, by definition, is a bad thing for people in Britain and for ordinary people in this country.  I do not accept that received wisdom.  I certainly believe it could be a bad thing.  The Brexit Theresa May has in mind - a so-called bargain basement Brexit - would be disastrous from the point of view of ordinary workers in Britain and in this country, particularly if the Government responds as it appears to be responding.  However, I do not accept that this is predetermined or that there is no alternative exit possible.  I refer, for example, to a left-style exit that could open the door to a serious discussion in Europe about what type of Europe we want and that could assist in a struggle for a different, socialist Europe that would put the interests of working people first.</p>  <p>  In order to have a real discussion about Brexit, there must be clarity on what the European Union is and on the European Union British people voted to leave.  One would get the impression from many of the discussions in this Chamber that it is a land of milk and honey, peace, prosperity, democracy, human rights and so forth.  That is very far from the truth.  The European Union is an undemocratic land of authoritarian neoliberalism, war, militarisation and misery for millions of people in crisis.  It is racked by substantial crises.  It is worth noting the events of last weekend.  Many within the establishments across Europe breathed a sigh of relief when Emmanuel Macron was elected President of France.  They thought that by dressing up neoliberalism in new suits and socks the collapse of the extreme centre had been stemmed.  However, that illusion has been contradicted sharply by reality.  Last Saturday, 150,000 people were on the streets of Paris to oppose Emmanuel Macron undemocratically pushing through his so-called labour reforms by decree, which will pave the way for zero-hour contracts and a complete decline in working conditions in France.  He has the lowest opinion ratings in history at this stage in his presidency.  They are lower than those of Donald Trump.  The movement against Macron and the rise of M&eacute;lenchon's La France Insoumise are the positive side of the crisis, the left expression of the crisis of the extreme centre in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The other negative and frightening side was also on show last weekend in Germany with the entry into parliament of Alternative for Germany, AfD, as the third party, with 94 members of parliament and 6 million votes.  It is the first party of the far right to enter the German Bundestag in over 50 years.  The basis for that rise was laid in the austerity imposed - before anybody else in the European Union was talking about austerity - in the form of the Hartz IV laws introduced by a Gerhard Schr&ouml;der-led SPD government and the propaganda campaign of the German establishment and large elements of the media blaming lazy Greeks for what were actually bailouts of German banks.  We stand with those who are mobilising now against the scapegoating of refugees, racism and AfD.</p>  <p>  Those events more accurately characterise the EU than the image people have of it.  It is fundamentally undemocratic, as was seen in the soft coups against the Italian and Greek governments and when it acted with an imperialist character against countries internally, such as Greece, and in terms of its so-called trade partners, with economic partnership agreements in Africa.  It is also racist.  The fortress Europe policies have turned the Mediterranean into Trump's border wall and a graveyard for refugees.</p>  <p>  The direction of travel is further in that direction.  Emmanuel Macron made a speech a couple of hours ago in which he spoke about accelerating the rhythm and said that no country should be excluded but no country should block.  That is in line with Jean-Claude Juncker's state of the Union speech in the European Parliament.  They have a definite idea, post-Brexit, of going further in terms of militarisation, with the establishment of permanent military headquarters and moving towards a security and defence union, and moving further in terms of economic integration, with Emmanuel Macron referring to a strong common budget at the heart of Europe.  That is the Europe people in Britain voted to leave.</p>  <p>  The real question is not about whether it will be a hard or soft Brexit but whether it will be a right-wing or left-wing Brexit.  That is not predetermined.  Consider the election results for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party.  It almost won the British general election.  He could win a future election, which could occur at any time.</p><p>If he is not sabotaged by the Blairites in the Labour Party who want to turn back the clock on the changes that have taken place and the struggle inside the Labour Party, he has the possibility of implementing a left-wing Brexit.  What would that look like?  Speaking on the &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot; at the weekend, Mr. Corbyn stated:</p><blockquote>We need to look very carefully at the terms of any trade relationship because at the moment we are part of the Single Market, obviously.  That has within it restrictions on state aid and state spending.  That has pressures on it, through the European Union, to privatise rail, for example, and other services.  I think we need to be quite careful about the powers we need as national governments. </blockquote><p>This statement hits the nail on the head.  If we want to implement left-wing policies and, for example, build homes with the money in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and National Asset Management Agency, we have to break the fiscal rules.  If we want to nationalise industry, which will be necessary if we are to turn the economy on a different basis, we have to break the rules.  If we want to invest in public services, we have to break the rules of the entire fiscal straightjacket imposed by the European Union.  Such an exit, in which workers' needs are put first, would create the best possible basis for resolving the issues that present on this island.  This means having no hard border and defending the right of people to free movement. <br/><br/>It is vital that workers feature in this discussion.  We hear IBEC, ISME and all the rest clamouring for wage cuts and attacks on workers' rights to place the burden of Brexit on workers.  Workers should come together across Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England in a conference of trade unions to discuss a response to these issues.  <br/><br/>A key question is what will be the response in the event of a Theresa May or bargain basement Brexit.  The response of the Government is to build a deeper basement and engage in a deeper race to the bottom, which goes nowhere.  Instead, we need the opposite response, a socialist industrial policy based on public ownership and massive public investment.  This is precisely what is ruled out by the European Union rules.  It is precisely why change will not come from the EU and why we need a different, socialist Europe.</p></speech>

We are always in danger of doing precisely that on a whole range of issues and certainly on the issue of Brexit.  We will try to focus on issues that I fully accept are very important for the many who are affected and the economy.  However, we look at them in a narrowly empirical and technical way instead of understanding that what we are faced with in Europe is a very serious political crisis, one which flows from an economic and social crisis in Europe as a whole.  This fact was recognised to a certain extent at the time of the Brexit referendum when there was an acknowledgement that Europe should look to itself.  It has since gone out the window, however, and we have entered a game of politics.  Theresa May is playing politics, as is the European Union, and it is now all about the mood music.  The question is whether Theresa May said something in Florence that was different from what she said in her previous speech, whether Michel Barnier's speech was slightly different from Guy Verhofstadt's speech or whether there has there been a slight change in tone.  It is, therefore, a case of playing politics.</p>  <p>  Not only does it not make sense to have a hard border between North and South or east and west between this country and Britain, it does not make sense for anybody.  It does not make sense for Britain or Europe to have tariff barriers between them and it does not make sense to have such barriers on the North-South axis.  I am sufficiently optimistic to believe, notwithstanding the politics and politicking that is taking place, that even business interests understand that this is not a sensible proposition. </p>  <p>  A previous speaker stated that consultancy firms are not getting a great take-up for advice on how to deal with Brexit.  The point, however, is that we do not know what Brexit is because it will be decided by politics.  We should, therefore, think a little about the deeper politics of the issue.  As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, the deeper politics of it are becoming very alarming against the background of the election result in Germany at the weekend.  In the bastion of stability and economic success, the model and anchor of the European Union, the fascists and Nazis have entered parliament, taking 13% of the vote and almost 100 seats.  This is part of a wider wave of growth for openly fascist, neo-Nazi, far right nationalist political forces across Europe and beyond and it is a development that should worry us. </p>  <p>  There are a number of ways to deal with this development.  One is to bend to these forces and their vile, racist, Islamophobic rhetoric which tries to explain away economic and social problems by scapegoating vulnerable people and minority groups.  I will give credit to the political establishment in Ireland on one point.  Notwithstanding all of our differences, from the centre right to the radical left and pretty much everything in between - certainly in terms of those represented in the Oireachtas - we are a bright light in that none of us has bought into this racist nonsense.  I am very glad of that and we must maintain that position and refuse to capitulate to this nonsense.  We also need to go a little further and ask why this obnoxious stuff is rising.  There is a direct correlation between the rise of racist, extreme right, nationalist forces in Britain, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Sweden, and any other country one wishes to name, and deprivation, unemployment and poverty.  These are the common denominators that are all increasing as a result of the austerity policies pursued by the European Union and the Tories in Britain.</p></speech>

The areas where the far right has grown are the poorest parts of east Germany where services have been cut, unemployment is higher, de-industrialisation has taken place and jobs have been lost.  That is where the far right grew.</p>  <p>  There are 14 million people unemployed in the eurozone and 18 million unemployed in the wider European Union, with the figure having increased by 100,000 in recent months.  Across Europe, 27% of children are living in households classified as poor.  More than one third of the populations in Bulgaria, Romania and Greece are suffering from social exclusion, while one in three Spaniards is living on an income of less than &euro;8,000 per annum.  I will not cite all the statistics.  In Britain, the areas where the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and Brexit received a high proportion of the vote were those that had been devastated by Tory neoliberal and austerity policies.</p></speech>

The problem is that if we do not recognise what people are feeling, they will look for nastier alternatives.  If we state clearly, however, that the problems of inequality, poverty, deprivation and the growing gap between rich and poor need to be addressed and if we identify what policies created these problems in the first place, we can win over the allegiance of people who are alienated and disenfranchised and who, in desperation, look to far right forces.</p>  <p>  Only 33% of the people who voted for the Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland - the Nazis - said they supported AFD policies, with 66% stating their vote was a kick against the establishment.  Why did these voters want to kick against the establishment?  Was it because the establishment is serving their interests so well or was it because it is letting them down badly while pretending everything is fine and Germany is a rock of stability and sense?  It is not the case that people are stirred up by populists, as the German Government would suggest, but that they are experiencing real problems of alienation, anger, deprivation and high levels of unemployment.  Unless we recognise that Europe has failed to deal with these problems, the frightening growth of far right, nationalist and, God help us, openly neo-Nazi forces will continue.</p></speech>

For those of us who live in rural Ireland, the deal that is ultimately reached will be vital.  From speaking to the news addicts around the country who watch "Six One" or the news at 9 p.m., I have noticed that they are getting tired of hearing day in, day out - like a boat rocking on the sea - about something happening with Brexit today and something different happening tomorrow.  It is like taking one step forward and two steps back.  People are fatigued listening to this debate.  It seems to be playing out in the open.  It is like two boxers who talk about beating each other up before their fight begins, but the real horse trading has to start when they knuckle down.</p>  <p>  Sometimes, I listen to comments from both sides - not just one side - that I would class as unhelpful.  One side claims that the other does not seem to have an idea about what it is doing and the other side throws the same snowball back.  While all of that might be down to tactics and trying to get the upper hand, people are getting fed up with it.  That is not a good thing in light of the fact that Brexit is of the utmost importance to our people and our country.</p>  <p>  In fairness, the Government has been involved in talks behind the scenes.  That is welcome.  Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, who spoke in the D&aacute;il Chamber last week, went to Monaghan to see the Border where cows were eating grass.  When he referred to how he stood with one foot in Northern Ireland and the other in the South, he asked how the cow would know.  The cow would not know for sure.</p></speech>

I have listened to the UK saying the same.  I welcome some of what Prime Minister May said a few days ago.  However, what I cannot understand is, if we are the cherished child and such a special case, why they do not eliminate this side of it and settle on Ireland because of the Good Friday Agreement, which is important, the trade between the UK and Ireland and how we have become intertwined down the years.  We might have fought the UK for a long time, but we still export a great deal to it.  That is especially the case for rural Ireland, be it in terms of milk, beef, sheep, poultry, pigs or whatever.  We are intertwined in terms of our exports and imports.</p>  <p>  People are holding us up as the trophy kid and we are caught in an awkward situation.  Everyone knows that this is one country with an invisible line.  We will be back where we were years ago trying to get stuff across fields in the middle of the night.  That should not happen.  If the UK wants to have that relationship with Ireland and the EU believes that we are so special, the first step should be for everyone to recognise the Good Friday Agreement, to keep it in place and to ensure all trade between the UK and Ireland regardless of the outcome for those countries that are not on islands and are a bloc away.  If we are to believe what is being said by both sides, then that appears to be the part on which there is agreement.  Why, therefore, do we not nail it down?</p>  <p>  We must put it up to Europe.  When this deal is finished in 2019 and there is a lead-in period or whatever, the Irish people deserve a say on it.  If matters do not work out as they must, we cannot afford to have a border or not to trade with the UK.  We may have more exports to Europe and the rest of the world in money terms, but tonnage creates the most jobs in rural areas.  It is vital that we stand up.  I worry about the idea of a majority vote on the deal, which is the direction that the EU seems to be going in order to leave the troublesome kid behind so that it does not have to listen to us.</p>  <p>  It is not helpful that the group in Europe with which the Minister's party if affiliated, the European People's Party, EPP, has stated in recent weeks that reform of the CAP budget should be put off until 2023 because we do not know where we are going.  The EPP also stated that we did not know what commitments needed to be made to the so-called new European army that has been envisaged.  This is not a helpful message to be sending out.  As a member of a party that has Irish representatives in the EPP, will the Minister quell this talk once and for all?</p>  <p>  People can reflect and ask why all of this happened.  In my opinion, Europe lost the run of itself.  When we joined the EU and traded goods, it was a great thing, but it basically went from that to trying to own people.  When we were in trouble, we saw who our friends were.  The UK and other countries gave us money, but a gun was essentially put to our heads by the same so-called friends that we have today.  If a dog bites once, people should always be wary of it.  We need to be wary of all of the nice, fancy talk that we are hearing.</p>  <p>  Were Europe good to Ireland, it would do a deal to give us a special rate on our debt.  I am not saying that we should not repay it because that debate is over.  Rather, we should get a special rate over, for example, 100 years.  That would help us, particularly in light of the current uncertainty.  Our repayments would be reduced and we would be repaying both the principal and the interest.  I put this suggestion to the Department of Finance during the Government formation talks.  It would give us room to deliver on housing needs, which Deputy Boyd Barrett and others know is crucial, and hospital services around the country.  These two issues are pulling the country down.  We would have money or fiscal space while staying within the so-called fiscal rules to which we signed up.</p>  <p>  I listened to last week's speeches from the EU claiming that everything was hunky-dory in the garden again, we had gone through a tough period and everyone was back to believing that we were the greatest thing since sliced pan.  While polls might show the case to be different in many countries, we could get a different answer if we spoke to people on the ground.  Some good things were done, but if a parent punishes a child badly enough, the child will not like it and there will be resentment.  I see it on the ground.  Perhaps the west coast has more resentment but, from speaking to people, opinions waver.</p><p> The EU thinks it has ridden the wave and that it is away again and can do what it likes.  It might have a lot of different stuff coming at it.  There is one thing the Minister has fought for and always stood up for.  If the EU thinks it will control our tax system and if it goes and takes what we are doing away, the game will be up for us.  We will have a decision to make then.  Every country should have control over what it does.  Let us argue about the rates and what we do.  Why do we need a D&aacute;il if the EU starts trying to control everything?  I worry about that coming down the road.  I know the Minister is doing his best out there and I am not criticising him in any way.  The smaller countries or the countries that were branded the PIGS at one stage need to stick together and not let the bigger boys in the class do what they want.  When one looks at television and sees Macron and Merkel in Italy, it is obvious that they think they control the whole show.  That is not good and people start resenting it.  The electorate in Germany went to the polls and said they would give them a bit of a shock but not because they liked someone else.  That will happen in other countries.  We need to ensure that we get a few countries that will work with us.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to address the situation with the CAP because it is worrying.  It is a statement that was made and a proposal.  The uncertainty for the farming community needs to end.  Ultimately, the farming community relies a great deal on CAP.  It is our own money we are dealing with.  We are now paying more to the EU than what we get.  Let us not be the beggars who go with the bowl.  It is our own stuff we are sending in.  As a result of the uncertainty in that and in light of Brexit, clarification is needed.  I also encourage the people who are doing the negotiation to sit down and start talking and not to play it out in the media every five minutes or by means of tweeting.  If they are in tough negotiations, it should be man to man or woman to woman, whatever way it will be played out.  It is not helpful because sometimes someone will say the wrong thing and it could put the whole process back, which is not helpful to anybody.</p></speech>

We had our guest speaker here last week to address Members of both Houses in this Chamber at a meeting chaired by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  We all welcome the Taoiseach's request to Prime Minister May that the UK urgently clarify what approach it is seeking to adopt regarding Northern Ireland.  It is beyond time that we had this clarification and certainty about what is happening.  The British cannot have their cake and eat it.  They have decided by majority to leave, so they need to think of the consequences for their nearest neighbour.  We might not always have been their dearest neighbour but we are their nearest.  We need to have that respected and acknowledged.  The former Taoiseach made great political capital out of his relationship with Europe.  Now is the time that we need those in Europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with us.</p>  <p>  The EU, through the work of its chief negotiator, has made it absolutely clear that the work of resolving the so-called Irish question falls to the UK.  That is not so.  It is a case of them and us - Europe and the UK.  We cannot leave it to one or the other.  I am delighted by what the Taoiseach said to Prime Minister May.  We have to ensure that Europe sees to it that we are not innocent bystanders or bridesmaids at a wedding when the wine runs out and there is no one to make any more.  It will be all water.  We will have no wine, as happened at the feast at Cana.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has stated that among the key issues that need to be addressed are those which will ensure that the interlocking political institutions on the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, established by the Good Friday Agreement, continue to operate.  That is vital because the Good Friday Agreement is in enough peril without being undermined further.  It is very important that co-operation, in particular North-South co-operation, is protected across all relevant sectors.  It has to be.  We cannot have a situation whereby there is any semblance of a border.  We were promised seamless borders.  I put the question to our guest last week about the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It was built with EU money in recent years.  They can tell us they have a seamless border.  How has this been built in the past three or four years?  It is a fortress.  The queues of buses, cars and trucks at that border go back for nearly half a mile.  I was on a bus and every passport was taken and checked.  That cannot be allowed to happen here.  I cannot see how they are saying it will not happen on this side of Europe when it is happening on the other every minute of every day.</p>  <p>  A full account must be taken of the right of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves as British or Irish, or both.  I would prefer both.  We might see a change to the dynamic there at some stage but not for the foreseeable future.  The European Commission also says that in light of Ireland&rsquo;s unique situation in the Brexit negotiations, a unique solution is required.  It is time now, as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, to get down to serious negotiations.  It is also time that we got engagement, rather than rhetoric, sound bites and spin.  We need to know for certain.  This is all well and good but, unfortunately, what we are increasingly witnessing is a hostile negotiating battle between the UK and the EU.  That appears to be more about political egos than getting a deal that would be to the best advantage of us all.  It is very true.  We have had too much.  I said it last week to our European guest, an MEP whose name eludes me.  It was Mr. Guy-----</p></speech>

We went on to say last week that we had gotten a few little wallops, as the former Taoiseach said one time.  I said it was more like a kick he got.  He sustained that wallop.  T&aacute; s&eacute; imithe anois.  He is gone off into the sunset.  Our own man I am talking about now - the man from Mayo.  I thought the curse on the football team might have gone with him but, unfortunately, it is still hanging over them.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile. </p>  <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt spoke about how other countries held votes recently, how their electorates had sent a warning message and how they will be listened to more.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go mbeadh a b&eacute;al d&uacute;nta agus a cluasa ag &eacute;isteacht, but I do not know about that.  Look at what happened in Germany.  People are angry about what is going on and about the diktats from the EU.  Many Irish people are also angry.  We all meet them on a daily basis and they scratch their heads and ask if the British were right.  That is out there and the Minister must be aware of it too because he does not live in a cave.  Those in Europe are not able to deal with the ordinary nuances, worries and issues of member states such as Ireland.  This is a huge problem.  They need to be able to listen and engage.  They must be able to rectify that and put robust systems in place.  They have to deal with all eventualities, seamless or steamless or whatever kind of a border it will be.  By hell, we do not want to go back.  I remember it when I was courting in Northern Ireland-----</p></speech>

I hope that following the debate, colleagues across the D&aacute;il will be in a position to support it to ensure it is passed through the House and acted upon by the Government.</p><p>I wish to outline my reasons for tabling tonight's motion.  It is primarily to ensure that a number of people who are currently excluded from funding support to deal with the aftermath of the funding can be included in the funding schemes.  It is also to ensure that some of the delays in rolling out those schemes in response to the flooding in Inishowen are not repeated in the future and that lessons can be learned from that.</p><p>Our thoughts continue to be with those who were affected by the flooding which happened this day five weeks ago on 22 August.  It primarily affected the Inishowen Peninsula.  Although it was a significant event in other parts of the county and other parts of the country, Met &Eacute;ireann recorded 8 cm of rainfall over a 24-hour period, the vast majority of that in a three to four-hour period in the Inishowen Peninsula.  Also badly affected were the neighbouring counties of Derry and Tyrone.  From a Republic of Ireland perspective, it particularly affected Inishowen.</p><p>On that night many home owners had their homes flooded by water, their possessions destroyed and their homes terribly damaged.  Businesses were likewise flooded with their contents destroyed and people's livelihoods put under threat.  Likewise many sporting and other voluntary community organisations also suffered significant damage.  Many in the farming community experienced loss of stock, and damage to land, farm equipment and crops.</p><p>The level of damage was highlighted by a survey carried out by Donegal County Council which showed that over 100 bridges were either washed away or significantly damaged.  In total, between bridges and roads over 600 points of damage need to be remedied.  There was tremendous destruction in a relatively small part of the country.  The bill for infrastructure and the roads is estimated at &euro;15 million according to the survey carried out by Donegal County Council.</p><p>In response to that unprecedented flooding, I acknowledge the tremendous effort by members of local communities who had to get out there, roll up their sleeves and come to the aid of their neighbours.  With the unprecedented level of the destruction and many different flashpoints, local communities and neighbours really came to the aid of those in distress.  I also acknowledge the tremendous work by the emergency services on the night, including the fire brigade, Coast Guard and Donegal County Council staff, in responding to the situation they found.  We are thankful that no lives were lost or injuries experienced as a result of the many dangerous situations that unfolded following the tremendous rainfall.</p><p>I acknowledge the tremendous work in the aftermath of the flooding in the days that followed by county council workers in trying to get roads and bridges reopened.  They really answered the call of duty in a tremendous way.  Tremendous work was done to get the peninsula moving and get routes reopened as quickly as possible.  I also acknowledge the contribution of the Army in the days that followed and the emergency services on a continuing basis.  I also acknowledge the water staff in Donegal County Council and also the members of the local community who fundraised and set up depots for furniture and for equipment to assist home owners.</p><p>I also acknowledge the work of the Irish Red Cross in administering the fund that was established and also the social welfare staff for their work in dealing with those who found themselves out of a home.  I also acknowledge the many political representatives from Government and from all parties who came to the peninsula, including Deputy Eugene Murphy along with our party leader, the Taoiseach, various Ministers and representatives from other parties who came to view the damage in the days that followed.  I acknowledge the commitments made regarding funding and I stress the importance of those being continued and followed through.</p><p>We need to learn lessons from the experience of how the event was handled.  The motion focuses on two aspects, one relating to the speed with which the various funding assistances and schemes were rolled out and the unnecessary delays that were experienced with them.  We need to learn from that and address those issues.  The other key aspect of our motion, which I hope will be passed, deals with those people who were excluded from those schemes and calls on the Government to follow through and actually provide funding to those people.</p><p>There was a two-day delay in getting the humanitarian assistance fund to support home owners who lost their homes up and running.  In future it is crucial that such a fund is in place and ready to be rolled out immediately.  When the flood descends and people find themselves without their homes it is crucial that the structures are in place to allow them to get immediate assistance.  There was a two-day delay, which is significant when people lose their homes.</p><p>The fund administered by the Irish Red Cross, which has a cap of &euro;20,000, was in place to provide financial assistance to sporting organisations, voluntary bodies and businesses.  It took a week before the Government confirmed that that fund would be put in place.</p><p>It was a further three days after that - a full ten days after the flooding happened - before application forms were available to businesses, sporting organisations and community groups to apply for the funding.  The fund provides for an immediate allocation of up to &euro;5,000 for those affected and on further application up to &euro;20,000.  However, it was a week before it was announced that a fund of &euro;2 million would be provided, and it was a further two to three days before application forms were available.</p> <p> One business in particular comes to mind among many that were affected.  It was a carpeting and flooring business in Burnfoot which was flooded on the night in question.  That is the type of business one would usually expect to benefit from such a situation as people would need to renovate their homes as a result of flood damage, yet the business in question lost all its stock in the flooding and it did not have insurance because of its proximity to the river going through the town.  It was ten days before an application form was available to apply for support to restock.  Other businesses and sporting organisations had similar experiences.</p> <p> The motion calls for a funding commitment from the Government to assist sporting organisations that suffered significant damage over and above what can be covered by the Red Cross fund which has a cap of &euro;20,000.  Cockhill Celtic soccer club in Buncrana lost two soccer pitches.  The pitches were completely wiped out and will have to be relaid.  The projected cost is more than &euro;100,000 and we still do not have a funding commitment to support the club five weeks after the flooding incident.</p> <p> The other key sector which was affected is the agriculture sector.  It was two weeks before it was announced that support would be available and it took three weeks for the Government to make application forms available for the relevant fund.  The closing date for applications by the farming community is this weekend.  It is estimated that up to 300 farms experienced significant damage but they still have not received funding.  The motion calls for the terms of reference of the agricultural support scheme to be extended to include certain sections of the farming community that are excluded.  I refer, for example, to those who lost grain crops, potato crops or second-cut silage as a result of the flooding.  In addition, there was damage to farm roads.  One farmer, for example, lost more than 40 acres of barley, yet is entirely excluded from the scheme.</p> <p> I hope that over the course of this two-hour debate those issues will be properly teased out, that lessons will be learned, this motion will be passed and we will see the Government follow through in terms of extending the various funding schemes I have outlined to ensure that nobody is left behind and that in their time of need the political system will ensure all those affected get the assistance required to get back on their feet and get back to normal life.</p></speech>

As Deputy McConalogue said, I visited Donegal with the party leader and I never saw such devastation and appalling damage in my life.  I heard Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and others speak on the radio about how bad things were and how badly people were affected.  I also heard the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, speak about the flooding but it is only when one goes to the Inishowen Peninsula and one sees the utter devastation that one realises the extent of the damage.  Irrespective of how good the defences were it was impossible to prevent the damage taking place.</p>  <p>  As Deputy McConalogue said, it was amazing to see the attitude of the community.  I heard much praise for the emergency services and the way people worked.  Deputy McConalogue and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, know very well how people worked to get others out of very difficult situations.  Looking at the devastation and the levels to which the floods reached I believe the unique response resulted in lives being saved.  There is no doubt about that.  When Deputy McConalogue showed us the devastation on the Inishowen Peninsula we could not imagine how lives had not been lost.  A major tribute is due to all the people there who were involved in the response.</p>  <p>  The flooding in Inishowen opens a bigger debate.  All of us in this House will have to realise that there are massive changes occurring that are affecting the climate.  Time and again in recent years we have witnessed flash flooding and torrential rain.  I looked up some statistics recently and it is not the case that there is a significant increase in the overall levels of rainfall but it is the pattern of the rainfall that is causing the devastation.  I mentioned two figures to the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, previously.  In Roscommon in one evening in June 2016 a total of 74% of the average rainfall for June fell in three hours.  A similar situation arose in Donegal recently in the space of two hours.  I believe 60% of the average rainfall for the month of August fell.  That clearly indicates we are dealing with a different situation and we will all have to assess how we respond to it, regardless of the side of the House we are on.  We will have to work together.</p>  <p>  When we look across the Atlantic we see the absolute terror and disaster that struck some of the islands.  God forbid that it would come to this country.  We have the wild Atlantic at our back door.  For an island country on the periphery of Europe we do not in any way have adequate defences.  While everyone is trying to do his or her best it will take more of an effort and require more money.  A total of &euro;480 million has been allocated over a five-year period but that will have to be increased.  Even allowing for the type of storm that occurred in Donegal, one point was made to me time and again there, namely, the lack of maintenance.  That is an issue all over the country.  Last December the Government launched a plan to dredge the Shannon.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, has spoken about the project in Banagher and some work has been carried out.  However, we have lost almost one year and none of the work has been done.  An arrangement was made with Bord na M&oacute;na on the River Shannon to remove silt and peat from the river but that has not been done either.  We will have to carry out improvements and ensure regular maintenance is carried out throughout the country.  I have no doubt we will face major problems in the coming years and we will have to be prepared for them.  Engineers Ireland stated that our flood defences are below standard.  It was said that we do not have proper flood defences and that our infrastructure lags behind.  We must remember that we are an island country on the periphery of Europe and we are open to irregular weather patterns, which are becoming more challenging.  We will all have to up the ante and do much more.</p>  <p>  We must also tackle the insurance industry and make sure people are not discriminated against and that insurance companies do not cherry-pick people in these difficult situations.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="21:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600047#UU00300"><p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for introducing the motion this evening and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.  This is not the first time I have spoken about flooding in this House for the simple reason that I come from south Galway and represent the people of east Galway where in 2015 flooding played a significant part in our lives when Storm Desmond arrived.  We experienced the effects of flooding from Christmas 2015 until the middle of the following February.</p>  <p>  As colleagues said previously, we cannot control the climate but we can control the template of how we respond to flood events.  I listened to references in the debate to humanitarian aid and the Red Cross.  That same template is what we needed in south Galway in 2015 as we experienced the same delays that Deputy McConalogue and his colleagues are experiencing in Donegal at the moment.  What people need when devastation knocks on their door is to know that there are avenues of support they can access.  We need to look at how we will put this template in place, be it for families, businesses and county councils.  People need to know that there is a contingency plan in place on a statutory footing for each council area so that a certain amount of funding is available depending on the trail of destruction.</p><p>There should be a basic minimum available so that when families need the support it is there, be it the &euro;600 from the Red Cross or whatever is needed to keep the farms ticking over.  In our case in south Galway, the helicopters had to come in.  We had 60 cattle marooned.  People did not know for weeks on end how long it would take to get their funding.  Initially they thought their funding was the same as everybody else's and that they were going to get &euro;600 from the Department of Social Protection.  Everybody plays their role - the Government, county councils, the ambulances, the helicopters - everybody helps out.  In these crises, people need to know if there is funding available and where they should turn.  It is as much as a support for the public representatives on the ground and those working in Departments.  We must know that it is there and on a statutory footing so we are not wondering what we are going to get.  It was a huge help to us in south Galway at the time of the flooding that there was funding put aside for our road infrastructure.  A lot of our roads and bridges had to be completely redone.  It was really well done.  We had to beg for that sort of money, however, although it did become available.  There should be contingency funding laid aside for the likes of these occasions.</p> <p> In south Galway at this moment, the Shannon is 13 inches higher that this time last year.  We are all aware of that.  We do not need much rain this year to push it over the edge.  Nor do we need much rain to find ourselves back where we were in 2015.  None of us want to be there.  One thing is for certain - if we do need the funding and if people find themselves in crisis, we need to know these mechanisms are in place.  There are great works taking place in south Galway.  It is a huge amount of work.  The engineers are two months out from going to contracts, tenders and everything else.  It is progressing.  At the same time, we will not have a digger in south Galway until 2020.  We need to have a comfort in place for those families to know that there will be funding available.  We need to know that the mechanism and the template are in place.  It is within the gift of the Ministers of State opposite to bring forward the resolutions to these problems.  We can find the solution.  This time the response was way quicker than we had in south Galway.  Why not put the template in place?  That is the message of Deputy McConalogue's motion.  If we put it on a statutory footing, we will relieve the pressures on people when they are hit with a crisis in respect of an act of God.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:&quot;notes:<br /><br />&mdash; that a pluvial rainfall event on the evening of 22nd August, 2017, gave rise to sudden and devastating flooding which affected the north-west, and in particular the Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal where homes, businesses, farms, community facilities and infrastructure were badly damaged;<br /><br />&mdash; the immediate and effective response of the emergency services in the areas affected, with their initial focus on rescues and protecting lives of those threatened by the flash flooding which occurred;<br /><br />&mdash; the immediate and effective response led by Donegal County Council, the designated lead agency for responding to flooding events, working with the other principal response agencies, in accordance with pre-established emergency management procedures, during the flooding and in its immediate aftermath to safeguard and facilitate persons in the area affected and to enable communities to continue to function;<br /><br />&mdash; the effective clean-up and roads restoration/diversion operations mounted in the aftermath of the event by Donegal County Council in co-ordination with the communities affected, and assisted by the Defence Forces, voluntary groups and local organisations, and that the elected members oversaw the response, clean-up and recovery operations of Donegal County Council;<br /><br />&mdash; that a range of humanitarian support schemes, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s Humanitarian Assistance Scheme for householders, the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Assistance Scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Helpline and Emergency Feed Provision, were activated and that local officials of the relevant organisations have worked in close co-ordination with Donegal County Council to assist those impacted by the flooding and, as demand-led schemes, are fully underwritten by Government commitment;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is liaising with a number of sporting clubs in the area impacted by the flooding but whose damage is deemed to be outside the terms of the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Assistance Scheme;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection activated its standing scheme for emergency humanitarian assistance on Thursday morning, 24th August, 2017, and that the Department&rsquo;s representatives were on the ground from 23rd August, 2017, working with Donegal County Council to identify and make contact with those affected;<br /><br />&mdash; that on 6th September, 2017, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced a measure to support the small number of farmers who bore the brunt of the severe flooding experienced in the Inishowen area; support will be provided to those who experienced losses of livestock, the loss of conserved fodder (hay or silage) and as a contribution towards the clean-up cost of agricultural lands, including repair to fences, damaged by debris washed up by the floods;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commenced payments to farmers under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme from last week and that it has secured permission from the European Commission to make an advance payment of 70 per cent of the Basic Payment Scheme from 16th October, 2017;<br /><br />&mdash; that discussions on risk mitigation measures in the agriculture sector are expected to form part of deliberations at European Union level on the next Rural Development Programme;<br /><br />&mdash; that the application forms for the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Assistance Scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies were available on their website on 30th August, 2017;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Irish Red Cross Humanitarian Assistance Scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies relies on receiving damage assessments from business owners and that a period of time is required following the flooding event to allow for an initial appraisal of the extent of the damage to businesses to take place;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government commitment to support both those affected and the public authorities who have been working in the recovery phase, and that Donegal County Council are still working to complete an estimate of the clean-up costs and the damage caused by the flooding to roads infrastructure at more than 630 sites, and that, given the exceptional nature of the response activities carried out by Donegal County Council, and the fact that the costs of these activities could not be met from within existing resources, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is making support available to assist the Council in meeting the costs of the response, clean-up and necessary immediate works related to the flooding and that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Office of Public Works (OPW) are also liaising with Donegal County Council about works in their areas of competence;<br /><br />&mdash; that Donegal County Council, as the lead agency for recovery, continues to manage and co-ordinate damage assessments and that consideration of further response and remediation options is still ongoing;<br /><br />&mdash; that flooding events can result from tidal, fluvial, pluvial or groundwater conditions (or combinations of these) and that the flooding event in County Donegal was as a result of an extreme pluvial event of a type which could affect any part of the country and for which it is not possible to accurately provide specific forecasts (location and timing) with any appreciable lead-time;<br /><br />&mdash; the appropriateness and effectiveness of the local emergency management system in place, derived from the &lsquo;Framework for Major Emergency Management&rsquo;, with the relevant local authority acting as &lsquo;lead agency&rsquo; to both deliver immediate response, clean-up and recovery operations, with local political accountability, and to co-ordinate the principal response agencies, the Defence Forces and the voluntary and community sector in responding to emergencies of all kinds in their areas;<br /><br />&mdash; that, in its role as lead Government Department, in accordance with &lsquo;Strategic Emergency Management, A National Framework and Structures&rsquo; the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management liaised closely, appropriately and effectively with Donegal County Council from the morning of 23 August, 2017, co-ordinated national level support for Donegal County Council and dealt with emerging issues for those impacted by the flooding, and that, in line with best practice in the aftermath of events of this kind, a review of the County Donegal experience is being carried out as part of the programme of ongoing development of emergency management capability within the local government sector;<br /><br />&mdash; that the OPW has completed 39 major flood defence schemes since 1995 that are providing protection to approximately 8,000 properties with an estimated benefit to the country of damage avoided of over &euro;1 billion; that construction continues on 10 major flood defence schemes and design and development for a further 25 is underway that will provide protection to 12,000 properties when all are completed; that up to seven major schemes are currently anticipated to commence in the next 12 months; and that a further investment of &euro;33 million in minor works since 2009 is protecting 6,000 properties across the country;<br /><br />&mdash; the OPW&rsquo;s proactive flood risk planning, through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme in the past number of years is nearing completion following review and assessment of the extensive response to the public consultation on the draft Flood Risk Management Plans which provided constructive and wide-ranging observations and comments, and by the end of this year the final Flood Risk Management Plans will be published setting out the proposed structural measures to be advanced through to detailed design to protect at risk communities and properties and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to more than double the annual allocation for flood defence schemes in the next five years from &euro;45 million to &euro;100 million to deliver the existing and proposed pipeline of projects;<br /><br />&mdash; the publication of the Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group in 2016, recommending policies and measures to Government that would reduce the impact of flood risks on individuals and communities, dealing with a range of issues including a voluntary homeowners relocation scheme and that Dutch experts &lsquo;have benchmarked (Ireland&rsquo;s) approach to flood risk management and concluded that Ireland is in line with international best practice and is well on track&rsquo;;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government strategy for improving the availability of flood insurance cover includes prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities, and improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in protected areas, complemented as necessary by targeted State emergency humanitarian assistance after flood events and that the success of this approach is evidenced by the increase in the availability of flood insurance in areas where flood defences have been installed, both fixed and demountable, with recent survey results showing that overall, 83 per cent of property insurance policies in protected areas include cover against flood risk and where the defences are permanent in nature it is 90 per cent; and<br /><br />&mdash; that the OPW maintains Arterial Drainage schemes completed since 1945 on in excess of 11,500 kilometres of channels which benefits approximately 650,000 acres (265,400 hectares) of land, that the maintenance of Drainage Districts is the responsibility of local authorities and that, while maintenance of rivers and other watercourses has some benefit to prevent the deterioration of channel conveyance capacity, river maintenance would have had no beneficial effect on the extreme flooding event experienced in County Donegal.&quot;</blockquote><p>I thank the Deputies for proposing the motion.  It addresses an area which is of particular interest to me and my colleagues in government.  That is why I have the Ministers of State, Deputies McHugh and Moran, beside me.  It is an area that affects all of government and our approach to scenarios like this is an all-of-government and all-agency approach.  That is how we try to handle things.  This is an issue which is devastating for those unfortunate enough to be caught by the forces which nature can unleash, as it did in Donegal last month.  It is nature and we are trying to handle and deal with it although we cannot always predict it.  We do our best to react as quickly as we can.</p><p>At the outset, I would like to place on the record of the House our concern for all those who were affected by the devastating flooding which took place on the evening of 22 August 2017 and into the morning of the next day.  Fortunately, no lives were lost in this event, although very severe damage was caused.  Those affected have had to work hard to try to bring normality back into their lives.  For some, despite the best efforts of all involved, restoring pre-flood conditions is going to take longer.  My Department is the lead Department with responsibility for flooding response and several other emergency scenarios.  The national directorate for fire and emergency management within my Department has the mandate to co-ordinate emergency response at national level and to liaise with and support the local response, which is led by the relevant local authority in the case of flooding such as happened in Donegal.</p><p>Flooding can arise in four different situations: tidal, fluvial, groundwater and pluvial, like the rainfall event on the evening of 22 August 2017 that gave rise to sudden and devastating flooding which affected the north west, and in particular the Inishowen Peninsula in Donegal where homes, businesses, farms, community facilities and infrastructure were very badly damaged.  I am happy that the Private Members' motion gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the immediate and effective response of the emergency services in the areas affected, with their initial focus on rescue and protecting the lives of those threatened by the flash flooding which occurred.</p><p>I am glad as Minister of State at the Department with responsibility for local government that all sides have praised the local government system in Donegal for how it responded in the hour of need.  The local elected members of Donegal County Council, along with the local authority management, oversaw the response, clean-up and recovery operations of the local authority.  Donegal County Council staff set to work immediately with the other principal response agencies, in accordance with pre-established emergency management procedures, during the flooding and in its immediate aftermath to safeguard and facilitate persons in the area affected and to enable communities to continue to function.  In doing so, they were working with their own communities, providing an immediate response for the emerging situations, closing roads, diverting traffic and supporting people in every way that was needed.</p><p>The initial response by Donegal County Council transitioned into the clean-up and roads diversion operations mounted in the aftermath of the event in co-ordination with the communities affected and assisted by the Defence Forces, voluntary groups and other local organisations.  A range of humanitarian support schemes were activated, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance scheme for householders; the Irish Red Cross humanitarian assistance scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s animal welfare and emergency feed provision.  Local officials of the relevant organisations have worked in close co-ordination with Donegal County Council to assist those impacted by the flooding.  These schemes operate within parameters which have been evolved from the experience of previous events.  They are demand-led schemes and are fully underwritten by Government commitment.</p><p>Several members of the Government, including those with specific areas of responsibility, visited Donegal to see for themselves the reported devastation and to show support for those affected and the public authorities who have been working in the recovery phase.  Donegal County Council is still working to complete an estimate of the clean-up costs and the damage caused by the flooding to roads infrastructure at more than 630 sites.  My Department wrote to Donegal County Council on 4 September 2017, acknowledging the exceptional nature of the response activities carried out by Donegal County Council.  In recognition of the fact that the costs of these activities could not be met from within existing resources, my Department is making support available to assist in meeting the costs of the response, clean-up and necessary immediate works related to the flooding.  This is in furtherance of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continuation of the support that has been provided to local authorities to undertake unprogrammed works associated with this type of emergency event.  My colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the OPW are also liaising with Donegal County Council about works in their areas of competence.</p><p>As I noted earlier, flooding events can result from tidal, fluvial, pluvial or groundwater conditions, or combinations of these, and the flooding event in Donegal was a result of an extreme pluvial event of a type which could affect any part of the country.  We are conscious of that and it has been highlighted at our own meetings.  The House will appreciate that it is simply not possible to forecast where such events may occur and neither is it possible to defend property against this type of event in the way it is possible sometimes to protect those living near rivers, where flooding is more predictable.</p><p>Returning to my Department&rsquo;s main area of responsibility which is the response to flooding events, the key issue of the emergency response therefore, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the local emergency management system currently in place is derived from the framework for major emergency management which was adopted as Government policy in 2006.  The relevant local authority acts as lead agency to deliver immediate response, clean-up and recovery operations, with local political accountability for its effectiveness in the first instance.  The local authority also co-ordinates the efforts of the other principal response agencies, namely, the Defence Forces and the voluntary and community sector in responding to emergencies of all kinds in their areas.</p><p>Although I do not have time to finish my whole speech, I would say that we learn from every emergency event to enhance our approach.  The House will be interested to learn that today in Tullamore the national directorate convened a workshop attended by the relevant key crisis management staff of all local authorities to review the Donegal flooding experience and to update our activities and learn from the events.  We are constantly striving to achieve best practice.  The framework was set down in 2006 and is an evolving procedure.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy McHugh.</p></speech>

That is not about Government but local politics.  I acknowledge all members of the municipal district in Inishowen who provided an invaluable on-the-ground resource in terms of intelligence gathering.  I acknowledge the work of my own colleagues, councillors Bernard McGuinness and John Ryan.  That kind of response was very much in evidence.  I acknowledge Se&aacute;n Hogan and his team and the interdepartmental work that they did.  They showed leadership and were on the phones to the team at Donegal County Council within hours of the flood.  That was so important.  The arrival of different personnel was vital for the integrated and responsive nature of what needed to be done, including the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, who ensured her staff were out on the ground making sure people could access information about the humanitarian assistance grants in phases 1, 2 and 3.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, met her staff to ensure they were on the ground meeting people and making sure they could access information on humanitarian assistance and on the first three phases of the operation.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, rang me on the morning in question to tell me he was ready to come up, but did not want media coverage.  He wanted to find out what was going on, so he met officials from Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the assessment.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, could not believe his eyes when he saw that many bridges, some of which were constructed over 200 years ago, were gone due to the devastation.  That was important from an intelligence point of view.</p> <p> I want to acknowledge the pivotal role played by the Army in providing shoulder-to-shoulder support to people in very vulnerable positions.  The day after this horrible horror event, people were in shock and were experiencing trauma.  They needed people to be with them.  On behalf of the people of Inishowen and the rest of County Donegal, I thank the young and not-so-young members of the Defence Forces who provided support by lifting blocks, gathering trees from rivers and cutting trees that were blocking bridges.  We can all learn lessons.  There are things we could have done better.  There are things we can do better in the future.  If this happens again, we need to ensure we repeat the things we did well on this occasion.</p> <p> There are outstanding long-term issues.  We can always learn.  The rivers still need to be cleaned.  At the moment, Donegal County Council is assessing who shoulders the responsibility for the rivers.  It is considering whether it should carry out these works itself.  I know officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are liaising closely with Donegal County Council as they work on these issues.  The people from Inishowen who responded ensured nobody died that night.  They ensured there were no tragedies and no funerals.  They did the proper thing.  I suppose it is the natural thing that Irish people do.  When others were in trouble, they responded in a proactive way.</p> <p> In addition to the colleagues I mentioned, I would like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, who came up to ensure insurance issues, etc., were dealt with.  There will be long-term legacy issues.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy said, in order to fully understand this issue, one needed to be there to see the destruction.  On a personal note, I acknowledge my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I thank the officials in the Custom House for their constant engagement and their constant updates to ensure the right thing was done.</p> <p> I appreciate that some farmers have outstanding issues.  We are continuing to liaise to see what we can do.  On a personal note, I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, who was there on the first day along with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ross.  It was really important to have the presence of somebody with experience who had been through this before and was able to assure people that they would get through this.  On a personal level, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, for his invaluable insight and contribution during those early hours.</p></speech>

Cuirfidh m&eacute; &eacute; chun tosaigh n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  I will move the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to this motion at the appropriate time.  I thank Deputy McConalogue and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues for the opportunity to debate this issue tonight.  Everyone has spoken about the devastation that visited the Inishowen Peninsula and areas like Raphoe last month.  One really needs to have seen what happened in order to understand its impact.  It is important for me to join every Deputy who has spoken up to now in recognising the hard work and dedication of those who have helped the victims of this tragedy.  I refer to the local authority staff, the Defence Forces personnel, the members of the emergency services, the volunteers and everyone else in the community who has been involved in the response efforts in the region to date.  I am not just referring to people from the Inishowen region; I am speaking about people right across County Donegal and further afield who have been contributing to the effort to return everybody to a stable position.</p>  <p>  As I said, we welcome the tabling of this motion, the text of which recognises the serious damage, devastation and destruction caused by last month's flooding, as well as the havoc it wreaked on communities throughout north Donegal.  It also acknowledges and heaps praise on the various authorities and responders who provided assistance to those affected by the flooding, as well as those who led the clean-up operations.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which seeks to add to the issues highlighted in the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, refers to the negligence of the Government in abdicating the legal obligation of the State, like all EU member states, to plan and act to prevent flooding where possible, a point which is underlined by "the continued failure of the Government to submit Flood Risk Management Plans to the European Commission in line with the requirements of the European Union Floods Directive".  This is further evidence that too little time and care has been directed towards protecting citizens from the ever-increasing threat posed by adverse weather conditions and patterns.</p>  <p>  This motion alludes to the fact it is no secret that the Government has been too slow in constructing and introducing the necessary flood defences, schemes and mitigation measures.  Communities the length and breadth of this State have been left abandoned by successive Governments even though the localities in question have a history of flooding or have been identified as being at particular risk.  I would like to refer to a particular part of County Donegal in this context.  We all recognise the schemes that have been put in place and the actions that have been taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, and all the other players, including the local authority, to provide humanitarian aid.  Castlefin, which is a number of miles down the road from Inishowen, was flooded twice within a year.  This caused devastation to businesses and properties.  There was no response at that time.  People there are asking why they could not access the schemes that are being made available now.</p>  <p>  While I recognise the progress that is being made, I remind the House that some communities are being left behind.  In June of this year, I asked the Government why it was not committing to flood mitigation measures in Burnfoot.  A number of months later, many houses in that village were completely destroyed, unfortunately.  Families that were left on the side of the road were completely devastated because their homes were no longer habitable.  People did now know where they could go or where they could sleep that night.  They did not know where they could call home.  They were worried that they would be taken away from their communities and their family supports.  I hope the Minister will inform us that the flood mitigation measures in that area are going forward and that local authority houses and all other houses will be secure for the time ahead.</p>  <p>  It is time we got tough with the insurance industry on the issue of insurers refusing to provide cover to householders and businesses.  In my view, they cannot continue to do what they are doing to vulnerable businesses and households in County Donegal and right across the State.  In our amendment to this motion, we call on the Government to "immediately convene a consultation process with all of the farming representative organisations, the Office of Public Works and Inland Fisheries Ireland to examine how water sources, such as rivers and streams, can be better maintained to mitigate the impact of flooding in the future and to amend the relevant legislation if necessary".  Similarly, the amendment seeks to "ensure that the current review of the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme results in adequate compensation for farmers with land prone to flooding".  Such farmers may suffer financial losses as a result of future flooding events.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by saying it is obvious that the inaction must stop.  The time to act fast has already passed.  We owe it to the communities in Inishowen, in other parts of County Donegal and right across the State to put in place the best strategy and the best measures to protect them from adverse weather patterns.  Before this debate finishes, I would like someone on the Government side to comment on the plight of Cockhill Celtic, which is a very large football club in Buncrana that saw its playing fields destroyed during last month's floods.  Those involved in the club have no certainty on whether the Government is about to step in here.  No timeframe has been set out.  I want to make a similar point about Swan Park, which I visited in the company of Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn.  The devastation there can be seen by one and all.  People want to know whether the park will be restored to its former glory.  If so, what is the timeframe for that?  I hope we can get clear commitments from the Government on both of those issues before the night is out.</p></speech>

I commend Fianna F&aacute;il on the introduction of this motion.  I also commend my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, on the tabling of a reasonable and appropriate amendment to that motion.  I urge all Deputies in the House to support our amendment.</p>  <p>  As we know, the people of the north west of this country have been devastated by the most recent flooding disaster.  Homes, businesses, farms, local sports clubs and community amenities across the Inishowen Peninsula have been severely affected.  Our solidarity and immediate support must go to these communities.  I know that my colleagues - Deputy Pearse Doherty, Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn and the broader team of Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in County Donegal - have been working tirelessly on behalf of everyone affected.</p><p> However, we must turn our attention to the actions of the Government and the statutory agencies in regard to the most recent floods and the issue of flood planning in general.  This Government is almost two years past the deadline for the completion of the flood risk management plans and there is still no sign of those plans being published.</p> <p> The importance of planning cannot be overestimated.  It can help curb the risks of flooding as well as reduce insurance premiums for those living in at-risk areas.  The European Commission has indicated that it has initiated infringement proceedings against Ireland in order to enforce compliance on this issue.  It is a disgrace that the citizens of this country must depend on the European Commission rather than on their own Government to act in their best interests.</p> <p> Furthermore, recent figures obtained by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, from the OPW show that there is very little provision by the Government for flood relief measures in the upper Shannon region.  Apart from a relatively minor scheme in Raphoe, County Donegal, there has been no funding allocated to other areas north of the Shannon, north of Athlone, in the past five years and none is projected in the next five years either.  That is despite the fact that this region has been subjected to significant flooding in recent times.</p> <p> In my constituency of Offaly, flooding in Shannon Harbour, Shannonbridge and Banagher was an issue of concern in 2015.  We cannot have a repeat of that again, nor can we have a repeat of it in any other part of the country.</p> <p> The submission by the OPW to the review of the capital plan makes it clear that additional resources are required for the office to complete flood defence works.  It further states that the fact that this has not been provided for has already constrained the efficient delivery of some aspects of flood defence schemes.  The submission also states that an additional &euro;102 million will be required by 2022 to continue works on the current schemes.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an additional &euro;35 million in budget 2018 alone.  Will the Government commit to that funding?  Will the Government commit to ensuring that the flood risk management plans are submitted to the European Commission without any further delay?  Will the Government ensure that an appropriate scheme for farmers affected by flooding is included in the upcoming review of areas of natural constraint?  Will the Government provide clarity to the people of Donegal that funds will be available to repair the roads, community and sporting facilities that have been destroyed?  Will it set out a timeframe for that?</p> <p> The people of Donegal, and citizens across this State, who have suffered from the effects of flooding deserve these answers.  They also deserve our full support and I call on all parties to support this motion and the amendment put forward by Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>

We understand that nobody can prepare for that but I spoke to some people about this who had relatives in Donegal and what concerned them was that they found there was not much co-ordination in the response.  I understand the Government is saying there was co-ordination but the experience of some people on the ground was that the response was not as well co-ordinated as it could have been.  That is something that can be worked on, and I am sure it will be worked on in the future.</p>  <p>  The criticism is that there was not some kind of national emergency plan that could be implemented quickly wherever this type of event happens.  We hope it never happens again anywhere but, unfortunately, the likelihood is that it may happen somewhere else again.</p>  <p>  The issue of insurance is another problem raised by one of the people I spoke to in the area.  In all cases, and most people experience it when they have an insurance claim, the first thing the insurance company tries to do is wrangle out of it in whatever way possible to ensure it will not have to pay.  Some of the people who have seen their lives washed away are experiencing that now.  They are very angry that when insurance company representatives come out to them they start giving all kinds of reasons this or that is not covered.  Some of these people are left wondering if the Government or somebody will step in to help them.  That is not to say that help has not come.  The Army came and helped people clear their houses and did a lot of other work for them.  As has been said, Donegal County Council has been magnificent in the work it has done in the area.</p>  <p>  The main point that strikes us all, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, was in my constituency and many other areas around the country in regard to this, is that when these deluges of rain occur we must ensure that the water levels in the rivers are at their lowest possible.  One of the problems is that many small drains and rivers throughout the country have not been cleaned in, if not centuries, certainly in decades in many cases.  We would encourage the Government to try to put a fund in place for local authorities to clean those small rivers and drains.  An example given to me in Donegal was of bridges washed away in cases where the rivers under them had not been cleared in 30 years in some cases.  That is part of the problem.  If there was a way of moving the flow of water faster, it would make a huge difference in many of these cases.</p>  <p>  I suspect the motion put forward will be generally supported by everyone in the House because we all want the same thing.  We want to ensure that we have a provision in place so that if this happens again, we will all step up to the mark and the whole of society will feel better about it.  However, there are problems that were not dealt with adequately enough, and that needs to be acknowledged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600050#XX00400"><p>I welcome this motion and the chance for Deputies to raise in the D&aacute;il the issues of flooding, insurance and flood defences.  My party colleagues have said a great deal.  It is not the first time this country has dealt with flooding.  I stand in solidarity with the people of Donegal in terms of what happened but if we cast our mind back to my constituency in east Cork in 2015, it was very badly hit.  On two occasions the people of east Cork expressed their grievances about the lack of organisation when they were hit twice with very bad flooding.  The N25 was closed for a number of weeks.</p>  <p>  A Deputy on the opposite side of the House mentioned maintenance.  The good old days of the fellow with the JCB and the shovel cleaning the country roads and the dikes to keep surface water off the roads have disappeared.  We are having major problems in rural areas as well.</p>  <p>  I want to draw attention to the problems of the aftermath of flooding and the elephant in the room is insurance.  I live at the top of the hill in Midleton.  It is probably one of the highest points in my town.  Behind me are the water works.  Just below me is an estate called Forest Hill.  One can understand why it is called Forest Hill; it is built on a hill.  A man in that estate could not get insurance because of the flooding in Midleton.  The entire town of Midleton would have to flood before that happened.  That is one of the issues that has to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty mentioned sporting clubs, social organisations and so on.  Our own rugby club, Midleton RFC, had nearly 4 ft of water inside it.  That club is built adjacent to a housing estate called Lauriston, which was practically destroyed by flooding.  Some of the people lost everything.  The position is not all bad but there are a couple of points I want to make.  On the night that flooding happened I got a telephone call from a friend of mine in Lebanon who could tell me that there was a full lorry load of sand bags in Collins Barracks but as an elected representative I could not get a contact number to get sanction for those bags to be sent to Midleton.  These are just some pointers for the Minister.</p>  <p>  I thank Midleton Town Council.  When we had the town councils we sanctioned our own money from local funding for flood relief for Midleton and thanks be to God, after a lot of wrangling and disturbances, that is going ahead.  When local councils are involved they have the local knowledge and seem to work better.</p>  <p>  I will leave the Minister with a final thought.  When it comes to planning in the future we should look at all the castles in the country.  I have not seen too many castles built on a flood plain.  That is another pointer.  Prevention is better than cure.</p>  <p>  The general public, the local authorities, the Red Cross, the Civil Defence and the garda&iacute; have been amazing.  When a disaster happens in an area, people pull together.  As elected representatives we have to address all these issues and give them the same support people have got in recent years.  When people are in dire circumstances, others come together to help them.  We have a duty to do the same.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600050#XX00500"><p>I saw the reports on television.  First, our sympathies are with the people of Donegal for what happened.  Second, I want to put on the record of the D&aacute;il and acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, saw the first machines go into the Shannon probably since the Brits were in this country.</p><p>That is a fair statement because, my God, it needed doing.  It was great to see around Banagher and Meelick the first machines go in, against the wishes of all the so-called non-governmental organisations and every type of expert that tried to tell us it would not work.  I welcome that and wish to put on record that it needed doing and still does.  It is very easy shouting from the sidelines in opposition, but when someone does good, we must be man enough to say it out straight.  No one will come into the House tonight and say the Minister can clean the likes of the River Shannon or rivers in Donegal or whatever overnight.  As I have always said, the first start is what is important.  At least people will see something is starting to be done after about 70 years of it not being done.  It is ferociously important.</p> <p> I have spoken to the Minister about councils throughout the country.  If a pilot scheme is needed to get this going, I have no problem with that.  Once upon a time there were schemes here and there right around Ireland whereby rivers and drains were cleaned and water let flow.  I have seen some photos of the flooding in Donegal.  I am not as familiar with it as the Deputies from Donegal and will never claim to be but I saw trees washed against bridges that blocked water.  Many of the water courses in this country are blocked and there is silt in them.  If a tree crashes up against a bridge, the water will flow out over it, and when water keeps going it is violent and will take the bridge with it.  One does not have to go to Trinity for years to know about water and what it will do.</p> <p> The councils will not be able to deal with every county overnight, but we could put in place a budget along the lines of the Suck drainage scheme in my area.  That is gone.  Some of the money is being used on diggers now, in fairness, but the available fund is not enough to catch up, because we are catching up on successive Governments doing nothing, to put it bluntly.  In my area we have the likes of the River Suck, which flows into the Shannon.  There is also the Brosna.  The Minister knows them better than anyone.  I have gone up the Shannon.  The Minister knows the pinch points on the Shannon.  We know them in Deputy Kenny's area in Leitrim.  If the likes of Lough Allen were lowered and Jamestown, Tarmonbarry and Roosky done, even just where there are pinch points to get the ball rolling, that would be useful.  I know the Minister is familiar with these areas.</p> <p> I ask that a focus be kept on this.  People right across this House have seen what those in Donegal and south Galway went through.  They have seen Roscommon, Athlone, Longford, Leitrim and all the other areas, right down to the mouth of the River Shannon.  We have seen it in Cork.  Why can we not make sure every obstacle is taken out of the way to give a clear run to get this work done?  It must be done.  I ask the Minister to do it for every county in the upcoming budget.</p> <p> There is another thing I would like the Minister to start putting a bit of a fire under.  There were, and still are, obstacles put in our way by people out measuring rain.  We can go back on 40 years of records of rainfall in different places but there are surveys going on at present in some of these turloughs.  We need to come up with a fast solution to the likes of Lough Funshinagh, Castleplunket and all the other areas.  South Galway can be solved.  This is not about my area or our area.  It is about all the different areas of Ireland, be it Donegal, Cork, Galway or Roscommon.  Wherever there is a problem it can be solved.  Funnily enough, when there were no satellites or lasers a long time ago, water was moved better than with all the gear there is now.  I ask the Minister to act in this regard.</p> <p> In Donegal, and indeed the country in general, when a crisis hits, not alone in areas of flooding, but also in farming communities, an awful lot of red tape is put in the way of people affected to access different things.  Householders can be affected too.  There could be a person with a large mortgage who has kids going to college and who is paying the college fees but who does not qualify for a certain scheme.  They might not have a penny in the house that night.  We must make sure that things are put in place for those people.</p> <p> The Minister also has a big problem to face in insurance.  I am familiar with MABS.  Sometimes it is not even known where people are living.  If they were to sell their house this minute, the people living there can get insurance.  I saw an incident in recent days where a person was selling their house and a mortgage was pulled because the new tenants could not get insurance, even though there is insurance on the property at present and it is fully covered for flood damage.  This is only happening because new people are going to live in the property.  Insurance companies are using outdated projected maps on which it is written that they are not official.  There is also this great phrase they use when one has a go at them.  They will say they did their own assessment, which I believe is codswallop.  They are refusing people throughout this country and we must address that situation for those people because it is ferociously unfair to leave them that way.</p> <p> Another thing the Minister's Department should encourage is that all the council people in the local authorities, be they roads engineers or the executive engineer, go into the Department.  I have seen cases in which we might give out that money did not go somewhere, but when we trace it back, there might not have been an application.  I have seen some great people.  Eugene Dwyer in Roscommon is one of the best at doing this, in fairness to him, but I have seen around different parts of the country that they need to wake up to make sure we draw down this money.  Earlier a Deputy referred to somewhere that did not get it.  I know the cost-benefit analysis has been sorted and that it is more workable in rural parts of Ireland, but we need to make sure when these questions are asked that the public representatives are told straight out that if they do not make the application, they cannot get the money.  It does not come down from Dublin in the train to be used without anyone knowing.  These things need to be done.  I ask the Minister to put a fund in place to make sure we start a programme.  Four or five counties have been badly hit.  That fund and a pilot scheme should start to get the ball rolling.  I encourage the Minister to keep the focus on the Shannon.  I know it will not all be cleaned overnight.  We could get the pinch points out as a start.  There are trees lying across other rivers and, of course, one will find the do-gooder who will say it cannot be taken it out and there is only one solution.  Fish will live, the whole ecology of a river will work and it will always come back if it is kept clean and the flow is kept going.</p></speech>

The floods which hit Donegal in late August, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, were devastating.  The report I read - I am not even sure if it was the final report - indicated 47 households registered as being displaced and 300 issues relating to the road network, ranging from extensive structural damage to bridges to stretches of rural roads being completely washed away.</p>  <p>  The motion refers to the challenge of climate change and increasingly volatile weather patterns.  The storms in Donegal may have occurred with or without climate change, but it is a fact there has been a fourfold increase in the number of severe storms globally since 1970.  The warmer atmosphere is a contributory factor, as is the warmer water evaporating more easily.  It is not just the storms but also other extreme weather events such as we saw with the heatwave in Europe in July.</p>  <p>  One hundred companies have been responsible for 70% of global gas emissions since 1988.</p><p>A mere 25 companies are responsible for more than 50% of the global gas emissions since 1988.  In the White House today, the world's number one capitalist politician, Donald J. Trump, a climate change denier, has appointed as the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency another climate change denier.<br/><br/>It is not just the crazy element of world capitalism that is contributing massively to the climate change crisis.  Investment in renewables peaked at $257 billion in the year 2011 and it has fallen by 23% since, in particular in countries such as Germany, where there has been a 56% decline, and in Italy, where there has been a 75% decline.  Martin Wolf, writing in the <i>Financial Times</i>in December of last year, said the Paris Agreement is far more than the world could have reasonably expected a year or two ago but, as it stands, it will at best slow the pace at which the world reaches a possible disaster.  All these examples show that the international capitalist system - both the Trump wing, on the one hand, and the more Christian democratic or social democratic wing, on the other - is contributing massively to this climate change crisis.  Naomi Klein, one of the foremost commentators on this issue internationally, in her recent book, <i>This Changes Everything</i>, talking of capitalism, said, &quot;If we want to avoid climate change, we need system change&quot;.  We agree with that point entirely.<br/><br/>How does this reflect itself in Ireland?  The level of neglect from this Government and from the political establishment on the climate change crisis as it pertains in this country is astounding.  Joseph Curtin from the Institute of International and European Affairs talks about the level of fines the Irish State could receive for not meeting targets on renewable energy and emissions.  He talks in terms of fines of &euro;610 million for missing targets by 2020 and, potentially, of up to &euro;5.5 billion for missing targets up to the year 2030.  The way in which agriculture is organised in this country is one major factor and transport is another.  Again, what has been the role of successive Governments led by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on this issue?  If they were to take a serious approach towards meeting the climate change challenge, surely a very basic thing they would do is put in place massive improvements in the public transport system to make it more attractive as an alternative to the car.  Yet, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus have all had their public service obligation payments slashed since 2008 - they have not even risen back to 2008 levels yet and, in the case of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the payments have been cut nearly in half.  We say that those cuts must be fully reversed and that even when they have been reversed, there should be a doubling of expenditure on public transport.<br/><br/>Imaginative and bold policies to combat climate change must be introduced.  For example, in 1981 the Greater London Council introduced its Fares Fair policy whereby fares were cut by some 30% and there was a massive increase in the numbers using public transport and the tube.  London Transport said that the benefits outweighed the costs by a ratio of more than two to one.  There needs to be a debate internationally about the idea of treating public transport in the way that education and health are meant to be organised but are actually not - that is, free at the point of use, with no charge.  There should be an international debate on that but, at the very least, as an immediate short-term step, there should be a Fares Fair policy, slashing fares and making public transport more attractive as an alternative to the car.<br/><br/>I want to conclude on a point I would particularly like to address to the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, namely, the question of flood defences for 2016-2021 in the Cork area.  Some &euro;140 million of the &euro;430 million is being set aside for the flood defences in Cork, which are to be concentrated in the city centre in raising the quay walls, with 46 pumping stations.  A major increase in the discharge levels at the Inniscarra dam, if necessary, would be considered safe alongside that.  Those proposals have been critiqued and, in my opinion, critiqued in a very professional and serious way by the Save Cork City group.  Among their supporters is Professor Robert Devoy of UCC, who is a leading figure on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Professor Devoy and his colleagues on Save Cork City say that the flood defence plans are based on a ten-year-old study of the flood tide risks and do not take sufficient account of the climate change challenge that Cork will meet.  He believes we need to factor in sea level rises of at least 1 m, which I believe is quite a conservative figure and I have looked at his argumentation, and also that a tidal barrier will be necessary within the next couple of decades at least.  The group argues, persuasively in my opinion, that we should factor in the tidal barrier now.  It will have to be built sooner or later but if it is done now, and combined with upriver anti-flooding measures and increasing the capacity of the Inniscarra dam, it represents a more effective and certainly more people-friendly proposal than the one the OPW has advanced.  The OPW counterargument is that it is expensive and would cost between &euro;450 million and &euro;1 billion.  If that is what it takes to provide proper flood defences for the city that will not be out of date because of climate change relatively quickly, then that is what needs to be done.  However, I believe the OPW has come to this figure rather quickly and perhaps is using it to justify its position as opposed to really objectively analysing it.  I would support the call for an independent analysis of what a tidal barrier would genuinely cost in Cork.  I believe it could and should be part of an alternative to the current proposals.</p></speech>

First, I want to extend my sympathies to the people of Donegal whose homes, farms and businesses have been destroyed in recent flash flooding.  I have seen numerous times the destruction caused by unprecedented levels of flooding in my own constituency of Cork South-West.  In 2015 towns such as Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen, and communities like Ballylickey, were torn apart by flooding causing tens of thousands of euro worth of damage.  Many of my constituents are still struggling to restore their farms, homes and businesses to their pre-2015 state.</p>  <p>  I welcome that a &euro;10 million flood relief scheme for Bandon town is being advanced by the OPW in partnership with Cork County Council.  This scheme will help alleviate serious flooding of Bandon although it will take a number of years for the scheme to go through feasibility, planning and procurement processes and construction prior to becoming operational.  I note such schemes have been successful in towns such as Clonmel, County Tipperary, and plans for similar schemes are ongoing in Skibbereen, Clonakilty and other areas of west Cork.  For that reason, I am urging the Government to find and allocate the funds to establish adequate flood defences in every city, town and village in the country.</p>  <p>  I have raised in the D&aacute;il previously the issue of insensitive insurance companies increasing premiums and denying policies to my constituents, and this is again very relevant as it is estimated that over 50,000 people in Ireland are without flood insurance.  The reality is that it is not those who live on the top of mountains who are rejected for flood insurance cover but those who live in vulnerable areas and whose houses have been flooded previously.  Failure to obtain adequate flood insurance is holding back local economies as banks will not provide small businesses loans to help them reach their potential due to the threat of floods.</p><p>It is an absolute disgrace that insurance companies are able to deny home and business owners such cover, or price them out of their means where cover is granted. This is another reason the Government needs to put pressure and stricter regulations on the insurance industry in Ireland.</p> <p> Council workers, volunteers and those in the emergency services are owed a great deal for their hard work in these situations.  These people stayed out day and night to clear roads, drains and assist those in flooded properties in an effort to restore normality as soon as possible.  Their work must be recognised and commended.</p> <p> The reality of the issue is that as our climate changes, this type of adverse weather will become more and more common.  Our Government needs to be in a position to act immediately to provide aid to flooded areas.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is well aware of the damage that flooding can cause.  He has seen it first-hand in his constituency and his town of Athlone.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he visited the areas in west Cork since he took over his Ministry and when he was not long in the office.  He spent the time with the people of Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty.  The Minister of State came back again to the people of west Cork and at ten o'clock at night he sat in the armchairs with those people who had suffered floods in Ballylickey and Castletownbere, and he caught up with the constituents.  That went down very well with the people, to see that the Minister of State had the passion and the compassion for them, and the good intention to turn it around when they saw devastation.</p> <p> I will conclude by stating my support once again for this motion.  Once the repairs to the affected areas in Donegal are completed, however, let us not wait for another town in the country to be destroyed by extreme and unprecedented floods.</p></speech>

I want to recognise this.</p>  <p>  I sympathise with the great people above in Donegal who suffered so much, as people throughout the country have suffered in the past.  It is right that Fianna F&aacute;il recognises this here tonight and that we are debating it for two days and two nights.  It is welcome.</p>  <p>  I will start with the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, himself.  I recognise him as being probably one of the most proactive Ministers of State in Government when it comes to dealing with problems and issues and in being dedicated to detail.  I will give an example to the House of what the Minister of State is like.  Before he became a Minister of State, I went to Deputy Moran and asked him when he became a Minister if he would come to Kerry and look at problems.  His answer was "yes".  Deputy Moran was a Minister of State for only three hours when he rang me and said, "When am I coming to Kerry?"  We agreed upon a date, and the Minister of State came down and looked at issues.  He was not like some fancy Minister who came in swanning around the place, looking at things and saying this and that would be fine.  After the Minister of State visited our county, travelling around with my brother and me, he called me at 10.15 p.m. on a Saturday to go through the schemes we had looked at.  We wrote them down and discussed them again in great detail.  No one can ever take that from him and I am very proud of the way the Minister of State carries out his ministerial duties.  No one will ever take that from him.  Be it looking at the problems we had in Kenmare, in Glenflesk, in Currow, in Castleisland and out on the way to Fenit where all of Liebherr's cranes have to go out the road, the Minister of State did not stand on the other side of the road wondering what the coastal erosion was like.  He climbed out over the ditch and he nearly got lost into the sea himself by looking at it.  He was not one bit afraid of it.  That is what one calls a Minister of State who has the common, ordinary approach.  He also has the ability to come back to his Department to fight for the money.  Ten days ago he gave us &euro;77,000 for one problem.  I thank him in advance, and I will be the first to do so, for the money he is going to give us in the very near future, which we will not talk about now but we will announce in a couple of days' time when he will have it ready for us.</p></speech>

This is what we need in Government.  We need some ordinary people who are down to earth and who feel the passion of what happens on the ground.  There is nothing worse than flooding and the problems it causes to people's property, their houses, their farms and the roads that would be torn away.  We have the right man in position at the moment with the Minister of State there.  The longer he is there, the better it will be for the people around the rest of the country.</p></speech>

He represents his people in Donegal.  We all sympathise with those who have been adversely affected.  Their lives have been turned upside down with what has happened.</p>  <p>  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, for coming down to Kerry to visit the places that are in trouble there.  I especially thank him for the &euro;77,000 he sent to deal with the problem in Currow.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has said, we are waiting for and hoping for more funding to deal with other issues.</p>  <p>  There is one issue that affects all the State and we must grasp hold of it and deal with it.  We are talking about two applications that must come in to the Department from Kerry.  Inland Fisheries Ireland will not let us touch one spoon of gravel or one spoon of silt in any one of the places we are talking of.  This means the rivers will keep rising and we will have to raise the roads and jack up the houses if we are to keep people out of water.  There are 22 houses that have been continually flooded in Glenflesk.  All that they will let us do there now, by the height of begging, is cut the trees.  This has been going on for two or three years.  They will now let us cut the trees.  God almighty.  We always had a closed time in fishing and an open time.  People were always able to take the gravel out from the river during the open times.  This kept the rivers flowing and they did no harm to anyone and there were fish in the rivers.  I want to know from where they got this almighty power.</p>  <p>  With regard to cost compliance, there are farmers right around the country being threatened that if they take one spoon of gravel or silt out of the river they would lose their single farm payment.  That is blackmail.</p></speech>

We should also think outside that box and think of the people of Puerto Rico tonight.  One week on from the hurricane that hit the island, there are one million people who do not have power.  It is 90&deg; there, if Members can imagine that.  Out of 69 hospitals, only 11 have either power or fuel.  Their entire agriculture system has been wiped out.  We can go across the world and see the same this summer.  In Bangladesh in recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of people have had everything they have washed away.  We have to think big around what is actually happening.  It is climate change and we must be clear about it, and in fairness to the Minister of State I heard him say it on the radio when the flash flood hit Donegal.  I am sure he heard the people in Donegal saying that they had never seen this before.  Lord knows that Donegal is used to rain, but this was not in the area of Donegal that we would expect floods.</p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State could come back to me, if not tonight then with a written response, on the following matter.  The OPW conducted a detailed assessment of some 70,000 houses it saw as immediate flood risk.  I would love to know if any of the houses that were flooded in Inishowen were on that list.  What happened in Donegal, like what is happening in so many places, is outside the ordinary.  As a result of climate change, everything is outside the ordinary.  We must prepare for it.</p><p>We have to protect ourselves and seek to prevent.  We cannot just do protection after the fact; we have to stop it.  We must all do something to stop it happening, whether we are in Puerto Rico, Bangladesh or anywhere else.  While there is uncertainty about having a five or ten-year horizon, if we keep going as we are, we will tip the world into being uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.  That is the scale of the crisis we face and our responsibility.</p> <p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I may have different views, but I keep coming back to the central point I always make to him.  Protecting and preventing are better for Irish farmers.  What we need to do is work with nature as it is the clever thing to do, but that does not necessarily mean dredging every river.  In many cases, the best scientists I hear talking about how to prevent and protect say we should actually give rivers room to move rather than build every wall and dredge every stream as if it were going to solve the problem.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I can sit down together.  He can bring his experts and I can bring mine and in a very civil way we can see what is the better approach.  The Dutch and others know a thing or two about river and water management, but they made the mistake of culverting the whole River Rhine.  They now tell me that they realise that does not work as one cannot beat nature.  One cannot tunnel, funnel and manage it that way.  It is better to work with it.  In farming it is better to work with it.  My heart goes out to those farmers in County Donegal and I agree with Fianna F&aacute;il in its motion that they need support.  My heart also goes out to those grain farmers who I am told again face a fairly serious problem this autumn.  God help us, it is going to start to rain in the next few days.  Are they going to face what they had to face last year when the harvest was flattened and they were picking corn up off the ground in November?</p> <p> While one can ignore Met &Eacute;ireann which does not seem to have a clue what is happening, our best scientists in Maynooth are saying that while they cannot be certain, the north, west and south west of the country will see a lot more rain with more intense bursts, which is what we saw happen in County Donegal.  However, the south and the east are likely to see less and we are likely to face drought in this couintry, as hard as that is to believe.</p></speech>

However, the best approach is not to build anything on the historical flood plains as we have done, which was an incredible mistake; rather, it is to let the natural river systems work.  If we think we can beat nature by culverting every river or that it is about dredging every river, we will see a stronger flow and end up with what happened in County Donegal where there was an intense downpour.  Rivers will become faster and faster and we will end up not being able to control them.  The better way to manage rivers is to let them spread in places.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that climate change has affected the weather in the past few years.  That is something we have to accept and deal with into the future.  I was shocked by the television pictures of what had happened in County Donegal in August.  I was not on the ground there, but I am not easily shocked by flooding as I come from Clonmel which has been flooded on a regular basis for centuries.  I remember looking forward as a young child to a few days' holiday every year as we could not get from Old Bridge to the Presentation Convent or Christian Brothers school in the town.  In fact, the most recent phase of flooding happened when I was mayor of the town in February 1995.  It was then that we decided that something simply had to be done.  We worked with the various agencies and, thankfully, a flood defence system has been put in place of the town and worked.  It took quite a long time to get it done, perhaps 15 or 16 years, but it is now in place and has been effective.  It cost a huge amount of money - &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  In the short time available to me I will focus on the question of insurance.  Even in Clonmel where the Office of Public Works has put in place flood defences at a cost of &euro;40 million, even now the various insurance companies will not cover properties in the town.  There are properties which were never or nearly flooded.  They are miles from the river, but their owners have been denied insurance.  That is something the Minister of State and the Government must take up immediately with the insurance companies.  The Office of Public Works has recently produced flood maps for the whole country which the insurance companies are using to deny insurance cover not only to people whose properties are deemed to be at risk of flooding but also to anyone who is anywhere near a flood-risk zone.  It is simply unacceptable that they are doing this.  I ask the Government to call in the insurance companies to ensure flood insurance cover will be available to households and businesses in these areas, particularly where there are flood defences to deal with once-in-100-years flood events as happened in Clonmel.</p></speech>

It is very appropriate to have this debate some weeks after the floods occurred on the Inishowen Peninsula.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, who post-haste travelled to County Donegal on becoming aware of the flooding.  I was indisposed at the time and unable to witness it at first hand, but in following it on television, in the newspapers and on local radio I noticed that the Minister of State was not looking for the limelight and not interested in photo opportunities, unlike many of his colleagues, on which I compliment him.  However, we will judge him and his colleagues in the weeks ahead when we see whether they will put their money where their mouths are as they said they would on that fateful August Monday in County Donegal.  I believe the Minister of State will and we will support him to ensure his colleagues in government will do likewise.  We were told that money would be available to restore whatever it was necessary to restore, whether it was bridges, roads or sports facilities, and to provide compensation for farmers.  As such, we will hold the Government to account in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the total destruction caused by the flooding on the Inishowen Peninsula and the huge personal loss.  Those of us who were not subject to it will never understand, but we can look objectively from afar at the destruction caused for many families and to their properties; the damage caused for many households, some of an unbelievable scale and extent, and the destruction of business premises.  We have all witnessed the vast infrastructural damage to roads, bridges and sports facilities and seen the loss of livestock and crops suffered by farmers.  I pay tribute to the emergency services who worked there 24/7 for a period of days.  I also pay tribute to the local authority workers and members of the Defence Forces who did tremendous work.</p><p>We cannot forget the many hundreds of volunteers who, and many sporting organisations which, assisted the people in the aftermath of the flooding.</p> <p> Many promises were made in the days after the flood, as well as numerous assurances by Government representatives.  Now that the television cameras and the national media have left, it is time to test the Government's commitment.  The promises made on the ground in August should not be lessened in any way.  The Government should not renege on them because we will not allow it to do so.</p> <p> When the local improvement schemes were announced with a blaze of publicity, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, told the people of Donegal that 80% of the roads would be covered.  Now we find out there is only funding for 4%.  A specific additional allocation should have been made for Inishowen, not an allocation with a substitute for the rest of the county.  There are hundreds of local authority roads but no funding provided for them.  How many of the 4% of those roads which will qualify in Donegal will be in Inishowen?  I doubt it will be many.</p> <p> The Minister of State&rsquo;s office will make statements about c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanglann and an extra &euro;30,000.  However, the Department will then say it made a mistake and it should be &euro;28,000 less.  There is no joined-up thinking whatsoever.  We will hold the Government to account again, but that is for another day and another time.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an fh&iacute;rinne searbh.</p>  <p>  Priority needs to be given flood defences in our county.  When I, along with the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and Deputy Pearse Doherty, visited the Castlefinn Partnership Initiative, we saw the Government and council made no contribution whatsoever.  All the flood defences were carried out by locals.  I hope we do not have a repeat of this in Inishowen.</p>  <p>  Why did the Government not apply for EU solidarity funding?  I was in Europe when the Shannon burst its banks.  At the last minute, at the 11th hour, I convinced the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, to apply for it.  He instructed the Department to apply for funding.  We were told it did not tick the boxes or fit the criteria.  However, we got &euro;13 million from it.  That was &euro;13 million less of a burden on the Exchequer.  Now the Government has decided not to apply for solidarity funding, despite the fact the UK Government secured &euro;60 million from the same fund with Brexit looming.  Is it too much work?  Should the Government have not applied?  I suggest the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, should look at this again.  However, I am afraid it might be too late.</p>  <p>  Donegal County Council has applied for &euro;15 million, a conservative figure.  That is to be additional over and above what will be provided by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There should be ring-fenced funding for sporting facilities.  We must ensure there is provision to compensate farmers who have lost crops because of adverse weather conditions.</p>  <p>  There is a legal and moral responsibility on the Government to deliver on the promises made.  It is critical that the necessary investment is provided without delay.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s work in dealing with flooding issues as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on flood relief.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks, the Minister of State will receive an invitation from the Oireachtas finance committee to deal with legislative scrutiny of the Flood Insurance Bill 2016, a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It passed Second Stage in November of last year and has been in the queue for scrutiny since then.  Scrutiny will happen in October.  The Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach will hear from Fianna F&aacute;il, as sponsors of the Bill, all stakeholders, including Insurance Ireland, the Minister of State and the Irish Flood Forum, which has been consistently raising the issue of areas where OPW food relief schemes have been completed but flood insurance cover has not been reinstated.  We heard tonight from Deputy Healy, who represents Clonmel, where an expensive scheme was completed and has worked.</p>  <p>  A different solution is needed for communities where the risk of flooding remains.  We cannot compel the insurance industry to insure against a risk which is approaching a certainty that there will be another flood event.  Over the next five years, the State will invest more than &euro;400 million on a range of flood relief schemes.  The OPW is a competent authority.  Where it has completed these schemes, they have proved to be effective.  There is a reasonable expectation that insurance cover would follow suit.</p>  <p>  We all know the consequences for households which cannot get insurance cover.  I have stood in homes in Cork which have been flooded three or four times.  They have no cover anymore and they will not get it back.  For businesses trying to access credit, the banks will look at their insurance policies.  If there is a big gap in their cover because they are in an area at risk or one which has a previous history of flooding, they will not get the credit they may need to survive or to expand.  It is a key issue which is going to have to be addressed.</p>  <p>  In the Government's amendment to this motion, it quotes figures about the level of flood cover in areas where schemes have been completed.  Those are industry figures and they should be challenged.  If we had not challenged the insurance industry on motor insurance premiums, for example, I do not think we would have reached the worst stage of motor insurance hikes at this point.  We challenged the industry and we have made some progress.  The Government needs to do the same with flood insurance.  Having a memorandum of understanding and sharing information with the industry is not sufficient.</p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging further with the Minister of State over the coming weeks where we can get into the detail of the Flood Insurance Bill.  We can see how it might be able to assist communities which have benefitted from major investment and have flood defence schemes completed which are actually working.  That is the central purpose of that Bill.</p></speech>

If I leave anybody out, I will come back to them with a written response or meet them personally.  My heart goes out to the people of Donegal.  On the Tuesday morning of the flooding, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I postponed our engagements and headed to Donegal to see first hand the effects of the floods.  The three days and two nights I spent in Donegal were all too familiar to me as somebody who has experienced flooding over several years.  I have seen the suffering all too many times.</p>  <p>  We would all love for the Government to do an awful lot more.  However, how to deal with the deluge of rain which came to Donegal at that particular time would be hard for any Government.  This is not about politics but about people.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, will be published.  The people waiting for this can be assured this is under way.</p><p>My Department has met Donegal County Council on two occasions and there was another meeting yesterday.  It is difficult to solve the problems.  It is not just about building walls or digging canals, but putting infrastructure in place so if this happens again it can cope with such a deluge of rain.  The gullies and culverts will be prepared to take it so people will not have to suffer.  Then we must examine what are called minor works schemes, such as minor works in terms of walls, and major schemes in terms of what emerges from CFRAM.  Whatever needs to be done by my Department will be done for the people of Donegal.</p> <p> My Department has been invited to meet the elected members in Donegal on 10 October.  I have spoken to many of those members and I have given an assurance that I will be there that night.  However, I wish to give a commitment when I go there that a programme of works will be started and completed to ensure, to the best of my and the Department's ability, that this devastation does not happen again.</p> <p> A number of queries were put to me about insurance.  Since I returned from Donegal I, along with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, have spoken to Insurance Ireland.  We put forward the same questions the Deputy raised.  We are waiting for a response to them.</p> <p> Members of Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il have spoken a great deal about budgets.  Not one Member from either party has met with me about budgetary matters, what is required or what those parties wish to put forward on behalf of the people they represent.  I have done that.  People say nothing has happened.  I am in this job for almost four months.  In those four months, I have had machines operating on the lower end of the Shannon, something people have told me for the past 30 or 40 years could never happen.  It is not one machine but a number of machines.  We are not doing one job, but seven jobs.  We also have machines operating on the outskirts of Athlone on a major scheme.  People might say that is because it is in my constituency.  This scheme was prioritised and had to happen for the people of Athlone.</p> <p> With regard to the upper Shannon, yesterday I spoke to people in the Office of Public Works about Jamestown and the issues I had examined when I visited.  I am hoping to have a meeting in the near future with the stakeholders there, Waterways Ireland, to see if we can fast-track help in that regard.  Many people talk about channel cleaning.  I hope to announce a pilot scheme for two counties in the next week to ten days.  I will give the reason for picking two.  There is what I call the red tape scenario, but let us not look at it from that point of view.  Let us look at it from the point of view of the IFA, the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service so we can overcome the issues that face the local authorities.  I will not be found wanting with regard to funding to support such programmes.  I have two counties in mind and I will announce them in the next ten days.</p> <p> Questions were raised about climate change.  The Government must consider climate change in a more serious manner.  I am not fully up to date with the issue of climate change but I know from what happened in Donegal and in other parts of the country that climate change is a huge problem and we must deal with it.</p> <p> With regard to Cork, I have visited Cork, Kerry and almost all of the places that are subject to flooding.  Recently, we announced a major scheme for the people of Clonakilty.  On the visit I made I saw at first hand the consequences those people face.  The fact that we can announce the scheme now shows the proactive work of the Government.  Cork has probably the biggest scheme the State will ever undertake.  I have heard the debate among politicians across this House, I have read newspaper articles and I have heard what people say.  I have also heard what the people of Cork had to say when I visited their shops and met them on the street.  They said: "Minister, will you get on with building the walls?  Will you protect us?  We cannot wait for a redesign or a barrage to be built."  I am not saying that we will not build it.  However, I am referring to the submissions I have received in the Department.  I look at the submissions, I have met the people from Save Cork City and I have met the people on the ground.  I also acknowledge the good work of the OPW.  Every scheme it has built to date has been trialled and tested and has worked.</p> <p> Se&aacute;n Hogan is here for the debate.  As a result of Cork and the meeting the co-ordination group held, it was signalled across every Department by him as chairman that whatever was required for Donegal was to be forthcoming.  That will remain the case as long as we are helping the people of Donegal.  I can give that assurance.</p> <p> There are questions about how to respond to flooding.  I issued a paper to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, a few days ago on what I believe is necessary in the future when something such as this happens.  One agency within a single Department should deal with it.  Some Members were critical tonight of Met &Eacute;ireann.  Have those critics gone to visit Met &Eacute;ireann, seen what the people there are doing and asked them what they intend to do in the future?  Met &Eacute;ireann is doing the best it can with what is available to it.  We have a new flood project with Met &Eacute;ireann - I am afraid I cannot pronounce its name - to help with future flooding in terms of helping to forecast what might happen.  I also consulted with my Department and different bodies on producing an app so that we might be able to help people.  Everybody has a smart phone now.  If one knew what amount of rain was falling, what gates were open on the Shannon and the amount of water going through Ardnacrusha or Parteen Weir, it could be a major help for a farmer or an ordinary home dweller who can look at this all day, every day.</p> <p> There are other issues I am examining aside from what is in this document relating to the home protection scheme.  We are all aware of that.  Some 69 people have shown expressions of interest in that.  It is another major step by the Government that people do not give it credit for.  There are also the criteria for the minor works scheme and the rolling out of more schemes to help people in areas throughout the country.  Let nobody say that nothing is happening under my watch.  That might have been the case under other people's watches, but while I am the Minister for as long as the people leave me here or for as long as this Government lasts, I can assure people that I will leave no stone unturned until I have a plan in place, so that if whoever comes after me follows that plan they will not have people roaring and giving out that nothing is being done.  I assure Members that when they get a chance to sit where I am they will find it is not as easy as putting a digger in the ground or removing a few stones.  There are defined rules, guidelines and regulations.  We must work with the people.</p> <p> The ESB, Waterways Ireland, the local authorities, the OPW, Se&aacute;n Hogan's people, the IFA, the IFI and in particular the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is condemned the most, have all been tremendous to me in my job since the day I took office.  All Ministers, ranging from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have been forthcoming in meeting what I require.  My line Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach have been 100% behind what I am trying to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-09-26a.510" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="22:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600056#DDD00200"><p>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  They were much appreciated and the debate was most constructive.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, was not present for the start of the debate so I wish to acknowledge his travelling to Donegal the day after the flooding and the time he spent there observing the extent of the damage.  The time he gave was very prompt, necessary and appreciated.  I also acknowledge Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan's role and his courtesy in carrying out that role.</p><p>Some good and important points were made in this debate.  My party's objective in tabling the motion is to ensure lessons are learned about what could have been done better in response to flooding on Inishowen and address some remaining weaknesses and failures.</p> <p> Deputy Michael McGrath spoke very well on the issue of insurance cover, which the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, also acknowledged.  The motion calls for progress to be made on enacting a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill in this area, which will be crucial.  It also calls on the Oireachtas to explore the options available to households unable to obtain insurance, including an examination of the model introduced in the United Kingdom.</p> <p> With regard to the necessity to fully implement the capital funding allocation, the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, spoke about the budgets available to him.  A sum of &euro;431 million has been allocated for flood alleviation in the period up to 2020.  It is crucial that this funding is drawn down and there are no delays in using it for flood mitigation measures.  The Ministers of State, Deputy Moran and Deputy McHugh, and a number of other politicians visited Burnfoot in County Donegal where they saw flooding in the P&aacute;irc an Ghrian&aacute;n housing estate.  I corresponded with the Department before the floods on the need for flood mitigation measures on the estate.  However, the Department recommended that works should not be carried out.  The Minister of State will have seen the results of that decision.  The adjacent estate, Lios na Greine, was also flooded. </p> <p> The implementation of the CFRAM study has been delayed and must be expedited.  The measures required as a result of the study must be introduced.  The budget for its implementation has been allocated and must be used for that purpose.  There must be no further delays in rolling out the programme. </p> <p> Previous speakers raised the issue of river cleaning.  There is a gap in respect of who has responsibility for cleaning rivers.  In County Donegal and other counties no agency has responsibility for this.  While the cleaning of rivers would not have prevented the recent flooding on Inishowen, it is an ongoing contributory factor in many flooding events.  The nettle must be grasped and the issued addressed to ensure some agency is given responsibility for cleaning rivers.  I have no doubt local authorities would be willing to assume this role if they were given responsibility and the funding required for the task. </p> <p> I again commend the ongoing work of those whom I thanked in my earlier contribution.  Many more months of work lie ahead.  Donegal County Council continues to do this work well and it is important that it receive support from the Minister of State.  I acknowledge the work of the councillors of Inishowen municipal district who worked exceptionally hard, night and day, with officials from Donegal County Council to ensure a good response to the flood damage.  I particularly acknowledge the work of my party's councillors in the district, Martin McDermott, Rena Donaghey and Paul Canning.  All the councillors in the municipal district continue to press this issue.</p> <p> As the motion states, the response to the flooding on Inishowen was not good enough in many instances.  The Minister of State indicated he wished to address many of the issues that have arisen.  I thanked him earlier for his quick response and for visiting the area, as did many other Ministers and politicians.  Notwithstanding this, it was a week before it was announced that the Red Cross would provide support to small businesses and sporting and voluntary organisations.  During that week, people stood in mud and water with lost stock and without support for their businesses.  As the Minister of State will acknowledge, this was not good enough.  We must learn lessons to ensure this does not happen again.</p> <p> It took two weeks for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to agree to establish a fund to provide financial support to the agriculture sector.  People had to wait a further week for application forms to become available.  In the meantime, many farms had been devastated, with rubble in fields, stock lost and fences broken.  Repair work should be ongoing but, as of today, none of the affected farmers has received funding.  Money should have been provided promptly to allow work to commence.  Lessons need to be learned because the response in this case was not good enough.</p> <p> As well as learning lessons, we must address a number of issues immediately, including funding for sporting organisations.  As I outlined, Cockhill Celtic soccer club has been without two pitches for five weeks.  The pitches will need to be completely relaid, which will probably cost in excess of &euro;100,000.  The club has still not been informed that it will receive funding for this work.  This is not for a new development, which would be covered by sport capital allocations, but to restore existing facilities.  It is not good enough that the club has been left picking up the pieces without financial support.  It should have been given a commitment that it would receive the funding it requires.  The motion calls for the provision of this funding and, if passed, as I expect, the Government must follow through by providing it. </p> <p> Swan Park in Buncrana is a fantastic public amenity used by hundreds of people every day.  Substantial investment in recent years enabled the park to be incrementally developed into a fantastic facility.  After the flooding, it needs to be rebuilt.  However, the Government has not given a commitment to ensure the park is restored to its former state.  The motion calls on the Government to make such a commitment and I hope it will deliver it. </p> <p> Likewise, Gleneven Waterfall in Clonmany is a tremendous tourist attraction which was developed by the local community over a period of years.  Much restoration work has already been done, with supplies and labour being provided free of charge.  However, the community needs a commitment of support from the Government, as called for in the motion. </p> <p> Inexplicably, a number of farmers have been left out of the scheme that has been announced.  I know one farmer who lost 40 acres of grain and 60 acres of potatoes as a result of the flooding.  He harvested his barley crop, at a low yield, after the flooding but the veterinary advice was that it could not be used because of the risk of contamination.  This farmer has been entirely excluded from the fund the Government belatedly announced.  The funding available has been capped at &euro;15,000, which would not go very far in meeting his losses.  We must engage with the European Union to ascertain whether it will provide flexibility on offering additional support.  As matters stand, the farmer in question has been excluded from the fund, which is scandalous.  The motion calls for this issue to be addressed.  Five weeks after the flooding occurred, it should not be the case that this farmer has not received assistance.  Other farmers who lost potatoes and second crop silage have also been excluded from the agricultural fund, as have farmers on whose land roads were washed away.  The motion calls for these farmers to be included in the scheme and for the Government to provide support.  This must be done now. </p> <p> I welcome the support for the motion expressed by Deputies across the House.  I also welcome the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, which I am pleased to accept.  I am disappointed the Government's amendment does not deal with the substantive points raised in the motion or provide the commitments on the issues I have outlined.  It is crucial these commitments are provided.  We cannot accept the Government amendment on that basis.  I hope the House will support the motion.  I ask sincerely that the Government act on it and learn lessons in terms of what can be done better.  It must also act now to address the issues I have raised and provide the support many people need at this very difficult time.</p></speech>
