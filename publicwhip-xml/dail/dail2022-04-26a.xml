    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600003#A00200"><p>The days of the mass harvesting of turf are over.  This is best underscored by the fact that Bord na M&oacute;na has moved from its traditional brown peat business to become a leading and profitable champion of renewables.  The Government's proposed outright ban on the sale of turf has caused real distress and frustration for rural communities.  The proposal is unfair, unworkable and should not go ahead.  The timing of the proposed ban could not be worse, as people are being hammered by the cost-of-living crisis that has seen energy bills go through the roof and that has put enormous pressure on people&rsquo;s pockets.  For many families in rural Ireland, turf is their one affordable way of heating their homes.  Their only credible alternative is home heating oil, the price of which, as the Taoiseach knows, has doubled in the past year.  Yet the Government has sat on its hands on this score.  Nothing has been done to reduce these extortionate prices.  In fact, the Government's actions will drive these costs higher.</p>  <p>  It is therefore not hard to see why people in rural households are so frustrated because the Government is placing them between a rock and a hard place.  It will ban the source of fuel on which they depend while, at the same time, refusing to tackle the soaring cost of the alternative.  How is that fair?  The ban on the sale of turf is a punishment for people who have no alternative way to heat their home.  It will be particularly hard on older people and those who are on low incomes living in rural communities.</p>  <p>  The Government's ineptitude in its handling of this proposed ban has been nothing short of astonishing.  Deputies and Ministers are at sixes and sevens, sowing mass confusion and spreading mixed messages.  Over the Easter break, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, rode a merry-go-round of contradictions.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, said the ban was going ahead.  The T&aacute;naiste then said the ban was being paused.  The Minister then responded by saying the ban is not being paused.  The Government did not seem to know if it was coming or going.  Then, on Sunday last, just to muddy the waters even further, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said on the radio that the guidelines for the ban are only in draft.  All the while, Government backbenchers - Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in rural areas - are falling over themselves to tell their constituents they do not support the proposed ban, with one going so far as to call the whole affair daft.  They claim it is all the work of the Green Party and nothing to do with them.  Those Deputies will have their golden opportunity this evening to show the people they represent that they are actually serious.  They can put a stop to the ban on the sale of turf by voting for the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an plean at&aacute; molta ag an Rialtas chun cosc a chur ar mh&oacute;n a dh&iacute;ol m&iacute;chothram agus do-oibrithe.</p> <p>N&iacute; fh&eacute;adfadh an t-am a bheith n&iacute;os measa, nuair at&aacute; oibrithe agus teaghlaigh ag streachailt le bill&iacute; fuinnimh, at&aacute; ag ard&uacute;, a &iacute;oc.  Cuireann an cosc seo pion&oacute;s ar theaghlaigh thuaithe nach bhfuil aon bhealach eile acu a dtithe a th&eacute;amh.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir leis an gcosc seo dul ar aghaidh.</p> <p> What we need right now is clarity on what exactly has been agreed by Cabinet.  Households who rely on turf to heat their homes need certainty as to what they face into.  The certainty that the Taoiseach should and must give them is to make absolutely clear that this turf sale ban will go no further.  I invite the Taoiseach to give that assurance to those households today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600004#B00200"><p>In the first instance, in a wide ranging presentation, Deputy McDonald said the Government had been doing nothing on the cost of living.  I need to disabuse her of that statement.  That is a completely false statement to assert because the Government has worked extremely hard and consistently in easing - not by any means mitigating in total - the cost of living increases that have occurred in recent times.  Over &euro;2 billion has now been allocated since the budget to try to alleviate pressure on people, particularly people on the fuel allowance.  There has been a 55% increase in the fuel allowance from the previous year.  We are now paying out around &euro;1,139 this year, including a &euro;125 lump sum, another &euro;100 that will be paid in the coming weeks and the increases in the budget.  That is a fairly dramatic increase in the fuel allowance by this Government in a very short space of time.  We have reduced the excise duty on petrol, diesel and green diesel until mid-October, saving motorists between &euro;9 and &euro;12 each time they fill their tank.  We have reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October, resulting in estimated annual savings of &euro;50 and &euro;70, respectively, for households.  This month households are seeing the &euro;200 energy credit appearing on their bills.  We will reduce the annual Public Service Obligation, PSO, levy from &euro;58 to zero by October 2022.</p></speech>

There is much more in terms of the work we have done for hauliers.  The idea that we have done nothing is a falsehood to articulate in this House.  There is much more that we have done.

It is important that we protect the rights of people in rural Ireland in terms of turbary rights, people utilising turf in their own bogs and traditional practices in turf sharing.  They are not being banned at all.</p></speech>

There is no ban on the gifting of peat by those with rights to harvest sod peat.</p>  <p>  What Deputy McDonald needs to be very careful of is the fact that the big issue here is the coal industry; that is the big villain of the piece here.  Back in the early 1990s, the former Minister Mary Harney introduced a ban on smoky coal that was transformative in terms of air quality in this city and other large cities around the country but I noticed that in her presentation Deputy McDonald did not mention air quality once.  It is about time now that people played this fair, down the middle and had a balanced debate on it because unfortunately, there are areas around the country which are above WHO levels in terms of poor air quality and that is not acceptable.  We have to take that on board.  Ireland was above the European Environmental Agency, EEA, reference levels for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, a toxic chemical, at four monitoring sites due to the burning of solid fuels.</p></speech>

He has accepted that the ban as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is utterly wrong and utterly unfair and will leave people in rural Ireland, particularly older people and people on lower incomes in a really difficult place.  I invite the Taoiseach again to clarify that there will be no ban and that the proposed ban, whether it is the finished item or in draft form, is officially from today ditched and assurance is given to people living in rural Ireland not alone that they can harvest their own turf but that those who do not have turbary rights can access that turf to burn in their grates to heat their homes.  That is what we need.  We need clarity.  The Taoiseach should not talk in riddles.  He should tell us that the madcap, half-baked, unfair notion advanced by Eamon Ryan is now officially ditched.</p></speech>

Is it the Taoiseach's Government or the permanent government?  We know the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Robert Watt, is in a rarefied position, not least because his pay grade is above the Taoiseach's.  Does that mean he can snub or thumb his nose at attending Oireachtas committees and decline to be held accountable for decisions he takes?  The same Secretary General thinks so little of the Oireachtas finance committee that he did not even bother responding to its request for a meeting tomorrow to discuss the botched appointment of Tony Holohan to a position in Trinity College Dublin.</p><p>There was a significant &euro;20 million sum associated with this proposed secondment and the finance committee is tasked with investigating State spending so why will the Secretary General and the Minister for Health not appear before that committee?  How on Earth does the Taoiseach expect D&aacute;il committees to have any authority in their functions and, for example, convince people in semi-State sectors or the private sector to appear before them if civil servants on very high salaries refuse to do so?  Who exactly is calling the shots?  It is certainly not the Ministers.</p><p>We learned in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner</i>that the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, cannot even get a meeting with HSE managers in individual community CHO areas around the country.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, requested those meetings from the managers of the nine different CHO areas, she was told it was not &quot;operationally feasible&quot;.  She was contacted not just by individual managers but by the national director of community operations, who essentially told the Minister of State to get back in her box.  We know disability services are in crisis and the High Court has ruled very recently that the HSE's current treatment of assessment of needs for children is illegal.  The Minister of State cannot get a 40-minute meeting once a month with HSE managers.</p><p>Do Ministers in the Government have authority over the Departments they oversee?  To her credit, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was trying to get answers and to the root of what is causing the rot in the disability sector.  We know different CHO areas perform differently and there is a variety of reasons for that.  Some perform way better than others so it is perfectly legitimate for the Minister of State to seek those individual meetings.</p><p>Who is running the country?  Is it the Government or the permanent government?  Is the Taoiseach happy that senior civil servants are snubbing invitations to Oireachtas committees?  What will the Taoiseach do about civil servants refusing to meet his Ministers?  Do elections and democracy matter?  Who is running this country?  What is happening is really frustrating many people.</p></speech>

Directly elected Members of this House pass legislation and our fundamental and basic laws on an annual and sessional basis.  The power lies in this House in terms of legislation and raising issues on a timely basis.  With any funding initiatives and so on, the elected Government and the Oireachtas sanction the Estimates of various Departments.</p> <p>Any individual proposals, and so on, have to go through the various procedures that are laid down.  There is no escaping that at the end of the day.  In respect of Oireachtas committees, my understanding is that the Minister has not refused to attend, and has made this clear in communications with the Chair of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The Minister has said that an external review has been commissioned.  From my perspective, it would seem logical that we allow the external review to conclude in a matter of weeks, which would then feed into any consideration by any Oireachtas committee.  I think a number of Oireachtas committees - certainly two - have indicated an interest in the matter.  It is something we need to resolve.  I do not believe, as someone articulated yesterday, that the same people should go before three committees; namely, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach; the Joint Committee on Health; and potentially the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p> Certainly, there are issues here that need to be dealt with and addressed, including from a health research perspective.  The secondment of the CMO was a proposal that did not go ahead in the end.  As I have said repeatedly, it is regrettable that the entire situation happened in the manner that it did.  There was some merit in the idea of building up capacity and pandemic preparedness into the future and learning lessons from our experience over the last two years in relation to the pandemic, which was a once-in-a-century event.  As a country, we did relatively well compared to other countries in dealing with the pandemic and the crisis.  All the people involved in that, in the public health arena and elsewhere, deserve credit for that.  However, there has to be due process and procedure in relation to this issue.  In my view, the sensible way to proceed is to allow the external review to conclude.  It will not take too long.  It is a matter for the House, ultimately.  I am not dictating on it.  It is then a matter for the committees to proceed with it.  I think we might have a more comprehensive, informed position in relation to it if we allow the review to conclude.  The Minister has made it clear to me that he has no issue in coming before a committee, but he believes that there is a sequencing that would make sense.</p></speech>

There was &euro;20 million involved here.  It is perfectly legitimate for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to interrogate that.  The committees are committees of this House, not committees of the Government.  If there is an external review, it is an issue for the Government or the Department.  As with Sl&aacute;intecare, for example, an all-party approach is needed.  When the head of the HSE and the Secretary General met with the Joint Committee on Health recently in relation to Sl&aacute;intecare, it was very clear that they do not want to implement Sl&aacute;intecare in full.  The permanent government was making that decision.  The permanent government is telling the Committee of Public Accounts that we cannot have a report or discuss the cost of the national children's hospital.  We keep being told that lessons are being learned, yet we do not learn lessons.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability services is being refused access to the people who are on the front line on the operational side.  The Taoiseach knows, as do I and everyone else in this House, that there is a very significant problem with disability services.  It is absolutely improper to refuse the Minister of State access to the staff in order to interrogate the issue and understand what it is going on so it can be resolved.</p></speech>

I did not get a chance to deal with that issue in my first three minutes.  Indeed, I work with the Minister of State and, in my view, there has to be a review of the progressing disability services programme.  I will be meeting with the Minister of State and the CEO of the HSE in relation to that in a while, to deal more comprehensively with disability services.  The progressing disability services programme is, advertently or inadvertently, taking some resources from special schools, for example, which I do not think is an acceptable way to go.  I have held this view for a long time.  To be fair to the HSE, the progressing disability services programme has been progressing for quite a number of years under successive governments.  It is important that we evaluate it, but also work to ensure we do not dilute existing resources in existing locations as that policy is being rolled out.</p> <p>That is a particular concern of the Minster of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  She holds monthly meetings with all nine HSE CHO disability managers in attendance, alongside the HSE headquarters management team.  Nonetheless, the Minister of State should always be in a position to meet any team in any location across the country.</p> <p> In regard to broader matters, it is important to point out that the issue the Deputy relates in terms of secondment was paused.</p></speech>

I have stood here many times, complaining of the issue at hand, and that is that our carers are not available to deliver the home care support service.  It is not all about the fact we cannot get carers.  It is about the system in general.  Despite the fact we have the best paid civil servant as the head of the Department of Health and we have three Ministers all appointed in the Taoiseach's time, nothing is changing.  In fact, it is getting worse.  We have a Minister and two Ministers of State and we have a home care support system that cannot deliver care on a seven-day basis to a person who, up to his accident, was a 74-year-old tax-paying farmer, who was taken home by his wife and family to be cared for at home.  He is now paraplegic.  I have had Mr. Cummins&rsquo;s name on the floor of the D&aacute;il before.  Despite the fact the accident happened and he returned home last October, he still only receives five-day care, one hour in the morning and one in the evening.  I cannot get an answer from the head of that department in CHO 5, Helen McDaid.  I have sent numerous emails, which are not even acknowledged, never mind addressed, and I cannot get a return phone call despite leaving several messages.  Mrs. Cummins has suffered Covid and is not in the same position as she was to deliver her own care for her husband yet we cannot get an answer from CHO 5.  I empathise greatly with Deputy Rabbitte not being able to get an answer, and she is the Minister of State.</p><p>I believe that, as the Head of Government, it is the Taoiseach's job to address this.  Let me read him something that is even more tragic and which was on our local radio this morning.  It was a call to the &ldquo;Morning Mix&rdquo; on Wexford local radio from Sharon Colgan.  Sharon suffers with cerebral palsy and this past weekend she was left alone in a bed that she cannot get out of for 19 hours, with no food, no water and no toileting.  She slept and sat in her own urine for seven hours.  That is the home care support system that we have.  If we cannot do better, we should be ashamed of ourselves.</p><p>I have here the rote letter that the HSE sends back every time:</p> <blockquote> 	The home support service operates within the constraints of available staffing resources, which impacts directly on the ability of the service to be delivered in its entirety.  There are significant challenges in sourcing home support services at present. </blockquote>  <p>Yes, there are: lazy admin staff.  I have spoken to many carers who know what the answer is.  We have staff whose clients go into hospital yet they are not put on a rota to look after anybody else.  Can the Taoiseach please address this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600008#F00500"><p>First, I appreciate the issues the Deputy has raised and the individual cases she has raised.  It is not satisfactory that any person would have to go through that in regard to access to home care.  The issue, as the Deputy knows, is not one of funding now because &euro;150 million of additional funding was provided in 2021 to provide for 5 million more hours of home support, and that funding is being maintained in 2022.  That obviously required significantly enhanced recruitment, and it has become a recruitment issue.  The total number of people waiting for home support across the system has gone down from 9,000 at the start of 2020 to about 4,500 now, at the end of this month.  We want to get that down to zero.  That will mean recruitment and reducing and getting rid of barriers to recruitment, and there is work under way on that, as the Deputy knows, in terms of the group that has been established to deal with specific obstacles to recruiting carers, home carers in particular.</p> <p>I will ask the Minister of State to work with the Deputy in respect of those two cases.  Across Wexford, the numbers waiting have come down from approximately 700 to 400 and a targeted approach is being adopted.</p> <p> Very significant initiatives were taken in the last budget around carers.  It straddles a number of Departments, including the Department of Social Protection.  We have a Minister of State dealing with the area of additional hours and home help hours in particular.  Very significant progress was made in securing resources.  The biggest challenge we have right now is recruiting people to work in home care capacities.  That is the biggest challenge facing us.  That is something on which we have to do better, notwithstanding the progress that has been made in respect of external recruitment into the country as well.</p></speech>

I have given him just two examples of my constituents.  I could give him 102 examples but I only have three minutes.  Rather than see the Taoiseach shake his head, I want to see an audit of how administration is being carried out.  Most carers are tasked with delivering 26 hours.  Does the Taoiseach know what the average delivery is?  It is 19 hours.  There are always seven hours going a-begging that nobody seems to take care of.  I know this because I have talked to the previous staff.  I have had exit interviews with staff who have left the HSE, which the HSE clearly does not even do.</p>  <p>  It is about time the Taoiseach stops making excuses and blaming the tools, and starts to look at the real issues.  It is not just about recruitment.  There are many issues.  We need key performance indicators, KPIs, for the staff to whom the Taoiseach has given the highest level of wages in this country.  They are the ones who are responsible for seeing that this is working.  It is not working but it is in place to keep people in their homes, to keep the taxpayer giving them value for money and to allow people to be cared for in their homes.

The first was that Irish people should grow salad on south-facing windowsills to ensure food supplies during Covid-19.  The second was to tell drivers to slow down on the motorway to save fuel.  The third was to have one car in the village to which people from rural communities should cycle and use to go to work.  The fourth was to stop people from burning turf and he will not arrest grannies if they do so.</p> <p>All these weird announcements are, one way or another, being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  It is making the country a laughing stock throughout the world.  Another damaging announcement made by the Minister for Transport recently was the 20% cut in public transport fares, as well as the proposed 50% cut in fares for students and young people availing of those services.  One would say this should be welcome.  If it goes ahead, however, it will have a disastrous effect in rural communities, as no local commercial operator can avail of the 20% or 50% reductions.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il with the Minister as soon as he announced the 20% decrease in early April, but he still railroaded ahead with it, wiping every private operator off this decrease, leaving many of those with struggling businesses asking if they can survive.</p> <p> The local commercial or private operators, as we all know, were still reeling from that shock when the Minister announced in the last fortnight that he is railroading ahead with a 50% decrease in fares for students and young people.  Again, this is to be welcomed.  Again he has nothing put in place for private operators to pass this decrease on to the students mainly in rural Ireland.  He said that technical and funding issues were preventing him.  This 50% decrease will benefit those who travel on Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Luas, trains, the DART and Dublin Bus.  These are all Dublin city-type transport, which I do not want to begrudge.</p> <p> There are private operators, such as West Cork Connects which carries 80% of the passengers on west Cork routes, has buses leaving Skibbereen and Bantry every hour on the hour every day passing through Clonakilty and Bandon to Cork on one side and from Dunmanway, Ballineen and Innishannon and to Cork on the other.  This service has opened up west Cork.  This local commercial operator is employing many staff in west Cork, but it is not allowed to pass on the recent 20% decrease, or the proposed 50% decrease, to west Cork students.  This is not just putting that operator's business in jeopardy, but also that of Wexford Bus, Cobh Connect, Aircoach, GoBus and Citylink.  All these operators, and many more, are facing the same wipe out.  This is another gaffe by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Minister.</p> <p> On top of this direct hit to the young people of rural communities who depend on private operators to connect their communities, can the Taoiseach tell me why his Government wants to wipe out private operators?  Unlike Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Luas, Dublin Bus, the DART and the train, these private operators have to pay their own staff, fuel and daily wear-and-tear on vehicles.  Instead of encouraging these operators, in the context of the so-called Connecting Ireland dream, the Government is going to disconnect transport completely in rural Ireland.  Why was what should have been such a positive announcement by this anti-rural Government not held off until everyone, rural and urban, could avail of this decrease?</p> <p> This Government&rsquo;s decision will see private bus companies being forced out of business by State-backed cuts and leave them contemplating taking legal action.  Not only is this unfair, but it is anti-competitive as well.  Seeing as the Minister for Transport cannot get this right, will the Taoiseach step in and treat everyone in rural and urban Ireland the same when it comes to this decrease in fares for our youth?</p></speech>

It is very important that we reduce public transport fares, and the Minister for Transport can do that readily within the legal frameworks.  It is not as easy with the private transport issue.  We will continue to look at that to see how we can be supportive.  The Government was very supportive of all the transport network during Covid-19 pandemic, for example.  Perhaps the Deputy might also like to acknowledge that too.  I refer to public and private enterprises, in transport and elsewhere.  The Government therefore does not have any position that is anti private transport as suggested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Also, across a broad swathe of policies, the Government is very pro-rural Ireland.  The Government has invested hugely in rural Ireland across the board and we will continue to do so in a whole range of ways.  The Brexit adjustment reserve fund, for example, is being worked on by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath with a view to ensuring significant funding goes to the parts of rural Ireland impacted by Brexit, for example, and by challenges with the fishing industry.  We have been very strong in respect of agriculture and rural development.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, has been very strong regarding community hubs throughout rural Ireland.  There have been substantial investments.  I refer to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the various funding for towns across rural Ireland in the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, in conjunction with and complementing the work of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.</p> <p>If you go through any Department, very significant allocations have been made for rural Ireland.  We want to rebalance the economic development of this country.  We believe there is an over-concentration and we have to rebalance that into the future.  We want to develop strong regional cities like Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway that will then strengthen the rural hinterlands of those cities.  Public transport is all over west Cork as well.  It does not have the same frequency but it is in most towns in west Cork and is complemented by private transport.  School transport is a State-funded scheme but it is predominantly provided by private operators.  The Deputy should know that.  That is just the way it has always worked in terms of CI&Eacute; outsourcing to private transport operators.</p> <p> In respect of the specific issue the Deputy raised, the Minister will continue to look to see what he can do to support private operators.  We should not stop implementing a good policy in reducing fares for young people in particular.  I think it is a very good idea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600011#J00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his answer but I do not think he quite grasps what the question was all about.  He spent about two minutes talking about fishing and farming.  Good God, he should come down to west Cork and talk to the fishermen and farmers.  He will not be long there; he will be run out of it quickly.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has to be straight with the public here.  Outside of Dublin the local commercial bus operators are the biggest operators in the country, carrying out 30 million passenger trips yearly, mainly in rural Ireland.  In a recent meeting with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the private operators asked straight up why they were not included in the 20% bus decrease for young people on their buses.  They were told it was for financial reasons that the Minister could not go ahead with it.  To the whole country's astonishment, a few weeks later, he announces a 50% decrease, again excluding young people in rural Ireland.  Where did this Minister find the money that he did not have a few weeks earlier?  Was it carbon tax money robbed from the hard-working people of rural Ireland?  The local commercial operators are convinced this Minister wants to wipe them out of business and basically get rid of them.  One of them asked me why he does not just come out and be honest about it and not drip-feed, destroying their business day by day.  Can the Taoiseach tell me today that this is not a fact?  What is the exact date that local commercial bus operators will be allowed to pass on the same decrease allowed for all Dublin city travellers to students in rural communities?</p></speech>

It concerns the facts that the finance committee wrote to Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, that it has actively sought information pertaining to the proposed secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan to Trinity College Dublin and that it has sought all the information pertaining to the clearance of up to &euro;20 million in public moneys associated with that move.  It also concerns the facts that the Department has not provided that information, that the Minister and indeed Mr. Watt himself refused to appear before the committee and that the committee has now written for a second time to the Secretary General of the Department of Health.</p></speech>

It is wholly unacceptable that a Minister or senior civil servant not only refuses to co-operate with a committee of this House but also acts to actively frustrate its work.  We need a substantive response from the Taoiseach on this matter to make it very clear to his own ministerial team and, perhaps more important, the public administration &mdash; senior civil servants, including Mr. Watt himself &mdash; that Mr. Watt has no authority or role in frustrating the work of any committee, the committee in this case being the finance committee of this House.</p></speech>

I outlined detailed proposals and asked that we discuss the issue this week.  We now have a housing emergency on top of a housing emergency; it is a matter of vital urgency.  If the Minister is asking for opinions &mdash; I have certainly furnished mine &mdash; we need to debate them.  I understand he has briefed the Cabinet on proposals.  Are we going to discuss this matter?  I think we can have a win&ndash;win whereby we seriously impact upon the housing and homelessness crisis and accommodate Ukrainian refugees, but it will take unprecedented emergency measures.  These need to be debated as a matter of urgency in this House.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to make time available this week to have that discussion.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said earlier that he believed we would come back relaxed after Easter.  We would be only for the Mutt and Turf Show and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, talking on every radio station about locking up grannies and anybody who gave a bag of turf to their neighbours.  We need a full debate on agriculture and the attack going on in rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach seems to think it is doing grand and he acknowledged that he burned turf himself, but we want a debate on this.  It is the Government that created this mess.  The T&aacute;naiste said banning turf was like taking wine off the people in France, which is kind of a nice catchphrase, and the Taoiseach said he would pour oil on troubled waters.  Then we heard some expert on RT&Eacute; the other day saying we were burning wet turf.  With a gallon of petrol, you could not burn a sod of wet turf.  The Government is on a different planet.  We need a debate here on agriculture and all things rural.</p></speech>

The traditional practices regarding turf will continue.  This winter there is no issue at all.  All of the arguments have been that now is not the time and it should not happen this winter.  It will not happen this winter anyway in terms of timelines.  I have to make that point.  I apologise to Deputies.  I want to have a sense of perspective about this, but some Deputies do not want to entertain that at all.  That is fine.  They are over the top in terms of their presentation.</p> <p> In terms of Deputy McDonald's points, I dealt with that in my response.  The Minister is not refusing to go before any Oireachtas committee.  I have made that point.  We need to identify which committee, or whatever the Oireachtas wants to decide regarding that.  Ministers are clearly aware of their responsibilities in that regard.  An external review is under way.  That is my view.  It is a matter to be resolved.  I do not know which committee will deal with it, or if a number of committees will deal with it.</p></speech>

Furthermore, the Secretary General has failed to furnish that committee with documents it has requested; in fact, he has not even given it the courtesy of a response.  I have in my hand a copy of the latest letter from the committee to the Secretary General, in which the committee Chair notes the lack of engagement and the apparent unwillingness to discuss and clarify matters of significant public concern.  I put it to the Taoiseach earlier and I put it to him again that this is just unacceptable behaviour.</p></speech>

I note Dr. Peter Boylan, who wrote today in <i>The Irish Times,</i>has suggested that the term &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; will be used in the national maternity hospital designated activity company document to qualify the obligation to provide all medical treatment to women, including abortion services.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to bring the final documentation before the Oireachtas and before the Oireachtas Committee on Health before it can be signed off?  We need to ensure there is a commitment that all the necessary treatments that women require for our reproductive healthcare will be met in the new national maternity hospital and that there will be no qualifying words which might restrict the availability of necessary medical treatments in the hospital.</p></speech>

Many hospitals that have been built have taken an inordinate amount of time to commission and develop, with arguments about them.  I remember that Tallaght hospital took an inordinate length of time back in the 1980s or 1990s.  There is another side to this story as well.  I do not think that women are being well served by the conditions and the quality.  I am not speaking of the clinicians but of the current physical surroundings.</p></speech>

Families are not coping seeing their children deteriorate with the lack of services.  There are no words for the suffering families are enduring, not to mind the State&rsquo;s neglect of children with disabilities.  Progressing disability services has failed.  Children are worse off than they were before reconfiguration.  Not only are these children&rsquo;s rights being denied, their capacity to live full, independent lives is being removed by the State.  A key cause of this is lack of accountability.  It is disgraceful that children's disability managers refused to meet the Cork parents' advocacy network and others.  Yesterday, we learned these managers also will not meet the Minister of State with responsibility for disability.  Where is the accountability?  What is the Taoiseach doing in response?  In particular, what is he doing to address the disgraceful lack of children&rsquo;s disability services in Cork?</p></speech>

Progressing disability has caused issues in respect of a dilution of services.  One of the key areas that need expansion - we have provided the resources - is the provision of therapies.  Special needs assistant, SNA, provision, for example, has grown exponentially and dramatically over the years.  Resource teaching has grown dramatically over the years.  When making an assessment, all that has to be factored in as well.  It is the area of therapists and the relationship between progressing disability services and the education services where it is not satisfactory at the moment.</p></speech>

For many couples, of course, that is a very welcome announcement.  If it happens, it will mean that Ireland is no longer the only country in the EU without any public funding for IVF.  It would mean that access to this fertility treatment will no longer be reserved for those who either have enough money or for those who are willing and able to go into substantial debt.</p>  <p>  However, I do not want to hold my breath about it, because we have heard this before from the then Minister for Health, Leo Varadkar, in 2016, it is in Sl&aacute;intecare, it is in the programme for Government, and there has been precious little progress.  I am asking the Taoiseach for a guarantee that this will actually happen in 2023 as well as for a timeframe for when that will be within that year.  I am also asking for a commitment that sufficient funding will be provided for the public system to ensure it can be done publicly as opposed to being outsourced to private, mostly for-profit, providers.</p></speech>

There was additional funding for the national maternity strategy into 2022 and beyond, access to contraception for women between 17 and 25, further developments in menopause care by an increase in the number of specialist menopause clinics from one to four, and increased investments in sexual assault treatment units and a range of other developments.  Therefore, the Minister has form in showing his commitment by securing funding.  He intends to roll out a model of care for infertility that will see the introduction of advanced assisted human reproduction treatments, including IVF, in the public health system.  The Minister plans to commence this in 2023.  That is his commitment.</p></speech>

He is also aware that the Commission on the Defence Forces recently recommended that both PDFORRA and RACO should be permitted to associate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, should they wish to do so.  I note PDFORRA has been calling for this for years.  Last week, RACO balloted its members, 85% of whom indicated this is something they wish to pursue.  Will the Government allow PDFORRA and RACO to associate with ICTU before the next round of pay talks?  If so, when are we likely to get that permission?</p></speech>

We also need to think it through as to what is in the best interests of the Defence Forces in terms of pay and conditions.  The commission has finished its work.  In keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government, the Minister for Defence will now consult the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body.  I would like to discuss further with Deputy Berry the best way that would be optimal for the rank and file in our Defence Forces.  Just joining may not necessarily result in that in the short term.  We need to look at that base and so on and make sure we can create a better situation for overall pay and conditions for the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach's earlier response was that a memo has not gone to Cabinet yet.  He said that when it does, it will then go to the committee or the D&aacute;il.  I would like the Taoiseach to be very clear to me now.  When it goes to the committee or the D&aacute;il, will the decision have been made by Cabinet?</p>  <p>  In his reply, the Taoiseach talked about the delay.  All of the women in this House, as well as male Deputies, are unhappy with the delay but it was not caused by debate or questions raised in the D&aacute;il which actually led to a better outcome in terms of clarifying matters on foot of what was raised with us by concerned doctors.  The Taoiseach went on about delays but where are we at with this?  Is it a foregone conclusion now, notwithstanding our concerns, three motions passed unanimously by the D&aacute;il and the concerns of the two female dissenters on the board?  Most specifically, is it open to change when it comes before the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

This is absolutely excellent and will be a game changer for Carlow.  We have two excellent colleges at Carlow IT.  I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris for their work on this.</p>  <p>  I have a question about the integration of Carlow College, St. Patrick's into the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  What is the timescale and the plans in that regard?  This is a fabulous building and a fabulous college but there is an urgency with regard to its integration into the technological university, which is of the utmost importance.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with Carlow College, St. Patrick's, which is an excellent facility.  In my view it would serve the public interest well if it was incorporated into the South East Technological University.  History shows that any facilities and land we acquire for educational purposes will be well used into the future, in terms of expansion and so forth.  I know that the Minister is very committed to this and will work towards that end.</p></speech>

The Government is due to publish the third iteration of national policy developed by the Department of Justice shortly.

I have been contacted by a number of constituents who have been unable to find a GP in Mayo to take them on.  These constituents were only assigned a GP after they contacted the HSE themselves.  This comes on the back of the HSE being unable to tell me how many dentists were taking on new medical card patients.  Staff in my office called every dentist in the county and discovered that Mayo has no dentist taking on new medical card patients.  It was only then that the HSE confirmed that this was a fact.  This is a problem that needs to be addressed.  We cannot hope to fix the problems that we are not even measuring.  The lack of access to GPs and out-of-hours GP services in rural areas is getting worse by the week and the knock-on effect this is having on Mayo University Hospital and other acute hospitals is extremely worrying and is costing lives.</p></speech>

First, the Government is funding out-of-hours services comprehensively and has been doing so for quite a long time now.  That was introduced to ease pressure on GPs generally in terms of weekend cover, rostering and so forth.  Increasingly, however, there are issues in rural Ireland with access to GP care and the recruitment of GPs to serve.  That is an ongoing challenge.</p>  <p>  Second, in relation to dentists, there are ongoing negotiations with the association representing dentists in terms of the State sourcing and contracting services.  The State has to get value for money for that and an additional &euro;10 million was allocated in the budget to deal with that.  It is my understanding that the negotiations are coming to a conclusion but there are discussions to be had.  I will get information on the up-to-date position for the Deputy.</p></speech>

There needs to be an overall and complete package for those undertaking IVF.  What preparatory work has begun to ensure that both parents will be eligible for leave, including sick leave, during this period, that eligibility will be inclusive of all of society and that the process will be open and accessible to all very quickly?  The uncertainty is already playing on the hearts and minds of so many people around the country.</p></speech>

Phase one of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment at secondary care level of regional fertility hubs within maternity networks in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of people presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention.  Phase two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services including IVF in the public health system planned for 2023, at such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country.  The key legislation, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill, passed Second Stage on 23 March and has been referred to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health for Committee Stage.  It is important that we get that Bill through to create the legislative base for this.</p></speech>

Last week a national record for the number of people on trolleys was set in the hospital.  There has been a very significant amount of investment in the hospital but it does not seem to have reaped the dividends one would expect.  Numerous front-line staff have contacted me.  They are working in intolerable conditions and are extremely worried about the treatment patients are receiving and the standards pertaining in the hospital due to the severe overcrowding.</p>  <p>  The Government must order a full review of managerial practices at University Hospital Limerick.  Where is the accountability for these ongoing issues?  How many senior management positions are there at the hospital?  There is growing concern regarding the filling of senior management positions and a belief that the people who have taken up posts in the recent past in the hospital are not meeting the required standard for senior positions in the HSE.  The hospital is under extreme pressure and people in the area are seriously concerned and worried.  I would like to see a full review into what is happening at University Hospital Limerick.</p></speech>

There has been significant investment in University Hospital Limerick but there are very significant issues there.  It is my belief and the Government's view that we must look at further increasing bed capacity there in the short to medium term.  I will talk to the HSE about the points Deputy Cahill has made about governance.</p></speech>

Incredibly, 113 people are on trolleys today.  This means there are no beds and, unfortunately, not enough trolleys for people.  Yesterday 105 people were on trolleys and last Thursday there was an historic high of 126 people on trolleys.  There is no let-up in this.  The Taoiseach will not intervene but something needs to be done.  We cannot wait for the planned 96-bed unit, which is to be delivered in three years' time if we are lucky.  It will only deliver 48 beds because 48 will be taken out as well.  What will the Taoiseach do?  The nurses are calling for an independent HIQA inquiry.  Will the Taoiseach support this?  It should be done as a matter of urgency.  The people and the staff deserve something better.</p></speech>

Many politicians have welcomed this but I am furious.  The people of the Beara Peninsula and residents of Dursey Island as well as landowners and visitors are left with only a three-day-a-week service.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions.  My colleagues have followed me in doing so.  Will the Taoiseach go to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and look for a properly funded seven-day service for the people of the Beara Peninsula and Dursey Island?  It is only fair.</p></speech>

More than 100,000 children are on some form of National Treatment Purchase Fund list.  One in three children has been waiting longer than a year for treatment or assessment by a hospital consultant.  Over the Easter period, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association issued a press release on these figures.

This is welcome and fantastic news because at present Ireland is the only country in the EU not providing state funding towards IVF.  Unfortunately, the statistics show that one in every six couples will struggle to conceive.  IVF costs &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000 per cycle.  This is a huge expense that is out of reach for many young couples.  Will the Taoiseach outline the Government's plans to ensure middle income earners as well as those on medical cards will get funding for IVF?</p></speech>

At least it is a start.  I would like a whole new service there.  I would like a whole new ferry.  I am determined to do this.  I believe it is being judicially reviewed at present as there is some objection to what I believe are good proposals to provide a proper modern cable car facility.  There are great opportunities there.  It should be developed in the fullness of time.  This is my view.</p>  <p>  With regard to the waiting lists for children, there is an overarching waiting list plan by the Minister.  Covid-19 had a huge impact on waiting lists.  It exacerbated what were already significant delays.  Let us not underestimate the impact of Covid-19 on waiting lists.  Significant investment has been put in place to deal with that.</p>  <p>  I would like to return to a question raised by Deputy Michael Collins earlier.  It is only fair to the House to say there is a process of negotiation and discussion under way with private bus operators.  When I was discussing it with the Deputy, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, helpfully said he had already met them six weeks ago.  He was seeing what way he could do something for them with regard to application of the youth card reduction.  There is further engagement on that front.</p>  <p>  This will be the third time I will answer on the issue Deputy Higgins raised.  This is illustrative of the broad views across the House in respect of IVF and the need to provide support and funding for it.  I dealt with it in the previous two replies.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600018#R02300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to ensure employers provide employees with FFP-2 grade masks, or higher, where necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular to education workers and healthcare workers, and to provide for a review of this provision within 3 months of enactment. </blockquote>  <p>The Bill proposes that employers, and in the case of public sector employees the State, will have to provide appropriate personal protective equipment, in particular N95 or FFP2 or higher-quality masks, for everybody to protect them when they are at work.  This is a vital issue because we know that Covid is an airborne disease.  We know that, unfortunately, it is still with us and that new and even more deadly variants can emerge.  If we are to successfully &quot;live with Covid&quot;, we have to take extremely seriously issues such as ventilation and mask wearing.</p><p>This is a public health issue.  It is a workers' rights issue.  The very least that can be done is to say that workers are entitled to get masks to protect them in their places of work.  It is ironic that we walk into the D&aacute;il and on the right-hand side there is a table with high-quality FFP2 masks.  These masks give us all significantly higher levels of protection than either the cloth or surgical masks that many people wear.  They multiply the level of protection that people have.  It is not okay that we as Deputies and Senators in our place of work get these to protect us and teachers, shop workers or transport workers do not get them.  There are all sorts of workers who have face-to-face interaction with the public all of the time.  To be clear I am not saying that Deputies should not get them.  I think it is great that Deputies get them and everybody who works in the Oireachtas should be able to avail of them.  The point is that they should be made available to all workers.  This is about taking seriously the issues of ventilation, worker safety and public health.</p><p>It is a very simple measure.  It would have very limited costs for employers and the State but it would make a big difference in terms of the safety of workers in their workplaces.  It would also make a significant difference over time to the spread of Covid and the impact that the spread of Covid has had, most horrifically in terms of the deaths that continue to occur from Covid-19 and absences from work, the massive disruption in people's lives and the massive extra caring burden placed on people, primarily women.  It would impact all of these things.  When the Government moved to undo the requirement for mask wearing it made a point of stating it would get rid of the requirement but that the strong public health advice and the advice from the Government would be that we need to have mask wearing everywhere.  This has not been the case in reality.  The Government has not followed through with this advice.  We rarely nowadays see advertisements encouraging people to wear masks.  The Government should take seriously its own rhetoric.</p> <p>It should strongly encourage people to wear proper masks that give people the best protection they can, as well as investing in ventilation and filtration.  The Government should match that by saying it will provide quality masks for ordinary people for free so they have a choice and can avail of masks to provide the best protection for themselves and those with whom they come into contact.</p> <p> I thank the people in my office who worked on this Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill is sponsored by my Rural Independent Group colleagues, some of whom are here with me.  It has been carefully drafted on our behalf by the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan.  I really cannot thank him enough for that.</p><p>For too long the Government has facilitated vulture funds and banks to seize and sell family farms in Ireland.  This Bill would create a policy platform to tip the scales back in favour of landowners and farmers, and it is all about protecting the small man or woman against predatory financial institutions.  It is sad we must have this Bill but it is vital and necessary in 2022, in the middle of our decade of centenaries.</p><p>The agrifood sector and the role of farmers in the Irish economy are critical, generating gross added value equating to &euro;14.4 billion per year.  Furthermore, the sector employs one in every ten workers in this State.  Farmers are under attack from all quarters.  First, the Government is targeting deep cuts at a farmers' ability to earn a living with climate action reductions and an inadequate new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme.  We have now seen how the one we have will not even be accepted by the bureaucrats in Europe.  Second, banks and vulture funds continue to seize and sell farms all over the country, with Government policy stacked in favour of those institutions.  We have observed first-hand the destruction and crippling impact these forfeitures and seizures have caused to families in rural communities.  It has brought devastation.  That is why we have brought forward this imaginative new Bill today.</p><p>As I have said, this Bill would not have been possible without the exceptional and invaluable voluntary contribution of the former Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, his staff and loyal supporters, who are in the Gallery today.  He intended to be here but has been held up in traffic.  Mr. Honohan's first-hand knowledge of the difficulties faced by farm families and his exceptional legal expertise have been instrumental in the publication of this Bill.  On behalf of countless families that have spoken to me, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and, I am sure, many other Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, I note the fairness, the protection and the humane way in which he treated the people who arrived in the courts system before him.  They are grateful to him for his stewardship, courage and dignified treatment of people.  It is what we all expect from the institutions of the State.</p><p>My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group are very pleased to introduce this Bill today.  Later today in the audiovisual room, our group will be pleased to have Mr. Honohan and his colleagues to address matters in this Bill and answer questions for any Deputies or Senators.  We would like to see as many people as possible coming and getting their teeth around the issues in this Bill.  If there are questions, they can be explored also.  The session will be in the audiovisual room and addressed by Mr. Honohan, and all Deputies are invited to attend.</p><p>Following from today, we sincerely hope all Deputies will join us and fully support the Bill and the farm families it seeks to assist.  There are many such families.  We all have them in our constituencies.  We have all had occasions where we have tried to help and found the tide too strong in favour of the institutions, whether they were banks, vulture funds or whatever.  Much legislation has been introduced, including the hearsay legislation, that has opened the floodgates for the vulture fund carry-on.</p><p>Without substantial local agriculture in local ownership, such as family farms or otherwise, our towns will be blighted and rural Ireland will continue to decline.  For too long the pillar banks have woefully and wilfully used and abused the farming sector in this country.  Our Bill would pave the way for a new State-run institution to extend low-interest credit to all farm enterprises in a specialised manner.  It would be a major shift in allowing access to capital for rural Ireland, boosting an entire rural economy and providing regional development in the process.  This is badly needed, especially after Brexit, Covid-19 and everything else, as well as the current pressure from the price of oil.  I hope the Government can see its way to accepting the Bill at this Stage and we can get cross-party support for it.</p></speech>

The Shared Island dialogue series is a key part of our approach, bringing together more than 1,300 civic leaders so far from across all communities, traditions and regions to discuss how we can work for a shared future on this island in practical and meaningful ways.</p>  <p>  Nine Shared Island dialogues have been convened to date, including on tourism and sport this year.  Most recently, a dialogue was convened on 24 February by the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Jack Chambers, at the Sport Ireland campus.  This brought together over 120 stakeholders to discuss the role that sport plays in building trust and understanding across communities, and how we can enhance sports co-operation on the island.</p>  <p>  Dialogues will be held throughout this year, now on an in-person and regional basis, focusing both on sectoral issues and wider societal concerns for the whole island.  The next dialogue will be convened by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, on "enabling rural and community development on a shared island" on 20 May in Monaghan.</p>  <p>  I have participated recently in a number of civil society-led dialogues on Shared Island themes, including at the John and Pat Hume Foundation in Derry and at an event with Queen's University.  Last Thursday, I spoke at the launch of a new Shared Island conversation series of the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, that will focus on "building inclusive prosperity based on social and economic equality".  I also look forward to meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement this Thursday to discuss the Government's Shared Island initiative.</p>  <p>  The initiative is also leading to exciting new civil society projects, including the All-Island Women's Forum, bringing women together from across the island to further develop women's role in peacebuilding and civil society and to address under-representation of women.  The President addressed the first in-person meeting of the forum in Enniskillen in February and I look forward to engaging with its work as it develops over this year.</p>  <p>  On 12 April, I participated in the launch event in Dublin Castle for a major report to the Government by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, on Shared Island: Shared Opportunity.  Following broad-based consultation across the island over the past year, NESC has made a series of recommendations on how we can deepen beneficial co-operation across the island in economic, social and environmental terms.  It found very significant support in practice for all-island approaches to key challenges.</p> <p>The council's recommendations will be positively considered by Government Departments and we will consult and seek to take forward agreed recommendations with our partners in the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government.  Finally, the Government is continuing to work to deliver beneficial North-South co-operation and investment as a key part of our Shared Island initiative, including, most recently, on 2 March, when I and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science announced over &euro;37 million in awards to 62 projects by the Higher Education Authority, under the Government's major North-South research programme, resourced through the Shared Island fund.  On 1 April, in a meeting with the North West Regional Development Group in Derry, I announced a new &euro;5 million shared island development funding scheme, open to local authorities across the island.  This scheme will support the development of a pipeline of new projects by cross-Border local authority partnerships to deliver on agreed regional development goals and the Shared Island dimension of the national development plan, NDP.  The Government will also continue to engage with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to seek to take forward collaborative investments, implementing our goal under the revised NDP to invest for a more connected, sustainable and prosperous island for all.</p></reply>

Similar protection is urgently needed here.  We know that some organisations in the public and private sectors already provide domestic violence paid leave for their employees.  This entitlement is usually supplemented with training for managers to ensure victims can secure the workplace support they need.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, undertook to include domestic violence paid leave in the forthcoming work-life balance Bill, but the draft heads of this legislation, as published last week, make no reference whatsoever to this promised workplace protection.  Deputy O'Reilly and I published robust legislation in 2020 providing for ten days of paid leave for victims of domestic abuse.  The legislation was drafted in consultation with the sector.  It has been endorsed very widely by unions and the sector.  We have had very wide engagement on the issue.  There is wide support for the provisions of the Bill.  It is broadly agreed that the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is the legislation within which the protections should be placed.  Our legislation received cross-party support during recent committee scrutiny of the Bill, yet at Government level, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the T&aacute;naiste have refused to engage on this proposal.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is an urgent need for a statutory entitlement to paid leave for victims of domestic violence?  If that is the case, I ask him to support our legislation, which, incidentally, is before the committee again today.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work undertaken to date under the Shared Island initiative, including the Shared Island dialogue.  It seems that the task of building a consensus around a shared future is ongoing, and that the work is increasing in pace.  I note that the Taoiseach will be launching another report from the ESRI on Thursday on the education and training systems on both sides of the Border.  This follows a previous ESRI report on the primary care systems North and South.  In addition, a new series of dialogues is under way on the theme of building inclusive prosperity.  There is a lot happening.  In passing, I also wish to compliment the John and Pat Hume Foundation for the role it is playing in building common ground on the island of Ireland, in Northern Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.</p>  <p>  At a recent think tank on the Shared Island initiative organised by TASC, to which the Taoiseach referred, the Taoiseach expressed concern about the functioning of the Stormont Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council ahead of the Assembly elections next month.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Irish and British Governments will need to be ready to intervene, in a proactive way if necessary, to get the Northern Ireland institutions up and running as soon as possible following the elections, and to generally encourage the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to listen to some of the discussions in the Shared Island dialogue on the provision of health services on this island.  There was a great outline in those discussions of the opportunities to provide more health services on a cross-Border and all-Ireland basis.  Indeed, in those discussions there was impatience with the slow pace of progress in this area.  I recognise the importance of the establishment of paediatric cardiac care in Crumlin and also the great progress with cancer care in Altnagelvin for the north west of our country.  We have some co-operation in the central Border area through the 1992 scheme of co-operation and working together that is being funded by the EU and the Irish and British Governments.  However, we need a greater delivery of acute hospital services on a cross-Border basis.  I am thinking of right across the Border area.  South-West Hospital in Enniskillen should be co-operating with Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.  In the north east, Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry should be co-operating with Drogheda and Dundalk hospitals.  I think there is great potential there to bring additional health capacity to the Border region.  It would help to complement existing services and bring about greater efficiencies.  In that context, we need better access to accident and emergency care on a cross-Border basis.  I think the Shared Island initiative can considerably enhance additional health capacity throughout the Border region that will benefit communities on both sides of the Border in a better delivery of services and easier access for communities.</p></speech>

Indeed, we recognise the merits of this initiative.  I note, as the Taoiseach said, that an important all-Ireland women's forum was held under the auspices of the National Women's Council in March, aiming to address the under-representation of women in politics on the island.  I should say as Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality that the committee will be addressing this issue when we seek to ensure the implementation of the 45 important recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I note the Taoiseach also spoke last week at the TASC Shared Island dialogue focusing on social and economic activity.  I ask whether the Taoiseach has considered a dedicated dialogue with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other unions in respect of the trade union movement specifically, which, as we know, operates on an all-island basis.  Indeed, it has played a critical role in our history and draws support from all communities on this island.  It is a century now since the Labour Party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called a general strike as Ireland was on the brink of Civil War.  We believe in an agreed united island, founded on fairness, equality and solidarity for all people on the island.  We want to see a process involving citizens' assemblies, approved by both the Oireachtas and the Assembly in Stormont, as a means of exploring how a united Ireland can be achieved on a truly consensual basis and by agreement across the island.  I ask whether the Taoiseach agrees with that proposal, and with the concept of dialogue specifically dedicated to discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other unions.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the Government's commitments on the new national maternity hospital, which we are very sceptical about, I wonder whether all procedures that should be available to women, and are legally available to women, will actually be provided, given the influence of the Sisters of Charity on the St. Vincent's Hospital Group and their ownership of the site.  What sort of signal does it send to the North, to women and to the idea of diversity and inclusivity on an all-island basis, when we are trying to overcome decades of sectarian division, the idea of sectarianism itself and the domination of State institutions of services like health and education, that the new national maternity hospital will be on a site owned by a private religious charity?  Does that not just completely undermine any credibility we might have as being serious about a different type of Ireland that breaks from the past and will be attractive to people from all political traditions, about bringing about unity in this country and about bringing genuine co-operation, on an all-island basis, to critical things like women's healthcare?</p> <p>Indeed, there is the wider fact that the majority of our schools and much of our health service continues to be in the hands of private religious organisations dominated by one particular religious viewpoint.  Is that not problematic?  Does the Taoiseach not think we have to do something about that and to separate church and state in all areas, particularly women's healthcare, if we are to be taken seriously in terms of uniting this country on an all-island basis?</p></speech>

The issue on the doors everywhere, just like in the South, was the cost of living and rising energy costs in particular.  People are being hit extremely hard.  As a glimpse of the kind of elections we may have if this crisis continues, people were absolutely furious with the big parties for doing nothing to protect them from energy costs, when they can see and there was widespread awareness that the big energy companies were pocketing massive, historic profits.</p>  <p>  Our proposal for a &pound;1,000 credit for households affected by the crisis was warmly welcomed by people.  It has the benefit that whereas tax cuts will disproportionately benefit high energy users, who are disproportionately people with higher incomes, a flat &pound;1,000 credit for households would be a progressive measure and those on low incomes would gain the most.  The question is whether the Government has considered such a measure - a &euro;1,000 household credit measure - to protect people in the South, something that would be a real action that would insulate people from soaring energy and other costs.</p></speech>

A particular issue at the minute is hybrid remote working.  The example I give is people living in the North and working in the South who were remote working, many of whom have been told they now need to be at work five days a week.  There is obviously a tax registration onus for employers.  This is something we definitely need to deal with.  Tech companies are making advertisements stating that to apply for a job, people need to be resident in the South.  This is not particularly acceptable and it is something we need to come up with a sensible solution to.</p>  <p>  We have two other threats at the minute, the Nationality and Borders Bill and the possibility of a hard border for non-Irish and non-British people on the island of Ireland, which is obviously not good enough.  We also have the legislative threat to the Irish protocol.  This cannot happen.  On a further issue that we need to deal with, a constituent told me about Ukrainians who are staying with them for temporary protection and they need a biometric visa to go to the North which costs about &euro;100.  We need a sensible solution to that.</p></speech>

What preparations are under way by the Irish Government, with the European partners, to address this attempt to breach international law?  Crucially, what role can the shared island dialogue play in ensuring that the real voices of people in Northern Ireland, the business people, the manufacturers and the farmers who are actually benefiting from the protocol, are heard among all this political noise?</p></speech>

The Assembly was resurrected on the basis of the Irish Language Act going through and, indeed, the British Government said up until last month that it would deliver on the Irish Language Act.  However, like much of the Good Friday Agreement, it exists on paper but it is invisible in reality now, North and South.</p>  <p>  This Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is not co-guaranteeing anything with regard to the Executive, the North South Ministerial Council or the Irish Language Act.  The British Government has reneged on this against the will of the people of the North of Ireland but it has also reneged on the Government.  Does the Government not feel embarrassed in any way that it was involved in an agreement to bring back the Assembly on the basis of the Irish Language Act being implemented and the British have reneged on it again?

The Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, is committed to that and has made commitments in that regard.  He will follow through on that and I want to assure the Deputy of that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the issue in regard to the ESRI and its work on education.  I am looking forward to that on Thursday because I think that is important.  Bit by bit, the research that is under way under the shared island unit is very substantive, from the National Economic and Social Council to the ESRI studies on primary care systems in health, on education and on broader issues that lend themselves to North-South co-operation, particularly climate change, biodiversity, health and so forth.  The fundamental point that Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey made is one I agree with.  It is extremely important that the politicians and parties that are elected in the aftermath of the election fulfil their mandates and establish the Assembly and the Executive.  It is very clear that people in Northern Ireland want their elected representatives to act on their behalf.  They do not like abstentionism.  They want people to take their seats in the Assembly and they want Ministers in the Executive to make it work for the people of Northern Ireland in respect of a whole range of services.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that all of the parties in the election have now focused on services.  In New York, there were kinds of banners on front pages and headlines looking for unity now, but that has all gone away over the last three weeks and it is about health, about education and about social services.  It is interesting to watch and observe, and I have observed it.</p></speech>

The work that has gone on between North and South has been very effective, in particular the huge funding that went into the capital provision for the comprehensive cancer care centre there.  With regard to Deputy Smith's point, when I was in Altnagelvin I met an individual who had travelled from Donegal having suffered a heart attack.  He had stents provided very quickly in Altnagelvin and was out the following day.  In our configuration, we are saying that people in the north-west should head to Galway as the major tertiary hospital.  In the fullness of time, as Deputy Smith said, in the various hospitals along the Border we should look at it regionally in a cross-Border, practical way.</p></speech>

I have been involved since I was Minister for Health.  I want to be positive about this.  We need others to participate in this.  We need the Northern health authorities to participate in this.  We had participated in this through investment and, likewise, the Northern Executive in the past agreed on a cardiac service for children and that there would be one national centre on the island because the volume of patients matters in services of that kind.  I think we can do more in respect of health services across the Border and that is something I would like to expand even more.  The community application of information technology, CAIT, initiative has been effective and I will engage with the Health Service Executive and the Minister for Health in that regard.</p>  <p>  Sometimes, on the Executive side, there are different views and perspectives on this, as everybody knows.  What is important is trust - that we build up trust with all traditions on the island that this is not some Trojan horse but that it just makes practical sense for the people in the region and that catchment area that they have quicker access to health services, particularly in regard to heart, cancer, paediatrics and so forth.  That is the spirit within which I would like to proceed on that front.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Bacik.  The trade unions have offered, as have the employer organisations, to work on the all-island aspect.</p> <p>Through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, that we have established, there is an agenda on shared island and a sub-committee of LEEF is dealing with the shared island issues.  To be fair, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been a cross-Border body for a long time and there has been strong engagement.  We need to support that.  We stand ready, through the shared island unit, to support practical initiatives across the trade union movement.  If any issues come forward, we will respond to them.  That point was made to me in the aftermath of the TASC debate last week when I met with people afterwards.</p> <p> In terms of Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, we need to provide modern facilities for women in this country in the areas of maternity, gynaecology and so forth.  Every day we lose in getting the national maternity hospital off the ground is a day lost in terms of quality care for women.  In that context, the Government has worked with the HSE to improve on the outcome of the Mulvey negotiations at the time of the mediation during the previous Government.  My understanding is the proposal will represent a very significant advancement, absolutely guaranteeing all procedures that are legally available in this State to women who would avail of services in a new hospital.  We need to move on with it and there has to be a transfer of property and so on and State control.</p> <p> In education, we have moved on with Educate Together a lot over the years.  There is plurality of choice now for many parents.  That will progress, evolve and improve.  In healthcare, it has been more patchy but the health board hospitals are State owned and we have independent hospitals such as St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  The creation of the HSE created a more national framework for hospitals-----</p></speech>

That is where it is heading because of the complexity of health.  In my view, that is the way it has to go on the health side.</p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy spoke about his campaigning for People Before Profit in the election and said that from his perspective, people are furious with the absence of any movement on the cost of living by the Executive and the main parties.  He suggests a credit of &euro;1,000 for every household across the board.  That does not seem very targeted either.  I have no doubt people would be very pleased if they were told that on the doorstep.  Anybody told he or she will get &euro;1,000 if he or she votes for a candidate will be pleased.  I am not sure it deals with the inflationary issue but that is a matter for broader economic debate.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made a fair point about hybrid remote working in terms of tax registration.  The Minister for Finance is looking at that and has agreed to engage with the Executive on that.  There are issues there.  They are not simple but we have to work on them to facilitate cross-Border hybrid working.  The Nationality and Borders Bill is a significant problem.  We will have to work with the British Government on that.  I would prefer if these types of proposals did not keep emerging from the UK Legislature.  They are not helpful.  They will be damaging to Northern Ireland, in particular and from a practical point of view, tourism in Northern Ireland.  If one thinks about it, it makes no sense.  Northern Ireland is developing and moving on economically.  The protocol is helping.  Inward investment is happening in Northern Ireland.  When I was in Derry recently, there was confidence.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that we are in the middle of an election and I will not rise to the bait.  It is not that Deputy Richmond is providing the bait but these proposals have been announced and pulled back, announced and pulled back.  Let us allow the election take place in as calm an atmosphere as we can possibly facilitate from our perspective.  We will take up those issues.

In particular, the Government has been working to strengthen social dialogue in a range of areas, including the national economic dialogue which will next take place in June, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, whose shared island report I launched recently, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, the national dialogue on climate action which held a stakeholder forum in March, and through many consultative groups set up in different sectors and direct engagement with Ministers and Departments on specific issues of concern.</p>  <p>  In recent months, I have had a number of engagements with social partners in a variety of different formats, including through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which brings together representatives of employers and trade unions with Government to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market and which are of mutual concern.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of LEEF, there has been significant progress on many issues, such as the introduction of statutory sick pay and the ongoing high-level review of collective bargaining.  In addition, LEEF played an important role during Covid-19, including dialogue on income and business supports and agreement of the national work safely protocol.</p>  <p>  The most recent plenary meeting of LEEF, which I chaired, took place on 13 April.  Given the serious economic challenges facing Ireland in the period ahead, it was agreed at that meeting that the members of LEEF would enter a process of dialogue to explore the potential for developing an approach to managing and responding to these challenges and pressures in a strategic and sustainable way.  This exploratory process will take place over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Other engagements I have had with social partners include a series of meetings last year with representatives from the environmental pillar, the community and voluntary pillar and the farming and agriculture pillar to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened, as well as issues of concern to those sectors.  I hope to meet again with these pillars in the period ahead as we seek to navigate and tackle major challenges facing the country, especially as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.</p></reply>

As the T&aacute;naiste and his Minister of State have recognised, ILO Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work.  This protection is, of course, especially relevant for women but for men too.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment since the ILO adopted the convention in June 2019 but there has been no tangible progress.  For two years now, I have been told that his officials are engaging with relevant Departments to establish whether further legislation is required for ratification, yet no detail of these engagements or their outcomes has ever been offered up.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Employment stated her intent to undertake a consultation with unions, employer representative bodies and others to progress ratification.  In January 2020, the T&aacute;naiste made the same commitment.  Just this month, the Minister of State at his Department admitted that not only has this consultation not yet taken place but it will be months before it is established.</p> <p>The Government has committed to protecting women and men workers from harassment and violence.  On that basis, I urge the Government to engage with the T&aacute;naiste to ensure ratification of ILO Convention 190.  </p></speech>

It is also important that we continue to meet the challenges we face in respect of the existing housing crisis and homelessness emergency.  As a part of doing that, it is important that we look at solutions to find additional housing not already in demand or in the pipeline.  Undoubtedly, part of the solution, as the Irish Refugee Council has proposed, is to ensure that some of the 162,000 holiday homes are put to use.  Some of those are rented throughout the year and will not be available initially but others are heavily underused.  These are furnished, serviced and in walk-in condition.  Many are located on the edges of towns and in communities with existing infrastructure.  We need some leadership from the Government on this issue.  We need a call to get some of these holiday homes into use and to tap into the goodwill that exists in this regard.  Details must be provided for people.  There should, for example, be lease agreements for 12-month periods.  Owners should also be provided with some compensation in respect of wear and tear so they can source alternatives for holidays.  When will a decision be made on this issue?  Why has it not been done to date?  Will the Taoiseach clarify which Department is taking the lead on this issue?</p></speech>

Without them, many of our shops, hospitals, public transport services and many public and private corporate entities could not have functioned.  I refer to private security workers.  Rank-and-file security officers recently set up a new campaign, Security Officers United, and some of its members will be outside the D&aacute;il at 1 o'clock tomorrow campaigning for decent pay.  The employment regulation order, ERO, for that sector means these workers get paid less than &euro;12 an hour.  It is shocking.  Some of their employers have blocked an attempt to give a miserable pay increase that would bring the rate to just over &euro;12 an hour.  These workers are campaigning to have a minimum pay rate of at least &euro;15 an hour.  There are 16,000 private security workers.  They are miserably paid and essentially treated with no respect.  They have no pension entitlements.  Often, they have no guarantee of hours.  Their employers are often charging the companies who have contracted for these services many times the rate of pay being paid to the workers.  That is really scandalous.  The workers get paid &euro;12 an hour, but the company hiring them out gets paid &euro;20.  It would be great if the Government would send a representative-----</p></speech>

One clear message from right across all the conferences was the need for substantial pay increases to compensate for the rising cost of living.  The Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, conference went so far as to pass a motion that said unless a meaningful pay offer was made by the end of the school or academic year which provides for increases that keep pace with the level of inflation, the TUI should initiate a ballot for a campaign of strike action.  The union is absolutely right.  If teachers do not get a pay increase that is higher than the rate of inflation, they will, in reality, experience a pay cut.  This goes not just for teachers and all public sector workers, but for all workers across the board.  Will the Government make a meaningful pay offer to public sector workers?  Will it increase the minimum wage to &euro;15 an hour to accommodate workers in the private sector?  Will it support other private sector workers who take action to ensure they do not experience a real reduction in their wages?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600023#W00700"><p>I previously raised with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste the urgent need for an increase in the national minimum wage to address the cost-of-living crisis confronting households.  With inflation rising, it is clear Ireland needs a pay rise and that people need to see the pay in their pockets go further.  The 30 cent increase in the minimum wage that came into effect in January has simply not been enough to address the rising costs facing our lowest paid workers.  Ireland is a high-cost and low-pay economy, and this is putting great pressure on working people.</p>  <p>  In our submission to the Low Pay Commission this year, the Labour Party argued for an immediate increase of &euro;1 in the minimum wage and for a clear, multi-annual pathway to deliver a living wage within three years.  Has the social dialogue unit examined, or can it examine urgently, the need for an emergency increase in the minimum wage?  Have any such proposals been tabled with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, to which the Taoiseach referred, to consider bringing a request to the Low Pay Commission to bring forward any such increase?  Could the Taoiseach also indicate if it is intended to bring forward legislation to provide for a living wage?  In response to a question I put to the T&aacute;naiste just before the Easter break, he raised this prospect.  Will the Taoiseach confirm what the Government's plans are?  It is clear we must see an effective increase in the pay people receive to meet this enormous increase in the cost of living.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600023#W00800"><p>Regarding Deputy McDonald's point, I will revert to the T&aacute;naiste in relation to that.  We all of course want workplaces that are free of violence and harassment.  A whole raft of legislation is already in place on our Statute Book dealing with harassment and violence in the workplace and to protect employees.  Sometimes the various declarations passed by international organisations have wide-ranging implications which must be examined in considerable detail before they end up on the Statute Book here through legislative ratification.  This is often not understood, and sometimes people feel it is just a matter of getting on with it and endorsing such proposals without having any examination of the implications of international resolutions passed in various forums.  That said, I will ask the T&aacute;naiste to revert to the Deputy regarding this issue.</p>  <p>   On the Irish Refugee Council and its recommendations, one of the issues now is that thousands of houses have been pledged.  Many holiday homes have been pledged.  The issue now is to process those as quickly as we possibly can.  Some are empty houses and some are shared houses.  The Irish Red Cross was the initial recipient of the pledges of accommodation.  We have provided resources to local authorities and Army personnel to make calls and so on.  The fundamental emphasis right from the beginning has been on procuring hotels and a whole variety of other accommodation.  It is extraordinary that 16,000 people have been accommodated in seven or eight weeks and more than 25,000 people have come into the country.  Some have been accommodated privately through families.  Other NGOs have pledged houses through their informal networks.</p>  <p>  I met representatives of one organisation yesterday - Angie Gough and others - which organised 200 houses to be made available.  They had some interesting perspectives on this matter and regarding what supports we can give to hosts, because there can be many uncertainties in that regard.  I refer to what has happened in the education and health systems and in the provision of personal public service numbers, PPSNs.  Of those Ukrainians who have come into the country, 99% now have a PPSN.  There is also an extensive one-to-one employment service engaging with Ukrainians regarding access to the workplace, for example.</p>  <p>  I have met many displaced persons - which is what Ukrainians prefer to be called - who have fled the war.  Their gratitude to the Irish and for what is being done is heartfelt.  That was the overriding response I got from them yesterday.  Obviously, there are concerns about education.  They are worried.  We have to work with them to reassure them that we will be able to do all of that.  There were meetings in the schools in that area yesterday with the parents to try to facilitate the entry of their children to primary school and so on.  Those children have also been through a great deal of trauma.  A whole range of wrap-around services are required.  There will be significant challenges because this is the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.  The United Nations has published extraordinarily shocking figures on the numbers of people displaced internally and those who have fled Ukraine.  As we speak, close to 5 million people have moved to other countries in Europe.  Those displaced internally could number approximately 8 million.  These are frightening figures of terror, trauma, death and destruction.</p> <p>We simply have to do everything we can to respond.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is leading that response in terms of the pledges and so on.  Equally, public servants are working flat out and I want to pay tribute to them.  They have been flat out for the past number of weeks procuring facilities and so forth.  Individual pledges and the safeguards that have to go with them are far more time-consuming too.  There is a balance that has to be struck between the two and they are working on that.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised Security Officers United, private security workers and issues of pay.  I will talk to the T&aacute;naiste about it but there are various labour relations mechanisms by which these issues can be improved upon.</p> <p> Deputies Paul Murphy and Bacik raised the teachers' unions.  In the social dialogue we are having with the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, we agreed we would explore the broad range of issues around inflation and the cost of living and that we would enter into exploratory talks with a view to having an inclusive strategic response to these issues that would be in the best interest of society as a whole.  Obviously pay is an issue in that respect.  In 2021, the average increase in pay was about 4.7% and in 2020 the average increase in pay was 5.2%.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has invited the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the public service unions to talks in respect of the existing agreement.  That will commence.</p> <p> On Deputy Bacik's point about the minimum wage, there is a process and procedure for that.  We are best placed to stick with that but we will hear what people have to say in respect of presentations on it.  There are established independent mechanisms to advise Government on general increases in the minimum wage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600024#X00300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:  	Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on automated data exchange for police cooperation (&quot;Pr&uuml;m II&quot;), amending Council Decisions 2008/615/JHA and 2008/616/JHA and Regulations (EU) 2018/1726, 2019/817 and 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 1st February, 2022. </blockquote>  <p>The Pr&uuml;m decisions, which this proposal seeks to update and improve, represent a cornerstone of European law enforcement information exchange.  The Pr&uuml;m decisions enhanced the crime-fighting capacity of our law enforcement agencies while respecting data rights by enabling member states, on a hit, no hit basis, automatically to search the law enforcement DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data of other member states with which they have established a Pr&uuml;m connection.  In our connected age, it is clear that peace, co-operation and effective law enforcement information exchange with our European partners are vital tools in our shared fight against crime.</p><p>Ireland put in several years of hard work and spent valuable resources on establishing our compliance with the Pr&uuml;m decisions, which were transposed into Irish law via the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act of 2014 in respect of DNA and fingerprint co-operation, and the Vehicle Registration Data (Automated Searching and Exchange) Act of 2018.  I know that if we were to choose not to opt into the new Pr&uuml;m II proposal via either Article 3 or Article 4 of Protocol No. 21, we would not only miss out on the benefits of the new features contained in the proposal but our existing co-operation under the present Pr&uuml;m decisions would come to an end.  This is clearly not in the public interest and would undermine important measures to support public safety and security, weakening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's capacity to respond to the increasingly dynamic criminal threats we face.</p><p>The new features of the proposal offer tangible improvements that Ireland should embrace.  In respect of the new technical solution, the central router, this should greatly improve the breadth of our Pr&uuml;m co-operation and the efficiency of that co-operation.  At present, connections are made on a member state to member state basis, resulting in duplication of effort and expense.  The central router will act as a message broker, and once connection is established with the central router, each member state will be connected to all other member states that have connected.  Importantly, however, the central router will hold no data and member states will retain ownership and control of their own data.</p><p>The proposal also seeks to enhance co-operation by expanding the categories of data currently amenable to Pr&uuml;m, namely, DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration data, to include facial images and police records.  With regard to facial images, I believe Ireland should support this extension.  Identification of criminals is of vital importance for any successful criminal investigation and prosecution.  There are occasions when the only lead captured in respect of a crime is an image of a suspect from a nearby security camera.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated in respect of a recent high-profile murder that had the awful crime been committed in a city rather than a relatively small town, it would almost certainly not have been able to identify the perpetrator through CCTV without the use of facial recognition.</p><p>The proposal also seeks to expand Pr&uuml;m co-operation to police records as part of the European police records index system.  I note this element of the proposal is optional for member states, so opting in to the proposal does not bind us to engage in this form of co-operation.  I believe we should opt in to the Pr&uuml;m proposal so that this option of extending our co-operation to police records remains open to Ireland.  Should we fail to opt in, we will not be able to decide in future that we would like to take advantage of this new means of police co-operation.  It is also worth noting that while today the exchange of police records is possible, there is no efficient procedure to do so.  The automation of the proposed system, finding out whether relevant information exists in another member state or does not, would reduce the need for manual work and save resources.  In case the automated search yields no results, competent law enforcement authorities will not have to process the request and retrieve the information, thereby saving time and resources and better respecting data protection rights.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was part of the European police records index system, EPRIS, pilot project, the success of which has led to the inclusion of this new feature in the Pr&uuml;m proposal.</p><p>The proposal will also bring Europol and the data the European law enforcement agency holds within the ambit of Pr&uuml;m information exchange.  This will allow member states to perform automated searches on a hit, no hit basis of third country data held by Europol, and Europol to check third country source data against the national databases of member states.  Importantly, Europol's participation in Pr&uuml;m will be in accordance with and subject to the data protection measures in Europol regulation.</p><p>Fighting crime and effectively utilising the technology and data available to do so is in the public interest.  However, there is also a strong public interest in ensuring data rights are upheld and data protection measures are sufficient.  Importantly, under Pr&uuml;m II, processing of data will be limited to the extent necessary to achieve its purpose.</p> <p>It allows for the comparison of data only on a case-by-case basis, and there is no fully automated exchange.  The searching is conducted in an automated manner but expert verification is required to confirm a match before any personal data can be exchanged.  The exchange of facial images will not entail the possibility of live facial recognition screening of a large number of persons in public spaces, and there is no envisaged use of artificial intelligence for the comparison of facial images.</p> <p> The costs arising from our participation in respect of this proposal are difficult to calculate, but the European Commission has produced estimates that appear reasonable.  The costs must be considered in light of the importance of fighting crime and ensuring public safety and security.</p> <p> The Department of Justice, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Forensic Science Ireland, is beginning a project to address the required upgrades to Ireland's automated fingerprint identification system, AFIS.  There is an opportunity to combine the needed upgrade work with the technical adaptions that arise from the Pr&uuml;m II proposal.  Ireland benefits from the Pr&uuml;m-based information exchange to date.  Participation in these measures is a demonstration to our European partners that we intend to play our part responsibly in fighting crime and ensuring safety for Irish and other European citizens.  It is not only our partners who will be interested in seeing whether Ireland continues to participate in these important police co-operation measures, because the criminal elements in our society and across Europe will be ready and willing to exploit any gap in co-operation should we allow it to emerge.  The Government has no hesitation in commending the motion proposing that we opt in.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting in via Article 3 is in order and is in fact the prudent course of action.  Ireland can support the measures contained within and should opt into the proposal.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

As we outlined before, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this co-operation as long as the databases are operated with the correct level of oversight.</p>  <p>  Cross-border co-operation is a non-negotiable element of modern law enforcement, especially against organised crime.  In 2017, it was estimated that there are 5,000 serious and organised crime gangs, 70% of which are active in more than three countries.  Anti-money laundering regulations and civil forfeiture through the likes of the Criminal Assets Bureau have meant these gangs have become increasingly sophisticated, and some of them work in co-operation rather than in competition with each other.  This poses great challenges in confronting them.  I commend the efforts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling large criminal organisations here in combination with other law enforcement agencies, including those in the US, Spain and the UK.  There can be no hiding place for the criminal organisations.  Irish organisations are alleged to have collaborated with gangs in Italy, the Balkans and the Netherlands, and they are also active in the UK, Spain and the United Arab Emirates.  Clearly, more collaboration between law enforcement agencies is necessary.  While we hope these gangs can be taken on, I sound a note of caution.  With the disruption to criminal networks, we can expect to see increased competition for supply lines and market share.  This could lead to feuding and violence, which will see ordinary communities suffering the consequences.</p>  <p>  We need to address the underlying demand for drugs, ensure proper healthcare and tackle supply.  The link between the casual use of cocaine in this country and organised crime must be highlighted.  The proliferation of cocaine use in the smallest towns and villages is directly leading to the enrichment and empowerment of the organisations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the set of measures currently under consideration, there are several points to be made.  First, the facial image proposals promise much in terms of effectiveness in catching criminals, but there are civil liberties concerns.  Data being available only on a hit, no hit basis, with no provision for generalised access, is welcome.  It is important to streamline the exchange of personal and case-related data and ensure the automatic exchange of data for criminal investigations, with a high level of data protection.  However, envisaging no artificial intelligence does not go far enough, perhaps.  We should be wary of the use of automated processes using large data sets.  There is a balance to be struck where serious crime is concerned.  Databases should be airtight in terms of legal challenges on human rights grounds so criminals will not be in a position to overturn their convictions on technicalities and so we may protect the rights of ordinary people.  Any risks of false positives should be eliminated.</p>  <p>  Second, the central router for data needs to be properly supervised.  I am curious as to whether there is a physical storage location.  With the use of PULSE, we have seen that systems can sometimes be open to abuse and that access to criminal records from other countries carries a risk.  This is all the more reason to have the necessary safeguards in place.</p>  <p>  Let me sound one more note of caution related to the processes and potential abuses by EU member states.  Spain, for example, was found to be using the Pegasus spyware against peaceful Catalan independence activists.  International law and treaties create binding obligations in these areas.  It is right and proper to proceed with caution.  The motion and the measures proposed do so.</p></speech>

It is presented as a technical one but one that has significant implications for law enforcement, the ongoing battle against crime, particularly serious crime and terrorism, and international criminal cartels.  We have to give our State the capacity to co-operate with other member states and jurisdictions across the globe to ensure the law enforcement side of the battle is as capable of using technology as the criminals.</p>  <p>  This is my first opportunity to pay tribute to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the spectacular success of last week.  The efforts made by the Garda in persuading international law enforcement agencies, especially the United States Department of Justice and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, to take decisive cross-national action against the Kinahan criminal organisation.  This is an extremely important success that underscores the Garda's persistence and dedication to the task.</p>  <p>  Before us for approval is a new regulation for updating the existing code of practice, adding to DNA, fingerprint, palm print and vehicle registration data capacity facial recognition and police record data.  Only facial images of suspected or convicted criminals could be exchanged.  The Minister of State has underscored that today.  It is really important.  In jurisdictions such as China, there is mass surveillance of populations with artificial intelligence.  People can be identified in crowds.  People who say discordant things from the administration's perspective can have their movement curtailed.  Therefore, the sorts of issues we are dealing with have to have a clear, spelled-out legal underpinning that safeguards the rights and privacy of individual citizens.  It must be enforceable.</p>  <p>  We need to have independent oversight of all this.  I am not sure where the independent oversight is dealt with.  The Minister of State might indicate that to us in his reply.  With regard to old-fashioned technology for what used to be called phone tapping, there is legally required judicial oversight.  That sort of oversight should be available regarding data exchange in the way envisaged in this case.  Clearly, there is a need to provide the technology in question to our law enforcers.  The battle against crime knows no boundaries and we need to approach it on that basis.  We also need to ensure we know to whom we are giving data and with whom we are exchanging it.  Some of the issues arising regarding the rule of law, even in some EU member states, cause us concern.  We need to ensure what we do is always overseen independently and protected.  The hallmark of a democratic and free society must be the protection of individual citizens' privacy.  Law enforcement should be clear and open and subject to independent review and oversight.</p> <p> I note in the opening sentence of the contribution of the Minister of State he cited Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland.  At the time of that protocol, the United Kingdom was part of the European Union.  I presume it is still necessary to cite that because it is the existing protocol.  He might indicate the situation now regarding the new updated Pr&uuml;m II regulation and the position in regard to the United Kingdom in terms of whether it is fully embracing this and will continue to share the new data on facial imaging and criminal records or is not participating in the ongoing development of co-operation on law enforcement these regulations underpin.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the motion before us, short as it is.  I support the motion.</p>  <p>  All contributions have shown an awareness of the transnational nature of organised crime and terrorism, whether that is people trafficking, weapons smuggling or drug trafficking.  People appreciate that.  We can also appreciate our law enforcement personnel need the means to reach across borders and access the appropriate information in a timely fashion so that they can deter, detect and prosecute serious crimes.  At the very least, our law enforcement personnel deserve that from this House.</p>  <p>  A lot of exchange of information is already taking place.  The principle is already firmly established.  We can already exchange information regarding car registration plates, DNA and finger and palm printing.  I understand those categories of information exchange are already functioning well.  The motion and associated legislation add an additional two categories to the information exchange, namely, facial images and police records.  It is completely appropriate we move forward in an incremental fashion.</p>  <p>  Some of my colleagues alluded to the fact that balance is being appropriately struck here, which is important.  We have struck an appropriate balance between timely access to information and have ensured the data protection component is also respected.  I am glad no artificial intelligence is permitted at this time.  I am also reassured by the fact that information received or transacted through the system will be the exclusive preserve of law enforcement agencies.  In this country, that will be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Forensic Science Ireland and the Department of Transport.  It is completely appropriate and fitting that should be the case.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the motion and am happy to support it.  I look forward to its swift implementation.</p></speech>

We are facing an increasingly dynamic criminal threat.  Criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, crime is becoming more and more transnational.  We have to think transnationally and dynamically to address those issues.  The updates are welcome.  As Deputy Berry pointed out, the principle is established but we need to keep updating these powers to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other police forces have the necessary power.  We have to ensure a balance is struck between giving police forces the necessary powers while also ensuring people's data is properly and rightfully protected, as Deputy Howlin pointed out.</p>  <p>  Regarding the UK, I cannot say that it is continuing to participate in Pr&uuml;m II at the moment.  My understanding is the position of the UK will be negotiated after Pr&uuml;m II has been completed.  Once all of the European Union countries have resolved the situation, negotiation will then be entered into with the United Kingdom.  The Data Protection Commissioner is the oversight body for the existing Pr&uuml;m and she will continue to be the oversight body for Pr&uuml;m II.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600026#Z00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today on the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which was published on Friday, 1 April.  As Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, I move this Bill to address a number of insurance-related matters that have arisen after the publication in December 2020 of the Government's Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</p>  <p>  The legislative measures outlined in the Bill will help to increase transparency and bring about clarity in the insurance market, benefiting policyholders and insurers as well as authorities.  There has been a critical mass of reforms already achieved in the insurance space in recent years.  I believe this has helped to contribute to a significant decline in motor insurance prices.</p>  <p>  As we are all aware, the matter of insurance reform resonates strongly with people throughout the country, from individual motorists and consumers to the many SMEs that form the backbone of our economy.  I am keenly aware that insurance is also vital to the operation of numerous community and voluntary organisations that make such valuable contributions at all levels of society.  Through my regular meetings with people as well as the many useful debates we have had in this House, I understand the availability of affordable cover is critical to groups and individuals throughout the State.</p>  <p>  The Government also recognises the importance of a sustainable insurance environment.  As set out in the programme for Government, we are continuing to prioritise reform in the insurance sector.  The importance we are attaching to this issue is clearly evidenced in the work of the Cabinet committee subgroup on insurance reform.  The committee brings together a number of key Ministers and is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste.  As acknowledged by all stakeholders, there is no silver bullet to improve the insurance market environment, which is why we have adopted this whole-of-government Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</p>  <p>  I am sure we will return to the matter of insurance reform more broadly over the course of this debate.  For now, I wish to focus attention on the specifics of the Bill, which is closely related to our ongoing reform work.  As mentioned, the aim of the Bill is to address a number of insurance matters that have emerged since the action plan was published.  In summary, it will enhance transparency around the practice of insurers deducting State supports from insurance claim settlements; support the Central Bank's new regulations to ban price walking; provide clarity on certain provisions of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019; and protect existing Irish policyholders following the UK's departure from the EU by supporting the Central Bank's technical changes to the temporary run-off regime, TRR, for UK and Gibraltar-based insurers, thus ensuring such firms can continue running off existing contracts here.</p>  <p>  I now propose to give an overview of the Bill and each of its five Parts.  Part 1 contains standard legislative provisions that cover the Short Title of the Bill and its commencement, as well as some relevant definitions.</p>  <p>  Part 2 provides legal clarity on the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 on the ability of the Central Bank to collect data on State supports deducted from relevant claim settlements.  As Members will appreciate, insurers may be contractually entitled to make such deductions in line with the principle of indemnity.  However, this is part of a continuous process of improvement to the national claims information database, NCID, thus enabling deeper insights into this insurance activity.  The NCID has already proven to be an innovative and unique data-gathering tool.</p> <p>It has significantly enhanced the collection of statistics and the operation of the Irish insurance market, thus improving transparency and information.  Building on that positive impact, collecting this additional data through the national claims information database will provide further evidence to allow the Government to identify future policy interventions.  This, in turn, will ensure that any such measures are targeted and evidence-based.</p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill is intended to complement the ban on price walking and protect consumers from unfair pricing.  From 1 July 2022, a ban on price walking will mean that motor and home insurance consumers can no longer be penalised simply for choosing to stay with the same insurer, thereby ending the unfair practice of a loyalty penalty.  This will make Ireland a leader in consumer protection as the first EU country to introduce such a ban.  There are 2.2 million car insurance policies and 1.3 million home insurance policies in the Irish market.  The Central Bank found that home insurance customers who remain with the same company for over nine years are paying 32% more on average than first-time customers.  In the motor insurance sector, the loyalty penalty is 14% for those who remain with the same company for over nine years.  The Bill will, therefore, require the Central Bank to report to me on the effectiveness of these measures.  As such, prompt passage of the Bill is vital to ensure we get timely oversight of the effectiveness of the price-walking ban and can act swiftly if further measures are needed to tackle unfair pricing practices.  This approach would also allow insurance providers to continue to provide discounts for new business customers.  It will ensure that consumers retain the opportunity to get a better-priced premium by switching insurance providers.  This approach, tailored to Irish market conditions, will facilitate competition, including by potential new entrants.</p> <p> Part 4 of the Bill contains a number of technical amendments to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 and aims to level the playing field for consumers and strengthen their hand in their dealings with insurers.  First, there is an amendment to clarify that legal privilege is protected in the disclosure of information requirements.  Second, the Bill clarifies that innocent co-insureds should be able to claim under a contract of insurance.  Third, we are introducing a new and transparency-driven section 16B into the Act which will require insurers to notify consumers of any deductions made from insurance claim settlements, including deductions made in line with State supports received by the claimant.  Insurers must also inform policyholders of the amount deducted and the reason for the deduction.  Finally, section 10 provides for a consequential amendment to the Central Bank Act 1942 in respect of the powers of the Central Bank to enforce certain sections of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Doherty in respect of that Act.  Technical amendments have emerged since the Act was passed and I am sure Members will support them here today.</p> <p> Finally, Part 5 of the Bill amends the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015, which underpin the insurance temporary run-off regime, TRR.  The TRR was set up to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers from the Irish market following the departure of the UK from the EU.  This was done to protect almost 35,000 Irish policyholders and to ensure service continuity of their existing contracts.  The Bill will amend the 2015 regulations to address two technical issues identified by the Central Bank in respect of the temporary run-off regime whereby certain firms that also provide reinsurance, and those in liquidation, can use the TRR to run off their existing Irish insurance portfolio.  It should be noted that other EU member states have introduced similar provisions.</p> <p> The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill and published its report in February.  I thank the committee for its work and for facilitating timely consideration of the provisions within the Bill.  I welcome the report, which sets out the committee's overall support for the general scheme.  My officials have examined its recommendations.</p> <p> On the recommendation to consider measures that would have a more immediate effect in deterring insurers from deducting State supports from claim settlements, I point out that in drafting the general scheme, the Department closely considered how best to address this issue.  This included examining the possibility of legislating to recoup retrospectively the value of deducted State supports from insurers, a matter on which the Department sought legal advice.  In light of legal challenges that could arise and the contractual nature of insurance contracts, the measures in the Bill are deemed an appropriate and proportionate approach to avoid unintended consequences.  Importantly, they have been designed to ensure the Government does not pre-empt any legal ruling.  The issue of State supports may be addressed in the ongoing business interruption test cases which remain before the courts.</p> <p> The other recommendation of the committee was that the Oireachtas would receive details of the Central Bank's report on price walking on or before the second anniversary of the commencement of the Act.  I concur with the spirit of this recommendation as I believe it provides an important layer of transparency and supports the democratic process.  In this regard, I point out that the Bill already provides for a report to be provided six months after the first anniversary of its commencement.  This will be laid before the D&aacute;il in a timely manner and earlier than the 24 months suggested by the committee.</p> <p> I welcome the constructive engagement from stakeholders throughout the consideration and drafting of the Bill to date.  Officials have engaged regularly with the Central Bank of Ireland and views of industry have been invited and received.  Officials have also consulted the European Central Bank, ECB.  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires member states to seek the advice of the ECB on draft legislative provisions.  We are awaiting a response on this consultation in due course and will continue to engage with stakeholders as we progress the Bill through the Oireachtas.</p> <p> In conclusion, I reiterate the importance of the swift passage of the Bill.  In particular, ensuring swift consideration of the legislation is important in order to get proper oversight of the price-walking ban, as well as the practice of insurers deducting State supports from claim settlements, as soon as possible.</p> <p> The Bill is being advanced against the backdrop of the Government's ambitious policy agenda as set out in the action plan for insurance reform.  I believe that through the Bill we will achieve further improvements in the insurance environment to the benefit of both policyholders and industry.  We will continue our work to reform the insurance sector in order to improve transparency and increase competition.</p> <p> Finally, I thank colleagues for their support for the Bill to date and I look forward to working with them to bring it through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600027#AA00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  There are many provisions within it but the primary motive for its introduction was to address an issue that came to prominence at the onset of the pandemic, namely, business interruption insurance in the context of Covid-19.  Many businesses, primarily in the hospitality sector, held insurance polices that provided a degree of cover in the event of their premises having to close as a result of a Government or public order decision in the context of an infectious disease.  As all present are aware, this led to several small businesses being drawn into a long and costly litigation process with an insurance company that refused to accept liability.  I will not comment on the particulars of that case.  Much has already been said about it.</p>  <p>  What is at stake in the context of sections 2 and 3 is the deduction by insurers of Covid-19-related State supports from final business interruption insurance claim settlements.  The Central Bank informed me in written correspondence dated 4 May that at the end of 2021 more than &euro;163 million had been paid to 5,128 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This included 4,271 claims that had been settled fully and 857 claims that had received interim payments.  It became apparent that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of the business interruption payouts.  There are good reasons these State supports, which included wage subsidy schemes and were ultimately paid for by the taxpayer, should not have been allowed effectively to subsidise the insurance industry with a windfall.  That is not the basis on which State supports were introduced or on which the taxpayer tacitly accepted to foot the bill.  Many of these insurance companies have thrived during the pandemic, continuing to receive premium payments despite long periods of empty roads or shut businesses.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, at the onset of the pandemic, I wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, warning that financial assistance and relief provided by the State should be structured and made with strict conditionality and that public money must not be diverted towards shareholders or used to cushion or protect profit margins.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that is not what happened.  We have seen companies that are receiving wage subsidy payments make dividend payments to their shareholders.  We have seen insurance companies cynically deducting public moneys from insurance payments they are required to make to their customers.  These were not the outcomes of the schemes taxpayers agreed to, but they are the outcomes that have come to pass through a lack of oversight of, and care for, public money.</p> <p> Specific to the issue of insurers deducting State supports from insurance payments, it should be noted that, last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was explicit in warning that insurance companies that did so would not be let off the hook.  It is clear that he has since rowed back on his promise.  The insurance industry has, in fact, been let off the hook and this legislation puts a nail in that.  Through a freedom of information request I made on 18 January, we know he met with representatives of the insurance industry on 22 June last year and warned them that further Government action remained an option.  We know that on 24 June, he received a submission regarding the issue of insurers deducting the value of Covid-related State supports from business interruption insurance claims settlements and warned of possible ministerial action in this regard.  No such action has happened.  It is clear that the only action the Minister of State has chosen to take is through sections 3, 4 and 8 of this legislation.  In essence, it amounts to an information-gathering exercise and nothing more - zilch, nada - and the insurers are off the hook.</p> <p> Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill will require the Central Bank to publish, as part of the national claims information database, data on any deductions from insurance claims settlements by insurance companies that relate to public moneys.  Section 8 amends the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, which will require insurers to notify their customers of any such deductions.  What will be done with that information and what will happen next?  As has been noted, where public moneys are deducted from personal injury awards by insurers through recovery of benefits and assistance, RBA, schemes, those moneys must be returned to the State.  However, this legislation makes no provision for such a scheme in this instance or, indeed, in the future.  What action, if any, does the Minister plan to take once this information is disclosed?  What possible ministerial action was laid out to him by his officials in a four-page document provided to him on 24 June, which has not been made public?  Are these provisions the extent of his response, which is, in effect, to let the industry off the hook?</p> <p> With reference to the recoupment of State money through RBA schemes, I want to make the House aware of a new method insurance companies are using to avoid and circumvent the legislation passed by this House.  It involves settling claims of damages incurred but not for the loss of earnings.  Such losses do not go to the individual if they were similar to the payments made by way of social welfare.  This is a means of circumventing the return of moneys to the State.  There is a major issue in this regard and it is one of the matters I will be examining next.</p> <p> There are broader questions that need to be addressed as we reflect on business interruption insurance in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I recognise that in response to the crisis, the Central Bank set up a business interruption insurance examination and engaged with insurers on the issue.  As I have said many times before, this stood in stark contrast to the actions of the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in Britain.  The latter took a test case on behalf of policyholders and in the interest of the public.  It took that case with a sample of 21 different types of policies, thereby providing clarity to as many businesses as possible.  The situation here was very different, where the onus was on small businesses with limited financial clout to take test cases themselves, with no guarantee of success.  I have engaged with the Central Bank on this issue and it has informed me that the FCA has legal mechanisms at its disposal that the Central Bank does not possess and which would require legislative changes.  Has the Minister explored this issue and considered providing the Central Bank with the legal powers to take such test cases in the future?</p> <p> Sections 5 and 6 of Part 3 of the Bill concern the issue of dual pricing, or price walking, in the insurance industry.  This practice involves insurance companies using big data and algorithms to identify loyal and vulnerable customers who are less likely to shop around or are less sensitive to price changes and then targeting them with artificially high premiums.  In simpler terms, it is a practice of price gouging that is recognised to undermine the consumer interests of loyal customers and to harm vulnerable groups.  That is what it does.  It also exposes the dangers of big data and machine learning with respect to customer rights.  I welcome that the Central Bank is now taking action by banning this price discrimination, with effect from 1 July this year.  I have campaigned on this issue for many years, first submitting a complaint to the Central Bank in October 2019.  The bank responded and acted on that complaint.  It is important that the regulations that come into force are kept under constant review.  The Central Bank found that more than 2.5 million customers were paying a combined &euro;187 million more than the actual cost of their policies.  I hope these regulations will be successful in putting money back in people's pockets.  That is what I set out to do and what I hope to see being done on 1 July.</p> <p> Of course, this legislation does nothing to end dual pricing or price walking, despite previous claims to the contrary in the media and elsewhere by members of the Government.  All it does is ask for a report, within 18 months of this legislation coming into force, on the regulations that will take effect in July.  I would have expected such a report to be published in any case and doing so will not reduce insurance prices by a single cent.  Nonetheless, we are not opposing this provisions of the Bill, although I question why we need legislation to ask the Central Bank to provide a report.  To tell the God's honest truth, I think this is more about party politics than anything else.</p> <p> I turn to other provisions in the legislation, some of which will amend the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act, as the Minister of State mentioned.  I introduced that legislation in January 2017 before it was signed into law in December 2019.  Sections 7 and 8 relate to and amend duties of disclosure requirements under the Act.  This is a technical amendment to clarify the scope and duty of disclosure requirements after a claim has been made.  Section 9 of the legislation amends section 18(4) of the 2019 Act by clarifying that insurers may exclude property loss or damage arising from certain forms of criminality from basic risks insured under a contract.  Section 10 provides that the Central Bank will enforce a number of the provisions within the Act.  Section 11 makes important provisions that provide for technical changes in regard to the TRR for British- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers in the context of Brexit.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this Bill, which includes several technical but necessary provisions in regard to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act and the TRR.  It should be noted that this legislation was touted as removing dual pricing from the insurance market and confronting the practice of insurers deducting State supports from business interruption insurance payments.  It does not do so and we need to be honest and clear about that.  Instead, it provides for information-gathering exercises.  Price gouging through dual pricing will be banned by the Central Bank independently of the Government on 1 July.  Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Bill to stop insurance companies from doing what they have done with Covid payments.  While there is no harm in these provisions, they should be recognised for what they are.</p> <p> There are big problems still to be resolved in the insurance market.  Premiums remain too expensive and many businesses and community organisations remain unable to access affordable insurance cover.  Despite personal injuries guidelines resulting in personal injuries awards falling by 42% through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, those reduced claims costs have not been passed on to consumers.  My Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill 2021, which will be considered by the finance committee in the coming weeks, will require insurers to disclose whether, and how much of, such savings have been passed on to their customers.  This would provide transparency and put pressure on companies to reduce premiums in line with reduced personal injury awards.  Given that the Minister is so confident of the virtues of the reports he is providing for in this legislation, I cannot understand why he and the Government have opposed my legislation for the past year.  In addition, promises to reform and rebalance the duty of care, which is essential, have not been acted upon by the Government despite years of delay.  This legislation provides for miscellaneous measures in the insurance sector.  We still are waiting for substantive measures to reform the duty of care.  Small businesses and community organisations cannot afford to wait any longer.</p> <p> As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this legislation.  We recognise the limits of its ambitions, which are disappointing.  The Government must act with speed to tackle the big challenges that remain in the insurance market.  It must stop blocking the legislation I have introduced, as it has done for more than nine months.  Let us get behind that Bill, which is now in committee, and push down insurance premiums for consumers across the board.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance, as we all know, is one of the most frequently recurring matters raised with us as politicians and with policymakers by both individuals and businesses.  To that end, effective insurance reform and the speed of that reform should be at the forefront of the work carried out by the Government.  While we do not oppose the legislation, as my colleague has advised, or its provisions, it must be pointed out that what is before us, particularly the measures relating to business interruption claims and dual pricing, is little more than window dressing.  The measures, as my colleague, an Teachta Doherty, has indicated, are nothing more than an information-gathering exercise rather than effective measures to tackle what we know is happening, which we can refer to colloquially as price gouging or whatever other way we wish to put it.  There is nothing effective in the legislation that will actually make a difference.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Central Bank regulations banning price walking from 1 July, but that is being done by the Central Bank independently.  This is something we in Sinn F&eacute;in have campaigned to ban for quite some time.</p>  <p>  It is important to see a multidepartmental approach to tackling issues relating to the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  Recently, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we discussed the general scheme of the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022.  The policy objective of that Bill is to amend the legislation to facilitate an increase in the number of personal injury claims that may be resolved through the board.  Tackling issues within the insurance sector across the board and in tandem is what individuals and businesses want and what is needed.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me not to mention commitments previously made by the Minister of State not to let insurers off the hook for deducting State supports from business interruption payouts.  This legislation does not respond to that development, unfortunately.  The Minister of State spoke about this and his intention to tackle it.  It is very disappointing that this has not manifested itself.  Many businesses out there suffered significantly during the pandemic, and for them to see this legislation, it really will not cut it.  Insurance companies did well throughout the pandemic.  Despite the &euro;20 One4All voucher given to people here and there, they did not give much back to drivers who could not travel throughout lockdown.  The Minister needs to look at this section again and include measures to sanction insurers that continue or start this practice on the commencement of the legislation.  The finance committee recommended this in its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the Bill, and it is unfortunate that it has not been included in the final draft of the legislation.</p>  <p>  A number of people have raised with me an issue that has become even more pertinent as we move into the summer months.  People with full driver licences who do not have insurance policies because they do not own cars face difficulties with short-term leasing of vehicles which require a no-claims bonus or proof of previous driving record as part of the hiring process.  These people who rent cars or car-share do not own cars and do not have the capacity to build up no-claims bonuses because they do not have ongoing insurance policies.  I would very much welcome it if the Minister of State would investigate that matter.</p>  <p>  The public and businesses are crying out for effective, efficient and expedient insurance reform from the Government.  I hope the Minister of State heeds these calls on Committee and Report Stages and brings forward amendments to strengthen the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in that regard, or at the very least supports the amendments that will come from Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600029#CC00200"><p>I welcome the Central Bank regulations seeking to ban dual pricing.  I commend my colleague, Sinn F&eacute;in's finance spokesperson, Deputy Doherty, who has painstakingly and relentlessly pursued this issue.  That is known the length and breadth of this country.  It is disappointing that the legislation will not ban the practice but will simply require the CBI to produce a report on the impact of the regulations.  This Bill will see the Central Bank collect information on the insurance companies interpreting business disruption claims in a manner that has led to the deduction of State supports from businesses during Covid.  Insurance companies have engineered a transfer of State supports provided to businesses across the State during Covid to boost their own profits.  Insurance companies have stripped thousands of euro from policyholders' awards by deducting the value of State supports such as wage supports and rates waivers.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that the Government was responding to the issue and that insurance companies would not be let off the hook, and now, months later, this is what the Minister of State has brought forward.  In truth, this legislation in many ways looks like a political response, that is, an attempt to be seen to be doing something.  The Minister of State's own Department stated that business supports should not be seen to be subsidising the insurance industry, nor should the industry be seen to be indirectly benefiting from taxpayers' money.  The legislation is a weak and inadequate response to what is essentially the hijacking of public money.  If this is in line with the established insurance principle of indemnity, as the insurance industry has argued, we need to address that head-on.  This legislation does not force insurance companies to return wrongfully accrued savings to the State, nor does it ban the practice in the future.  All it does is require the Central Bank to report on this practice.  Ordinary workers cannot be asked to subsidise insurance companies.  We need far more than information collection.</p>  <p>  The public rightly expected the Government to go after the insurance companies for this money.  I think what gets to people is that we have seen this Government pursue people beyond the grave for the smallest amounts of money where people have made minor mistakes in claiming payments, maybe an unemployment payment or a pension payment.  People in their 80s and 90s are penalised and criminalised for not ticking a box or failing to disclose even the most modest savings.  That is why people see this as the insurance companies and the insurance industry getting off while they are pursued, as I said, beyond the grave, and it is not right.  It seems, as always, like there is one rule for ordinary people and another rule for the insurance industry, banking and big business in this country.</p>  <p>  Action needs to be taken to ensure the Government retains the ability to support businesses in emergency situations without business being at risk or simply being transferred over to large insurance corporations.  This is evident in the fact that the Government continues to drag its feet in addressing the duty of care.  We know that small businesses, sporting organisations and community groups continue to close down or to struggle due to a lack of affordable insurance.  Despite promises in election manifestos and the programme for Government, we still have not seen any legislation in this regard.  The T&aacute;naiste, who chairs the Government subgroup on insurance reform, promised that legislation to reform the duty of care would be published by September 2021.  This is a threat to jobs and our economy.  This Government's approach to insurance reform has always been and continues to be as little as possible and as late as possible, and people really will not stand for that any more.  This Bill, while welcome, needs to do an awful lot more to tackle the insurance industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600029#CC00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The Labour Party will not oppose the legislation.  The Minister of State will know that is not the same as supporting the legislation.  The legislation should not make any extensive claims as to how effective it will be in making the playing pitch of insurance fairer for consumers.  There is a degree of tokenism in the legislation.  Of course, the bulk of the insurance reforms that are about to be introduced come from the Central Bank, not necessarily the Minister of State or the Department of Finance, yet it would be churlish of me not to recognise that the Government has the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in place.  The jury is very much out on the effectiveness of the measures that the Government has announced and that are central to that initiative.  We know that reform of the insurance sector has been snail-paced at best.  Over the course of the past few years, insurance companies have continued to raise their premiums year after year and the Government has, frankly, stood idly by and failed to protect customers, businesses and community services in the way it ought to have done.</p>  <p>  A prime example of this is the so-called loyalty penalty, or differential pricing.  In fairness, I pay tribute to the work undertaken by Deputy Doherty over the past few years in drawing attention to this set of circumstances and the imposition, to put it diplomatically, it has involved for customers and consumers across the country.  Efforts are under way to address that in the context of the Central Bank reforms that will be instituted from 1 July, but it has taken nearly three years for the Central Bank and, to a lesser extent, the Government to take action finally on price discrimination across the consumer insurance market.</p> <p>That is what this is.  It is clear price discrimination.  Of course, we know that the situation relating to the loyalty penalty involves a practice whereby suppliers charge higher prices to existing customers who they believe are unlikely to switch to another provider in order to get a better deal.  In practice, it means that after years of staying with the same insurer, one customer&rsquo;s policy might be 30% more expensive than that of a new customer, even if the risk profile is exactly the same.  Repeated work by the Central Bank of Ireland has identified that as an issue.  It is important that that is on the public record.  Credit is due to the Central Bank for undertaking those important exercises.</p> <p> The so-called loyalty penalty does not impact everyone equally.  It particularly effects those who are disadvantaged and older customers who may not have the time, the resources or the knowledge to navigate complex financial products.  I am thinking of elderly parents or elderly grandparents, who may be in their mid-70s, 80s, or even 90s.  They may live at home alone.  They may not have the Internet, or they may not be all that comfortable using the Internet.  Yet, the system expects them to fend for themselves and to go into battle against what I describe as &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; insurance companies to scour the net and shop around for the best deal available.  Not only are these non-switchers - or what used to be termed loyal customers, which should be the term applied to them - being ripped off, but to add insult to injury, they are also indirectly subsidising lower premiums for those regular switchers who are often more financially savvy, who are capable themselves and are better equipped to begin with to get a better deal given the skills and experience that they might have.  This whole issue of price walking and the loyalty penalty is a scam, plain and simple.  That is what it is.  The Central Bank reforms, which are due to come into effect in July, will help.  There is no doubt about that.  This legislation complements those reforms, but it should not make excessive claims about what this legislation might achieve in itself.  There is no doubt that more transparency is required.  The Central Bank reforms, and indeed this legislation, will assist in that regard, especially around the issue of consumer consent for renewals and so on.  That is an important issue that will be addressed and that ought to be addressed.</p> <p> The practice of loyalty penalties is not confined to the insurance sector.  It is a practice that is common across the economy.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to regulate adequately cartel-like behaviour extends beyond the insurance sector, which is the sector that is at issue here.  The loyalty penalty is somewhat endemic in this country.  It is a practice that is common across economic sectors.  For example, existing customers of gas and electricity suppliers are also charged higher rates than new customers, who often get offered special deals to switch.  With prices soaring, every customer should be obliged to be switched to the best available price.  Ofgem, the regulator from the UK, has already moved existing customers to the best tariffs available.  Their rules require suppliers to provide payment plans on emergency credit for prepaid metres.  Similar measures ought to be considered here.  Yet there has been no move, from what I can establish, from the regulator or the Government to do this.  Particularly in the context of the ever-rising cost of living, this should be an area that is properly examined by the Government and by the relevant regulator.  They can also take some guidance from my party, the Labour Party.  We published legislation last year.  We introduced last year the Consumer Protection (Loyalty Penalty and Customer Complaints) Bill, which would ensure, if passed, that utility companies must offer all their customers the best possible rate and not to restrict lower rates to new customers only.  It would also significantly strengthen existing consumer protection legislation.  As we know, too many citizens have been at the sharp end of shoddy customer service in insurance, energy and utilities.  We recall here many debates and references for example to the behaviour of Eir over the last few years.</p> <p> This kind of behaviour also extends to the banking sector, as the Minister of State will know.  With the rushed exit of Ulster Bank and KBC potentially putting over 100,000 account holders under pressure to switch, this is going to become a bigger issue over the next period of time.  Put simply, the system will not cope with the number of closures at one time.  Yet again, the cost here will be borne by ordinary people, due to the failure of regulators to regulate appropriately and to take the companies that they ought to regulate into hand in a proper fashion.  There is a common pattern here, which is a hands-off approach of it will be alright on the night and waiting until the 11th hour until acting in the interests of consumers.  I am mentioning this issue in relation to utility companies and other service providers because there is a pattern right across the economy.  This question of a loyalty penalty does not only apply to the insurance sector, but it applies to others as well.  It is important to point that out.  There is deficiency here in how we regulate.</p> <p> I want to return to the general point of reform in the insurance sector.  A narrative, as the Minister of State will know only too well, was long sown by the insurance sector that the so called compo-culture was to blame for sky-high premiums.  Undoubtedly, sky-high pay-outs were part of the problem that needed to be tackled.  Excessive high payments were extremely damaging to businesses, to their prospects and to jobs.  Yet, this was not the full story.  It was far from it.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s successive reports on the experience of Covid-19 proved how premiums still rose even as claims declined.  We were promised that the introduction of judicial guidelines for personal injury awards last year would put a stop to runaway premiums.  Yet, a recent survey from the Alliance for Insurance Reform showed that premiums for liability insurance for businesses, sport organisations and charities have increased by 16% in that period.</p> <p> The foot dragging with regard to passing on premium reductions and rebates is simply unacceptable but, given the track record in this country, should we be surprised?  We all know that excessive rewards were a problem.  There is no doubt about that.  There is no getting away from that, but they certainly were not the kind of problems that were presented to us by various insurance sector interests.  The scale of the problem was simply not that significant.  We know that now from our experience and from research by many organisations, which is important to note.</p> <p> Nearly two thirds of organisations also had additional accesses or exclusions imposed on their policies since 2019.  That is just not good enough.  It is deeply unfair.  The insurance sector should have no more excuses.  It should have no one else to blame.  It has to be held to account.  We all know, and Deputy Conway-Walsh referenced this, of experiences in our constituencies and across the country of local businesses and community services folding as a result of their inability to get insured.  We know the challenges that we have experienced over the last couple of years in the context of Brexit where often specialist insurance providers are not any longer available to insure certain types of activity.  That is something we need to be mindful and conscious of.  That is having a particular impact on the tourism and leisure sector in my experience.  I have dealt with in many cases in my constituency where companies of this nature have only been able at last minute to access reasonable insurance cover to allow them to continue with their businesses.  Therefore, competition and access to products is a big challenge undoubtedly.</p> <p> It is clear that we have a fundamental market failure in that regard in the insurance sector.  That is acting as a block and it is holding back Irish society.  When there is that kind of market failure, it is imperative that the State steps in, as in housing and healthcare, to ensure that good local businesses, community services and jobs in the real economy across the country can be maintained.  For instance, in recent years, my party has proposed the introduction of what we describe as innovative pooled insurance schemes, which are the norm in other EU countries.  They would allow community services, such as community-run childcare centres, sports clubs and others to group together under one policy to secure significantly cheaper premiums.  We have also called, for example, on local authorities and education and training boards, ETBs, to use their mutual ownership and collective ownership of the Irish Public Bodies Insurance to extend cover to community events and festivals in certain circumstances.  That would be necessary if we are to help our vibrant arts and entertainment sector to bounce back after their desperate experience of Covid-19.  They do require our support.</p> <p>We need some more lateral and innovative thinking about how we address some of these societal problems in a progressive way and how the State responds to those problems because the reality is that the market is simply not going to do it.  It is not profitable enough and they would argue that it is too risky so the State has a function here or an entity like Irish Public Bodies, IPB, Insurance could step in.</p> <p> We could also put an immediate levy on the profits of insurance companies that have not played ball in the context of regulation and Government policy.  We could ring-fence this revenue to give customers a long overdue break on their premiums.  It is high time that we had much more progressive thinking on how we do insurance in this country.  There is certainly merit in many of the propositions contained in the 66-point action plan that was published by the Government but it is fair to say that the jury is out.  There is little confidence, frankly, in the regulator and in the Government that they will take the insurance industry in hand and make sure it works in the interests of consumers.  We know from the loyalty penalty and the dual-pricing scandal that there is no confidence whatsoever in the insurance industry.  It is concerned with and motivated by one thing alone and that is profit.</p> <p> While the Labour Party will not oppose this Bill, we believe much more reform is needed in the coming years.  We are happy to work with the Minister of State on progressive reforms he might want to introduce in the best interests of society, the economy and jobs and enterprises across this country.  We have proposed some ready-made solutions that I suggest the Minister of State takes another look at.  He really needs to fast-track and expedite many of the reforms that have been long fingered and that, according to his action plan, have been identified for actioning next year or the year after.  This is an urgent matter.  This Bill overpromises in many ways or, at least in the way it is presented, seeks to make excessive claims in terms of its effectiveness and what it aims to do.  The reality is that the bulk of the reforms that are about to be introduced that are consumer focused are coming from the Central Bank and not from the Government.  We are constantly told, of course, that the Central Bank is the independent regulator and that it makes its own decisions independently of the Government and that is the case.  The Central Bank reforms are welcome but the Government needs to do much more in relation to reform of the insurance sector more generally.</p></speech>

I appreciate the comments of all the Deputies opposite and no doubt we will have more detailed discussions on Committee Stage in due course.  Some Members said the Bill could do more and that is one of the points we will discuss.</p>  <p>  Much of the commentary related to the fact that the Bill itself will not ban price walking but I want to be clear that that is the job of the regulator, the Central Bank.  The Department of Finance is not the regulator.  The Department of Finance is not the Central Bank.  It is the job of the Central Bank to do this work, not the job of the Department of Finance.  It is unfair to suggest that because the Department of Finance is not banning price walking, there is very little in the legislation.  Deputies said that all we have done is put a timetable in place with regard to reporting from the Central Bank, and that is quite right.  That is the job of the Department of Finance.  As part of the overall Government approach, the Department's job is to make sure that various State bodies and agencies under its aegis do their job.  It is not up to the Department of Finance to do everything here.  The subcommittee includes the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I can tell the House that the Department of Justice's duty of care legislation is at a very advanced stage.  I expect it will be before the Cabinet in the very near future.  We will see progress on that as this legislation progresses.  It is a key element of the insurance reform package.</p>  <p>  I want to draw a comparison with the personal injury guidelines which were drawn up by the Judiciary.  The same comment could have been made by people as to why the Department of Finance did not draw up those guidelines or commission consultants to do so.  We did not do so because it is the Judiciary that makes judgments on these matters when they go into court.  The Judiciary drew up the guidelines and the sole function of the Department of Finance was to put a timetable into legislation by which the Judiciary would report.  That is all we did in the Department of Finance on those two key measures.  The Central Bank had one job to do and the Judicial Council had its job to do.  All the Department had to do was give them a timetable to make sure the job was done.  That is our function in this area, rather than doing everything ourselves.  It is good way of working, whereby the relevant State agencies do the work on those areas.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned a particular issue concerning new drivers and I will make inquiries on that.  Everybody accepts that insurance companies should not benefit from State supports.  As I said in my opening statement, this matter is still before the courts in certain cases so I am not going to comment on that particular topic.  The issue of business interruption claims is still before the courts.  While people might like me to comment on it, I am not in a position to do so; nor would it be appropriate to trespass on a matter that is before the courts.  When we see the outcome of the court proceedings, we can discuss it at that stage.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Deputy Nash spoke about non-switchers being penalised and the issue of the lack of availability of insurance in some sectors of the economy.  Most people have insurance policies but there are some pinch points in the country where there are difficulties.  We are working on each of those, area by area, with the insurance industry and consumer representative bodies.  I thank the Deputies for their comments.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to it progressing to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It is pulling the rug from under people without providing alternatives.  The greatest frustration in all of this is that once again the Government has been doing things back to front, taking away what is there and leaving people with nothing.  This is what the latest proposal seeks to do.</p><p>In recent days, I have heard the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, hitting out at misinformation and disinformation on his proposals on the sale of turf.  We had a reply to a parliamentary question on 5 April which stated categorically that a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the placing on the market for sale or distribution of sod peat.  The reply went on to state that persons with turbary rights will not be permitted to place turf on the market for sale or distribution to others.  There was no mention of a draft.  There was no mention of any consultation.  It was a factual statement that this was happening from 1 September, a matter of months away.  This was clearly the Minister's intention.  The T&aacute;naiste was quick to say the ban was paused.  The Minister was quick to say the ban was not paused and the plan would proceed.  The Minister then went on to say, and it was almost as if he were trying to be funny, that he would not be putting grannies in prison for cutting turf.  I was not sure what that was about.</p><p>The latest is a proposed exemption for communities with populations of 500.  It is another completely unworkable suggestion.  If the Government and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, want to speak about misinformation and disinformation they should look at themselves first and foremost.  It is the Government and the Minister in particular that have caused all of this.  They have caused worry and stress, particularly among older people in rural communities who do not know whether they are coming or going with regard to turf.  Many who buy turf do so by the bag because they cannot afford to buy any more.  Others who cut turf previously and had turbary rights are physically no longer able to save turf and, therefore, they buy it.  I am not sure how it would be possible to look at exemptions for certain populations.  Would it even be overseen or policed?  It is absolutely unworkable.</p><p>I notice a change in language in the amendment to the motion tabled by the Government.  It has changed it to refer to a regulation to prohibit the sale of sod peat in larger agglomerations.  I do not even know what that means.  Turf is not sold on a wide scale.  It is not a big enterprise.  It is not happening.  Who are these proposals aimed at?  We need absolute clarity this evening.  This is why the debate is so important for people in rural communities who do not know what is happening.  I do not think &quot;agglomerations&quot; will help the situation.  It now looks like the Minister is framing proposals to deal with a situation that does not exist in the first instance.  People selling turf are doing so on a small scale for people who need it.  They are the only ones using turf today.  They are using it because they have no alternative and they rely on it.</p><p>The cost of home heating oil is an issue we have raised repeatedly.  The Government has done nothing on reducing the cost of home heating oil.  This is something that has not been, and is not being, addressed.  In fact, the Government will increase the cost on Sunday when it will increase the carbon tax.  Much has been made of the idea that the Government is offsetting the cost of the carbon tax.  It is simply giving with one hand and taking with the other but this will not help people.  We have heard a lot in recent weeks about fuel poverty.  We do not know the number of people and households living in fuel poverty.  How do we address it?  According to ALONE, the organisation for older people, we know that approximately 3,000 people die in Ireland every year due to fuel poverty.  They die because they are cold in their homes.  That is absolutely incredible in 2022.  We know there has been no energy poverty strategy since 2019.  We know there was a commitment to establish an energy poverty advisory group.  This was recommended in 2016.  It has not come to pass.</p></speech>

His latest attempt is premature, daft, unworkable and senseless.  These are words from his Government colleagues.  I will not repeat what colleagues on this side of the House have said but the sentiment is the same.  Those same Government colleagues will have the chance to act on their words when we vote on the motion tomorrow evening.</p>  <p>  The Government's handling of this matter has been reduced to a farce.  It is another example of mismanagement from this out-of-touch Minister and out-of-touch Government.  There is a failure to prepare, meaningfully engage and identify and support those who might be adversely or worst affected.  There is a failure to imagine, never mind deliver, a just transition.  It reads like a joke but it is a most serious matter.</p>  <p>  We need to move away from burning dirty fossil fuels.  The question is how to do so.  It has to be managed in the right way.  The Government will say air pollution needs to be tackled, and I agree, but if it is the case that the Government has such concern about air quality, air pollution and public health, I might ask why it is so committed to the Energy Charter Treaty, which bestows such protection on the fossil fuel industry and its potentially stranded assets.  It is part of the reason we are here.  It is because coal providers have rights.</p>  <p>  If it is the case that the Government has such a concern about air quality, air pollution and public health, I might ask why, three weeks ago, Indaver Ireland was granted a licence under Government policy to increase the amount of waste it receives at its incinerator in Carranstown in my constituency to 280,000 tonnes per year.  This is an increase of 45,000 tonnes per annum, of which 15,000 tonnes will be hazardous waste.  What does the Government think this does to air quality?  I can make a similar case about the landfill at Knockharley, which is also in my constituency.  It was also granted permission under the policy of the Government for a massive, almost fivefold expansion to accept hazardous and non-hazardous waste.  If we want to talk about air quality, air pollution and public health, let us have a real conversation.</p>  <p>  With regard to this proposal, public health is central but when it comes to public health nothing is worse for health than poverty.  People are not protected from poverty if they live somewhere with a population of more than 500 people.  To state it explicitly, the Government's proposal will drive people into poverty.  It does not have to do so but it will because once again the Government has announced a scheme that fails to support those who need to be supported.  It is failing once again to deliver a just transition.</p> <p>The Government can speak about the environmental need to make this move, and I agree there is such a need.  It can speak about the public health need for such a move, and I agree there is such a need.  However, in making this move the Government must consider the impact it has on household incomes and people living in or at risk of fuel poverty.  Inequity has been a feature of every climate move this Minister and Government take.</p> <p> It is a damning indictment and insight into the Government's lack of commitment to a fair and just transition that the Minister cannot answer basic questions such as how many people are dependent on turf and where they live.  How many of those people live in poorly insulated homes and are on fuel allowance or are otherwise eligible for retrofitting support?  How can we support those people as a matter of priority?  How many are not eligible and how can we support them as a matter of priority?</p> <p> The Government's failure is best exemplified in the case of thousands of low-income households living in G-rated homes struggling to make ends meet which are dependent on turf to heat the building.  These people are just getting by and there is absolutely nothing but pain for them in this proposal.  The Government has no answer or support for them.  They will not get a 100% grant for retrofitting because they are not eligible, even if such people could wait for two years.  They will not get an 80% grant support for retrofit because they have no disposable income to make up the balance.  Let us not talk about the &euro;25,000 upfront cost of a deep retrofit.</p> <p> The Minister and the Government must go back to the drawing board.  I call on Deputies across the House to support this Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to listen to what these people in Longford and Westmeath are saying.  They are worried and scared.  These are people who could already tell us the price to the cent of every item they put into their shopping trolley because of spiralling levels of inflation.  They have watched helplessly as prices have continued to rise, putting some of the most basic items beyond their reach.</p>  <p>  We are now rapidly approaching a position where the price of home heating oil is beyond the reach of ordinary working families.  I cannot be the only person who has seen the return of the drum of kerosene.  People no longer look to fill or half-fill their tank but have to fill a drum, and this might get them two or maybe three days of heat for the week.  The Government is seeking to ban the use of turf, the only form of heating for so many people in my constituency, and that is wrong.  On top of what I have already spoken about, the measure is grossly unfair, unrealistic and, to be frank, devoid of any level of common sense where there are simply no other options.</p>  <p>  This morning I heard the Taoiseach speak of the coal industry being the villain, with smoky coal being the target rather than turf.  He would want to have a good long chat with his Cabinet colleagues and a similar good long chat with his Government's backbenchers.  They are beside themselves running around their constituencies saying one thing before coming here to vote for something else.</p>  <p>  I heard a Government representative on the radio this morning talk about a public consultation, reaching out, black markets for turf and wanting people to working together.  There are people in my constituency with no other option but to burn turf.  They hear very loudly and clearly from the Government that there will be no turf or heat for them.  They hear that this Government is committing to compounding that fear and worry.  The utter lack of clarity is creating chaos.  For those people, this truly will be a winter of discontent without the support they so desperately need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600033#GG00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  The Government's proposed ban is the wrong measure at the worst time.  We must introduce climate action measures that are workable, affordable and bring communities with us rather than alienating and punishing people.  This is not a just transition.  This measure will affect the entire country but it will hit Laois-Offaly hardest.  More than a quarter of people in the constituency have no alternative to solid fuel, which in many cases is turf.  They cannot afford retrofits to their home because they would have to put up &euro;30,000 for it.  Even if they could, there is a waiting list of over two years for that scheme, and the Minister and I know that will only continue to grow.</p>  <p>  The number of people cutting turf continues to reduce.  I used to cut turf and my previous house depended solely on turf as a fuel.  I do not depend on it for fuel in my current house but many people still live in houses that do.  In my previous house, the cooking, central heating and heating of domestic water was done using turf as a fuel.  There was no other way of doing it.</p>  <p>  The numbers of people cutting turf are reducing and that should happen in conjunction with the provision of practical and affordable alternatives.  New homes being built are not dependent on solid fuel and homes in the midlands are being retrofitted but the process is slow and will take time.  The Minister knows the reasons, which include labour, money, etc.</p>  <p>  The problem right now is that families are being prohibited from using the only source of fuel they have and the Government's proposed ban, which apparently will not apply to communities with fewer than 500 people, is not practical.  For example, there is no piped gas in many towns across Laois-Offaly, including Mountrath and Mountmellick.  What should people do there?  I could name 30 other towns in the same position but I do not have the time.  What are the people in those towns supposed to do?</p>  <p>  The Green Party continues to conflate, possibly deliberately, the smoky coal ban and turf.  We are seeing briquettes with a high carbon footprint being transported from eastern Europe with much more environmental damage caused while we ban very limited local turf cutting.  This turf-cutting ban will harm ordinary families with no alternative.  We are calling for this ban to be scrapped.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should halt the planned increase in carbon tax planned for this Sunday.  He should also remove excise duty from home heating oil.</p>  <p>  There are people who pretend to stand up for rural Ireland who may be critical of our proposal but yet again they have failed to bring any proposal of their own to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  They stand for everything and nothing, except their own self-interest.  We are making a proposal to give people the space to have a just transition and ensure rural communities can be protected.</p></speech>

I cannot believe I must stand here to try to convince the Government to help people in dire straits.  I cannot believe I must explain the hardship that people are living through.  I certainly cannot believe, and I will not believe, that the Deputies sitting opposite in the Chamber are unaware of what is happening outside this building.  Perhaps the people coming to their offices are not suffering or perhaps they do not know who comes to their office door.  I do not believe that either, to be fair.</p>  <p>  In the past three weeks, I have had elderly people in my office who cannot afford to buy heating oil so they go to bed once the evening gets cold.  I have had parents who had to choose whether to heat or eat; they do without dinner so their children can be fed and warm.  I have had people who own older homes and hoped to retrofit as they are terrified they will not be able to heat those homes next winter but they cannot afford the retrofit process.  The grants do not come close to covering that cost.</p>  <p>  The Minister does not have to take my word for this.  Social Justice Ireland, One Family Ireland and Age Action Ireland have been warning the Government about this for months.  In rural Ireland there are thousands of people depending on turf and oil as they try to heat their homes.  The majority of these people are not in a position to retrofit their homes so to tax them further and offer no other resource or to threaten to criminalise selling a bag of turf is not only cruel but absolutely insane.</p>  <p>  We all agree action must be taken against climate change.  We all know we are running out of time.  This, however, is not the way to do it.  Today on "Morning Ireland", Senator Pippa Hackett referred to the "black market" of turf sales.  I really wonder what planet she and her colleagues are living on.  Have we ever heard the likes of a black market for turf sales?  Using this language causes fear and solves nothing.  Our constituents need our help in a very difficult time and they do not need to be bullied or reprimanded around turf sales.</p>  <p>  I ask the Government to support this motion.  In particular, I ask rural Deputies for their support because they know the reality faced by their constituents.  I will hold to account the Deputies in south Kildare when I see what they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1506" speakername="Johnny Guirke" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600033#GG00500"><p>I thank my colleagues for bringing this motion before the House.  People in my constituency of Meath West and right across the country are really struggling now with the cost of living.  They believe they are getting very little help from the Government.  The rising costs for families are evident every week, with the price of diesel up 46%, the price of petrol up 35%, the price of electricity up 22.5%, the price of gas up 28% and the price of home heating oil up a massive 126.6% in the past year.  The price of solid fuels has increased over 20% in the past year.</p> <p>All this means is that older people are staying in bed for most of the day, as it is the only way they can stay warm.  Others are choosing between heat, food and paying the rent or the mortgage and families are going to work struggling to put petrol or diesel in the car.  These are real people.  The only thing staying the same is people's income.  This Government needs to act now.  Does the Government realise the seriousness of the situation?  Does it care enough?  There is huge financial pressure on those who can least afford it.  I have never seen it as bad.  That is why we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, are calling on this Government to remove excise duty from home heating oil, to cancel the carbon tax increase which will increase the cost of gas and home heating oil from next Sunday and to scrap plans to ban the sale of turf from September.  Turf is the only form of heating that has not increased in price in the last 12 months.  It is mainly the well-off who cause most emissions and who are best placed to do something about it, yet most Government policies seem to penalise the poor, like those on burning turf.  The importation of briquettes and peat from mainland Europe should be of greater environmental concern than stopping one neighbour from selling turf to another in a cost of living crisis.  In a lot of cases, we are talking about older people who are not able to rear the turf themselves and rely on their neighbours to cut it, rear it and sell it to them.  What alternatives are there for these people?  They do not have money to retrofit their homes.  They need 100% grants and even then it will take years.  While Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael might like to blame the proposed ban on the sale of turf on the Greens when in their own rural constituencies, the fact is that without the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the Greens cannot bring in this ban on the sale of turf.  Rural Ireland is watching which way they will be voting on this.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:  	 <blockquote> 	notes that: <br /><br />&mdash; the annual rate of consumer price inflation, as measured by the European Union's (EU) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, picked up sharply over the course of last year, and stood at 6.9 per cent in March - the highest reading since the series began in 1997;<br /><br />&mdash; the key driver of this increase is increases in wholesale energy prices as a result of the rapid rebound in global demand, and more recently, the war in Ukraine;<br /><br />&mdash; price spikes have also been seen for a range of other commodities, including fertilisers, metals and food;<br /><br />&mdash; global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as the economy re-opened have also added to inflationary pressures;<br /><br />&mdash; more recently, as a result of the war in Ukraine and Russia's role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen further and these increases will feed into higher inflation over the coming months;<br /><br />&mdash; pass-through price effects are being experienced in the cost of fuel internationally, and Ireland imports over 70 per cent of the energy we use, compared to an EU total of almost 60 per cent;<br /><br />&mdash; recent measures taken by the Government are targeted to mitigate cost of living increases, and increased fuel and energy prices in particular;<br /><br />&mdash; Budget 2022 contained a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living, including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million and a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million, and specifically, there was an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter and an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the Fuel Allowance in mid-March 2022, with a further &euro;100 again to be paid in April;<br /><br />&mdash; from April all residential electricity customers will see the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200 (including Value Added Tax (VAT))<font color="#FF0000"> </font>credited to their accounts, and this measure is expected to cost circa &euro;400 million;<br /><br />&mdash; the National Retrofit Scheme includes specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80 per cent grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation;<br /><br />&mdash; a further package of measures, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10th March, reducing the excise duty on petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively, and these measures are being extended to 12th October, 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO;<br /><br />&mdash; there is an &euro;18 million package of emergency support measures for licenced hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices;<br /><br />&mdash; VAT will be reduced from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October, and there will also be a reduction in the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy to zero by October 2022;<br /><br />&mdash; in this context changes to carbon tax rates are having a relatively small impact on current energy prices, with the Budget 2022 carbon tax increase, which came into effect in October last year, adding approximately 2 cents per litre in tax to petrol and diesel; and<br /><br />&mdash; the increase in rates for home heating fuels such as kerosene, gas, and solid fuels was delayed until 1st May, 2022, to mitigate against impacts during the winter heating season, and the May, 2022, increase will add approximately &euro;21.56 to a 1,000-litre fill of kerosene and 20 cents (VAT inclusive) to a 12.5<font color="#202124"> kilogram</font>bale of briquettes; and<br /><br />recognises that:<br /><br />&mdash; carbon tax is a key pillar underpinning the Government's Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030, and reach net zero no later than 2050;<br /><br />&mdash; the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future committed to increasing carbon tax and the Finance Act 2020 provides for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 2030;<br /><br />&mdash; a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels;<br /><br />&mdash; previous analysis undertaken using SWITCH, the Economic &amp;amp; Social Research Institute tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package has confirmed that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive and households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures;<br /><br />&mdash; in the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them, and we will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050;<br /><br />&mdash; furthermore, recent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance using SWITCH has confirmed that the suite of recently announced measures more than offset the carbon tax increases for all income deciles, with the following measures being included in the analysis: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the lump-sum increase in the Fuel Allowance of &euro;100;<br /><br />&mdash; a cut in the VAT rate on Gas and Electricity from 13.5 to 9 per cent;<br /><br />&mdash; a reduction in the PSO levy of &euro;58.57 annually; and<br /><br />&mdash; an extension of the cut in excise duty of 15 cent for diesel and 20 cent for petrol from 31st August, 2022, to the Budget Day in October; </blockquote>&mdash; overall, in net terms, all households see increases in disposable income, with lower income households seeing the greatest proportional gains, reflecting the progressive nature of the measures;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government has very little flexibility on kerosene from a VAT perspective because it is subject to a VAT rate of 13.5 per cent, which is provided for by way of an historical derogation that allows Ireland to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies under Article 118 of the VAT Directive known as parked rates and cannot go below 12 per cent, and were the Government to reduce kerosene to 12 per cent the saving would be very small, but there would be a considerable additional cost to the Exchequer (&euro;216 million to the end of October) because all other areas currently subject to the 13.5 per cent rate to this level would also have to be reduced to 12 per cent, as we are only allowed have two reduced VAT rates under EU law, accounting for about 25 per cent of economic activity and, as well as fuel used for heat and light, also include construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance;<br /><br />&mdash; each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning, and it is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution;<br /><br />&mdash; turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands, but measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, while respecting these traditions, and no ban on the burning of peat is being proposed, but a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the sale of sod peat in larger agglomerations while allowing the traditional sale in rural areas;

I will also address the proposed new regulations relating to solid fuels.<br /><br />At the outset, I wish to state that I am happy to move the Government amendment to the motion.  The Government fully recognises the seriousness of the current inflationary crisis in the fuel sector and the impact that this is having on broader society.  However, the causes of the spiralling increases in fuel costs are beyond the control of Government.  Therefore, it is not possible, as Sinn F&eacute;in has acknowledged in its motion, to insulate fully all households from every price increase.<br /><br />We are living in unprecedented times.  The global and extreme nature of this crisis is not something anybody could have envisaged a few months ago.  The energy market is experiencing a perfect storm of global supply chain disruptions and the ongoing war in Ukraine.  It is these issues that are driving the current rise in prices and not, as some would have us believe, the tax on energy products.  Ireland's taxation of fuel is based on EU law, as set out in the energy tax directive, ETC.  This directive prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all member states must comply.  Ireland applies excise duty, in the form of mineral oil tax, MOT, to fuels used for motor or heating purposes.  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component.  The carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax.  Kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of zero.  The carbon component is currently &euro;84.84 per 1,000 l.<br /><br />Deputies will be aware that the programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030.  This measure is a key pillar of the Government's climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.  Deputies will also be aware that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society, but also, in the long run, will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  It is also important to note that the Government has very little flexibility on kerosene from a VAT perspective.  This is because it is subject to a VAT rate of 13.5%, which is provided for by way of a historical derogation that allows us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies under Article 118 of the VAT directive.  These are known as parked rates and cannot go below 12%.  If the Government were to reduce VAT on kerosene to 12%, the saving would be very small, at &euro;20 per 1000 l, but there would be a considerable additional cost to the Exchequer.  This is because we would also have to reduce all other areas currently subject to the 13.5% rate to this level, as we are only allowed have two reduced VAT rates under EU law.  As the 13.5% rate currently applies to about 25% of all economic activity and, as well as fuel used for heat and light, also includes construction, housing, labour-intensive services and general repairs and maintenance, it would cost in the region of &euro;216 million to the end of October.<br /><br />While price trends are driven primarily by global factors, the Government made the decision to alleviate some of these impacts through the domestic taxation of fuel and other measures.  Last month, the Government reduced excise duty on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.  This provided for a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction for the excise on marked gas oil, or green diesel.  These measures were VAT-inclusive and set to last until 31 August 2022.  This was estimated to cost &euro;320 million.  Last week, it was announced that these measures would be extended until 11 October 2022.  The Minister for Finance is also providing for a further reduction in the excise rate on marked gas oil which amounts to a VAT inclusive reduction of 3 cent, effective from 1 May until 11 October.  The excise reduction extension and the further reduction in the rate applied to marked gas oil will cost an estimated additional &euro;97 million.  From 1<sup></sup>May, and effective until 31<sup></sup>October, we are also providing for a reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9%, resulting in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  This will more than offset the 1 May increase in carbon tax, and will cost an estimated &euro;46 million.  The combined impact of the fuel tax reductions alone is over &euro;460 million.  These measures come in addition to the measures in budget 2022 and the February package of measures to alleviate the impact of the increased cost of living that households are undoubtedly experiencing at this time.<br /><br />Budget 2022 included a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million for this year, alongside a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million, whilst the February additional package of measures made changes to the value of over &euro;500 million that included an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households; a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance which was paid in early March to almost 400,000 households, and an additional &euro;100 payment announced in April; a temporary reduction in fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year to reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and people using public transport, which will impact approximately 800,000 daily users; and a further reduction of the drug payment scheme threshold to &euro;80, which goes beyond what is proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare and will benefit just over 70,000 families.  The working family payment budget increase announced on budget day has been brought forward from 1 June to 1 April.  Other measures have included reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children, and a reduction in the public service obligation levy to zero by October 2022.  Earlier today, the Government agreed to the abolition of public inpatient charges for children.<br /><br />The evidence confirms that the measures taken by the Government to date are progressive.  Recent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance, using the SWITCH model, has confirmed that the suite of recently announced measures more than offsets the carbon tax increases for all income deciles.  In addition, the Government continues to drive public investment in energy efficiency, with an overall investment of &euro;267 million this year, &euro;118 million of which is allocated to making homes of those most at risk of energy poverty, warmer, healthier and cheaper to heat.  We acknowledge the waiting list and the need to make further progress in reducing that backlog as quickly as we possibly can. </blockquote> <p>In response to increasing energy costs, new grant rates have been introduced that will cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of attic and wall insulation.  These are very cost-effective upgrade measures that can be deployed rapidly and at scale this year.  The typical cost savings from cavity wall insulation are &euro;300 per year on a home heating bill.  Cumulatively, the Government has spent approximately &euro;2 billion to date on additional cost of living and welfare supports from budget 2022 to the present.</p> <p> The programme for Government commits to introducing new restrictions on solid fuel so the environmental and health benefits that have already been brought to our cities and towns under the current low smoke zones can reach every part of the country.  This is because, each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning.  It is estimated there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.</p> <p> The Government recognises that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands.  A balance must be struck between the need to reduce emissions and improve air quality, on the one hand, and respecting these traditions, on the other.  It is important to note that no ban on the burning of peat is being proposed but, instead, as the amendment states, a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the sale of sod peat in larger agglomerations while allowing the traditional sale in rural areas to continue.  I understand that final regulations will be agreed by Government in the coming weeks that will ensure that while measures are introduced to enhance air quality, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat, including localised rural trading and the sharing of turf with family members and neighbours.  This approach will facilitate rural communities to continue to cut and burn sod peat for their own domestic purposes while also reducing the use of sod peat in urban areas.</p> <p> In conclusion, the Government is deeply conscious of the negative impact that the rapid rise in consumer prices is having on society.  Everybody in this House is aware that the reason for this significant inflationary pattern is because of matters completely outside the control of this Government but we have responded in the way I have outlined.  Therefore, I ask the House to support the amendment the Government has put forward.</p></speech>

We support measures that protect our environment and deliver climate action.  Where we differ from the Government is that we insist that such measures are fair, workable and credible, concepts that are alien to this coalition.  In fact, at the heart of this Government's approach is an inherent unfairness.</p>  <p>  We now have an all too predictable cycle.  Someone in the Government, usually the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, decides that the way to address a problem is by making the lives of ordinary people more difficult and then, when the Opposition points to the fact that such a move is counter-productive, we are accused of being populist.  All the while, we have Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies, as we have seen in the past week over the turf issue, running around their constituencies crying that they themselves are opposed to the moves, as if they were detached from the fact that it is only through their consent that the Government can proceed.  When those same Deputies have an opportunity to make a stand, like tonight, they run for cover.</p>  <p>  It is like a wilderness across the floor of the Chamber.  They are nowhere to be found, avoiding the debate before they meekly return to the Chamber to cast their vote and then quickly scurry back to their constituencies in the hope their voters do not notice the duplicity.  Where are the backbenchers tonight who have been telling us and their constituents that they support everything in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion?  Where are those Ministers who were conveniently leaking that they were passionate and forceful on this issue at Cabinet?  Where is the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, tonight?  He told me in a radio debate on Sunday that he was looking forward to this debate.  What happened since?  Maybe we can get clarification on that.</p>  <p>  The motion is essentially about people being able to heat their own homes.  Some, and it is a small minority, burn turf.  All of the evidence shows that that minority is getting smaller because people move from turf when they have a credible, affordable alternative.  However, as usual, rather than ensure that people have that alternative, those in the Government see fit to give them a kicking.  They demonise those who have a different life than they do and they insinuate that those who use turf are responsible for public health issues for which they are not culpable, in the same way that they blame those who have no option but to drive to work for climate change while turning a blind eye to the multinational corporations that are actually responsible for the bulk of emissions.  How ironic that during the period when Government Ministers have been at sixes and sevens on whether families can heat their homes with a turf fire, approval was granted to yet another data centre that will actually use about the same amount of electricity as entire counties.  Of course, they voted against a moratorium on data centres when they had the chance because every time a proposition comes before this House that would make a positive climate impact but would face up to corporate interests, the Government shirks away.  Yet, time and again it is willing to stick the boot into ordinary workers and families who have no alternatives and through punitive actions - this is crucial - undermine public support for climate action and public health measures.</p>  <p>  For those who use turf to heat their homes, in the vast majority of cases the only available alternative is to use their home heating oil central heating but the cost of home heating oil has more than doubled in the last year.  The Government, despite all of the rhetoric from the Minister, has not done a tap, not a single thing, to help ease the burden in regard to home heating oil.  What does it intend to do now?  It plans to increase the cost of home heating oil next week.  If there was a semblance of fact around Government assertions that the turf ban is about public health, what it would actually be doing, rather than increasing home heating oil costs further, is supporting this motion and removing excise duty entirely during this cost of living emergency.</p>  <p>  This is a comprehensive motion before the D&aacute;il.  In a nutshell, it calls for the Government to scrap plans to ban the sale of turf, to cancel the carbon tax increase due next week and to remove excise duty temporarily on home heating oil.  I was hoping to use this opportunity to plead with the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael backbenchers but they are not here.  I do not know if they are in their offices rather than the D&aacute;il bar but if they are listening, let me say this: if they want to make a genuine stand for their constituents, for those hard-pressed workers and families who have been squeezed to the absolute maximum, then they will come in here and reject the pathetic amendment the Government has put forward and support in full and with enthusiasm the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, rather than random leaks to journalists and a pretence that somehow they are on the side of the ordinary people who have borne the brunt of this Government's mismanagement.</p></speech>

I recently undertook a cost of childcare survey, with parents sharing their experiences.  I raise that because I was somewhat taken aback when talking about that topic by how many people responded to talk about how much they are struggling in general with the cost of living and, in particular, they referenced the area of trying to meet the rising cost of home heating fuels.  It is very difficult.  We have had several debates in this Chamber in regard to the increased costs but it is genuinely very difficult for many families and individuals, and sometimes the individuals get lost in that argument.</p>  <p>  Perhaps many people will not associate turf cutting with the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  However, just like every other constituency, people in this area are outraged at this stage in regard to the response and the attitude coming from the Government, in particular, as has been referenced, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  It is very difficult to know what exactly is going on.  First, turf cutting is out, then it is in, but only in certain circumstances.  It is very difficult to know exactly what is the position.  Other colleagues have referenced the irony and hypocrisy of having briquettes come in from Germany, Latvia and other areas when people are being penalised for burning turf.</p>  <p>  What we need is a situation where there are credible alternatives that people can afford.  Nobody is against retrofitting their home or changing to the more modern heating systems that we see in some of the new builds, such as air to water systems and so on.  People welcome that and they would love to be able to do that in their homes but, unfortunately, it is totally unaffordable for them.  There are already huge waiting lists attached to some of the schemes in operation and the grants do not go far enough for people, even in terms of windows, doors and those basic things that people want to replace.</p> <p>That is really where the focus needs to be rather than on this constant penalisation.  That will not work.  Deputy Carthy made a point about people having driving to work.  We need to promote and fund credible alternatives but the crucial part is that it needs to be affordable for people.  People will change.  They want to change but it needs to be affordable.</p></speech>

He knows it is the wrong thing to do and so do his fellow Deputies and Ministers.  It is disgraceful they have left the Minister on his own in here this evening and have not even come in.  They and councillors have taken to the airwaves throughout country, trying to detach themselves from this.  It speaks to the absolute chaos in Government.  In terms of going back to constituencies and to people in rural Ireland saying it was the Greens who made us do it, they need to grow up and own this.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has said he will change it, and you can see him backtracking.  People in rural Ireland do not trust the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael and they have very good reason not to.  People in rural Ireland have done more to address climate change than anybody else.  They have done that through natural heritage area, NHAs, special protection areas, SPAs, special areas of conservation, SACs, and leaving their land as a public good.  They were promised for years they would be compensated for that.  They know Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have turned their back on them, and the Minister knows it.</p>  <p>  The Minister is now telling rural people to trust the Government and that it will only do it for the towns with more than 500 people.  It just does not wash.  It is disgraceful to think we are here in this day and age and are saying to people who are absolutely put to the pin of their collar that they can no longer cut turf or buy bags of turf when they need it most.  Who will police all of this?  It is the National Parks and Wildlife Service, our new landlords in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has lost rural Ireland, rural voters and rural dwellers.  This is just another nail in the coffin.  People are more than willing to address climate change and to play their part, but telling them in this day and age that they cannot cut turf is beyond belief.  The Government parties' councillors and Deputies know it.  They need to own it and stop hiding behind the skirt tails of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p></speech>

We see the cost of fuel, food, housing and basic services is now out of control.  Everyone is feeling the pinch, most of all those who are already struggling to make ends meet.  The horrendous war in Ukraine has undoubtedly added to this crisis, but many of the reasons underlying this spike are structural in nature, and measures such as the untargeted &euro;200 energy stipend the Government provided for earlier this year are not the answer.</p><p>We say the Government response to the cost-of-living crisis simply does not go far enough, but we also believe the measures proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in in this motion are not the answer either, and I will set out why.  Instead, we in the Labour Party believe Ireland needs a pay rise.  What does that mean?  It means ensuring we can put money back in the pockets of those who need it most, that people's incomes will go further, and the pay they are currently getting will be able to keep up with the necessary expenditure they have.  It means implementing an effective universal pay rise and increasing the minimum wage but also targeting the enormous costs now faced now by so many households, such as costs of education, childcare, housing, health and transport.  Ireland needs a pay rise because all of us meet people every day whose income is simply no longer enough to keep up with the rising price of commodities and the basic services that they need.  We all hear from constituents living in genuine fear that they will not be able to continue to keep their homes, heat their homes or put food on the table.  We need a co-ordinated response to this.</p><p>Addressing the cost-of-living crisis means taking progressive measures to make people's pay go further and adding value, not undermining important investments in our future, such as in the area of climate action.  We know what is at stake.  We have all heard the chilling prognosis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and we know the solutions to the existential threat of the climate emergency are available to us.  Our task as legislators is to implement them and to do so without delay.</p><p>I want to speak specifically about the Government plans on the sale of turf and peat.  This has not been handled well by Government.  We have seen endless mixing of messages, confusion and lack of clarity.  As the Minister has said, the final regulations have still not been agreed by Government.  We are debating today in a vacuum.  Indeed, a debate is going on in the public domain in a vacuum because we have not seen what is to be in the detail of the regulations.  It is welcome to hear that a fair balance will be struck to ensure the rights of those who are reliant on peat burning for their heating on a small scale will be met.  The Minister has pointed out that a balance will be struck between the need to reduce emissions and improve air quality and respecting the traditional activity of citizens' turf cutting for their own use in rural areas.  That fair balance would be welcome but we have not seen the detail of it.  We are conscious the Government needs to do more to support people, especially those in rural Ireland who are dependent on peat for home heating.</p><p>In recent weeks, we have seen some dangerous equivocation between large-scale commercial mining and smaller domestic use.  However, people's genuine fears and concerns about heating their own homes are not unfounded and our call is now to fast-track applications for retrofitting by prioritising households that are currently reliant on turf for home heating.  Furthermore, we call on Government to explore the possible creation of a temporary band with a higher income threshold for accessing the fuel allowance, even at a reduced rate.  This change would also widen access for households to the warmer homes scheme.  Many of us hear of households that are missing out on that scheme and the fuel allowance by a mere handful of euro above the current eligibility rate.  We cannot afford to maintain the <i>status quo</i>and we cannot afford to leave people behind.  I ask that the Minister commit to fast-tracking retrofitting applications for such households.</p><p>I acknowledge the considerable importance of the issue of air pollution, and indeed the pandemic experience of the past two years has brought into sharp focus the importance of respiratory health and the need for measures to improve air quality.  Nearly 20 years ago, the introduction of the smoking ban was an important health policy milestone, and we know that approximately 7,000 deaths have been prevented due to the reduction in passive smoke inhalation brought about by that progressive law.  By contrast, we are still failing in our public health approach on air pollution from the burning of solid fuel.  We know from estimates available to us that approximately 1,300 people die annually in Ireland due to the effects of air pollution from that burning of solid fuel.  That is four people every day.  The World Health Organization has described air pollution as the world's single biggest environmental risk.  For public health reasons, as well as for climate reasons, we must phase out the burning of these materials.</p><p>My colleague, Deputy Kelly, began the process of introducing a nationwide ban on smoky coal in 2015.  Despite subsequent attempts to make it happen from Opposition, some within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have unfortunately resisted further measures on that policy.  I am old enough to recall the days in the 1980s when you could see the pollution in the air in Dublin as a result of the burning of smoky coal.  Anyone who remembers that will know the considerable improvements we have seen in our air quality as a result of progressive measures to tackle that.</p><p>However, the attempts to resist introduction of policies on air quality improvement have resulted in a sort of phony urban-rural war unfortunately being whipped up by some backbenchers in government.  We need to move past this unhelpful narrative because we know that for the health of both urban and rural households and communities that we need to phase out the burning of smoky coal, peat and wood that has not been dried properly in tandem with providing real supports for people of the sort I have outlined in terms of accelerated retrofitting and expanded access to fuel allowance.  We need an all-island strategy on air pollution in recognition of the contribution made by the importation of smoky coal from Northern Ireland.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in, as well as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, will reflect on this as we approach the assembly elections next week in the North.</p><p>On the climate emergency, I have already referenced the recent IPCC report.  Those of us on the red-green left know the need for measures to tackle the climate and biodiversity emergency and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  It is why we in the Labour Party have supported, with some reservations, Government retrofitting plans and the carbon tax.  It is also why we cannot support any further delay on an increase in the carbon tax.</p><p>This is the second motion Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled in two months which has sought, at a minimum, to scrap carbon tax increases.  With such a focus in parliamentary activity, it is hard to escape the conclusion that Sinn F&eacute;in as a party is not serious about climate action.  The evidence is clear.</p> <p>Properly targeted carbon taxes can help in reducing emissions and in redistributing wealth to ensure polluters pay.  Therefore, the Labour Party has called for new, targeted carbon tax credits to accompany the carbon tax, combined with targeted increases in fuel allowance eligibility and social welfare payments.  Over time, the credit could be phased out as homes are retrofitted and renewable energy generation increases.</p> <p> Carbon tax is clearly not the only mechanism to tackle the climate emergency - far from it - and neither is it the only reason for an increase in the cost of fuel.  The same can be said for mining sod turf for commercial sale.  We need other measures.  We must ramp up retrofitting, promote active and sustainable transport and build our infrastructure to ensure electric vehicles are a real option for people living in more remote areas.  We also need targeted financial supports for households on lower incomes, for renters living in poorly insulated homes and for people locked into dependence on unsustainable fields.  Equally, we need ring-fenced carbon tax revenues to complement our investment in a just transition.</p> <p> Therefore, to the drafters of this motion and to those in government seeking to undermine climate policies, a just transition does not mean delaying action until we have passed the point at which climate disaster has become irreversible.  Under that model, we would see the catastrophic consequences of inaction weigh worst on those who have the least.  It would be a false economy in the truest sense of the term.  A just transition presents immense opportunities and it can provide for a genuine redistribution of wealth throughout the country.  We are awaiting the launch of the national consultation on the national hydrogen strategy.  I have called for this before.  A green hydrogen strategy has the potential to enable Ireland to be a leader in decarbonising heavy industries and in addressing long-standing energy security concerns, which have been brought into sharper focus by the terrible war in Ukraine.  We can be a leader in the generation and export of clean energy and create clean and decent jobs for workers.  We can do this through enhancing our wind energy capacity and through our retrofitting adaptation and carbon capture policies, as well as through the green hydrogen approach.</p> <p> Just as we did during the Covid-19 pandemic, we must trust the science.  The mantra when we hear about climate change is that we must be honest about the nature of this crisis.  A carbon tax and an end to the large-scale commercial sale of turf must form part of our national strategy to incentivise climate-friendly behaviour and to fund the necessary infrastructure to aid in the just transition I spoke about.  We know polluters must pay, but that argument does not exempt us all from responsibility.  Lending our voices to constructive proposals is a better use of parliamentary time than seeking to convince constituents that delaying climate action is the answer to their problems.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad are set to use three time slots this week to debate if we should do away with the albeit modest gains we have made for climate action.  This would not be a good use of our time or of the platforms given to us by those who elect us.  Therefore, I would prefer these opportunities for constructive debate, and I hope colleagues on both sides of the House will adopt that strategy too.</p></speech>

It is an important discussion and I was hoping we would get some clarity on the issue of the turf ban.  Nothing but confusion has been generated in the media by Ministers and Government representatives in the past fortnight.  It has fuelled fear for many people in rural Ireland regarding what is going to happen to their ability to burn peat for fuel this winter.  Looking at the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposed amendment, there seems to be no real clarity as to what is happening.  The final regulations are still to be agreed.  Therefore, I wonder what the past two weeks have been about.  Ministers said there would be a ban, and then that there would be no ban, that grannies would not be arrested and people would still be able to sell turf to their neighbours and to family members.  I was hoping for clarity here but, unfortunately, we have not been presented with it this evening.</p>  <p>  I was also hoping that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications would be here.  It is important he listens to this debate, understands the impact the lack of clarity and the resulting confusion has had on people, and listens to the constructive suggestions being made by the Opposition regarding this issue.  I found the past couple of weeks incredibly frustrating, and not just because much angst and worry has been caused to many vulnerable people and those struggling with the cost of fuel.  I have also found it frustrating as an environmentalist because important messages on air pollution and health, carbon capture and storage, and biodiversity have all been lost in this debate.  With the Green Party in government, the hope was we would see some progress towards addressing the environmental challenges we face.  What I am seeing now, however, is a lack of ability to convey the message about these issues, to communicate properly with people and to listen to them.  It is like death by a thousand cuts to the environmental message.  I find that not only frustrating but incredibly concerning.</p>  <p>  This aspect concerns not just the turf ban.  We also saw it regarding the carbon tax.  I refer not only to the Government&rsquo;s inability to convey that message properly and to be honest and truthful with people about what the carbon tax was, how much was going to be taken in and where it was going to be applied.  The Government also failed to protect people and to assist them to meet their climate change and energy needs in a way that could be done in balance with our environmental requirements.  That has caused significant problems and has done untold damage to our ability to weather the environmental storm we are experiencing now and that we must continue to weather and address.  That is unfortunate.</p>  <p>  The fundamental issue underpinning all this is that when the Government is making decisions and developing its policies, it is not doing it in the manner of a just transition.  This is the key element.  I suggest that not only the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications but all Ministers making major policy decisions in this area should print out copies of the just transition principles, stick them beside their desks and look at them to see if they are ticking the boxes every time they do something.  I refer to checking whether they have considered rural communities, vulnerable communities, minorities and workers.  Will the measures they are taking be done in conjunction with communities and will they assist communities?  This is a critical facet and it is a major failing.  I would like the Government to move away from just using the words &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; as a catchphrase thrown into debates, conversations and media presentations.  Instead, it should work to take on board the just transition principles and their meaning.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister read the Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2021.  I introduced it last year to establish a just transition commission.  It is an excellent Bill, and I am not boasting on my own behalf because it based on a Bill written by Deputy Eamon Ryan in 2018.  I updated that proposed measure to include just transition principles and what that would really mean.  Therefore, I ask that the Minister for Finance and other Ministers read that Bill, because it is important.  The definition of &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; is "a transition that ensures the economic, environmental and social consequences of the ecological transformation of economies and societies are managed in ways that maximise opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and support industries, workers and communities negatively affected, in accordance with nationally defined priorities, and based on effective social dialogue".  It is wordy, but it is important and something that must be taken on board.  Ultimately, it means this Government cannot leave people behind and that those least able to take the climate action, pollution and land-use measures we need them to take are supported to do so.  Those people should be listened to and supported, but this is not happening.</p>  <p>  Taking the proposed turf ban, let us ask what we would have seen being suggested by the Government if a just transition had been applied to that policy.  What would the resulting policy look like?  The first thing we would have seen would have been a coherent policy.  I am talking about one developed as part of a consultation process, based on data and evidence and properly communicated to people.  It is clear this has not happened.  This process has shown a complete lack of respect from this Government and the Minister for people living in rural communities.  I refer to the fear and confusion caused.</p> <p>It is not acceptable, justified or warranted.  If some forethought had been put into this it could have been avoided.  I note the manner in which the different Government parties are fighting on the airwaves at the moment to object.  Some Fine Gael backbenchers are online at the moment talking about how this should not go ahead.  That is wrong.  They are part of a Government and need to show leadership in this.  They need to work together.  It causes confusion and creates angst for people.  It is completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>In respect of a just transition, the measures taken need to be fair and need to make sense to people.  One day this week in the <i>Irish Independent</i>we had the headline &quot;Fuel rationing on cards as public told energy efficiencies are now urgent&quot;.  The next day in the same paper, we saw &quot;data centre in Meath that will use enough energy to power the whole of Kilkenny [city]&quot;.  That does not make sense at all.  When the Social Democrats brought forward the motion last year for a moratorium on data centres, this is why.  We knew what was coming down the road as did the Minister.  Everyone knew.  The Government failed to prepare and plan for it and we are now facing the results.<br/><br/>We need people to be helped, which means targeting those who are most vulnerable and least in a position to upgrade their homes and helping them with retrofitting.  A pilot programme was developed for the midlands to do just that.  In 2020 there was a proposal for 750 retrofits to be done on local authority houses in that area.  As of last November, 100 had been done, with 12 in Roscommon.  It is just not good enough, quick enough or deep enough.  It is not going to help people.  We cannot say we need people to reduce their energy use and move away from these fuels when the whole power of the State cannot retrofit more than 100 properties over the course of two years.  Every time we ask these questions we are told there is Covid.  Now there is the Ukraine crisis.  As a witness at the climate committee told us recently, the Government does not have the luxury of dealing with one crisis at a time any more.  It needs to be able to deal with multiple crises.  I ask that it puts focus into doing that.<br/><br/>I am glad we have had this opportunity to debate matters.  The Government needs to grow up when it comes to this issue and actually support people and show some leadership.  It should stop the infighting.  Its policies should be evidence based and properly thought out and it should stop with the kite-flying in the media.  All that does is cause difficulties for people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600038#MM00200"><p>The glaring visual tonight is the absence of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  That is a big mistake on his part.  Most of the measures listed in the motion are to do with the Department of the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  However, the question the whole country is discussing is that of ending turf cutting.  We will be talking about carbon tax again tomorrow.  It is a massive issue that my party spent a lot of time studying.  I have to say Deputy Bacik of the Labour Party is completely wrong on it.  There is not a heap of evidence to show that carbon tax is the right thing to do or that it alleviates the climate disaster - quite the opposite.</p>  <p>  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will accept the People Before Profit amendment to the motion in the spirit in which we are trying to address this issue.  It is entirely possible for two different things to be true at the same time.  That might come as a surprise to some Deputies.  It might surprise climate deniers and it might even surprise the Minister.  We have a global climate catastrophe on our hands yet some people need to continue to use fossil fuels to survive in their homes and to move around.  Both things are true at the same time.  It is absolutely true the climate crisis is worsening.  This week we are likely to see record temperatures in the Indian continent that will kill thousands of people.  Records elsewhere will be broken and in some cities and regions temperatures will exceed the ability of human habitability.  It is true that this year again will be among the warmest on record and floods, droughts and storms will destroy lives, crops and biodiversity.  It is also true that any policy we take to deal with this can either address the systemic nature of the causes of climate change or not.  It can hinder rather than aid the fight against climate change.</p>  <p>  The Minister must bear with me because this is important to say.  We need to stop burning turf.  It is more carbon dioxide intensive than coal or oil.  It is a potential pollutant in the air.  However, if we examined the areas in which deaths happen from poor air quality, they are more likely to happen in bigger cities where traffic is severely congested and air quality is extremely compromised.  I represent Dublin South-Central, which is consistently reported in Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, findings as having the worst air quality in the country.  I represent many older and vulnerable people in that constituency who have chronic respiratory conditions and cannot even access SEAI grants or other State helps.  By and large they do not burn turf but they are subject to the burning of some illegal fuels and mostly to traffic congestion.  Nevertheless we will add turf to the list of things we have to move away from burning and extracting wholesale.</p>  <p>  We also need to stop driving petrol and diesel cars.  We need to stop burning gas to heat homes.  We need to stop building data centres that consume vast quantities of water and energy.  What is the point of banning turf cutting and then facilitating the building of liquified natural gas terminals throughout the country?  We need to do all of this urgently and immediately.  How we do it is not just a question of tactics.  How we do it will determine if we can succeed in stopping a climate catastrophe and reducing emissions.  We will debate the carbon tax tomorrow.  I see the Government's turf policy is very much in the same category: an emphasis on personal, individual behaviour while ignoring the systemic causes that drive emissions up.</p>  <p>  I reject utterly the idea that turf burning is a cultural or uniquely Irish thing which must not be upset or challenged.  That is nonsense.  If we were to call out what is behind that idea, it is straightforward climate denial.  It is no accident that the Deputies who have consistently denied the facts of climate change resort to this mystical cultural argument to defend the continued burning of turf.  We could argue that coal is as much a cultural aspect of the lives of people in Poland, Germany or Spain.  It is a building block of much of Britain.  It is the foundation of the trade union movement not just in Britain but for working-class organisations across the globe.  Does that mean those regions get a free pass to continue burning it?  No, it does not.</p>  <p>  How we stop using or burning turf is critical.  If by September the State cannot show the households relying on turf a scheme that will fully compensate them financially and another scheme that will ensure their homes do not freeze and are fully retrofitted to the highest degree in readiness for that change, we have no business proposing such a ban or pretending even that we understand what we mean by just transition.  We have seen with Bord na M&oacute;na that Government Ministers refer to just transition this and just transition that although they are utterly ignorant of what it means or should mean.</p>  <p>  I will finish with a warning to the Green Party and others.  When they support policies and actions that allow, as this has, political and vested commercial interests to rail against the impact of the policy on vulnerable households or communities, they do absolutely no good to the fight against climate change.  They give succour to and shore up the arguments of deniers and sceptics and drive away ordinary people from the fight against the biggest single crisis facing humanity.  This is the case with carbon taxes on ordinary people and it is the same with banning the burning of turf.  We must translate climate action into policies which win people to the urgency of the fight.  In this case, that starts with saying we need to make this change and this is how we will make it while we help those who are most affected by it.</p>  <p>That is why I ask the Government to take our amendment seriously and prioritise for retrofitting those households affected by any restriction on turf burning.</p></speech>

I often think from listening to debates in this House that this has not dawned on people enough.  To quote the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Working Group III report, there is a "rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all".  We are in a biodiversity emergency and experiencing the sixth mass extinction event on this planet.  We are also experiencing a cost-of-living crisis.  Half a million people are in fuel poverty and must choose between heating and eating.  All of these crises are rooted in a capitalist system of production for profit rather than production in the interest of ordinary people.  It is in the interest of the latter that we must avoid the climate catastrophe and stop the biodiversity crisis.  We need action to address all of these.  It must be rooted in the idea of eco-socialist change and eco-socialist policies that put people's needs and our planet first.</p>  <p>  The science is crystal clear: Ireland bogs are the richest in Europe, and bogs are incredibly good carbon sinks.  Peatlands cover 3% of the world's surface but store 40% of all carbon in the soil.  They store twice as much carbon as all the forests in the world.  They are a treasure trove of biodiversity in this country, and burning them poses a threat to public health.  They are the equivalent of Ireland's Amazon, so we have to stop mining peat.  We have to stop mining our bogs.  Incidentally, we also have to stop importing mined peat.  There is no reason to continue with that when we are stopping its sale here.  However, we must do all this in a way that ensures ordinary people are protected.  Our amendment would expand the turf-cutting compensation scheme to all those with turbary rights, giving a grant to immediately meet the difference for people who face buying more expensive fuel if they are unable to buy turf.  There should be upfront retrofitting of people's homes at no cost to ensure quality insulation.  </p>  <p>  All this can be done, but two questions must be posed.  First, why has the Government not had a genuine just transition?  Second, why is Sinn F&eacute;in's motion not calling for it?  Why not call for what needs to be done according to the science and protect people by September?  Why call for the postponement of urgent action instead of demanding that the Government do everything to protect people?  It can be done.  It is a question of political will and resources.  It is about putting people and our planet before profit.</p></speech>

The first thing that comes to mind is the phrase &ldquo;mining of turf&rdquo;.  I never heard that phrase before and wonder where it came from.  The burning issue of the day is turf.  What are we going to do about it?  The proposal made by the Minister is that we stop the sale of turf.  I live in the constituency of Galway East, where towns such as Tuam, Loughrea, Gort and Athenry have social housing.  In the social houses are Stanley 8 ranges that heat the water and radiators and cook the food.  If, tomorrow morning, the local authority were told it had to replace all the heating systems with heat pumps, how long would it take to do so, and at what cost?  One would not find enough heat pumps in this country or maybe in the rest of Europe to do what needs to be done.  If we believe we can do it in the next 12 months, we are actually in cloud cuckoo land.  What we need to do is very simple.  Let us be reasonable about it.  We need to phase out the use of turf and smoky coal.  We have dithered on it for a long time.  However, I guarantee, as a person who has come from the construction industry, that if the Government wants to replace the Stanley 8 turf-burning cookers around this country, it will take ten years.  One cannot bring in something to stop the sale of turf to the people who rely on it &ndash; those who buy the 100 yards and the spread and use the turf to heat their houses for the winter and do all that needs to be done with it.  The problem is that we are not putting the plan in place.  We are having a knee-jerk reaction by announcing something without a proper plan.  Through the warmer homes scheme, for all it is doing, and despite the cost of oil, we are still putting in oil-fired boilers instead of heat pumps.  This is being funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland right now, in 2022.  It is madness.</p>  <p>  We are going to have another fiasco like the one we had with the peat.  We banned peat milling.  We are now importing peat from elsewhere in Europe and causing more carbon dioxide emissions through the decision we made.  There has been no planning.  Really and truly, we need to proceed in a way that will work for people, the country and the environment.  We have a certain amount of time to act, but bringing in a law to ban the sale of turf to neighbours, friends or family members is absolutely cuckoo and has to stop.</p></speech>

However, there is an irony that is not lost on people in that Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies voted last year in favour of the climate action Bill, which paved the way for the carbon tax and the turf ban.</p>  <p>  I have an image in my mind of Deputy Paul Murphy leaving Dublin in search of a turf mine with a speech in his pocket calling turf miners around the country to action.  Unfortunately, Aont&uacute; is the only party that voted against the climate action Bill last year, which Bill was the start of many of these issues.  One of the first things the Taoiseach did when he assumed office was demote the Department of Rural and Community Development and lump it in with the Department of Social Protection.  He left poor old Deputy Ring without a Ministry, which was a big crisis for the then Government.  Also, there was no senior Minister for the west of Ireland at the time.  Sligo, Mayo, Galway, including Galway East, Roscommon, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary are without a representative in the Cabinet.  This is a Dublin-centric Cabinet and Government.  The weight of Government Deputies in the capital is incredible and is deciding the direction the Government is going in this matter.  Ireland is incredibly lopsided and getting worse.  Dublin is overheating.  Right now, a third of the country is a sprawling commuter belt.  People are commuting from Connacht, Munster and Ulster to Dublin to work.  Much of rural Ireland is being depopulated, especially of its young people.  The average age in Balbriggan is 30 while the average age in Killarney is 43.  Since rural Ireland is being left out, young people have no option but to go to the sprawling commuter belt to get a job and raise a family.  The actions of this Government, particularly of the Green Party, the tail that is wagging the dog in the Government, are incredible.  The Government, like the country, is completely lopsided.  It is way out of touch, especially with rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State realise rural Ireland is on its knees?  Utility bills are going through the roof.  Gas bills are coming in at &euro;600 and &euro;700 and it costs well over a grand to fill an oil tank for the home.  It is more costly for people in rural areas than urban areas because they do not have the public transport.  They rely on their own cars to get to work or the shops.  People in rural Ireland are far more likely to use oil than gas for home heating.  Home heating oil has increased in price radically by comparison with other fuels in recent times.  Many homes in rural Ireland are older homes that do not have the insulation necessary to keep in the heat.  People are living from overdraft to overdraft.  Just at this time, the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il think it is a good idea to delete a heat source from their homes.</p> <p>What planet is the Minister living on, given that he thought that in the middle of an energy and cost of living crisis it would be a good idea to delete a heat source from people's homes?  It is absolutely incredible.</p> <p> Turf is the only source of fuel for many homes in this country.  It heats the radiators and stoves on which families cook food.  Families are completely dependent on it.  The idea that the Minister would stop a son or daughter providing turf to a mother or father, or to a person who had put &euro;300 or &euro;400 into the credit union to buy turf to keep his or her family going through the winter period, is incredible.</p> <p> I also heard the Green Party Minister talk about the fact that burning wet turf and timber is as dangerous as burning coal in terms of respiratory illnesses.  Who in their right mind burns wet turf and timber in rural Ireland?  Does he think they have no cop-on at all?  People dry it out every year, and when it is nice and dry they decide to light it.</p> <p> Most of these homes are in rural areas and are one-off houses.  The particulate levels are well dissipated by the time they come into contact with other people.  There is a chasm between the Government's understanding of what is happening in rural Ireland and people's experience.  Dublin Ministers and Deputies living in a concrete jungle - in a city full of pollution - are pointing fingers at rural Ireland for being the cause and source of the damage that is happening.  It is an incredible situation.</p> <p> At the same time, that same Government is supporting the Mercosur deal which sees wide elements of the Amazon being floored of its trees so that beef can be brought thousands of miles into this country.  That has a far bigger impact on the environment than anything produced in this country.  At the same time, massive data centres are being opened in this State which suck in the electricity of half a county.  </p> <p> Rural Ireland cannot understand what is going on with this Government.  A mother and father cooking on a range using turf they got from their son cannot understand how the Government can favour other policies yet damn those families who are trying to survive.  I ask the Government to not just put out statements to say it had strong words with the Green Party Minister today.  Rather, I want the Government to put the idea to bed that a generation comprising mostly older people coming to the end of their lives are expected to go without the necessary fuel sources to live and are instead expected to find investment from somewhere to radically retrofit their homes.</p> <p> The Government talks about retrofit figures in the country.  The retrofit figures on annual basis are paltry.  Last year there were only 18,000 retrofits and ten deep retrofits in the State.  The Government cannot on the one hand take away the fuel source of a community and on the other provide nothing in return.</p></speech>

One would swear to God it was some sort of an illegal drug the way we are talking about it.  I never thought the sale and supply of turf would come to this.  I would like the Minister to look around him.  He was very welcome to Kerry this morning.  I said it to him today and will say it again, any time a Minister comes to our county we welcome him or her with open arms.</p>  <p>  The Minister should look around him.  Where is the support for this?  The backbenchers in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il know that this will be their death knell and final nail in the coffin because they are losing rural Ireland.  The Green Party does not come into this equation at all because this is about what Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are going to do.  The only thing for them to do is to back the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and say that this will not be accepted in any shape or form.  The people have had enough.</p>  <p>  If the people who went before us heard us, as legislators, discussing this issue they would ask how it had come to this or ask what had gone wrong with our politicians.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is the Minister for reintroducing wolves to rural Ireland, shorter showers, car pooling and everyone walking or cycling to a village to get into a car that would not be there in the first place.  He is a Minister who has his foot firmly placed in his mouth from early in the morning until late at night.  At this stage, he and his party are an embarrassment to the environmental movement in Ireland.  They are doing more harm than good.</p></speech>

I have no personal gripe with the Minister, but the Government has annoyed and upset many people in rural Ireland over the past fortnight.  What has been done is unfair.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, must now realise that what he is trying to do to the people of rural Ireland is blackguarding.  He is here now.  He has tried to blackguard the people of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  People can die of the cold as well as because of bad or smoky air or whatever else it is called.  However, they are more likely to die of the cold this winter due to the cost of fuel and everything else.  This is the time of year when people take out a sle&aacute;n and go to the bog.  The Minister must realise that China, Russia, Poland, Romania and the USA are digging mountains of coal at the present time.  We are all under the one sky, whether the Minister realises that or not.  The Minister is focusing his attention on poor people who go to bogs in places like Fybagh, Reaboy and Gneeveguilla or the bogs in Barna.  The Minister is trying to stop those people from cutting a bit of turf and selling it to their neighbours, something they have traditionally done.  The Minister is trying to take away their traditional rights and culture.  He is wrong and should not be hurting ordinary hard-working people in rural Ireland who want a bag or box of turf.  With the power he has, what he is trying to do to people is a disgrace.</p></speech>

The State pension is &euro;13,100 per annum.  The minimum wage is &euro;21,840 per annum.  People have to pay for groceries, house and car insurance and the price of a car.  People in rural Ireland can barely live on what they have at the moment.</p>  <p>  I spoke on radio during the week with the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.  He mentioned the &euro;2 billion the Government will spend on energy grants for people in Ireland, but he forgot to mention that that is only for ESB and gas.  I was accused of not knowing what I was talking about.  I had to remind the Minister of State that 67.8% of the people in County Limerick rely on oil and solid fuel to heat their homes.</p> <p>They are the people who elected him and Deputy O'Donovan to come up here and look after them in a time of crisis.  They are the people who Deputies Niall Collins and O'Donovan will go to looking for votes.  They sent them up here to get them fairness until there are alternatives.  They have the likes of the Minister drawing a line across it and saying that we should get rid of turf, solid fuels and coal, and tax everything out of existence.  If that happens, the 70% of people in County Limerick who rely on these fuels and have no alternatives will suffer but everyone living in areas with gas and public transport will actually make a saving.  That is on the Government Deputies who are present, and every other Deputy from Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  When Deputies Niall Collins and O'Donovan go to the doors in County Limerick, that is what they will hear from the 70% of people in the county who are affected.  They asked the Deputies to represent them but they have not been doing so.  I will be watching which way they vote on this.</p></speech>

As of now, do we know whether the sale of turf is banned?  As far as the Taoiseach was concerned earlier today, it is okay to sell it this year.  It is a case of kicking the can down the road as far as he is concerned.  Of course, he will be gone from next year so he does not care.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is now present in the Chamber, came out last week and said that grannies would not be arrested for burning turf.  Does he dream up this nonsense and turn it out of his mouth for the craic?</p>  <p>  This Government has no idea what is happening on the ground.  Its Deputies are frantic.  Today they are saying they had a robust meeting of backbenchers.  They are all in deep trouble in their constituencies and they know it.  They will get it hot and heavy.  They are on the ground and going around in a bubble, just waiting for the next nod-and-wink grant aid announcement so they can lay claim to taxpayers' money and glorify their part in the allocation.  The groups involved tell me they are insulted by such claims as it is the groups themselves that are working their butts off to get the grants in the first place.</p>  <p>  I refer to the lack of interest shown by the Taoiseach in the House this afternoon when we raised the issue of the struggles that farmers, fishermen and ordinary mothers and fathers are going through thanks to this Government.  All he gave was a smirk and sarcastic comments that have no place in the D&aacute;il.  We have constituents coming to us to ask how they will be able to pay the ever-rising cost of daily living or whether they should pay to heat their homes or to put food on the table.  The past couple of weeks have made this island a laughing stock, with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announcing what he dreamt of overnight and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies jumping up and down, frantically trying to hide from being behind this shameful announcement.  Those Deputies are completely guilty of what went on during the Easter break.  I heard a so-called expert stating on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 last Saturday morning that wet turf is dangerous.  Where did RT&Eacute; find this comedian?  No one living in rural Ireland burns wet turf unless he or she is crazy.  The good people of rural Ireland would never do the likes of it.</p></speech>

The Green Party is acting as if it is the conscience of the country.  It is high time for the rural Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael to stand up for their constituents.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has no right to dictate to people on how they should heat their homes.  In my county, 38% of people are dependent on fossil fuels, mainly turf.  These are not just elderly people.  They are families with no other source of heating.  How dare the Green Party try to create such hardship?  When I heard about the ban, I thought it was a late April fools joke.  It is a joke.  Limiting it to villages with a population of 500 or more is still a joke.  It is not acceptable.  We will continue to burn turf in rural Ireland whether the Minister likes it or not.</p>  <p>  I want to make the Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in aware that I and my Rural Independent Group colleagues have tabled an amendment to this motion.  Our amendment calls on the Government to provide an explicit commitment that it will ensure the sale, marketing and distribution of turf at voluntary or commercial level will be permitted permanently.  We are not giving up our traditions for the Minister's vanity project that is going nowhere.  We want this to be permitted permanently.  We do not want it to be kicked down the road by any Government or party.  The Government must make a firm and permanent commitment to the people of rural Ireland.  That is what we are seeking.</p>  <p>  The amendment also calls on the Government to investigate the possibility of categorising turf use as a protected cultural practice under such instruments as the Council of Europe framework convention on the value of cultural heritage for society, also known as the Faro Convention.  I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, through a parliamentary question.  To the best of my knowledge, one year later I have not received a response.  The Government thinks it can do what it likes and that it is not accountable to us as politicians and fellow Deputies, or to the people of rural Ireland, but it will not get away with this one.  It is not happening - not now; not ever.</p></speech>

I will be supporting the motion.  I, along with colleagues here, have fought consistently to raise matters relating to housing, health and climate change on the floor of the D&aacute;il but we were laughed at.  I am no climate denier and I am not here to demonise the Green Party.  We have to make fundamental changes in the context of climate change but the absence of leadership and the divisive manner in which that is being tackled fills me with despair.  I absolutely despair that it has become a divisive conversation.  I never agreed with carbon tax.  It is a divisive tax that punishes the poor while letting the big polluters off the hook.  What the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has done here, aside from creating a communications fiasco, is even worse in the sense that he has divided people from each other under the guise of a climate change action when what we really need is leadership, unity, solidarity and to get a message across that we are in it together.  We should have learned from Covid that we cannot split and divide.  We have to get a message across that we need transformational change.  That is not done by making an announcement that people will not be allowed to use turf from September.</p>  <p>  Of those in my constituency, 23% or 25% use turf.  What provision has been made in respect of those people?  The debacle of various backbenchers and other Deputies going on radio programmes to speak on this is appalling and unacceptable.  It is setting climate change way back.  The Government is doing this at a time when energy prices are going through the roof.  We have heard the figures.  I looked them up.  The price of home heating oil rose by 58.5% between February and March and by a further 126.6% in the 12 months to March 2022.   I do not have enough time in my few minutes to quote all the other statistics.  The Minister knows them well.  On top of that, average rents in the county from which I come, outside the city, have increased by 19%.  I ask the Minister to listen to these figures.  Houses and rent used to be cheaper outside the city.  Rents in the county increased by 19% from 2020 to 2021.  In Galway city, they cannot rise any more, but they still rose by 8.8% in a short quarter.</p>  <p>  On top of that, the Government's amendment to the motion cynically refers to the number of deaths per year as a result of air pollution.  I welcome that the Government is beginning to look at things like that but it has included that statistic in a very cynical way in this context.  None of its amendments have ever referred to the number of people who die each year from poverty, bad housing or being left on hospital trolleys.  Dr. Hickey in Sligo has said at least 300 deaths every year are directly related to the person having spent two or three days on a trolley.  In my city, people are being left for seven or eight days on a trolley and, furthermore, they are without visitors, but that is an issue for another day.</p>  <p>  What should we do here when we are faced with the existential threat to the planet of climate change?  Should we go down a divisive road of telling the turf users who make up 23% of the people in my county that they cannot use it in September; they can sit and freeze?  Should we tell them that turf burning will have to stop at some stage, outline the way that will be done and show them what we are going to do for them because they will help us with our climate strategy?  Should we keep on with these idiotic debates where we vote for or against something and the Opposition divides up in different ways, with the Labour Party telling us one thing or Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, for whom I have the greatest of respect, proudly stating he did not vote for the climate action Bill?  We are facing an existential crisis and we need leadership and transformational action but that is sorely lacking.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Kerrane and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.</p> <p>One issue that must be recognised, as mentioned by Deputy Martin Kenny, is that in the case of many social housing developments, including, for example, in Tuam and in different parts of counties Galway and Roscommon, ranges and stoves are installed and people are getting &euro;1,300 per year to heat those homes.  The councils are not going to have the heating systems in all those properties changed by next September.  Many of the people living in them buy either a plot of turf or a few trailer-loads of turf from someone.</p> <p> It is necessary, first, to understand turf.  I will not deny I am a bogman.  I was on the bog this morning, where I met and talked to a few people.  There is an attitude that the way this is being handled is like a bully in the schoolyard taking it out on the small children.  People feel they are being targeted while, at the same time, 7,000 tonnes of coal are being burned in Moneypoint to keep the lights on.  I am not saying that does not need be done.  I know we are under pressure.  Six artic loads of diesel or oil are being used to keep the generators going but we are talking about people burning a bit of turf.  A transition is needed and we must resolve this issue.  Nearly every Fianna Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy from around the country has taken part in radio station discussions and agreed with Opposition Deputies that this cannot happen.  However, when a vote is called or whatever, they still will run into this House and do the same thing.</p> <p> We need to resolve this issue.  During the Covid pandemic, we were told to use one bottle and then another bottle to clean our hands.  Let us say we have a peat briquette in one hand and a sod of turf in the other.  What is the difference?  The Government has said a peat briquette is okay.  Ministers will say that people in UCD and other places have done tests on this, but I have done my own tests.  If something is allowed to season, its moisture content is brought down.  I backed the proposal by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on reducing the moisture content to below 25%.  I understand he is leaving it at that.  He needs to work with the industry over the next few years to resolve this issue.  On top of that, clarification needs to come rapidly.  What happened, however, was we had a one-line statement on turbary rights and, hey presto, that was that.</p> <p> There are ten different ways in which people can own a bog.  There are fee simple rights, for instance, and acquired rights.  What about the people who historically took a plot of wet turf and used it, whether they lived in a town of more than 500 people, in a city or wherever?  There are people with turbary rights who live in cities.  The understanding of this issue is complex.  I have fought many a day with the people in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, but, in fairness to them, they have a fair knowledge of what went on and the different types of ownership in bogs.  Lisnageeragh Bog covers 3,000 acres on one side of the road, which the people in the NPWS worked to preserve.  On the other side of the road are 100 acres, where people cut their bit of turf.  What about the people who gave up their bog and were told by the NPWS they would be given turf?  By the way, the State pays at the moment to take turf to people's houses.  What about the people who were asked to take money and buy turf somewhere?  What about those who moved to relocation sites under a licence?  Does that amount to a turbary right?  No, it does not, but all that was given was a one-line statement on turbary rights.</p> <p> Since 2020, the price of home heating oil has gone from 43 cent a litre to approximately &euro;1.30 today.  The price of gas has gone up by 45% to 50%.  People cannot just knock off one light and we cannot tell them they have to stop using turf in September.  We need a just transition.  In saying this, I am not going against the Government.  I am trying to work with it.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, is willing to work with it.  The one thing the Minister must do is come down off the high horse when it comes to the September deadline.  What is needed is for him to work with the industry to ensure that in larger urban areas, the moisture content is brought down and the peat briquette is made sound.  Whether with timber or peat, the moisture must be brought below the 25% level he requires.  That is achievable if it is done in that way.  We do not have to complicate it by talking about this town having 100 people, that one having 500 and the one with 50,000 being a no-go area.  The Government needs to introduce something whereby, in the case of a population over 5,000 or 10,000, as with timber, there is a requirement that the moisture content be at a certain level.</p> <p> People seem to think we in rural Ireland are gorms who go out and cut and burn a tree and split the chimney liner to make sure we do harm.  That is not done.  The wood is seasoned and the same is done with turf.  I spoke to a person today who has turf in his shed for two years to let it season.  I guarantee the moisture level of that turf is below that of a peat briquette.  There needs to be rationality and common sense brought into this discussion.  Above all, we need to hear from people who know a bit about it.  I have listened to stuff in here tonight that would make you vomit if you come from a bog.  I have listened to the BS that came out of some people about mining turf.  By the Lord Jesus, we are hearing about mining, above all things.  A lot of people are talking about bogs who know nothing about them.</p> <p> I came from the bog, grew up in it and lived in it.  I am proud to be from it.  I can tell the Minister now that he needs to sit down and talk to his backbenchers and others.  We will work with him but the bottom line is that the machines were out today in every bog in the country cutting turf.  He cannot tell people next September that they cannot buy that turf.  It is cut and it is done.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has expressed the view that the May carbon tax increase should be cancelled, excise duty on home heating oil should be temporarily removed and plans to regulate the sale of turf should be scrapped.  I have listened carefully to the debate this evening and will take this opportunity to remind Deputies of the rules governing energy taxation in Ireland and to highlight the importance of carbon tax to Government policy on climate action.  I also will reiterate some of the measures put in place by the Government to mitigate the impacts of price increases.</p>  <p>  Many contributors spoke about the pressures on people, whether in rural or urban Ireland, in dealing with the cost of living and rising inflation in recent months.  We all get that and want to work on it.  The initiatives brought forward by various Ministers have seen more than &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money being used to take the pressure off people and reduce their costs.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, went through some of those initiatives earlier.  We recognise that they do not alleviate every pressure or cost for people and families throughout the country, regardless of where they live.  There is no one denying that.  We want to work continually on this issue and respond as best we can.</p>  <p>  I compliment some of the speakers tonight.  However, comments about rural Ireland being on its knees are not fair on rural areas.  I was in a part of Kerry today where 2,500 jobs have been created by one company, Fexco.  Every part of rural Ireland has stories like that.  There are parts under pressure, just as there is pressure in some urban areas, but the constant debate in here about how rural Ireland is dying or on its knees is not fair on our rural areas.  There are many parts of rural Ireland that are thriving and I want to work with Departments to enhance and develop them.  I ask Deputies not to keep talking down our own country.  People in those parts of rural Ireland have ambitions and want to thrive.  They want to avail of Government schemes, create jobs and do well.  They do not want to be insulted in here by being told their areas are dying.  That will not help them to attract the investment they need from any Department, whether in jobs, education or anything else.  Deputies should not continue to insult rural Ireland.  We accept that some parts need extra help or need to be regenerated.</p></speech>

I can tell them, with the back problems I have, that I have spent time on a bog.  I know all about it.  Some Deputies have that experience but there are plenty of people speaking here who probably never were on a bog, footed turf and brought it home but who claim to be experts just because this issue is popular.</p>  <p>  Let us have a real and proper conversation about how we can achieve a just transition over time.  It is what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to do and we are working with everybody to achieve it.  Let us not exaggerate what is being proposed.

We have to work within that and try to reduce the cost pressures on people.  This point has been discussed at length in recent weeks.  I have made it clear that there are limitations to what the Government can do in its response, but we will certainly try to channel taxpayers' money to ease the pressure in that regard.  We have said many times that the final retail price of fuel is determined by a number of factors, most of which are global phenomena and out of the Government's control.  Market dynamics have driven up the pre-tax cost of kerosene dramatically in recent months.  No one is denying that.  It is clear for anyone to see.  It is also clear that taxation of energy products is not behind the current prices and their increase.</p>  <p>  As mentioned earlier, kerosene is subject to mineral oil tax, which is comprised of a non-carbon and a carbon component, known as carbon tax.  Kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of &euro;0.  The carbon component is currently &euro;84.84 per 1,000 l.  Consequently, if we were to temporarily remove excise duty on kerosene, we would in effect undermine our carbon tax measure as the Government would come under pressure to remove carbon tax on all fuels and, before we knew it, there would no longer be a coherent response to probably the biggest medium-term challenge we face, which is climate change.  Anybody living in Ireland, rural or urban, wants us to play our part to tackle climate change and save and preserve rural Ireland.  Let us be fair and honest about that.  We know they do, but they want it done in a just way that is fair to everybody.  They want us to play our part to protect rural Ireland the way we know it, live in it and enjoy it, for our generation and many generations ahead.  We need to remember that in these discussions.</p>  <p>  Carbon tax is fundamental to our achieving our climate change strategy of halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero no later than 2050, and it is critical, in the Government's view, that nothing is done to endanger that strategy.  This also explains why the Government opposes cancelling the carbon tax increase due to commence on 1 May.  However, we have brought in other measures to deal with the consequences of that and to make sure that that carbon tax does not put added financial pressure on anybody who cannot afford it.  That is why the measures were announced in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The Government has also made clear the restrictions it faces with VAT on kerosene, which is at a special parked rate of 13.5% and cannot go below 12%.  In this regard, the House should also note that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wrote to Commissioner Gentiloni on 10 March and outlined the various actions he had taken to mitigate the cost of energy for households and businesses to date.  He acknowledged the importance of the energy and tax and VAT directives, in particular the framework they provide for a consistent application of these taxes across all member states.  However, he outlined the limitations of the changes to annexe III to the VAT directive insofar as they specify that reduced rates may be applied only to gas and electricity and, therefore, that other fuels remain outside the scope of the reduced rates.  In this context the Minister asked the Commission to consider allowing member states to respond to the crisis with greater flexibility than is permitted under the current directives.</p>  <p>  On 23 April, the Commissioner wrote to all finance ministers regarding the energy crisis, responding to points the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his European counterparts had raised.  The Commissioner highlighted the current flexibility provided by EU directives, including the newly agreed amendment to VAT rates.  The Commissioner also indicated that the Commission does not envisage any further revisions of the EU taxation framework to respond to the current crisis.  Therefore, there is very little room for significant changes on the VAT side regarding kerosene.</p>  <p>  In summary, it is necessary to respond to the current energy price dynamics, and in this regard the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, outlined earlier what has been done to date to try to deal with those dynamics and alleviate the pressures.  However, our response cannot be at the expense of climate action policy, and I think most people would agree with that.  It is a matter of taking away some of the financial pressure.  In the long run the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them and to develop and to create our own energy not only for ourselves but also for export.  We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government's commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>  <p>  As for other actions, we heard earlier the list of measures the Government has taken to mitigate the impact of increased fuel prices from the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  I remind Deputies that the measures taken by the Government have been proven to more than offset the May increase in carbon tax, and they do so in a progressive manner that reaches those most in need.  Significant enhancements of the fuel allowance will protect those most vulnerable to energy poverty, while the reduced excise rates on auto fuels, reduced VAT on energy bills and the &euro;200 utility credit will mitigate impacts across society.</p>  <p>  As for turf, as Members of the House heard earlier, the Government recognises that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands.  The burning of large quantities of turf, however, is associated with harmful levels of particulate matter emissions.  These emissions can have a considerable public health impact.  Therefore, Government policy will look to address these public health concerns while respecting local traditions in personal use of turf for home heating.  That involves cutting and saving of turf.  To be very clear, no ban on the burning of peat is proposed, but instead a regulatory provision will be made to reduce and prohibit the sale of sod peat in larger clusters of urban settings while allowing the traditional sale in rural areas and use by families there.  That is respected.  It is a matter of finding a way to plot a course through this.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to work with us all to guide us through that and to reduce the harmful effects where such fuels are used in large urban centres.  We can all see the benefits of the reduction in the burning of coal in many of our urban centres.  We all know and recognise that.  The question is how we can build on that initiative to protect the greater public health for us all.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that the current energy price crisis remains an immediate priority for the Government.  Our response to date has been comprehensive and immediate.  While many of the forces dictating the current situation are outside of our control, the Government will continue to use the policy responses we have to mitigate the impacts on businesses and consumers and to take the pressure off many people living in both rural and urban Ireland.  We must, however, remain committed to the policies which are critical to meeting our obligations on climate action.  The carbon tax is a key pillar of Government policy to transition to a decarbonised society.  The policy of ring-fencing carbon tax receipts for welfare supports for those at risk of energy poverty also ensures that this transition is done in a just and progressive manner.  Similarly, the policies proposed on turf cutting are part of our broader commitments on climate action and to improve air quality for everybody.  Accordingly, I do not accept the motion before the House and present the Government countermotion for consideration.</p></speech>

Since that came out, it has been one long fiasco after another.  After showing complete disregard for the 9% of rural households in this country who depend on turf to heat their homes, it quickly went to the Minister making outlandish and dismissive statements like "we won't jail your granny" and unworkable suggestions relating to population limits.  All this shows a strange disregard for the reality of the situation so many people face.  There are people in Tipperary choosing between heat and food.  That is where we are in 2022, and that is on the Government's watch.</p>  <p>  No matter how much the Minister, Deputy Ryan, wants everyone to make the transition immediately, the Government has made it impossible for many.  I have spoken to many people across Tipperary who would like to have their homes retrofitted, but that is out of their reach, and the coalition is to blame for that.  It failed to plan properly and instead rolled out schemes that discriminate based on people's level of income.  It is plain wrong, and now it wants to ban turf, which is the only fuel that has not gone up in price with inflation.  The price of home heating has increased the most, and the Government would not cut excise on it.  Instead it wants to add the carbon tax.  Far more people live in energy poverty than receive the fuel allowance, yet at a time when there is an immediate crisis the Government would prefer to see them with fewer choices available to them.</p>  <p>  Of course we must take steps to ensure that people live with proper air quality and a good environment for future generations.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports that, no matter what the Government and some in the Opposition who spoke earlier want to spin.  We are not climate deniers, but the Government is going about this backwards.  It is undermining the climate action message with a fixation on punitive measures.  The Government should have identified those who are dependent on turf and at risk of fuel poverty and supported them to transition by prioritising them for schemes like retrofitting or putting electric cars within their reach.  This Government has not even established how many people are in energy poverty here because it has not lived up to its commitment to do so in the 2016 strategy to combat energy poverty.  Sinn F&eacute;in will bring forward a Bill to address that in due course.</p> <p>I call on the Government, especially its backbenchers who are conspicuous by their absence this evening, to scrap plans to ban the sale of turf from September 2022, cancel the carbon tax increase due to commence on 1 May and temporarily remove excise on home heating.  I call on the Government Deputies who have called foul over this to stand by their recent commitments and support this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600044#SS00200"><p>The vast majority of people who use turf as their main fuel are those who are in poorer circumstances across the country.  They live in rural Ireland and do not have many options.  They, more than anyone else, need retrofitting grants that are an awful lot bigger than those the Government is offering.  They cannot afford to retrofit because they do not have &euro;25,000.  Retrofitting costs &euro;50,000, with the Government providing &euro;25,000.  Where will they get the other 50% or &euro;25,000?  The Government is now telling these people they can no longer burn turf.  It is unbelievable that the Government can screw things up to such an extent.  It steps into one big pothole after the next.  Every time it seems to come up with a solution for something, it finds a way of screwing it all up.  There is no need to go down this route.  The Government should concentrate on ensuring it can provide adequate options for people.  If people had options, they would embrace them.  Instead of doing that, the Government is taking out a big stick and beating people up because they happen to live in rural areas and turf happens to be the most convenient and cheapest fuel they can find.</p>  <p>  Most people who burn turf have a bog close to them.  They can hire someone to get a couple of hoppers of turf or cut them themselves during the summer.  They can get them home and put them in their shed.  Turf is a fuel that is immune to wars or turbulence across the world because it belongs to people and they have access to it.  That is what seems to be missing and people do not recognise that.  The Government does not seem to understand why people in predominantly rural Ireland are so angry about this.  They feel it is an assault on something they, their families and everyone belonging to them have done for so long.  It was there when their backs were to the wall.  Prices are increasing for everything, including the other fuel option for people, namely, oil.  Prices for oil firing are going up all the time, as are electricity prices and the price of everything else.  However, turf is the fuel people own and the Government is saying it will ban it.</p>  <p>  I just cannot believe it.  I understand that the green movement is an international movement.  I understand what it is about but I cannot believe there can be such short-sightedness in trying to develop alternatives for people.  Why on earth did the Government go down this route?  What is wrong that people cannot see the common sense of doing the right thing for everyone?  Doing the right thing means the Government should provide for the people who have the lowest income and the least choice before taking out a stick to beat them up, yet the Government continues to do that.  It needs to withdraw its amendment, support our motion and get rid of this stupid nonsense that is going on here tonight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-26a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600044#SS00300"><p>As Sinn F&eacute;in has acknowledged previously, and acknowledges in the motion, the Government cannot do everything when it comes to the cost of living and, in particular, the energy crisis that households right across this State face.  However, there is a glaring anomaly in relation to rural households, the vast majority of which rely on home heating oil and nothing else to heat their homes, and the reduction and removal of excise duty.</p>  <p>  The Minister went to great lengths to tell us about the difficulties in relation to reducing VAT.  He spent from October last to April telling us that VAT could not be reduced.  Eventually, we heard it could be reduced.  That has not happened for home heating oil, which has to be reduced.  The same applies to the many rural households that rely on turf.  Many people, of whom I am one, do not necessarily enjoy going to the bog.  We go reluctantly.  Many members of the generation before us are much happier to go to the bog and actually enjoy it.  A previous speaker stated there is a kind of mystic belief for people when it comes to bogs.  It is so much more than that for our older generation.  I am thinking of my nanny who is 90 years of age.  She would go to the bog tomorrow before she would go anywhere in the world.  The bog means so much to that older generation.  Turf cutting is being phased out and turf is not going to last forever.  New homes are being built without chimneys.  Young people do not have the same interest in going to the bog.  It is going to phase out naturally.  That should be allowed to happen.</p>  <p>  It is not unreasonable for people in rural communities and for those of us on the Opposition benches to ask for alternatives to be put in place before the Government takes away the only source of fuel that rural households have.  That is a reasonable ask from Opposition parties.  All of us, including people in rural communities, want to play our part when it comes to climate action.  Everyone wants to do their bit.  However, for rural communities it is more difficult to play that part because the alternatives are not there.  We do not have the same options when it comes to public transport.  In many cases, it simply does not exist.  We have not had the same options as regards changing home heating.  People have to have money in their pocket if they want to take up the grants the Government has made available.  That, in the first instance, is an immediate problem. </p>  <p>  There are various views in the House on the carbon tax increase.  Again, the difficulty for those of us who live in rural communities is that there are no alternatives.  The carbon tax is almost irrelevant for people who have a lot of money.  They can buy an electric car and upgrade their house without having to think twice about it.  From Sunday, the Government is piling a carbon tax increase on people who do not have that disposable income.  They cannot afford the alternatives.  They will be the people who will make the difficult decision not to turn on the heating.  They will contribute to the 3,000 people who die in Ireland every year due to fuel poverty.  It is a great stain on our State in this day and age that this is happening.</p>  <p>  With respect, I wish Members on the Government benches would stop talking about the cost-of-living package in the budget last October, which was months ago.  They keep referring to the social welfare increases that are now totally irrelevant.  There were no social welfare increases for two years.  People who are on those higher social welfare rates have incomes of approximately &euro;50 a month below the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, which would protect them from poverty.  None of our social welfare rates do that.  There has also been a consistent over-reliance on the fuel allowance.  There is no link to the fuel allowance and people who are at risk of or are living in fuel poverty.  People get the fuel allowance if they get a certain number of payments.  That is it.  There is no link between the fuel allowance and fuel poverty.  It does not exist.  </p>  <p>  Government Deputies also spoke about allocating to households that are at risk of fuel poverty.  How can the Government do that when it does not know who is in fuel poverty?  We do not have the data.  The Government did not meet the commitment outlined in the strategy in 2016 to look at those houses that are in fuel poverty.  That is the first step.  As a Deputy said earlier, we have not said what needs to be done in relation to action for rural communities.  The first thing we have to do is identify households that are experiencing fuel poverty or are at risk of it.  We have to prioritise them for retrofitting.</p>  <p>  We heard that energy upgrades would be deployed rapidly and at scale.  Where are they being deployed rapidly and at scale?  The warmer homes scheme has a waiting list of two years to get a home retrofitted.  That is only if someone receives the fuel allowance, which is allocated to a small number of the population.</p>  <p>  On turf, the Government has to consider what it is asking people to give up.  People rear their turf and when they put it in the range it heats every radiator in the house and the water.  People can cook breakfast, dinner and tea on the range.  The Government has to consider what it is asking people to give up.</p>  <p>  This motion has been brought forward in good faith by those of us who come from rural communities and know the impact this fiasco over the past two weeks has had.  It has caused worry and stress, particularly to our older generation who deserve far better.  I ask the Government to reconsider its position on the motion.</p></speech>
