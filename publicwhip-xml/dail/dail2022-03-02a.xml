It has been an important matter over many years, but over the past six days it has become even more important in the context of the geopolitical issues occurring in Ukraine.  I wish to take this opportunity to express my complete revulsion and outrage at what has been done by Russian forces to the people of Ukraine over the past six days and express my solidarity with every man, woman and child in Ukraine.  I hope that the glorified spy ring on Orwell Road known as the Russian Embassy, which I am sure is listening to what is being said this morning, as it is every day, will very soon get its marching orders out of this country never to come back.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and appreciate him for being here.  However, it is unfortunate that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here to take this matter because our energy security is something of utter importance right now and in the short, medium and long terms.  Throughout Europe, countries have in the past six days pivoted in their position on energy security and changed their policies.  In Germany, the Green Party is in government and a decision was made in recent days to build liquified natural gas, LNG, terminals.  Issues that were not even on the table this time last week are now being considered and decisions are being made to change policy because of the over-reliance on gas coming from Russia and the time it will take to provide alternatives.  People are now starting to think realistically and transition to renewable sources of energy that we all know are needed in the future.  There is time in the middle and a period during which I am afraid that the lights will go out.  I am very concerned that our only policy in this country for that transitional period seems to be one of complete denial and that we are, in effect, going to hope for the best and hope that the lights do not go out.</p>  <p>  We have had many amber alerts regarding energy supply in recent times, before the appalling situation in eastern Europe kicked off.  What do we think is going to happen in the future?  This is something that is, as I said, of critical importance to our entire country and everybody on the island, yet our policy of denial is something that I feel will not work in the future.  I do not believe that a Joe Jacob-style policy of handing a candle out to every household in case the lights go out, like the iodine tablets years ago - something we might need again - is enough.  We need something more concrete.    An application is currently up for a decision regarding the building of an LNG terminal on the Shannon estuary.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to try to safeguard some of our national energy security, yet we have a stick our head in the sand approach from Government, as far as I can see, regarding what we need do to keep the lights on in this country.  We all want to move to renewables, but that is not simple and cannot be done overnight.  The misinformation and twist being put on the Shannon LNG application, which involves overlooking the renewable and transitionary elements of the application and its compatibility with future technologies, is concerning.  I would appreciate a response from the Minister of State regarding whether those issues can be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200003#A00500"><p>I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this very important issue around energy security and policy.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who could not be here today.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I wish to reiterate that the Government continues to stand in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our EU partners.  Our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity remains unwavering.  We stand with the people of Ukraine and will work with the EU to provide continued support.  Let me condemn the outrageous actions of Russia and Belarus in their aggression in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  This crisis has brought into sharp focus the reliance of the EU and Ireland on fossil fuel imports.  We must continue to accelerate the clean energy transition, focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energies.  The European Commission is working closely with member states to protect the resilience and security of Europe's gas supply.  The Commission is also actively engaging with other countries to ensure a sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result in disruptions.  </p>  <p>  Natural gas continues to flow and be traded normally, albeit at high prices.  Lessons have been learned since the Russian gas crisis of 2006-2009, including the adoption of an improved internal energy market in the European Union.  Ireland sources roughly one-quarter of its gas from the Corrib gas field and three quarters via the UK.  The UK's gas supply comes mainly from indigenous supplies via pipelines from Norway and through imports of LNG.  In addition, the UK also imports via two gas interconnectors connecting the UK to Belgium and the Netherlands.  The UK and Ireland have far less reliance on Russian gas than other European countries.  </p>  <p>  An analysis of the potential impact of a partial or complete curtailment of Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe indicates that, in the unlikely event of a disruption to Russian supplies, the result would be manageable for Europe.  Ireland is a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, and is in continuous consultation with our European and international partners to ensure energy security.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his counterparts agreed to release 60 million barrels from oil reserves to show solidarity with Ukraine and help maintain stability in global oil supplies.  This is only the fourth time in the IEA's history that it has agreed to a release of strategic reserves, which demonstrate the international community's commitment to maintaining stability in energy markets and solidarity with Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  Ireland holds 90 days demand of stock in oil, in line with its international commitments, and intends to participate in the action.  Ongoing conflict in the Ukraine region is likely to maintain pressure on European gas prices, with knock-on effects on electricity prices.</p> <p>Like Ireland, both the IEA and the EU have stressed that the current situation only further threatens our collective resolve to accelerate the clean energy transition in line with the European green deal.</p></speech>

I do not why we have Topical Issue matters if the Ministers responsible do not show up.  There is not really much point.  I have been in the situation previously where I have had to answer for other Ministers in the Chamber.  There is no point in me having at go at the Minister of State today.  I would like to have had a decent discussion with the Minister to try to get to the bones of the issue, but unfortunately that has not happened.  I do not know why the Minister is not here.  I wish to make the point that the cheese has moved.  In the last six days, things have changed.  It is okay for Government to change policy when matters of fundamental change occur outside of our control.  Yet, from the response the Minister of State has given me, I am convinced that the heads are still very firmly buried in the sand and the sand has gone into the brain at this stage.  Europe is so dependent on Russian gas that it is going to impact on this country.  We need to have options and we need to be able to look at alternative sources while we get our act together in relation to renewable energy.  As long as we continue to deny that and to ignore that reality, we are at risk of the lights going out.  I raised the issue three months ago in this Chamber.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was not available for questions on that occasion either.  I told the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith, not to blame the people of County Kerry or the rest of us if the lights go out.  We have done everything that we can to try to progress the Shannon LNG proposal, for example.  It has been going on for years now.  I met the people of Ballylongford on Monday to discuss the issue again.  There was hope that the Government would see sense.  Now, we are getting the same drivel back from officials in the Department, who seem to be completely wagging the dog in relation to our energy policy.   As far as I can see, they are people who are living in a bunker and do not have any cop on in relation to our energy security.  I ask that this crazy policy is reviewed before the lights go out and before people are sitting the dark and the cold in this country because of Government inaction and its determination to ignore reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200004#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the very important matter of Ireland's energy security following the invasion of Ukraine.  I hear the Deputy's considered views and opinions.  I will certainly bring them the Minister's attention.  The best way to secure our energy needs is to continue to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets us on a pathway to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels dramatically by 2030.  Measures include the following: aiming for up to 80% of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, including an increased target of up to 5 GW of offshore wind, 8 GW from onshore wind and 1.5 GW to 2.5 GW from solar PV; 500,000 extra walking, cycling and public transport journeys per day by 2030; and an increase in the proportion of kilometres driven by passenger electric cars to between 40% and 45% by 2030, in addition to a reduction of 10% in kilometres driven by the remaining internal combustion engine cars.</p>  <p>  IEA members hold emergency stockpiles of 1.5 billion barrels of oil.  Yesterday's IEA announcement of an initial release of 60 million barrels, or 4% of that stockpile, is equivalent to 2 million barrels a day for 30 days.   This sends a unified and strong message to global markets that there will be no shortfall in supplies as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Any disruption of Russian gas supplies would maintain upward pressure on European gas prices with knock-on effects on electricity prices.  In the unlikely event of any gas supply emergency, there is excellent co-operation between Irish and UK gas system operators.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is the designated national gas emergency manager appointed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  GNI prepares a natural gas emergency plan which sets out a detailed procedure for managing a network gas emergency and provides details on the role of GNI as the national gas emergency manager.  In the medium to long term, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland's electricity and natural gas systems, focusing on the period through to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State being here to respond to the debate.  For the record, I submitted the matter for the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I appreciate that the Government appears to operate on a silo basis.  As a result of the problems that that gives rise to, we have a situation where after a very protracted and sometimes acrimonious issue with community employment, CE, supervisors who resorted to the intervention of the Labour Court, ultimately, a settlement was reached in respect of a financial arrangement on the retirement of CE supervisors, which is most welcome.  What I am really asking for, in the context of this debate, is that Government joins the dots.  There is no difference on the ground, in all practical reality, between the work that CE supervisors, T&uacute;s supervisors and rural social scheme supervisors do.  I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate that.  There is not a community in urban or rural Ireland that is not benefiting significantly from these interventions.  I fail to see why we insist on differentiating between the arrangements for CE supervisors and T&uacute;s and rural social scheme supervisors when they retire.  That is the problem.  Ultimately, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform controls the purse strings.  I appreciate that the Department of Social Protection is hands-on in terms of the day-to-day administration of these issues.  However, as I said at the outset, we need to join the dots here.  Otherwise, we will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to a resolution of this issue.  It would be better to resolve the issue without resorting to that form of acrimony, that level of unnecessary engagement and a repetition of visitations to the Labour Court, which I am absolutely certain, because the circumstances are entirely the same, would result in the same judgment.</p>  <p>  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could consider the matter in detail.  The amounts of money in the context of the overall budget of the Department are very small.  As I said, there is no difference, in practice, between the work these people do in rural social schemes, T&uacute;s and CE schemes.  It is the logical thing to do.  I regret that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done everything to duck, weave and avoid addressing this issue.  I have attempted to submit several parliamentary questions on the issue to that Department on the basis that it ultimately controls the purse strings.  I suspect the Minister may well tell me that notwithstanding his good intentions and wish to resolve this issue, he cannot do so.  That is why I appeal to Government collectively to address this issue and join the dots.  It will be solved and the dots will be connected, ultimately.  Let us do it before we are dragged, kicking and screaming to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200004#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  At the outset, I want to acknowledge the excellent work that is done on the full range of schemes, including the community employment, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes, supported by my Department, and the contribution that these schemes and their workers make to communities across the country.  Work schemes, such as T&uacute;s and the community employment scheme, are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a significant contribution to their communities while upskilling themselves for prospective future employment.  The rural social scheme, RSS, provides farmers and fishers with income support while continuing to work in the area of farming or fishing and also make a contribution to their community.  At present, there are more than 10,000 places available on T&uacute;s and the RSS, with a budget of over &euro;160 million available to support the schemes in 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Social Protection sponsors and funds these schemes that are delivered by independent bodies.  While the Department funds participant and supervisor wages, the Department is not the employer of any scheme participants, their supervisors or team leaders.  Furthermore, the State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.</p> <p>All employers, including the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s implementing bodies, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account under the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002.<br/><br/>Community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors have been seeking the implementation of a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for a number of years.  Discussion had been ongoing for several years through their union representatives to reach an agreement and to have Exchequer funding allocated for this purpose.  The discussions that led to the agreement were held in the clear knowledge and agreement of all involved that they related solely to those parties who were the subject of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation, namely, community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that any agreement reached arising from these discussions would apply only to those parties.  The Deputy will be aware that a settlement was recently reached on this issue when the unions involved confirmed acceptance on 23 December 2021 of the <i>ex gratia</i>payment.  That settlement will now benefit more than 2,200 people who employed by community employment schemes since 2008.  The settlement is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.<br/><br/>Under the terms of this settlement, upon reaching retirement age, community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off <i>ex gratia</i>payment for time employed by community employment schemes since 2008.  People who have retired since 2008 will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place.  The Department is now working to put in place the administrative arrangements to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified community employment workers this year.<br/><br/>The discussions leading to this agreement were held in the context of a specific Labour Court recommendation, dating back to 2008.  This was acknowledged by all participants in the discussions and so the specific agreement referred to by the Deputy is framed in that context and cannot extend to any other workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200005#C00200"><p>The Department of Social Protection did not distinguish itself in helping with this issue between 2008 and the recent resolution of the problem for community employment supervisors.  Of course, the deal was confined to those in the room, which included the Department of Social Protection, the community employment supervisors and their representatives.  We are talking about the people who were locked out of the room, including the T&uacute;s supervisors and the rural social scheme supervisors.  I am sure the Minister of State acknowledges that those people do the exact same work as community employment scheme supervisors.  Notwithstanding the fact that the 2008 Labour Court recommendation was specifically about community employment scheme supervisors, does the Minister of State accept that the people to whom that Labour Court recommendation applies do the exact same work as employees or supervisors of the T&uacute;s and rural social schemes?</p>  <p>  For God's sake, will the Minister of State avoid this circuitous journey to a resolution?  This issue will be resolved because it is the right thing to do.  It is &euro;24 million out of multiple billions of overall expenditure in the Minister of State's Department, which is not a lot of money.  These people do invaluable work.  I know the Minister of State accepts that and that his Department would like to resolve this issue.  Can we end the silo mentality in the Government that states we cannot sit around the table, join the dots, accept the logic of the settlement and extend it to those T&uacute;s and rural social scheme supervisors?  It is the right thing to do.  I know the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, know it is the right thing to do.  Can we have proper engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and have this sanctioned?</p></speech>

It does not have a training element, to make a slight distinction.  It may look as if they are identical from the outside, but they are not.  They are all of equal and high value.  The Deputy knows I place a huge emphasis on the importance of such schemes.  I have visited many community employment, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes over the past number of months, speaking with participants, supervisors and implementing bodies.  I am fully aware of the important work that they carry out in the community.</p>  <p>  I have seen first hand the great work that is being carried out, providing valuable services to the vulnerable members of our communities, in keeping our towns and villages looking so well, and in helping to protect the environment.  The agreement that the Deputy refers to was entered into in the knowledge that it would pertain only to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The focus for the Department at present remains on putting the administrative processes in place that will ensure that payments issue to those supervisors identified by the Labour Court as being entitled to receive them.  Both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I are fully aware that all schemes make a valuable contribution to communities through the provision of services and my Department will continue to support them to do this.</p></speech>

The news last night that the early intervention class in Kilbrittain National School will not close is very welcome.  I cannot emphasise that enough.  It is down to the dedicated parents and staff who understand the value of early intervention autism spectrum disorder classes.  They are essential classes for children aged three to five.  However, this case also reveals a worrying dimension to special needs education.  First, the entire situation in Kilbrittain was of the National Council for Special Education's making.  It closed the class, leading to additional stress for parents and disruption to school life, as well as taking up time that the principal and staff could otherwise have spent with students.  It is now clear that the NCSE can, without engagement, just remove a vital service.  The need for the class in Kilbrittain was never in doubt.  The school had the staff, space and students enrolled.  Nonetheless, a vital service for children with additional needs can be removed just like that.  If the NCSE had engaged with the school in the first place, all of this would have been avoided.</p>  <p>  Second, and most worryingly, it appears that Kilbrittain is not an isolated case.  Indications from the NCSE reveal an agenda to potentially phase out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model, AIM.  AIM is a welcome development, but it cannot in any way replace early intervention classes.  The NCSE has repeatedly refused to clarify whether or not this is its policy.  It has mostly ignored the question, but when it was pressed in a public meeting, it stated it did not want to comment and that it is waiting for the finding of an AIM report, which would lead us to worry or believe that this is being seriously considered or, worryingly, it has already been decided, and that it is potentially pre-judging the findings of that report, with Kilbrittain being the first casualty.  Will the Minister assure us that they will not be phased out and replaced with AIM and explain why the NCSE does not liaise with schools before making decisions?</p></speech>

This is unbelievably important for this community.  My colleague is right to thank and acknowledge the incredibly hard work of the principal, staff, parents and the entire community of Kilbrittain who fought for this.  I also acknowledge the intervention of the Minister's Department.  I was delighted to receive correspondence from the Minister's office last night confirming that the class would reopen.  That intervention is appreciated.  Parents and children should not have to fight for these incredibly important services.  The early intervention pre-school class is an effective model that should be expanded and rolled out nationally.  I would like the Minister's Department, and the NCSE, which the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has responsibility for, to take that on.</p>  <p>  The issue with Kilbrittain has certainly been resolved for next year, but I have to take this opportunity to raise another school's special needs education where children with autism are involved.  I never thought I would be saying this in 2022.</p> <p>Ballydehob national school is undertaking its own fundraising drive in order to pay for an extra special needs assistant, SNA.  It should not happen that it falls to a community and a gentleman - Mr. Barry O'Brien in this case, who is probably best known for arranging the famous turnip racing festival in Ballydehob - to organise a tractor and vintage run in order to fund an SNA allocation for children who need it.  The school has been through two appeals and the request has been turned down twice.  I would love it if the Minister could consider the matter and intervene.</p></speech>

Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for this Government.  This year the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special classes and school places are at unprecedented levels.  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021-22 school year.  Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.</p>  <p>  Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements throughout 2020 and 2021, my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process that has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  I am satisfied this approach is delivering and this intensive intervention has seen the addition of 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places that have already been opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year.</p>  <p>  The Department recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can most certainly be a stressful experience.  The Department is working hard to ensure there are sufficient school places appropriate to the needs of all children available on a timely basis nationwide.  On Cork specifically, there is currently a network of 357 special classes, of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.  Of those 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes, with 81 at post-primary level.  A total of 45 new special classes have been established in Cork for the 2021-22 school year.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme provides up to two years of preschool within the eligible age range without charge.  The access and inclusion model, AIM, introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities and additional needs in the ECCE programme.  The goal is to create a more inclusive environment in preschool so all children, regardless of ability, may benefit from quality early learning and care.  The model achieves this by providing universal supports to preschool settings and targeted supports focusing on the needs of the individual child.  A diagnosis of autism is not required to access AIM support but preschool children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream preschools, with additional supports provided through AIM where required.</p>  <p>  The NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including autism spectrum disorder early intervention classes, where there is an identified need.  I understand that, on occasion, early intervention classes are redesigned as school-age special classes to reflect the changing age profile of students.  Kilbrittain National School currently has an enrolment of 205 students and the school, in conjunction with the NCSE, agreed that whereas an early intervention class could be opened, it would be redesignated as a primary school special class in September 2022 to meet the projected demand for places in the area.  It was further noted the class would cater for the children enrolled in the early intervention class should they continue to require a special class place for primary education.</p>  <p>  On 10 February the school engaged with the NCSE on the emerging need for the retention of the early intervention class in the school and requested that the class be retained.  The NCSE has now reviewed the matter and approval has been given to the school for the retention of the early intervention class for the 2022-23 school year.  In addition, a new special class is being opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class.  This decision was taken following consideration of the needs in the area and the capacity of the school to make the additional provision.</p></speech>

The larger point remains that decisions are being made by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on behalf of schools and not with them.  We all know staff and parents are the experts on local conditions and the needs of children and they should be at the centre of the process, or at least part of it, and currently they are not.</p>  <p>  I will ask the questions again if that is okay.  Will the Minister commit to changing that process?  Is there a move from the NCSE and the Department of Education to phase out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model, AIM?  Is that the report that is currently under way?  The question has not been answered.  I put in questions to the Department and the NCSE but I do not get a reply.  The disability committee has asked the question but still has not received a reply.  The only time we see a response is when the media put in the question but the answer is avoided in this case and Kilbrittain school is referenced on its own.  That is very important but people need to know if this is a national policy.  Was there prejudgment of the AIM report in deciding to close the resource at Kilbrittain?  The Minister has stated this is based on need in an area but how could that happen in Kilbrittain when students were enrolled, staff were in place and accommodation was there for the following year?  It does not make sense.  This is the reality that parents are experiencing.</p></speech>

There is also the extra special needs class allocation, which means the pupils in the current preschool early intervention class have a special needs provision.</p>  <p>  This has shed light, I suppose, on the overall matter of a lack of SNA provision in particular in the west Cork area, particularly in and around Skibbereen.  I do not expect the Minister to know each of these cases individually but I have written to the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, about them.  I speak about some schools in the Skibbereen area, including Coronea National School and Dreeny National School, which only has 0.5 of an allocation for four children with high needs.  There is also Schull National School, which has seven children with very high needs, and St. Joseph's National School in Skibbereen, which has a class with pupils with profound needs.  The NCSE is getting this wrong time and again and its approach must change.</p></speech>

It is important to put on record the commitment of this Government to special education.  It is worth noting that 25% of our budget, as I outlined earlier, is dedicated to special education, which is correct.  That is a budget of &euro;2 billion.  It is also important to note that considerable progress has been made in the past number of years in the provision of special education classes.  We can very clearly say that budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year, which will provide over 1,700 new places.  This means for the 2022-23 school year, there will be a provision of 2,435 special classes, which is significant progress in a short period.  I acknowledge most sincerely that further work must be done.</p>  <p>  On the provision of early intervention, I want to be very clear that the request from the school was received by the Department on 10 February; the acknowledgement from the school that its view was that there was an appropriate opportunity for the early intervention class to continue.  On 1 March it was communicated that the early intervention class would continue in the school, that it would be retained, and that provision would be made for a new special class to be opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class.  That speaks volumes about the proactive nature of the process, the determination and the recognition of where there is a need, early intervention classes will be put in place.  Where there is a need for children to progress from the early intervention class, that will also be catered for.  That is important and we must have a focus on children not just being put into classes but having a facility to progress to meet their future needs.  That is being provided for.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for being here.</p>  <p>  In many HSE documents we see the mantra the "right care", the "right place", the "right time".  In County Meath it does not happen.  We are aware that there is an intent in acute services to close the ICU and emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  We are at the bottom of the list or very close to it for primary care and disability services, GP services or the head of population services, children's services, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology services and on the topic we are to discuss today, namely, mental health services.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the vacancy for a suicide resource officer, for example.  This post has been vacant for longer than other vacancies in any other part of the country, since February 2020.   Also in this context, with day services we have a failure by the HSE to deliver appropriate physical space to deliver services.  As a result, we do not have the services delivered.  For those small number of people who are receiving services, they are stressed and anxious that the service will be cancelled at short notice.  A huge swathe of people who otherwise would have received services are not getting those services.  Active day hospital services are not happening, there is no group work, therapy or assessments.  These services would have been dealing with 70 people a day, and it is not happening.  We want to hear from the Minister of State what the plan is for the physical space and for the services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="09:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200007#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for making herself available for this issue.  We are talking about the day hospital services for mental health in Navan, which as Deputy O'Rourke has said, provided group therapy, individual therapy, assessments, and a clozapine clinic.  Unfortunately, only part of this is happening at this point in time.  Before March 2020, this was happening properly and was fully functional.  The fact is that we did not have the same pressure then in Meath as those on the services at the department of psychiatry in Crosslanes, which is under severe pressure.  Louth and Meath have very low provision of beds.  I am led to believe that it is around 14.2 beds per 100,000 people.  The State average is in the 20s and the EUROSTAT average in 2018 was 34 beds per hundred thousand.  It is very far from the number in Germany which is 128 beds per 100,000 or in Belgium at 135 beds per 100,000 people.  We do not have the service that is required.</p>  <p>  I have particular issues around the protocols and resources for the Drogheda department of psychiatry at Crosslanes.  We had a service that was working and, to a degree, was replacing the need for people to possibly go into hospital.  This is not the case.  We have had a building that was handed over for Covid around March 2020.  It was sought back around August and a promise was made of a modular build.  That modular build later became a block build and it was delivered late in 2021.  There was a fire in the old part of the hospital and the two parts that have been given to mental health services are not fit for purpose.  Electricity is not working and there is no heating.  The clozapine clinic for people who are treatment resistant is operating as a clinic in the cold and they are incredibly worried.</p></speech>

On Deputy O'Rourke's comments, I will check out the situation with the suicide resource officer post vacancy since 2020, and I will revert back to the Deputy on that.  I do not have any detail on that today.</p><p>In relation to Meath mental health services, the HSE provides a wide range of services for adults, children and adolescents, and older people.  These services are provided in various locations and settings and include community outpatient services provided by community mental health multidisciplinary teams, and approved centres and day centres, including Navan mental health day centre.</p><p>In 2020, use of the Navan mental health day hospital was required by Navan general hospital for Covid-19 purposes.  This requirement continued longer than expected, as the pandemic wore on, leaving Meath mental health services without a day hospital.  A longer-term solution was identified, which saw the day hospital move into a block-build construction extension to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  This opened in October 2021 in line with Covid-19 restrictions and was gradually returning to full capacity with face-to-face therapies and assessments being carried out.  Unfortunately, on 27 December, a fire broke out in an adjoining area to the day hospital, which rendered the building unsafe for use.  Remedial works for the fire damage have taken considerable time to address and full safety clearance remains outstanding, though I am assured by the HSE that the clearance is imminent and the day hospital will reopen as soon as possible.</p><p>I note that patients of Meath mental health services continue to receive support and intervention from their local community mental health team.  Also available are our online and telehealth services, many of which are available 24-7.  <i>Yourmentalhealth.ie</i>provides an excellent information service and signposts to numerous NGO partners who provide specialist help on behalf of the HSE.</p><p>It is very disappointing that the centre has been closed, obviously because of Covid, and when it did manage to relocate and the service was up and running that this fire could have happened.  There is more detail in the remainder of the script but as I understand that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is under pressure for time, I will not read it into the record.</p><p>On bed capacity, we are currently carrying out a review of bed capacity throughout the whole country.  Some 25% of our bed capacity is sourced from the private sector.  This is never included in the figures that are used, which only show the public bed capacity.  When this review is finalised it will provide great data for me to be able to see all over the country where there are issues.</p></speech>

I will point to one line that the Minister of State did read into the record which is "I am assured by the HSE that the clearance is imminent and the day hospital will reopen as soon as possible".  I ask the Minister of State to take a personal interest in that to ensure that it happens as quickly as possible and that the services returned to full capacity.</p></speech>

We will all be very interested in the review around the bed capacity and where those weaknesses are that need to be addressed.  As Deputy O'Rourke has said, there is a need for the Minister of State to take a look to ensure that the plan is for the day hospital to be provided with a sufficient amount of space to offer the services that are required, and so it means that we deal with the community care piece.  We are also looking for day hospital services in Dundalk and Drogheda.  This would mean we could have community capacity and it can alleviate the pressure on the acute hospitals, which we all accept are under pressure.  Will the Minister of State give us an assurance that she is going to do the devil and all to make sure this happens?</p></speech>

Sharing the Vision, our new mental health policy, is all about support in the community including day hospitals, peer support, crisis cafes, which all play a hugely important role to allow people with mental health issues to live at home.</p>  <p>  It was unfortunate, which is the only word I can use, that having been closed for so long due to Covid, when the service did reopen, a fire broke out in the adjoining area of the day hospital.  This meant that the building was unsafe for use.  Obviously, we were not in a position to put people into the day hospital then.  I have visited day hospitals all over the country.  They are very important and hugely supportive for people have mental health illness and challenges.  I give both Deputies a commitment here today that I will keep a special eye on this to look at the time frame.  All I want to do is have all of these facilities open to support people with their mental health.</p>  <p>  The temporary closure of the Navan day hospital due to a fire outbreak is very unfortunate.  It has impacted on our ability to provide the level of service we aspire to uphold.  The Deputies will appreciate it was completely out of my control.  The reduction in service has been difficult for individuals using the day hospital, but I assure the Deputies that every effort is being made.  I am confident that services will resume fully in the near future.  Go raibh maith agaibh.  I will revert to the Deputies when I have more information.</p></speech>

At the outset, has it been indicated that the Government is putting forward an amendment to this motion?  I hope it will be accepted.  I will believe that if and when a vote is called.</p><p>In regard to the current national driver licence, to start at the beginning, until 2013 people obtained their driver licences in the same way as they obtained their motor tax, that is, at their local authority offices.  In 2013 the local authorities, which were the issuing authorities for driver licences were replaced with a sole issuing authority, that being the Road Safety Authority.  The Road Safety Authority in its wisdom decided to tender for three contracts, one of which was the front office service where people went in to give their information and hope that they would obtain the licence.  The other two contracts were for the back office to go through the data etc. and the third was for physically printing or making the driver licence.  </p><p>At the time, the Road Safety Authority awarded the contract to the Swiss service company, SGS, to be the front office provider.  One Minister who sat around Cabinet at the time had a certain crisis of conscience thereafter.  We are not aware that he had any at the time when he subsequently announced that that was a contract that should have been given to An Post.  However, it was not given to An Post, but to this Swiss company which set up 33 offices at the time.  It has very recently announced a 34th office.  </p><p>There is now a difficulty, according to information the Minister of State confirmed to me in the D&aacute;il at the end of the week before last when I brought to her attention the difficulties in obtaining appointments at the Ennis office.  She confirmed that the walk-in service, which previously had been discontinued during Covid-19 based on health and safety advice to ensure there was as little contact as possible between people, was completely discontinued when a new contract was awarded in 2021.  I have worries about that on a variety of levels.  The first is that it appears to me, and I do not think it is unfair to suggest, that Covid-19 was used as a cover for the downgrading of a public service.  The second is the lack of a walk-in service <i>per se</i>.  People are still able to go to an National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, office, of which there are now 34 in the country although some of them, including some in the Minister of State's own constituency, operate on a part-time basis, but they have to make an appointment in advance.  To make an appointment, you have either to go online, or ring a number.  I have previously highlighted the difficulties that my constituents in Clare had in booking that ten-minute slot.  One woman in her 80s spent 90 minutes on the phone and people in my office spent 45 minutes on the phone.  I thought this might be unique to Ennis but since I raised this issue with the Minister of State it has come to my attention that this is a widespread problem throughout the country.  </p><p>In the space of less than ten years we have gone from a situation where anybody was able to walk into his or her local authority office and get his or her driver licence, to people not being even able to book an appointment in a public service.  What ought to be a public service is no longer public because it is being provided by a Swiss logistics company, SGS, and it is no longer really a service.  If you cannot book your appointment, and I do not think it unfair to say that if you have to spend almost an hour, or in excess of an hour, on the telephone trying to book a ten-minute appointment, it is inadequate.  I note the Minister of State is agreeing with me on at least that much, this morning.  </p><p>The other thing is you can renew your licence online completely but to do that, you need a public services card.  The Minister of State will be aware that during the previous Government's term of office the Data Protection Commissioner carried out an investigation into the legality of the public services card and in particular using it as a basis or requiring it to provide services other than social welfare services, and found that there was no lawful basis for that.  There was a big brouhaha about it.  The Government took a case against the Data Protection Commissioner which was subsequently compromised or settled between the parties.  To the best of my knowledge, that Data Protection Commissioner finding that it is unlawful to request a public services card for anything other than social welfare services, stands.  Regardless of her view on whether it stands or not, I ask the Minister of State to point to me somewhere in legislation which says that a public services card is required in order to renew a driver licence.  The public services card is not mentioned anywhere in the Road Traffic Acts and they are what govern the granting of driver licences.</p><p>Why are we making it so difficult to renew driver licences?  That is what I would like to know.  Why are we moving State services in this direction which is essentially to trim them, to privatise them and make them less accessible to the citizens that we are supposed to be serving?  Those are my concerns.  When the contract was being renewed in 2021, I was not aware of it at the time and it probably slipped under the radar for many people because of what was going on at the time, but An Post again sought the tender.  An Post has several hundred offices throughout the country, with 950 post offices.  I accept that it might not be able to provide a driver licence renewal service in all of them, but I expect it could provide the service in many of them.  Yet it was passed over again in favour of this Swiss logistics company which has 34 offices.  We are talking about saving An Post and about moving as many services as possible into An Post.  We criticise the banks for taking services away from our main streets and the difficulties that entails for sections of our population who may not be good with computers or who live in an area where there is not a good broadband service or who simply want to have a service provided face-to-face and yet, we seem to be doing exactly the same thing. </p><p>The last issue I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention is one that I brought up before, which is that SGS is now refusing to accept cash, at least in Ennis and I do not know if this is nationwide.  Again, is there any lawful basis for that?  I can accept it, if it was a temporary measure during Covid-19 not to accept cash, but why on earth can it not accept cash now?  What is the problem?  It has a limited number of offices, it can lodge the cash at the end of the day.  The office in Ennis is in a shopping centre.  We are not talking about huge amounts of cash whereby the office would become a target.  We are seeing a complete downgrading of the service and it concerns me.</p> <p>Another thing that irks me about driving licences is the countries from which one can have their driving licence recognised.  It is countries that one might expect: Australia, Isle of Man, Jersey, South Africa, New Zealand, the UK and Northern Ireland, of course, as well as some provinces of Canada, leaving out Quebec, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  </p> <p> What concerns me slightly more is the 50 states of the United States.  We have much interaction with the United States.  We have many people moving over and back.  It is not in the motion and I accept that, but can the Minister of State explain the rationale in her summing up as to why we do not recognise driving licences from the United States?  The UK recognises driving licences from some countries but not from others and if it does not recognise the licence, then a person has to do the practical and theory tests before getting a licence.  That is all quite rational.  However, in respect of the countries from where Ireland does not recognise driving licences, on top of that, even if you have been driving ten or 20 years in another country and you come to Ireland, you also have to do all the lessons.  That is a racket.  People who have been driving for 20 years and had a licence in another country should be able to sit the test and then they will either pass or fail the test.  The idea that they would have to do all of the lessons, even if they had been driving for most of their adult lives in another jurisdiction, makes very little sense.  I would like to know what the rationale to that is. </p> <p> I urge the Minister to accept this motion because of the diminution of services in the driving licences renewal area.</p></speech>

While Covid-19 has brought many problems for people, it seems to be a cover for many things at present in taking services away.  We see things changing in agriculture day in, day out.  Some changes are for the better and I will never be against prosperity or moving things on.  However, we also have to remember in this country that there is a generation of people who gave to this country but never had the opportunities that every one of us have had, such as being able to work a computer, being able to go online and being able to bank online or fill out forms.  We seem to have become a generation that wants to nearly cast those people aside.  I think a nation is viewed by how it looks after its elders.  We seem to have this thing in our head of basically leaving them with difficulty, to say the least, in trying to access services.  As Deputy McNamara pointed out, one could spend 90 minutes on a phone call.  Does an 85-year-old deserve that?  Even for Deputies, who to be frank should have a direct line such as we have in some services, in fairness it is pretty good but it takes 45 or 50 minutes to get through.  Then someone will come on and say about 40 times that you can do it online.  In the first instance, you might not have the broadband for it.  That is the biggest problem for many people in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Sometimes we think we are doing good.  The councils were looking after licences at one time and then we decided to set up a new system.  If we are going to protect or help the post office network in this country, I have always said that doing many little things will make it sustainable and make it work.  However, we decided, of course, that, because of EU rules and procurement, a foreign company would get the tender.  Sometimes we do things and we think are going forward, but in actual fact we are going backwards.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to listen to the Deputy.  I hope that she will not table an amendment and call a division on it.  This needs to be revisited.  This needs to be made accommodating for people, especially those in the rural areas, those who do not have the broadband and those who will not be hanging on the end of a phone for 90 minutes.  This is a solution that needs to be put in place.  However, a better solution down the road would be the likes of the post office network doing this, where there is one 5 km or 10 km away from people and where someone might talk to them, because not having that in-person interaction is the worst part in much of this.  A person's problem could be worked out if someone actually talked to him or her and if he or she saw someone, not a screen.</p>  <p>  Also, it appears as though this card, which started off in social protection, is being pushed despite the legal question.  I urge the Minister of State to produce the document that was given to the Government on the legal standing of this card because sooner or later, if the Government does not make the move, someone in this country will push the button and go to the courts.  If legal advice to a Government is to not use this card other than in respect of social protection, then it should be adhered to, at the very least.  I envisage that if the Government keeps trying to drive this the way it is at present, someone in this country will be obligated to basically prove that it cannot do what it is trying to do. </p>  <p>  On the whole licence issue, I have talked to people who, thankfully, have come back from Australia and different countries from where you do not have problems getting a driving licence here.  As Deputy McNamara pointed out, a person has to go around the rigamarole for I do not know how long trying to get licences sorted.  We should nearly have a one-stop shop and it would be a good idea for the likes of the post offices.  Imagine that there are now companies setting up in Ireland that try to get people coming back to this country set up here.  The person who is coming back to work in Ireland is actually paying people basically to get his or her life in line for licences, a bank account &ndash; another thing for which you now could be waiting for three months &ndash; and all the simple things that are necessary to make sure that you can live a normal life and fit into a community.  We are crying out for people at the moment in different sectors, yet we are putting every block we can in their way.</p>  <p>  Another thing on licences is that in 1992, much of the paperwork was basically eliminated.  Then, a few years later, we decided to bring in a requirement whereby a person needs a trailer licence.  At that time, there was no paperwork to show what one had.  This trailer licence has caused huge problems, especially in the farming community, and a resolution should have been brought to the issue.  </p>  <p>  There is another thing I urge the Minister of State to do.  Day in, day out I meet, elderly people in particular who got their provisional licence years ago.  They never bought a car and had a tractor and were tipping around with the tractor on the rural roads.  We have gone to being a society now where we look at someone and say, "That is illegal."  These people at one time were used to going into the back of a van but as time progressed, we got offices in which to do the theory test.  We have pushed a certain amount and we all see it as public representatives, day in and day out.  Some elderly farmer that might have had a provisional licence years ago does not have a licence now and is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.  Many of them never had the privilege of getting secondary education or college education, through no fault of their own.  They have lived the best education of all, which is a thing called life.  However, they are being pushed out and left, and they cannot even feed a few cattle with their own bale because they have no licence.  I have urged for change before, and I am just blue in the face from talking about it.  We talk about road safety and all the great things we are doing.  As I have said, why do we not get a place such as Mondello Park?  Why do we not get a place in the west of Ireland or four places in Ireland?  There will not be an enormous number of them.  Rather than putting people with a difficulty through this paperwork, they could go around some place that has all the signs up and do it in a simple way.</p> <p>If it is done in a simple way then people who might have learning or other difficulties can be brought inside the law.  We have to stop pushing people outside the law.  We have to show a bit of heart and find ways to solve things.</p> <p> The way things have gone in this country now, you look at a screen, answer 35 out of 40 questions or else they are a failure.  That is it.  Everything now is about referring to a computer or to this, that and the other.  If we keep going down that road, we will push more and more people out.  I see it, day in and day out.  Through no fault of their own, there is a lot of these people around the country but the people who are supposed to be promoting road safety do not appear to want to listen.  They are not interested in putting a simple thing in place in areas that are safe.  I have suggested Mondello Park as one example but there are three or four places around the country where this could be done, rather than telling people to go into an office and press a button on 40 questions which some of them might have difficulty in reading.  They are told that they can get a reader but it is just not as simple as that.  These people would be the finest in the world at driving.  They are driving all their lives but now they are outside the system.</p> <p> I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion.  I also ask her to make a statement on the card and confirm that it is going to be scrapped for once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200010#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputies concerned for tabling this motion on the national driver licence service, NDLS.  The Government will not be opposing the motion.</p>  <p>  At the outset I would like to clarify that the NDLS front offices across the nation are open to the public.  The only change since the new contract came into effect in June 2021 is that there is no longer an option to attend at an office without a prior appointment.  Appointments can be may online or by telephone.  A public services card, PSC, is not required to book an appointment.</p>  <p>  The NDLS, which processes applications for and issues driving licences and learner permits, is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The service is provided to the RSA under contract.  The NDLS front office service commenced in 2013 as a non-appointment service.  An appointment service was subsequently provided to manage queues.  Under this, people with an appointment had preference and attendance without an appointment was facilitated if time permitted.</p>  <p>  The contracted service in place since 2013 ended in 2021 and a replacement NDLS front office service contract was procured.  The procurement process for the new contract began in January 2020.  It was not intended that the new contract, which took effect in June 2021, would offer a non-appointment option.  This decision was made based on experience with the previous contract that managing a non-appointment element was difficult.  RSA market analysis, ahead of procurement of the current service contract, showed that more bids and better value for money would be attainable for an appointment-only service.  Such a service gives certainty to customers and prevents overcrowding, queueing and long waits.  The non­appointment service had generated complaints from members of the public due to waiting times and delays.  It also allows the provider to manage resourcing of the service because demand is predictable rather than having peaks and troughs during the day.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the procurement process did not prohibit tenderers from offering a non­appointment service.  Four bids were received, each of a high standard.  Following assessment under the published assessment criteria, the tender was awarded to the incumbent, SGS Ireland Limited, a Swiss company that has been active in Ireland for over 40 years, operates over 34 offices nationwide, and provides extensive services across a range of sectors.  The contract has a term of two operational years from June 2021 to June 2023, with possible extensions to June 2025.  An Post tendered for the contract but was unsuccessful.  The procurement process and contract were totally compliant with EU and national law.</p>  <p>  The requirements for the new contract differ from the predecessor as demand for the front office service is declining with the growth in the NDLS online service.  The ability of companies to manage and adapt staffing requirements was an important element of the current contract.  The decision to move to an appointment-only service was supported by the online licence renewal and application service, which accounts for over 40% of total applications, and the option for older customers to apply by post.  The change was communicated to the public on the NDLS website and in renewal reminder notices.  The existing service had moved to an appointment-only system from June 2020 because of Covid-19 restrictions before the new service began in June 2021.  Therefore, an appointment-only service was in place one year before the new NDLS front office contract commenced.  The current contract has virtually the same capacity and opening hours as the previous contract.  It was expected that the NDLS front office capacity would be reducing in the lifetime of the new contract as the take up of the online service increases.  In practice, the centres are now catering for more applications than originally forecasted for this time due to the effect of the licence and learner permit extensions.  The effects of the extensions will apply until September of this year.</p>  <p>  The same network of 34 permanent offices has been retained from the old to the new contract.  The only reductions are two satellite centres which were open one day per week in Belmullet and Clifden.  Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between both of these centres.  These have not been retained due to the provision of an online service.  Any significant change to the current contract would involve a contractual change and have commercial implications for the service.  It is the RSA's opinion that the introduction of a non-appointment service would in fact diminish the quality of the service to the public.</p>  <p>  An applicant is required to present photographic ID and evidence of Personal Public Service, PPS, number, address and residency entitlement when applying for a licence.  Applications may be made in person at a NDLS office, where the required documents are examined and a face-to-face verification is made.  A PSC is not required for an NDLS application made in an NDLS office.  It may be used to establish identity but it is not mandatory and an applicant may use one of several options.  For online applications, the same information is required but verifying a person's identity is more difficult online.  A MyGovlD account, which requires a PSC, satisfies this requirement.  Legal proceedings, in which the Department of Social Protection appealed an enforcement notice from the Data Protection Commission, DPC, on processing of personal data for PSCs, were resolved in December 2021.  The agreement reached acknowledged that other public bodies listed in social welfare legislation, that is "specified bodies", may use the PSC as a means of verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity.  The agreement also acknowledges and accepts that the Department of Social Protection and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovlD as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service channel is made available.  The Road Safety Authority is a specified body for the use of a PSC under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009.  Applicants who do not have a PSC may apply for or renew a licence in person at an NDLS office.</p>  <p>  Payment at the NDLS offices can be made by credit card, debit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay or Payzone vouchers.  Payzone vouchers can be purchased from retailers in towns and villages nationwide.  Card payment is significantly the most predominant means of payment.  The NDLS allows an accompanying person make card payments for customers who do not have cards themselves.  The decision was made not to accept cash after a market sounding exercise where only one potential bidder advocated accepting cash payments.  The decision was made after evaluating security, administration and value for money factors.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, appointments to attend at a NDLS front office can be made by telephone as well as online.  Currently, 29,000 appointment slots are free out of 77,000 slots available for booking across a six week period.  There is currently a high renewal demand for driving licences and learner permits due to the extensions put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic coming to an end.  The RSA acknowledges the service provided to customers in the phone booking service in this period has been less than adequate.  I have heard the concerns of Deputies in that regard today.  At a minimum, three full­time agents are necessary to provide the required level of service on the booking line.  The service provider is working to ensure that these resources are available daily and are committing extra personnel to training to ensure that the three full-time staff members are assisted and supported through busy periods.  The RSA has been assured that once training is completed this week, the service to the public will be greatly improved.  It should be noted that where people are late for an appointment, they cannot always be accommodated.</p> <p>Where possible, however, every effort is made to accommodate them.</p> <p> No permanent NDLS offices have been closed.  The services provided in Belmullet and Clifden were temporary and were set up to operated in hotels in those towns one day a week.  Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between the two.  The feedback from the market analysis conducted was that these two centres were not required in order to provide a strong service to the public.  The provision of these temporary services was not included within the successful SGS proposal in response to the tender process.</p> <p> Some NDLS front offices have had to close on some days or to offer a reduced service in the past few months because of absences due to Covid-19 pressures.  The RSA is working to restore the service, with all centres open for the full contracted hours as soon as possible.</p></speech>

At face value, that may appear to be true but we must realise that these are just two examples of a steady creep of the incessant rolling back of public service provision brought in by successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fail Governments.  Moreover, we need to recognise that these are symptoms of a disease, not the disease itself.  The symptoms are the obliteration of State-provided universal public service and its direct replacement with for-profit privatisation where buzzwords such as &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;streamlining&quot; serve only to mask the reduction of services or the removal of universal service obligation as a core tenet.</p><p>Any doctor knows full well that treating the symptoms only goes so far and that the disease must be cured.  The identification of the disease is not difficult.  It is unfettered capitalism.  It is the kind espoused and perfected in America by zealots such as Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago.  Actions such as using the cover of the pandemic to remove the walk-in service at the likes of the NLDS are well-documented moves straight from Friedman playbook.  Naomi Klein, in the opening pages of her seminal work, <i>The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism </i>describes this well, saying of Friedman, &quot;[In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina] One of those who saw opportunity in the floodwaters of New Orleans was Milton Friedman, grand guru of the movement for unfettered capitalism&quot;.  He proposed the privatisation of the school system, and backed by the Bush administration, Klein describes what happened next:</p> <blockquote> 	In sharp contrast to the glacial pace with which levees were repaired and the electricity grid brought back online, the auctioning off of the New Orleans' school system took place with military speed and precision.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Before Hurricane Katrina, the school board had run 123 public schools; now it ran just 4. </blockquote>  <p>This perverse ideology was championed by Friedman and then found its natural home within the regimes of Reagan and Thatcher, but driven by a vast cohort of lobbyists and their money.</p><p>Where did the ideology in question take hold in this country?  We must look back to the first act of a Romeo and Juliet-type story that continues to play out before us in this Chamber today.  I refer to the unfinished saga of the merging of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, and the unfortunate genes that appear to have become dominant in the offspring.  It begins with the convergence of right-wing elements of both parties into the Progressive Democrats in the mid-1980s.  What we saw emerge was a small cabal that exerted an undue influence over Irish economic policy that was far beyond their representation in the D&aacute;il or the appeal of those policies to the people.  However, propped up by their wilful enablers in Fianna Fail, they did damage that has continued to the present day, with the contagion now having spread and taken control within Fine Gael.  Sadly, when I look across the floor, I see only a small group of fundamentalists but they are in control of strategic Ministries of Government despite not leading it at present.  This gang of four or five in Fine Gael appear destined to continue leading the party into the future according to media speculation, as the rest play bit-part roles as mere cheerleaders who attend openings, make local announcements and cut and paste their names into head office press releases for the local media.  They are the golden scissors brigade.</p><p>I am not sure whether this is due to the apathy or ineptitude of those on the Opposition benches who appear to function almost exclusively on the basis of a mentality of &ldquo;I'm just happy to be here&rdquo; .  I am sure of one thing, however.  The days when backbench Deputies could vote in here to privatise public services or dubiously auction State assets, such as mobile phone licences, or close post offices and Garda stations and then scurry back to their constituencies and claim to be against the very same decisions, are coming to an end.  You are being caught out and called out.  The people are better informed and see through this.  It is the death by a 1,000 cuts nature of the privatisation of services and the inevitable reduction of that service that follows which most gets to people.  It is also the nature of who ends up worse off.  It is easy for ourselves in here or younger citizens to navigate new online systems so the burden falls on the older generations or those without broadband, who tend to live in rural areas, or those who simply cannot afford a broadband service.  These are the people targeted by such moves.  They are the very people that this Government is willing to discard and sweep aside in pursuit of its privatisation agenda, which is often miscategorised as being in the name of progress.</p><p>This is why the motion to restore the NLDS walk-in service is important.  It is important to my constituents in Donegal because most of us will wait until 2025 for the Government to roll out broadband to us.  It is important for my constituents in Donegal because we have a higher proportion of older people than is the case nationally.  It is important to my constituents in Donegal because we have lower disposable incomes and higher deprivation rates than most of the country.  These issues are common to most of us who live in rural constituencies right across the western seaboard.  It is vitally important that these services remain in public ownership and remain available to the public as walk-in services, which is the least that we can expect the Government to provide to citizens.</p></speech>

The motion reads, "the current National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) contract, which was put in place in 2021 while the attention of the body politic was diverted by the Covid-19 pandemic, no longer offers a walk-in service, the walk-in service having originally ceased temporarily in March 2020 to ensure the safety of the service's staff and of the public using the service during the Covid-19 pandemic".  That is an important point because I do not think that there was a need to divert completely from the walk-in service after that temporary situation of a walk-in service.</p>  <p>  The motion continues, "the Road Safety Authority (RSA) awarded the contract to the Swiss company SGS, which operates 34 offices, some of them on a part-time basis, over An Post which has a network of 950 post offices".  If the RSA was concerned about long queues and waiting times for people applying for the national driver licence then I would have thought that access to 950 post offices would be a more accessible way for people to get their driving licences.</p>  <p>  As has been said by my colleague, the outsourcing of public services for profit is in the DNA of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  The same policy has been adopted by the Department of Social Protection, with the local employment service, LES, throughout the country and new contracts.  I have read a paper on the matter, and it is very clear that private companies are literally licking their lips with the opening of the welfare market.  Can one imagine?  Public services being declared a welfare market and private companies are waiting to pounce on them.</p>  <p>  The motion continues also states, "a verified MyGovlD account, which requires a Public Services Card (PSC), is needed to avail of the online service despite a previous Data Protection Commission investigation into the legality of the PSC", which the Minister of State referred to in her response.  Can passports or other forms of ID be used to avail of the online service?  Not many people would oppose an online service once it is easy to use, accessible and there is an alternative walk-in service in terms of getting one's ID.</p>  <p>  The motion states that cash payments are not accepted.  That is ridiculous.  My next door neighbour does not have a bank card.  She uses cash all of the time and she has a car and drives.  Loads of people still make cash payments yet we have a move towards the whole of concept of card payments only because that suits the banks and the State.</p>  <p>  There is mention in the motion of insufficient staffing.  The Minister of State indicated that there will be more training.  I would have thought that staff to service the NDLS would have featured in the initial tender.  I see that the contract will last up to 2023.  I demand that the Minister put the contract for NDLS back out to tender in order that there will be greater facilitation of direct access, walk-ins, cash payments, etc.</p> <p>I am sure the tendering process always depends on what is sought and the requirements put into the tender.  I call on the Minister of State to consider changing that tender process and to allow people to access it more directly.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion, which raises some very important issues, particularly as they relate to inclusivity, State procurement and State priorities.</p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, in a response to a parliamentary question I tabled, and again today, the Minister has confirmed that the current NDLS contract, which was put in place with the front-office service provider in June 2021, no longer offers a walk-in service.  Appointments must be booked to attend an NDLS centre and are made available through the online booking system or by telephone.  The fact is that the current system is failing people.  I will share with the House the experience of one constituent of mine who went to his local NDLS centre on 8 February.  He arrived for an appointment only to realise that he had not received an email - he does not have email - or a text confirmation so had no appointment.  The centre was empty, however, so he immediately rang 0818 919 090.  He received no response.  He dialled 1 - no response.  He dialled 9 - no response.  The official behind the desk told him he was wasting his time.  He went home.  He tried to reach the service on that number for 20 minutes on each of the next four days.  He received no response.  On day five he waited 101 minutes before his call was answered.</p>  <p>  To add insult to injury, this service has been outsourced to a private company with a limited footprint, 34 offices, at a time when this Government and that which preceded it have known full well that An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union are crying out for this type of contract to ensure their future viability.  If they were before us today, they would say that they want more Government services and footfall, particularly any work that requires ID verification.  They already do that work for the Department of Social Protection.  In hundreds of post offices they already have ID verification equipment and systems and, at the drop of a hat, they could have such equipment in every single office if that was what was required.</p>  <p>  The truth, however, is that the post office network is hanging in the balance, and successive Governments have continued to turn their backs on the network.  This is despite the fact that the 2016 Kerr report on the future of the post office network, on page 41, highlighted specifically that the provision of driver licences should be considered as part of an increase in the range of Government services available through the post office network.</p>  <p>  In March of last year, the Government set up an offline services group to identify suitable services based on the recommendations of the offline services report and to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to post offices.  We were told that this group, in conducting its work, was considering the increased use of the post office network for the delivery of Government services.  On 7 July of last year, during a D&aacute;il debate on the post office network, the Minister of State said: "The Government's objectives for An Post include harnessing the opportunities presented by e-commerce and the digital economy, capturing and retaining market share in parcels and delivering a sustainable nationwide post office network offering a range of e-commerce, financial and Government services."  I stress the phrase "and Government services".  What has come of all that?  What Government services have been or will be transferred to An Post since these groups and objectives were identified?  What has come of the Government's explorations and examinations?  Following report after report, nothing has come of this from the perspective of An Post.  There are comforting words from the Government but, when it comes to it, when there are clear options on the table, An Post loses out.  There might be some small defence if the Government said it was delivering a better service at a cheaper rate, but the exact opposite is true in the case of the driver licence service.</p>  <p>  To add further insult to further injury, as for the online service, the Government looks set to throw good money after bad in defence of the PSC.  That is what I expect the Government will do, as other Deputies have said, if it does not remove the PSC requirement.  To be clear, the objective is to drive people online, and it is 100% mandatory to have a PSC to avail of services online.  That is belligerence.  The Government needs to act on this and remove that element.</p></speech>

The outsourcing of the issuing and renewal of driver licences has been a farce from the start.  Hardly a week goes by without some form of complaint made to my office about the standard of the quality of the service provided by the NDLS.  This has nothing to do with the staff members; it is a matter of understaffing, under-resourcing and pointless procedures.  The Minister of State will be aware of the issues; they have already been outlined to her.  All are by-products of outsourcing, and anyone watching this debate will be able to see that.  Among the complaints are staff shortages, a lack of timely service, limited opening hours for centres and the need for a public services card to avail of the online service.  Is it mandatory but not compulsory?  Is it compulsory but not mandatory?  Who knows?  Other complaints are the non-acceptance of cash payments when, as has been outlined, there are still people who use cash only as well as the recent cessation of the walk-in service.  The vast majority of these issues have at their root the outsourcing of the service, which has caused it to be run on a shoestring budget to ensure that the operating company can make as much profit as possible.  As is ever the case, it is the public, in particular older people, who will suffer because of this.  Receiving or renewing one's driver licence should be straightforward, simple and stress-free.  Instead it has become complicated and very stressful for people.</p>  <p>  It has also become very complicated for professional drivers such as HGV drivers who wish to exchange a foreign driving licence for an Irish one.  I have been told that some drivers who are qualified to work here are left in limbo for up the three months due to delays in issuing PPS numbers in the first instance and then delays in NDLS appointments, which compounds the issue.  While the operating company of the NDLS may point to issues due to Covid, the reality is that the delays and difficulties existed pre Covid, as the Minister of State will be aware.</p>  <p>  There must be a way to resolve these difficulties.  The NDLS operates 34 offices, some of them only part-time.  By comparison, An Post has a network of over 950 post offices with decades of experience in dealing with customers and delivering Government services.  There is no NDLS office in my constituency, but we do have plenty of post offices.</p></speech>

Not a week goes by without at least one person in my offices, be that in Mullingar, Longford or Athlone, at their wits' end over broadband not being able to access a decent connection.  Yet again we see this drive, if the Acting Chairman will pardon the pun, towards being able to access services only online and this smoke-and-mirrors attitude to there being an in-person option when we know that, in reality, that does not exist.  This disenfranchises and angers people because they feel victimised because of where they live.  More concerningly, a point that has not been made is that it also makes this very difficult for people who struggle with literacy.  This is a reflection of the for-profit model of outsourcing.  The Government may wish to do away with walk-in services, and that may be applicable and acceptable in some areas, but the public purse pays for this service and, as such, it should suit the entirety of the public.</p>  <p>  To echo what my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has said, this is a real missed opportunity for the An Post network.  We see this consistently throughout the NDLS.  People are notifiable only by text or email.  At present there are no weekend appointments in Mullingar or Athlone until 2 April.  Longford fares a little better but not by much.  Responses I received to parliamentary questions last week state that the driver test list in Longford now numbers 944.  In Westmeath, the corresponding figure is 2,689.  The Government appears to have conveniently forgotten the debacle surrounding the public services card.  The public have not, nor have they forgotten the statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the time that it was not a mess despite costing &euro;60 million.  Obviously, the definition of a mess does not include costing a small fortune.  At local level, the quality of political gymnastics by Government representatives is now truly an act to behold as they try to distance themselves from this Government decision.  If this were an Olympic event, the Minister of State's Government colleagues would take gold.</p></speech>

This makes it very difficult for people in Connemara to renew their driving licences.  Many of our constituents have been badly affected by this.  I raised the matter in June 2021 and was told by the RSA that everyone can now renew their driving licence using the online system.  That is not always the case, however.  In order to avail of the online system, a PSC is required.  Not everyone has that, nor is it a requirement to have one.  Moreover, a PSC cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  It is ridiculous that those in Connemara who are looking to get to an NDLS centre have to travel over an hour to Ballybrit to renew their driving licence.  It is a major inconvenience.  Although it was a part-time operation, the centre in Clifden was of massive benefit.  It made it easier.  We all know these administrative things can take a lot of time out of the day anyway.  For those who are living in more rural, isolated areas it is essential to have a centre like the one in Clifden to make it easier for them to renew their licence rather than having to travel into the city.</p></speech>

It is nice to have a commonsense approach.  It is the Irish way here to try to fix something that is not broken.  It beggars belief that we could have a private company doing this because 99% of the time privatisation equals profit; it is not about providing proper service.  As previous speakers have mentioned, there are 950 post offices in the country.  It beggars belief that we are in here talking about this and trying to reverse something that could possibly have grown better.</p>  <p>  The PSC was also mentioned.  In the last D&aacute;il term I had a good few arguments with the then Minister, Senator Regina Doherty on this.  I could see it was going to cause problems.  I cannot figure out why they cannot simplify it.  We all have a PPS number that is registered to the database.  That should be good enough.  We are having similar issues with medical cards at the moment but that is a different situation.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the motion's common-sense approach to going back to the way we used to do it, which worked.  People forget that those with disabilities struggle even more to access these services.  One-to-one interaction makes a difference as does walking in to a service where we can actually deal with a real human being.  Other speakers have also said that this is public money.  It beggars belief how we can privatise a system.  It seems to be just systemic for successive Governments to take everything away, privatise it and come back in a few years scratching their heads and wondering why it has gone so wrong.  We should be investing in our own people and our own services.</p>  <p>  It is madness that the centres cannot take cash.  They are making it so difficult for people.  Others mentioned online services.  How many debates have we had here about broadband?  Some people are not computer literate.  Someone might have the old provisional licence, might have been working on a farm the past 40 years and might never have turned on a computer.  How are they going to manage?  It is ludicrous that we have private companies running this when we have a national post office network that is crying out for public services and that should be supported.</p></speech>

It is a really important service.  Various issues with the issuing and renewing of permits and driving licences have had a severe impact on the lives of workers and their families over the past two years.  We heard from numerous front-line workers about the difficulties they faced in renewing their driving licences and the impact on their work.  It is disappointing that the NDLS no longer offers a walk-in service and that it refuses to accept cash payments.  On the PSC, it sounds in theory like people will not need one but in practice they do need it.  This is in spite of a previous investigation by the Data Protection Commission which found there is no lawful basis for this requirement.  The whole process is a prime example of the downgrading of public services due to Government services being privatised.</p>  <p>  An Post operates a network of some 950 post offices around the State.  It is a devastating indictment of the Government's view of An Post that it will not engage with or involve the postal service in this process.  The awarding of this contract to the Swiss company, SGS, reflects a missed opportunity to use the post office network and bring the NDLS into every community, ensuring ease of access to all.</p>  <p>  Removing the walk-in and cash services shows the level of disconnect between the Government and ordinary people.  There are many people who need that bit of extra assistance, including the elderly and those from minority backgrounds.  Many of those people might not have a PSC.  They may have literacy barriers.  Sinn F&eacute;in has previously called for the PSC to be scrapped following the report from the UN on the disproportionate impact it has on marginalised communities.  I welcome and support the motion because it highlights the serious issues currently with the NDLS.</p></speech>

It is a very appropriate time for it given the end of Covid restrictions which can no longer be used as an excuse for providing such a poor service to so many people.  Deputy O'Rourke's example has really shown how poor that service is.  Constituents are desperately getting in touch with all our offices to try to get a licence sorted out for work or some other important reason.</p>  <p>  We oppose the privatisation of public services.  This is clearly a service that has profit as its only goal.  Fine Gael, along with some in various Departments, is slowly but surely dismantling our public services.  "Commissioning" is a buzzword for the delivery of many health and social services.  What commissioning really means is the provision of private services.  Many are not-for-profit now but we know from the experience of local employment services that this can change very quickly.  If we are serious about the post office network, the provision of driving licences would help secure many post offices, particularly those in rural areas.  In a world where we are being told we have never been as connected, people engaging with people seems to be anathema to the bean counters and the profiteers.</p>  <p>  Many are deeply concerned at the creeping of the PSC into areas that make no sense whatsoever.  The Government should be honest with people and put it out there in its manifesto for a national identity card.  It should put the matter to the people and ask if they want to be forced to provide their private details to a private company.  I was doing a bit of research on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, previously stated that he believed the card was an attempt to introduce a national ID card and that the Department had offered pathetic excuses for the measure while trying to expand it dishonestly through the back door.  I hope he and his colleagues still stand by those words.</p></speech>

It is the second Wednesday morning Private Member's motion in a row which makes eminent sense and is speaking to a real need felt by thousands of people who have been going through heartache in renewing their driving licences.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has left and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has joined us.  The Government has said it is not opposing this motion.  What does that actually mean?  Will we see any changes called for in this motion, which has the support of this side of the House, implemented, specifically regarding the offices accepting cash, which they should, and the use of the PSC, which is not and should not be required in this situation?</p> <p> Since the pandemic, the new operation of the NDLS has resulted in a reduction in the level and quality of service received by users and the NDLS no longer provides users with a walk-in service.  We all accepted that certain services were going to be impacted by Covid and that it would take a while for certain services to return to a level of normality or catch up on backlogs.  Passports being one with which we have all dealt in the past number of months.  There has been a point of real crisis here but the passport service does seem to be getting back to some level of normality and turning things around in a relatively quick manner - touch wood.</p> <p> What is different about the NDLS is that it is not even trying to get back to normal.  It has used Covid as an opportunity to copper-fasten an entire change in how it operates.  This is not trying to get back to a face-to-face, proper public service.  As Deputy McNamara said, this is no longer a public service.  It is operated by a private operator, SGS, but it is not operated according to public need.  It is operated for profit and the public is having to jump through needless hoops, which is having a real impact not just on waiting lists and call-backs.  It is having an impact on people starting new jobs because they need driving licences and they cannot get them because they need a PSC, which is ridiculous, and cannot get appointments to obtain the latter.  We all deal with constituents.  I spent just under four weeks trying to get somebody over the line with the NDLS because of the PSC obstacle.</p> <p> It is fundamental.  People say "Don't bring ideology into this, don't bring ideology into that" but this is the outworking of a right-wing ideology played out in terms of a public service.  We talk about the time when people could go into their local authority and renew their licences.  Maybe that was not the best model but it was a model whereby people were face to face and knew where they could go, and it actually worked.  We have replaced something that worked with something that is not working.  It may be working for SGS and the Department as it does not have to actually manage the delivery of this and does not have any real responsibility for it - like everything.  I cannot wait for the reply we will get to a parliamentary question soon telling us that this is a service matter for SGS and that if it does not reply within ten days, to get back to the Minister because that is what we get with HSE inquiries and an awful lot of financial inquiries when they relate to banks - banks we own.  Regarding moving everything to phone services, look at what happened with the banks.  Look at what the Central Bank found regarding banking services.  It crucified all our banks for offering deplorable customer service over the phone.</p> <p> This is a quality-of-life issue for many people.  Regarding the days of having to do your household messages, going down to the village and nipping into the post office, the bank, shops or the building society, that actually worked for people all over the country.  Our 950-branch post office network is crying out for business, is trusted by the people and is skilled in the provision of public services and here we have instead part-time offices scattered all over the country in some population centres instead of in every community and not accepting cash and walk-in appointments.  It is turning into a pathetic service for something that is vital.  A driving licence is vital for work, caring, families and commuting.  It is a statutory document to which we are entitled  It is a rite of passage for many - driving lessons, getting a provisional licence and moving on to do a full test.  It is a rite of passage, a right and a need and the State is failing.  This is a succinct and to-the-point motion that speaks to a real deficiency in what the Government is doing in this area.  If the Government is not going to implement the asks in the motion, it may as well vote against it because otherwise when it does this as a Government, it is just being dishonest.  I commend the Independent group on this motion and look forward to the rest of the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="11:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200014#M00200"><p>I thank the Independent group for putting forward this motion.  We have been debating the use of the PSC in this House for years.  We have been arguing about when it can be used, how it can be used and what kind of data it can contain.  I again make the same point I have made repeatedly over the past number of years.  If the Government wants a national identification card, it should admit it, produce legislation, get legal advice, come into this Chamber and let us debate it, but it should not do it by stealth, which is exactly what is happening at the moment.  If anyone wants to access public services online, in so many cases, the PSC appears to be required.  Of course, this is not legal in most cases.</p>  <p>  Last December, the Data Protection Commissioner agreed that the PSC could be used as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services provided that an alternative service channel is available.  Of course that spirit of that ruling obviously means that service users should be given the freedom of choice and that in-person services should be freely available without the need for a PSC.  The Department of Transport's decision to close down walk-in services for the NDLS is completely against the spirit of that ruling.  Let us be honest: it was done in order to drive people to the online service by reducing the quality of in-person services and consequently nudging people into getting a PSC.  Then it is lauded and the Government says "Oh so many people have got it; it is really successful."  This is because people are given no choice.  The Government cannot keep throwing up obstacles and reducing the standard of in-person services while claiming that there are genuine alternatives to those provided online.</p>  <p>  When I checked the NDLS website yesterday, the next available appointment in Kildare outside of the nine-to five work day was 26 March.  A total of 222,000 people live in Kildare.  Its population surpassed that of Limerick city and county in the census before last so it is a very large county.  The NDLS centre is in an industrial estate in Naas and there is no public transport to it so it is not as if it is particularly convenient.  However, there is essentially a purpose in driving people to get access services online because it is made less accessible.  Consider first time drivers, who have to get a fully licensed driver to drive them to these centres because no public transport is available.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the future generations of drivers and public service users will be pushed towards the PSC with little alternative.  Not everyone has access to a computer or a bank account.  Currently, all driving licence services, either in-person or online, do not accept cash.  Bank accounts obviously are not available to everyone in society.  I refer primarily to those who do not have a fixed address.  Many people for reasons of their own do not have bank accounts.</p>  <p>  We have a habit sometimes of thinking that we are constantly playing catch-up with other countries when it comes to technology and rushing forward but in reality, anyone who visits other countries can see that we are often quite advanced when it comes to introducing technological advancements.  This is positive but it cannot be abused.</p>  <p>The reality of a society that has rapidly become more online is that people are being left behind.  They are the people who always get the short end of the stick, such as migrants, for example, and, in particular, older people, who are provided with driving licences of a shorter duration and need to renew them more often.  Welcome legislation was brought in by the Department of Transport recently to allow asylum seekers access to driving licences.  That move will provide an incredible amount of freedom and independence to people who we in this country have treated very poorly through the years.  The measure introduced was that temporary residency permits will be accepted as proof of normal residency.  Can asylum seekers access the online services or are they required to obtain in-person appointments?</p> <p> There was never any legal underpinning for the public services card, PSC.  It has been an absolute disaster in that respect from the onset.  There are serious concerns regarding how it has been imposed on citizens and the range of data embedded in the card.  The two successive Governments responsible simply have not been up front about any of it.  The previous Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Regina Doherty, insisted on multiple occasions that the Department did not hold biometric data, but it does.  The Department has since admitted it was using biometric data on the PSC to identify cases of welfare fraud.  There is a national database of facial recognition data and that database has no safeguards written in law.  There is no legislation and no clear legal basis for it.  Decisions of the Data Protection Commission on the PSC are still pending.  There is an investigation into the use of biometric data, as well as a mass complaint mandated to Digital Rights Ireland by hundreds of citizens about the illegality of the use of the card by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is genuinely incredible that the Government is still pushing forward with the PSC in the exact same manner it has always done despite seemingly falling at every single legal hurdle it encounters.</p> <p> When it comes to these databases, it is important for everyone to realise it is not just the Irish State that has access to them.  Under the Pr&uuml;m II law, the Council of the European Union is discussing plans to add driving licence data to an EU network of police facial recognition systems.  Will the Government be supporting this measure?  If it intends to do so, it is saying that a person who owns a car, needs to drive or has a driving licence must submit a photo and information that could be used for that kind of purpose.  People need to know that.</p> <p> We know very little about these systems.  We do not know what impact they will have on privacy and civil liberties.  We do not know how they address accuracy problems or how they will impact on ethnic minorities, for example.  This is the essence of turning citizens into customers.  We have been talking about this since 2011.  It is just another erosion of a public service and we really need to have an alternative.  We cannot allow the PSC to be used as an identity card by stealth.</p></speech>

The new contract is in place but the problem is that walk-in services are now not available.  I live in Galway East, a rural constituency.  Some of the people I represent do not have a smartphone or a credit card and may not have broadband, which is very relevant.  They may not have any of the tools they need to do their business online.  This is the kernel of the matter.  As we fast-track ourselves into the digital age, we are doing something very wrong: we are beginning to leave people behind.  It is a significant trauma in the lives of people who may not be computer literate to have to try to figure out a way through the morass of systems they have to use.  We have to recalibrate how we are actually preparing society for the digital age.  The digital age is taking over but it will not take over everybody if it is going to leave people behind.  We need to ensure services are available to people on a walk-in basis and that public services are available to people who wish to pay cash.  All of that needs to be recalibrated.  There is no point saying this is a workable and more efficient system and whatever else because that is not what people are finding.</p>  <p>  I have come across an issue that I am sure other rural Deputies have heard about.  To go to a GAA match, one now has to download one's ticket onto a smartphone.  There is no cash being taken at the gate and there is no way of scanning the ticket one has; one has to have it on one's phone.  There are many followers of Gaelic games.  It is time for the GAA to consider this and make sure these people are also facilitated.</p>  <p>  It is one thing for me to criticise what has been done, but the question is how we can rectify this and put systems in place that actually deal with people and provide them with a public service.  It has been stated previously that there are 940 post offices in the countrywide network.  The Government has not yet engaged to fully provide a system for the delivery of offline services.  An Post has the mechanism, wherewithal and network to do that but it is not being done for reasons I keep hearing about which relate to procurement and making sure everything is right.  It is time to recalibrate and decide to get things right for people rather than for systems, rules and regulations that are brought in but are unworkable.  I go back to the basic point that we need to ensure we are putting people first, not systems.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that any time I contacted the RSA in the past two years on any issue relating to driving licences, it was able to help me in a prompt fashion.  I want to put that on record.</p></speech>

It allows us to ask the Minister to account for what I believe is an underhand and discriminatory reduction in the services of the NDLS.  Decisions made in the context of Covid-19 were supposed to be temporary measures, supposedly made in the public interest to protect customers and staff in a variety of State bodies.  It is an abuse of the Covid-19 measures for the NDLS to fail to return to the level of service that existed prior to Covid.  It is also an underhand way of discriminating against those who find online literacy difficult.  Many of us can put our hand in our pocket, whip out a phone and do almost anything we want, but there are a significant number of people who are unable to perform these tasks.</p><p>To add insult to injury, in adopting its online-only policy for services, the NDLS is insisting that people use a public services card, as has been mentioned many times today.  There are three main problems with this.  First, a vast number of people do not have sufficient Internet service to operate any website.  Second, a large number of people do not have a public services card.  As for the third problem, I will quote directly from an agreement between the Department and the Data Protection Commission in respect of the use of public services cards other than by the Department of Social Protection.</p> <blockquote> 	The Agreement acknowledges that other public bodies listed in social welfare legislation (&ldquo;specified bodies&rdquo;) may use the PSC as a means of verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity.<br /><br />The Agreement also acknowledges and accepts that the Department and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovID as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service channel is made available. </blockquote> <p>It is very clear that requiring the use of the public services card or a MyGovID account clearly goes against this agreement and goes against the legal judgment made in 2019.  Despite this, if I go to the NDLS website to apply online for a licence, the only option outlined involves the use of a public services card.  To quote directly from the NDLS website:</p><blockquote>	Applying online is a simple, straightforward process, no need to book an appointment or attend an NDLS centre.  Save time and do it the smart way.  Apply Online today.<br /><br />All you need is your Public Services Card and your verified MyGovID for safe, secure access to your online application.<br /><br />Already have a verified MyGovID account?  Apply Now<br /><br />If you haven&rsquo;t got a verified MyGovID account but have a Public Services Card?  You&rsquo;re almost there.  You can set up your verified MyGovID account using your public services card at <i>www.mygovid.ie</i>.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t yet have a Public Services Card?  You can book a Public Service Card (PSC) appointment by phoning your local Intreo office.  Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 pandemic online PSC appointments are not available at <i>www.mywelfare.ie</i>. </blockquote> <p>There is no alternative option mentioned and it seems that Covid is still being used as an excuse for online PSC appointments not being available, which makes very little sense with regard to the conversation we are having today.  The whole situation is a mess.  It has been badly handled and badly communicated and bad decisions have been made.<br/><br/>Many citizens do not have debit cards.  This is just another impediment the Department is responsible for.  With this in mind, I hope the Minister of State will outline for us today the answer to the following questions.  Who was responsible for making this decision to curtail in-person services?  Who was consulted before the decision was made?  What assessments were made about the impact of this decision on those with poor digital literacy or poor access to the necessary equipment or Internet services?  Why have the NDLS and the Department of Transport broken the agreement with the Data Protection Commission by requiring the use of a public services card?<br/><br/>I concur with all of the speakers and I want to point out that when it comes to the NDLS engaging with the RSA on identifying compatible licences of foreign nationals it is a very slow process.  Many people who come here with work permits spend as long as six to nine months trying to get their licence verified so they may undertake the work they are here on a permit to take up.  This is something that has to be addressed.  It may not be the Department of the Minister of State but it certainly involves both agencies mentioned, namely, the NDLS and the RSA.  It is an impediment to how we get on and progress as a country.</p></speech>

The Government and agencies with which people must interact are going out of their way to make life more difficult than it needs to be.  There seems to be no sense of pragmatism or common sense at times.  Where is the common sense in the NDLS?  Ever since it was rolled out in 2013 it has been beset with difficulties.  The new requirement for a public services card before being able to access the NDLS is ridiculous.  It needs to be looked at urgently.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, the Data Protection Commission ruled after a two year investigation that the card is illegal in terms of being required to access public services other than those of the Department of Social Protection.  The Data Protection Commission has also ruled the State must destroy the 3.2 million personal records held on cardholders.  Yet here we are with the NDLS overruling the Data Protection Commission.  What is really going on?  In this respect the NDLS has acted without any apparent regard for the difficulties its decisions will create for thousands of motorists and those wishing to access an updated licence.</p>  <p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the call in the motion to set up an open competitive tendering process in accordance with national and European Union procurement rules to provide a walk-in service at multiple centres throughout the State.  I also agree the NDLS must allow cash payments to be accepted.  It is absurd this is not the case already.</p>  <p>  The motion refers to insufficient staffing that has led to further problems.  This needs to be looked at.  It is not good enough that people are trying to get through by telephone.  It is just not happening and there are serious delays.  This is an issue many of my constituents have raised with me.  I would appreciate if these concerns can be addressed.</p></speech>

The fact that local NDLS centres are not accessible to many people who need to get a licence if they do not have a public services card is nothing short of our joke.  Many Deputies have said the same thing.  If it was not broken, why fix it?  The Government has a habit of doing such things.  It tampers with something that is good and that delivers and ends up making a mess of it.  It was the same with the reverse last night by the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party Government on early intervention units.  It had removed funding for the unit in Kilbrittain.  It reversed the decision last night after I had raised it three times in the D&aacute;il.  This is embarrassing.</p>  <p>  The same goes for people trying to obtain licences.  Many Deputies have rightly asked why post offices cannot be used for people to get their driving licences.  It is easy to know why.  The Government's agenda is to get rid of post offices by starving them of work and giving them no chance to keep their doors open.</p>  <p>  Vehicle licensing in this country needs a complete overhaul.  Look at people who come back to this country and have to sit a theory test and a driving test.  It is a farce beyond belief.  One man told me he could drive through New York one week but cannot drive through Goleen when he comes to Ireland the following week.</p>  <p>  The wait of months that many Irish drivers have had to endure over the past two years ahead of a driving test looks likely to continue for quite some time.  During the height of the pandemic driving lessons and testing services were put hold.  As a result, Ireland's driving licence backlog reached astronomical heights.  Although everything has been done to clear waiting lists it will be quite some time before normal timing resumes.  The RSA states that at this point, having hired testers and with restrictions easing, 60 centres throughout the country have reduced their waiting times down to the ten-week mark.  However, other centres still have a backlog of between 12 and 18 weeks.  This is not for the physical test alone.</p></speech>

It is a scandal to God that a walk-in service is no longer offered to renew licences in Tralee.  People must book an appointment online.  People who do not use the Internet have long waits to get through on the phone line to make an appointment.  This is something I have to say.  To get these people on the phone is absolutely impossible.  To those who have phones but will not answer them and will not ring back I say throw them away.  These people should be got rid of because they are useless.  If I do not answer my phone today or if I do not ring someone back I can expect I will not be in my place after the next election.  I will answer my phone and that is what people are supposed to do.</p>  <p>  It takes forever to get a theory test or a driving test.  The RSA will not answer.  Old people cannot go over to the office.  We are practically the smallest country in the world and we do not have a system whereby we can renew driving licences.  People need to have a public services card.  This was found to be illegal.  Why is the Government allowing this to continue?  Is it in power?</p>  <p>  Applying online is simply not an option for many people, particularly elderly people or those not used to the Internet.  There are no drivers for buses, lorries or any other work vehicles.  People cannot get licences to go on the road legally.  I ask the Government to do something before the country grinds completely to a halt.  It is not fair on workers.  It is not fair on ordinary people, old people or young people who cannot get a driving licence when they need it.</p></speech>

It is ridiculous to think that at the start of the pandemic there was a six-week waiting list.  During the worst of the pandemic it increased to six months.  Now we are back to approximately ten weeks.  This is a ridiculous length of time for people who desperately need to get their licence and to get on the road.  At present 104,398 learners are waiting to take the driving test.</p> <p>The system we had in the county I represent, County Kerry, was absolutely perfect.  You could visit the office, take a ticket and queue to be dealt with by a person.  It was a perfect system that we were very happy with.  You had to wait but you were quite willing and glad to do so because you knew you would be served.  The current system is unworkable, unfriendly and unfair to the person who is important, namely, the customer or person waiting for the service.</p> <p> Unfortunately, in all departments there seems to be a massive desire to disconnect from the people.  They do not want to engage on a telephone or the Internet; they do not want to engage at all.  They definitely do not want to meet a person face to face.  I have news: offices and businesses are open, and hiding behind the pandemic will not be accepted by the public anymore.  When people want a service, whether it concerns a driving licence, medical card or the processing of an application for a grant, they want to deal with staff on a personal basis.</p> <p> I thank the staff who work in the service in Kerry.  I am aware that they are working under pressure.  It is the system that is wrong, not the individuals.  I am not going to be critical of the individuals working in County Kerry because, regardless of whether they are in the housing or planning department of Kerry County Council or any other section, they are good.  So, too, are the others but we need a better service for our customers.</p></speech>

We are just dehumanising people.  That is what is going on under the Government.  I have been up here for 14 years now and note that is the case in respect of everything we have done.</p>  <p>  When the NDLS was first established, I could not believe that three private companies would have a part to play before a driver got a licence.  One of them could not get the materials to make the licences and there were delays as a consequence.  It is a shambles.</p>  <p>  I thank the county council staff who help people above and beyond the call of duty.  At the time when you could take a ticket and queue, at least you saw movement and people&rsquo;s smiling faces.  You did not have to ring up and get no answers.  The people in the offices are under pressure.</p>  <p>  We decommissioned the IRA.  We have the RSA and the NRA, which is now TII.  These are unelected, unaccountable quangos that the Government has set up.  They are like mushrooms, growing and expanding, and they have no respect for the public interest or this House.  All those concerned want is a big office with a brass plate on the door.  There are chief executives, chairmen and everything else, including a board, of course.  It is all a matter of jobs for the boys and saying to hell with daoine na t&iacute;re, especially the people of rural Ireland.  What if a person does not have broadband?  Many of us do not.  What if a person cannot use broadband?  People are dehumanised in these circumstances.  It is making life hell for them.</p>  <p>  I do not know how we get multinationals into this country because their staff, when they come here from all over the world, cannot drive here.  They have to do a theory test.  What an ungracious insult to people who can drive in Manhattan and all over the world.  I thank Geraldine in my office, who deals with this.  I thank the voluntary organisation in Clonmel that helps young people with learning difficulties to do the theory test.  All these tests did not exist when we were applying for licences; they are in place now.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  We are not praising the young; we are denying them.  We are killing our elderly population and allowing them to perish.</p>  <p>  Bus drivers cannot be got.  People over 70 are not allowed to drive school buses.  They can drive private buses to matches but cannot drive to school.  We are crying out for drivers.  Now we are told the unfortunate drivers coming here from the war will not be allowed to drive in Ireland.  They can drive in every other European country.  What is wrong with this little quango Republic?  It is shameful.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable that service provision is not up to standard.  I have been assured by the RSA that the additional training by the service provider, to be completed this week, will improve the service provided to the public.</p><p>During the tender process, it was not intended that the new contract would have a mandatory non-appointment option.  Experience has shown that managing a non-appointment service was difficult.  Each office was staffed to take a certain amount of activity but, where a non-appointment service was permitted, there were peaks and troughs during the day, with early mornings and lunchtimes putting the offices under pressure.  This generated complaints from members of the public due to the waiting times and delays.</p><p>The RSA was aware that over the lifetime of the contract, there would be a service with increasingly fewer customers because of the increased uptake of the online option.  To make an attractive offering to the market, it was important to pitch the service in a way that would attract several bidders and ensure value for money.  The ability of companies to manage and adapt staffing requirements was an important element of this.  Accessing the online service to apply for a driving licence or learner permit requires a verified <i>mygov.ie</i>account to validate identity.  This is consistent with Government policy.  A public services card is not mandatory.  It is not needed to book an appointment at an NDLS office.  Other documents, such as a passport, are accepted to verify identity in person.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement between the Department of Social Protection and the Data Protection Commission, it was acknowledged and accepted that the Department and other specified bodies, such as the RSA, could continue to use <i>mygov.ie</i>as a sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services provided that an alternative service channel was available.</p></speech>

For many people, including those with poor or no broadband, those who want to use cash and those who expect the State to provide a quality public service for the issuing of driving licenses, the service is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 saw the temporary cessation of walk-in services for driving licence applications.  Now most public offices have reopened and services are returning to normal as much as possible.  We are all learning to live with Covid.  Why is the NDLS not learning to live with it?  We cannot stand over the diminution of the service under the pretext that Covid is somehow responsible.</p>  <p>  What we are considering here is the wider issue of the privatisation of services, on foot of which the quality of service is not factored in and the lowest bidder that can provide the most basic service is the one that is chosen.  Time and again, I have heard about the EU public procurement directive.  Two things need to be said about it.  First, it gives member states the opportunity to include social clauses, but that is up to their governments.  Second, and most crucially, who in the Department or RSA is responsible for writing the tender specifications?  That is what matters.  That is why I expect that An Post was not awarded the tender.  I do not know the details but believe that if a requirement for a network of 75 officers were stipulated, perhaps with two per county and a few extra in the larger counties, An Post would then be in a much better position to tender for the contract.  That would have helped to sustain the network.</p>  <p>  I understand a procurement process must be open and fair, but it must be drafted to ensure a quality service.  When a local post office is closing, every Government Deputy and councillor goes to the public meeting calling for a reversal of the decision; yet, because the Government outsources the process to the RSA, which outsources it to a private company, the Government representatives and the rest of us are wasting our time.  The Government and RSA hide behind public procurement regulations.  If there were a proactive Government policy to ensure the sustainability of the An Post network, the tender documents would be written in a way that would ensure a quality walk-in service for Irish drivers.  Then, at least, An Post would be on a level playing field when applying.</p>  <p>  The Minister is not present, which I am sorry about, but I listened carefully to her when she spoke about the public services card.  She said a public services card is not necessary to make an appointment, and she is right.  Before I came into the Chamber, I looked at the NDLS website and checked out exactly what it states.</p> <p>It states:</p><blockquote>	Applying online is a simple, straightforward process...<br /><br />All you need is your Public Services Card and your verified MyGovID for safe, secure access to your online application.<br /><br />Already have a verified MyGovID account?  Apply Now.<br /><br />If you haven&rsquo;t got a verified MyGovID account but have a Public Services Card?  You&rsquo;re almost there.  You can set up your verified MyGovID account using your public services card at www.mygovid.ie. </blockquote> <p>Then comes the final kicker:</p><blockquote>	Don&rsquo;t yet have a Public Services Card?  You can book a Public Service Card (PSC) appointment by phoning your local Intreo office. </blockquote> <p>I wish the Minister were here because this is a three-card trick.  Who decided that a public services card was needed to apply online?  Was it the Swiss company providing the service?  Was it written into the tender documents?  Was it the RSA?  Was it the Government?  This is a simple question and I would appreciate an answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="11:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200018#Q00200"><p>I thank everyone who spoke on behalf of the motion.  I thank all my colleagues in the Independent Group and all the Opposition Members, including Deputy O'Rourke, for their support.  I also thank the Government for accepting the motion.  I note that no Government backbenchers are speaking in the debate, which I take to indicate that they also accept the necessity for the motion.  I want to be clear on what the motion calls for.  It calls for the Government to instruct the RSA to set up an open tendering process for a walk-in service.  The move to tender only for an appointment service was explained by the Minister of State in her statement.  She said:</p> <blockquote> 	The procurement process for the new contract began in January 2020.  It was not intended that the new contract, which took effect in June 2021, would offer a non-appointment option.  This decision was made based on experience with the previous contract that managing a non-appointment element was difficult. </blockquote>  <p>Therefore, a procurement process had begun and the goalposts shifted as a result of the consultation between the RSA, which was going to provide the contract, and a company which had previously provided it.  That sounds very strange to me, especially given that one of the companies seeking to obtain the tender, An Post, was in a position to provide a walk-in service throughout the State.  While it is no longer in every village, still every town in the country has a post office.  That is really strange chicanery to occur in the middle of a pandemic.  I am not saying that the tender is invalid or anything but it is a really unusual admission, almost as unusual as the admission the Minister made last Thursday week to me that this contract had been provided on a walk-in basis only.  That came as news to me and to most people in this House.</p><p>The motion also states that we should ensure that all NDLS offices accept cash payments.  That was repeatedly emphasised by my colleague Deputy Fitzmaurice.  During this, we were actually discussing whether it is legal to refuse cash.  I am afraid I do not know, but the Central Bank's website states it is legal tender.  Businesses such as shops and restaurants cannot refuse cash unless both they and the customer have already agreed on another way of paying.  People who walk into an NDLS office have not agreed on another way to pay.  A constituent of mine walked in to an NDLS office, did everything right, went to pay and was told it would not take cash.  He rang his wife who gave him details of a bank card.  He was told that because she was not there, it could not accept that either.  He then had to go and make another appointment through this farcical system of making appointments in order to get a driving licence.</p><p>It has been made inordinately difficult to get a driving licence.  Does the Government envisage the day when someone will be required to make an appointment online or by telephone in order to buy a stamp?  I fear that this is the thin end of the wedge.  Not much was wrong with the system whereby people went to the local authority office to renew a driving licence in the same way that they renewed their motor tax.  Of course, people can also renew motor tax online and many people do, which is a good thing.</p><p>However, someone renewing motor tax does not require a public services card.  I accept, as the Minister of State said, that the RSA is specified body for the use of a public services card under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  However, the RSA contracts out all its services.  Is the company that it contracts out to, which is effectively the company with which people are interacting online when renewing a driver licence, a specified body?  If it is not, the entirely unlawful use of State data is being facilitated by this regime.Deputy Harkin said that everything is now contracted out and an obvious question follows from that.</p><p>I welcome that the Government is accepting the motion, but I hope it will act on it.  Deputy Verona Murphy among others raised the delay in getting a foreign driving licence recognised with people waiting eight to nine months.  Of course, Ukraine is not a country whose driving licences we recognise.  I have no problem with people from Ukraine or any other country having to do a theory test and a practical test if they come from a country whose driving licence we do not recognise; we need to be sure that people can drive if they say they can drive.  However, not alone will they have to do that, but they will have to do all the driving lessons over 12 months and I certainly have a problem with that.</p><p>I have no doubt that Ukrainian refugees will arrive here and some of them will hold driving licences.  I have no doubt that the State does not recognise those driving licences.  I have no problem with any of that.  However, it will take them years to get a driving licence here and that will affect their employment prospects.  The same is true of people who come from any state of the United States of America, some provinces of Canada and many other states.  Nobody could possibly have a problem with requiring people to show they can drive and understand the rules of the road.  However, it is inexplicable that they are required to do all the driving lessons and tests that somebody who cannot drive must do.  I raised that point with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, at the start of this debate.  I recognise that it is not mentioned in the motion, but it needs to be addressed and I hope the Government will come back to us on that.</p><p>I greatly appreciate the support from all colleagues across the Opposition and the fact that the Government accepts the motion.  However, I question what accepting it actually means.  The motion requests that a new tender process be set up for a walk-in service, that cash be accepted in NDLS offices and that the requirement for online applicants to provide a public services card be discontinued in circumstances where that service is contracted out by the RSA.  People are not providing their public services card to the RSA, but are providing it to a private company that may not be covered by the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  I would welcome clarification on that point.</p></speech>

We have seen the bewildered faces of children and civilian populations fleeing for their safety and lives, spending night after night huddled in air raid shelters in scenes that we never dreamed we would live to witness on our Continent again.  Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine - those who have fled and those who have travelled to Ukraine, including from Ireland.  We have heard their harrowing testimonies.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le h&eacute;inne a bhfuil a meas aige n&oacute; aici ar an tsaoirse agus ar an bhf&eacute;inchinneadh ach breathn&uacute; le huaf&aacute;s ar ghn&iacute;omhartha na R&uacute;ise.  Seasaimid leis an &Uacute;cr&aacute;in agus tugaimid &aacute;r dtaca&iacute;ocht di ar&iacute;s.  The ongoing violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and Ukraine's internationally recognised borders is an affront to the principles that we hold dear as members of the international community.  I wish to take this opportunity to commend the work of Irish diplomatic staff and NGO personnel who are on the ground in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe carrying out very important work assisting those caught up in this nightmarish conflict and distributing humanitarian support and aid.  This is vital work.  I equally commend everyone engaged in collecting aid in Ireland to assist the humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has set out the initial contribution of the Irish Government to the humanitarian effort.  We all agree that this is a time when we need to stretch ourselves.  Will the Taoiseach set out what else the Government proposes to do and how Ireland might step up our efforts and supports for these humanitarian endeavours?</p>  <p>  Later this afternoon, I will meet the Ukrainian ambassador to assure her of our continued support and our unwavering commitment to seeing peace in her homeland.  I welcome the overwhelming support of the European Parliament yesterday for a resolution condemning Russia's actions.  I hope that, in the D&aacute;il this evening, we will equally support the motion before us on a cross-party basis.</p>  <p>  Our diplomatic response to Russia's actions must be firm, sure-footed and consistent.  Our objective is to end the war and we need to play our full part in that.  Our military neutrality, our history of conflict resolution and our seat on the UN Security Council mean that we are strongly placed to advance these efforts for a peaceful pathway forwards.  Diplomacy must prevail.  Every diplomatic avenue must be used to end the war.  All diplomatic leverage must be employed.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the actions of Russia in Ukraine are abhorrent.  To that end, I wish to ask about the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland.  Thus far, this is an action that the Government has not taken.  It has advanced the case of working in concert with our European partners.  I happen to believe that now is the time for our Government and the Taoiseach as Head of Government to take the lead on this issue.  Has he raised this matter with his fellow EU leaders?  Has he put a proposal to them?  Does he agree that it is now time to pursue this course of action?</p></speech>

More importantly, what is very clear from the resistance of the Ukrainian people is "how dare they value their freedom, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity?"  There is not a scintilla of evidence that there is any response from Ukrainian citizens that embraces the Russian invasion as President Putin would have advocated with his troops and so forth.</p>  <p>  The courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people is resonating across the globe.  I spoke last evening to the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Mr. Denys Shmyhal.  He thanked Ireland for our support - our political support, our economic support, our humanitarian support - along with our European Union colleagues.  He said that the situation was extremely difficult on the ground in terms of the indiscriminate killing of children and women.  It is shocking what is going on with the levelling of cities.  It is very clear now that President Putin is moving into a new phase where we are witnessing extreme forms of barbarity in terms of barbaric attacks on cities and civilian targets and in levelling cities.  It is quite horrific and an extraordinary trauma is now being visited upon the people of Ukraine, and we have to do everything we possibly can to support them.  For example, cluster munitions - this is something that we as a country took a leading role in by creating an international treaty to ban the use of cluster munitions in conflicts - are being used in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that approximately 700,000 people have already left Ukraine and the numbers could grow dramatically and very significantly.  We should expect those numbers to increase.  That will create huge challenges across the European Continent because the repercussions of this war, which is being waged by Putin, are going to be felt across the length and breadth of our Continent.  The human trauma will be enormous.  I am working on the basis that that trauma will be on a scale that we have never experienced before.  We as a country now have to get our heads around that and start preparing the humanitarian responses that will potentially be required to deal with the scale of migration caused by the war itself, but I think that the Irish people will do the right thing.  We will not be found wanting in relation to our humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  In relation to diplomacy, we are absolutely working with our European Union colleagues in respect of that, and first of all in terms of seeking a peaceful resolution of the issues.  To be fair to all the European leaders, particularly the French Presidency, Emmanuel Macron did everything he possibly could to avert this war, and Chancellor Scholz likewise.  I met Chancellor Scholz last week in respect of his engagements with President Putin and his endeavours to resolve this.</p>  <p>  In terms of diplomatic channels and expulsions, that is the easy bit.  It is our view that, across Europe, we work in concert with our European Union colleagues.  I have been absolutely passionate about this, in that our unity is our strength.  It is easy to say "I will lead ahead of others."  I actually think that the most effective route-----</p></speech>

The European Union, working together as a unified body with the United States and Canada, packs a powerful punch.  We have seen that in terms of the sanctions that have been agreed.  We were very clear at the EU Council meeting - we wanted the widest set of sanctions.  We want to protect Irish citizens and we want to maintain diplomatic channels to protect Irish citizens in Ukraine, in Russia and elsewhere.  It is important that we bear that in mind before taking precipitative action on the expulsions front.  That could be done in a day; it is very easy, but the repercussions could be much longer felt by Irish citizens.  That is the challenge.</p></speech>

No one underestimates for a moment the barbarity of Vladimir Putin's regime and the illegality of this invasion of Ukraine.  Neither should any of us doubt the absolute necessity to reassert the primacy of international law, rules-based international relationships and, above all else, the need to restore good order, a full withdrawal of Russian troopers and peace such that this war ends.</p> <p>It is in that spirit I invite the Taoiseach as Head of the Irish Government to lead again, to lead together with our partners in Europe and to leverage this crucial diplomatic tool.  It is essential as shells rain down on Kyiv and people flee for their lives that we demonstrate in every way to the Russian Federation that Ireland means business and that we will not offer any shelter, any excuse or any cover in any form to them.<b></b>In that spirit, I again invite the Taoiseach to lead our European partners in this endeavour.  As regards keeping diplomatic channels open, and that is a legitimate point the Taoiseach made, there are ways in which that can be achieved such as, for example, the appointment of a Charg&eacute; d'Affaires to ensure that our citizens in Russia or elsewhere are catered for.  I invite the Taoiseach not to break ranks with Europe but to lead on this matter.</p></speech>

We have expelled diplomats in the past.  The Deputy did not find favour with that in the past, as she knows.  She took the view that it was contrary to military neutrality at the time, in the teeth of Russian aggression.  I readily acknowledge that when that happens there is a reciprocal response and one ends up with nobody on the ground, particularly in Moscow, where we have Irish citizens.  I do not know how this war is going to unfold or what implications it will have for Irish citizens.  I do know that right now in Ukraine we are working extremely hard to help Irish citizens to get out, in particular very vulnerable young babies and so on in hospitals in Ukraine.  I am not going to cut off channels that potentially can help us to get Irish citizens who are in difficulty out of Ukraine or anywhere else for that matter.</p>  <p>  We have discussed everything with our European colleagues, including diplomatic issues.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has discussed it at Foreign Ministers level and we discussed it at COREPER level and at Heads of State level.  I really believe that the centrality of the importance of us working in unison trumps any domestic political consideration of me being able to say that I am leading ahead of the rest.  I have no interest in doing that.  In the teeth of the worst war on our Continent the best response is a unified response from the European Union working with the United States.  That is the best response.  I say that genuinely.  It is not about one taking a lead over the other.  I do not think that is the right way to go.  It might play well domestically in the short-term, but it is not in the best interests of the Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I have listened to the Taoiseach and there is validity in what he says but there comes a point when there is indiscriminate killing of civilians, where children are being murdered and when we know we have a dictator who is pursuing a scorched-earth policy.  We have always shown leadership in this country.  The Russian ambassador is a liar.  He lied to the Irish people on multiple occasions.  We are in unprecedented territory with a regime that is acting in an absolutely horrendous way.  There is no way on this Earth, not just domestically, the Russian ambassador should stay in Ireland.  What is the point in having diplomatic channels with somebody who lies?  We cannot trust him.  If he had said nothing, it would have been better.</p>  <p>  President Zelenskiy has thrown down the gauntlet to the world.  The Taoiseach is correct that collectively at EU level with our partners we have to do everything we can, but we also have to lead.  I am asking the Taoiseach formally to withdraw our ambassador from Russia.  I believe we have to do that.  I also believe that we have to expel the Russian ambassador.  We must also condemn the actions of some of our own elected representatives in the European Parliament.  Clare Daly and Mick Wallace do not speak for the Irish people.  As far as I am concerned, and the Labour Party is concerned, they have disgraced their mandate.  There are a number of others who also have not covered themselves in glory either.</p>  <p>  On the humanitarian crisis, the Taoiseach needs to give guidance to the Irish people as to how best they can help.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has asked the Taoiseach to accelerate the passage of the Magnitsky Bill.  The Taoiseach knows what it does regarding the proceeds of crime.  It gives the Criminal Assets Bureau the power to seize the assets of oligarchs, officials and anyone involved in human rights abuses.  If we did that, it would send a message to the world.  We need to park the party politics.  It is a Labour Party Bill but we will work with the Government.  The Labour Party has two hours of Private Members' time next week.  We will give it over if the Government is willing to add to it to take Committee and Report Stages.  That would send a message to the world.  This legislation is ready to go.  I hope we all support it.  We can make changes if needed.  Will the Taoiseach please work with us to set aside time so that we can implement it?</p>  <p>  I have key questions.  On behalf of the Irish people and taking everything into account, will the Taoiseach act and expel the Russian ambassador who is a liar?  Will he work with us to implement the Magnitsky Bill?  I am organising and attending a protest in my home county on Friday.  I am giving guidance.  Will the Taoiseach please give clear guidance to the Irish people as to how they can help our Ukrainian neighbours?</p></speech>

I have made that very clear in this House.  I understand fully people's anger towards Russia, the leadership and the Russian ambassador.  My primary concern is with Irish citizens and vulnerable Irish citizens.  Earlier, Deputy McDonald made the point about diplomacy and so forth.  A Charg&eacute; d'Affaires located here or somewhere else will not do a whole lot.  Let us be very honest with people about that.  If you cut off diplomatic relations, you cut them off.  That is something that at European level, along with all of the other measures that have been taken, has been discussed.  Far greater things have been already decided upon.  Bigger impact decisions have been taken by the European Union, with Ireland participating, in terms of unprecedented economic sanctions against Russia, denying the Russian Central Bank access to its foreign reserves and excluding the majority of its critical banks from the SWIFT mechanism.  There is also the decision in terms of trade and the undermining of the industrial base.  These are unprecedented sanctions that have real teeth and real impact on the ground in terms of Russia's economic and industrial capacity into the future.  The issue will be to continue with them because they will have impacts.  We have got to hold the line in terms of those sanctions for the longer haul.  President Putin has crossed the line here in terms of his appalling, barbaric attack on the Ukrainian people.</p>  <p>  In my view, the European Union has surprised international opinion generally in terms of its remarkable solidarity among 27 member states, the unity of purpose, the speed with which it has worked with the US, Canada and others to apply unprecedented sanctions against Russia, which are already having an immediate impact in terms of the Russian economy.</p> <p>Russia's currency has crashed to record lows on foreign exchange markets.  Its purchasing power on international markets has been significantly reduced.  Inflation in Russia has risen significantly.  The Russian Central Bank has hiked interest rates from 9% to 20% to prop up the currency.  The Russian stock market has shut.</p> <p> That is the real meat of what Europe and America are doing.  We will to do more, if necessary.  I do not accept the basic premise that has been articulated to the effect that Europe should split in different directions.  Europe should stay solidly united in its response to this issue.  In the discussion I had with the Ukrainian Prime Minister yesterday, he expressed a genuine desire for European Union membership on behalf of the Ukrainian Government and for Ukraine's application to be accelerated, which we support, as I have said.</p> <p> I did not get to all the Deputy's questions but I might get to them in my next contribution.  I have already indicated to Deputy Howlin that I am positively disposed to the Bill.  I have to talk to other Ministers about what can be done in that regard.</p></speech>

He has lied to the Irish people.  His interview on RT&Eacute; with David McCullagh will go down in history, as will the way he performed when he was before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  We need to get rid of him.  I accept what the Taoiseach is saying.  It is a valid argument.  However, I do not agree with him.  There have been times when we have been of a different view to our European colleagues when it comes to how we have used funding.  This is another issue on which I believe we should lead.  The Irish people want us to lead.  They do not want that man in this country.  They do not want his colleagues in the country.  They do not want a military attach&eacute; in this country.  We should also ask Irish citizens to leave Russia.</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Labour Party and, I hope, on behalf of everybody, I want to ask the Taoiseach sincerely about the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, drafted by my colleague, Deputy Howlin.  It would probably take two hours or a little more to pass through the House next week.  We will give over our Private Members' time over to the passage of the Bill and we will ask members of the Opposition and the Government to support it.  We can include any amendments the Government wants to add.  This proposed legislation would take the money from the oligarchs.  It will facilitate the seizing of assets.  It is only expanding on legislation that is already there.  I ask the Taoiseach to help us, give time to the issue, work with us and have a conversation.  This is not a matter of party politics.

We are now, thankfully, starting to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and society and workplaces are reopening.  The past two years have been very tough for everybody.  Many people lost their jobs.  Others saw their businesses close.  Many also lost friends and family members to the dreadful pandemic.  Now, just as we are starting to emerge from lockdown, the people are faced with new challenges.</p>  <p>  The cost of living, as the Taoiseach knows, is rising at an alarming rate.  The rising costs are affecting all businesses in the country, large and small.  I have spoken to many business owners about these challenges.  A local joinery company explained to me that this time last year, its core product, a sheet material, was costing approximately &euro;28 per sheet.  Today, the cost is over &euro;70 for the same sheet.  To put that in context, the company would purchase an average of 50 of those sheets per week.   This means that the cost has risen by more than &euro;100,000 in one year.  On top of that, the company's diesel bill has increased by more than &euro;250 per week.  The core costs for that business have increased by over &euro;120,000 in the past year.  Another business owner explained to me that their electricity bill has risen from &euro;25,000 per month to &euro;45,000 per month.  These two examples are just the tip of the iceberg.  Every business in the country is faced with these challenges.</p>  <p>  In the Border region, particularly around my home town of Dundalk, local businesses are facing even greater challenges.  It is becoming clear that the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing is going to have a devastating effect on local businesses in towns such as Dundalk.  I support minimum unit pricing for alcohol.  However, I stated all along that we must introduce it at the same time it is introduced in the North.  People are travelling in their thousands to buy cheap alcohol in the North.  This is going to be a massive drain on the local economy because, as the Taoiseach knows, when such people travel to the North to purchase cheap alcohol, they also buy other items, such as groceries, coffee or clothes.</p>  <p>  The same is happening with regard to heating fuels such as coal.  Coal is nearly half the price in the North that it is here so people are travelling there to buy it.  Businesses along the Border can no longer compete with their Northern counterparts.  The introduction of the carbon tax at this stage is not helping.</p>  <p>  I will also speak to the cost of utility bills.  People in Ireland like to do budgets but some utility companies are only billing people twice a year.  People have arranged for a standing order of &euro;130 per month, or whatever it is, and all of a sudden, four or five months down the road, they are getting bills of &euro;1,000, &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000.  This has to stop.  We must start pushing the utility companies to do a minimum of six meter readings per year.</p>  <p>  People in the Border area are looking for help.  I appreciate the &euro;200 payment towards the cost of electricity bills.  However, that is only a small item.  I would appreciate a reply.</p></speech>

In the earlier part of his contribution, the Deputy referred to the impact that rising costs have had on a particular company in his county.  I acknowledge that.  Inflation has risen significantly around the world in recent months, mainly driven by higher energy prices.  Because of the Ukraine-Russia war, costs are likely to go up even more in the short term.</p>  <p>  Inflation in Ireland was 5.5% in December and eased to 5% in January.  The cost of electricity, gas, home-heating oil, petrol, diesel, motor cars and rents were the main contributors to inflation.  Some food products, including bread, pasta, soft drinks and coffee, have also risen markedly in price.  In 2021, the country spent &euro;6.2 billion on imported fuels compared with &euro;3.4 billion in 2020.  That illustrates the scale of the increase.</p> <p>It was an increase of &euro;2.8 billion, which reflects the higher prices on the international market.  We spent an additional &euro;1.5 billion on imported oil and &euro;1 billion on imported gas last year.  A year ago, a barrel of oil was $64 on the international market; today, it costs $110.  Oil prices have risen by $14 a barrel over the past week alone.  Natural gas costs 400p a therm today on international markets, compared with 40p a therm last March.  Gas prices have soared by 220p a therm over the past week.  These are enormous increases in a very short period.</p> <p> The most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data on wages show average hourly earnings in quarter 4 of 2021 were up by about 2.6% from a year earlier and up 8.2% from quarter 4 of 2019.  As I said earlier, if we look at the United Kingdom and the US, inflation has been at multi-decade highs recently.  Euro area inflation has gone up again, with the figures today showing it is at about 5.8%, if I am not mistaken.</p> <p> We are in a very difficult situation regarding the costs of living.  The Government has responded.  Since coming into office, we have raised the fuel allowance from approximately &euro;630 to &euro;1,039.  We have been in office for approximately one year and seven months.  If we include the &euro;200 electricity payment, support for those on low incomes has now almost doubled to &euro;1,239.  That will help to cushion the blow for people on low incomes.  In addition, we have taken measures, as the Deputy acknowledged, in respect of the drug payment schemes, the front-loading of the working family payment and the reduction in public transport fares from the end of April, which will benefit 800,000 people.</p> <p> The minimum unit pricing of alcohol came into effect on 4 January.  I know the Deputy's heart is in the right place in respect of this matter and I know the point he is making.  The policy is designed to reduce alcohol consumption.</p></speech>

That is what is annoying me and it is why I use the word "profiteering".  Every time we open the newspapers, we see that the banks and companies like the ESB are making many millions in profits.  Some businesses are even saying they are making profits of 40% or 50%.  We need these businesses to help us and we must find some kind of incentive in this regard.  I repeat that many people will really welcome the &euro;200.  However, I reiterate that many companies are engaged in profiteering.  I worked in an electrical wholesale business for 25 years and I cannot understand how a sheet of timber could cost &euro;28 this time last year and now, all of a sudden, the price has increased to &euro;70.  There is something seriously wrong with that.</p>  <p>  We have a culture in Ireland whereby people want to pay their bills.  However, utility companies are raising prices twice a year.  A widow came to me last week whose electricity bill had gone up from &euro;130 a month to &euro;400 or &euro;500.  The simple reason for this was that the company had made a mistake in its reading.  When she telephoned the company, the response was, "Oh, sorry, we made a mistake."  We must help people at this time.  The &euro;200 is good but we must give some kind of incentive to the companies to help the people who need it.</p></speech>

There are various mechanisms in place whereby households that are in arrears or are in difficulty in respect of paying bills and so forth can be switched off.  The utility companies have developed policies in that respect.  Likewise, in terms of the utility companies the Deputy identified, meaningful and flexible approaches and responses should be developed by them in the current situation where, as I have outlined, international market prices for oil and gas have rocketed in the past 12 months and are set to go up again in the short term.</p>  <p>  In the context of the broader issues of supply and demand, there has been an issue as economies were recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic that demand far outstripped supply and costs went up accordingly for many products.  There was some evidence that was evening out in the past while, but it was a significant factor.</p></speech>

However, there is also a real crisis nationally in the community and voluntary sector, which provides services for children and families.  While I will refer to the situation in Sligo-Leitrim this morning, this is a nationwide issue.</p>  <p>  The community and voluntary boards in Sligo-Leitrim provide and run services funded by Tusla but they are not in a position to pay their staff decent wages commensurate with their experience and qualifications.  These boards are not in a position financially to pay increments to their staff, ensure that they have pension contributions or fund paid maternity and paternity leave.  Many staff have no comprehensive sick pay arrangements.  The boards provide supports and services for children, young people and families.  They include home-based, targeted family supports to which clients are referred by the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, disability services, local GPs and schools.  The services provide supports to early school leavers, asylum seekers, refugees and Travellers and also provide parenting programmes.</p>  <p>  The voluntary and community boards provide an extensive range of quality, professional caring services.  The different services and their staff are held in high esteem because of the conscientious, caring and responsive nature of the services they provide.  At one level, you might say money could not buy this service and that is, on another level, true.  The services are run by voluntary boards, thereby saving the State huge sums of money.  Critically, however, and this is why I refer to a crisis, many of the staff who provide these invaluable services are stuck on the bottom rung of pay structures.  Many of them are ten or 15 years in the service but have received just one or, in some cases, no increments.  There is no salary scale for staff and no financial credit for training and experience.  Yes, there has been a core funding increase for family resource services, which is good.  That core funding has gone to provide extra services and that is excellent.  However, none of it is for family support workers, counsellors, youth workers, play therapists and the other staff who deliver the services.  In Sligo-Leitrim alone, these services interact with several thousand families and children.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach will not disagree about the value of the services but, in order for them to provide a quality, nationwide service, including to the people of Sligo and Leitrim, they must be adequately funded.  This requires not just a block grant but the ring fencing of a proportion of that money to ensure the staff who provide the service are paid a decent wage.</p></speech>

I share her admiration for all who work in the community and voluntary sector, particularly those working under the aegis of Tusla, which provides a range of services, as the Deputy said, right across the board, including family resource centres, home-based supports, supporting early school leavers and much more.  The fundamental point is that in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, under which Tusla was established, it is stipulated very clearly that the funding arrangement for such community and voluntary bodies does not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the agency on the other.</p> <p>In the last while there have been significant funding increases to the bodies that work with or are funded by Tusla.  As the Deputy knows, Tusla is not the employer itself.  There are about 121 family resource centres with a core annual budget of &euro;18 million and that has been raised in the context of the national employers group and by trade unions such as SIPTU in numerous representations to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Tusla provides funding to those bodies and to more than 600 community and voluntary sector bodies to deliver services on its behalf under sections 56 to 59 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  About &euro;130 million in Tusla funding has gone to such bodies for a broad range of family supports.  Increased sustainability funding of about 4% to those services as part of the Tusla budget comes to an extra &euro;40 million in 2022&rsquo;s budget for these bodies, which is a significant enough increase.  It has been the way since the inception and establishment of Tusla to provide core budgets to these organisations.  The annual allocations from Tusla for these budgets have been increased, particularly during the Covid period and in the 2022 budget a significant increase was allocated to Tusla for these community and voluntary bodies that are associated with its agreement for family supports.</p></speech>

I welcome that and I stated that but those services are delivered by staff; by the workers who man those services.  The Taoiseach said himself that this has been the way since it started but I would put it to him that it is time to change or at least review that.  The average salary in these organisations is &euro;33,000 per annum, yet the average wage in Ireland in 2019, based on CSO information, is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;49,000.  Most of these staff have level 9 qualifications or master&rsquo;s degrees and they provide the services that are invaluable to families and young people.  It is not good enough to stand back and say that Tusla has increased the funding.  Part of that money should be written into the tender or the public procurement and set aside.  Do not ask me how to do it as there are enough experts to figure that out but part of that money must go to ensure that the staff who provide those services have decent jobs and wages and want to remain in the service because staff retention is a huge issue which we need to act on.</p></speech>

Funding has been significantly increased and in the most recent budget, apart from the additional funding that was provided to Tusla by the Minister following the discussion on the Estimates, further funding of about &euro;650,000 was provided from the dormant accounts programme to family resource centres in 2021.  A further &euro;1 million in dormant accounts funding also went to the family resource centres to progress minor maintenance works, the purchase of the central office and so on.  The Deputy is talking about salaries and pay and conditions for those who work in the various bodies or for those who work providing services that would receive grants and core funding from Tusla.  There are various mechanisms by which these issues are pursued such as the Workplace Relations Commission and so forth.</p></speech>

This has led to shocking waiting lists across the State and also to the denial of services to countless people.  There are more than 10,000 people on orthodontics lists waiting longer than a year and half of those people are waiting longer than three years.  That is not acceptable for any patient or for any condition anywhere.  Can the Taoiseach explain to me why there has not been an intervention from the Department of Health to deal with this growing crisis?  Why are there no serious talks between the Department and the dentists to fix the dental treatment contract and to prioritise preventative oral healthcare?  How will the Government ensure that older people, including workers and families on the lowest incomes, can access the good dental treatment they require?</p></speech>

An extra &euro;10 million was allocated in the budget, which is available to provide for dental services on an interim basis to medical card holders.  There have been discussions between the Irish Dental Association, private contractors and the State, which represents the people and which wants to do the best for the people.  It is time an interim solution was found based on the money that has already been allocated, and I would appeal to the Irish Dental Association to engage constructively on the utilisation of that funding.</p></speech>

After a local campaign this decision was rightly reversed, which is welcome news.  However, it is still of huge concern that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, plans to phase out early intervention classes nationwide in favour of the access and inclusion model.  Needless to say, that would be a disaster.  Since then I have been doing my best to try to get answers.  At a committee meeting last week the NCSE had a worrying and evasive response.  Where we would expect it to say that is absolutely not the case, it said it is waiting on the findings of an access and inclusion model, AIM, report and did not want to comment.  Since then it and the Department have just ignored my questions so today thanks to the Ceann Comhairle I raised it with the Minister for Education at the Topical Issue debate and she also did not answer the question.  I do not expect him to know the answer in this exact moment but I have tried every other avenue to try to get an answer to this question, so will the Taoiseach please look into it?</p></speech>

The National Council for Special Education has statutory remit and freedom to commission reviews to put forward policies.  We have to acknowledge that.

He and the T&aacute;naiste repeatedly said that workers who have played a key role in keeping our society going during Covid should get a reward.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the shocking efforts by Aer Lingus, the national flag carrier, to try to impose a pay freeze on 1,000 ground staff until 2024 and a 10% reduction in its rostered allowances, against which the workers have now voted twice?  In the most recent result in the past few days, 85% of the workers voted against this shocking attempt to cut their pay.  These workers are faced with inflation which is now, according to the Department of Finance, looking as though it will go up to 7% because of events in Ukraine and Aer Lingus expects them to take effective pay cuts.  Will the Taoiseach join with me in commending those workers in rejecting this disgraceful pay cut from a company that got huge amounts of public money-----</p></speech>

The equine sector comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but has not benefitted from any capital investment grants or direct support from CAP.  There are currently 27,000 farmers registered on the Department's database with equine premises.  These farmers in Tipperary and throughout rural Ireland would greatly benefit from the inclusion of their sector in target agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, to be funded under the new CAP regime from January 2023.  Essential infrastructure, such as stabling, arenas, horse fencing, outwintering paddocks and horse handling facilities should be incorporated and eligible for funding under the scheme.  Will the Taoiseach request that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine examine inclusion of this integral part of Irish agriculture in such a scheme and engage directly with representatives of the thoroughbred and sports sector?</p></speech>

Mr. Thomas Kennedy has written to the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the land services regulatory authority and the Property Services Regulatory Authority to try to obtain justice.  Mr. Kennedy bought and paid for land but believes a wrong has been committed and he has been wrongly imprisoned and put off his lands, which he has farmed for 30 years.  I have also reported these issues to all these agencies on Mr. Kennedy's behalf.  He has been fighting for 20 years.  He has written to the Taoiseach.  Will the Taoiseach sent up an independent inquiry into this?  There are rogue elements within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department, solicitors and all involved in this.  It is a murky business and it is not fair a citizen of our country should be treated like this.  The Taoiseach knows about it because he has written to him and handed letters him.  The Minister for Justice knows as well.</p></speech>

I have heard many positive announcements by the Minister, Deputy Foley, in my constituency.  There is one outlier, though.  Tubber national school dates back to the 1870s and is absolutely hemmed in and crowded.  It is on a triangular site with two very busy roads straddling it.  It has no space to expand.  On certain days of the week, the teachers ask the pupils to leave their schoolbags at home because they cannot fit in the classroom.  I was a teacher for 16 years.  I am alarmed by the conditions in the school.  The Department of Education urgently needs to come out to inspect it.  This needs to be green lighted for a new build on a new site that the school and diocese have acquired.</p></speech>

Obviously, movement and progress is needed on it.  He said the diocese had acquired a new site.  The most significant thing in terms of a new school is that the site has been secured.  I will speak to the Minister for Education but the fact that the site has been secured facilitates the progression of the project.  If one does not get a site, sometimes it can go on for far too long.</p></speech>

Will the Government and our EU partners give consideration to how best we can assist with Russian soldiers who are conscientious objectors to what is happening?  Many are fighting a war they do not want to fight and are involved in situations where they are killing men, women and children that they do not want to kill.

The European Union stands ready at all times in terms of a humanitarian response and to facilitate people, such as conscientious soldiers, who have no truck with this war and want to disengage.  One will find that the European Union, through all of its agencies, will be facilitative and help out in that situation.</p></speech>

It has been 224 days since the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 was passed and the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, have said they are serious about building houses.

I raise with the Taoiseach the damaging impact social media is having on the self-esteem and mental health of our young people, in particular when it comes to eating disorders.  Only a few months ago, the Facebook whistleblower, Ms Frances Haugen, reported that Instagram targets pro-anorexia content towards young girls who show a vulnerability of low self-esteem and negative body image.</p> <p>The Instagram algorithm is basically selling these young people an eating disorder.  Ireland is the European hub for almost all of our social media companies.  We have responsibility to address these issues adequately in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  What is the Government doing to protect our young people from the dangerous manipulation of social media companies?</p></speech>

In parallel with that are the ongoing programmes in education in terms of building up self-esteem and self-respect among children at the earliest ages.

I made it very clear that in respect of diplomatic channels, our primary concern is not the ambassador but rather Irish citizens who will need our assistance both in Ukraine and potentially Russia as well.</p>  <p>  We should not understate the seriousness of that in terms of helping people who right now are very vulnerable and need our assistance.  We are getting representations from Deputies and Senators in respect of individuals who need our help right now.  That is why it is important that we work in concert with our European Union colleagues on that front and work together in unity.</p>  <p>  What has been done so far by the European Union has been very strong.

If a landlord decides to retrofit his or her property, he or she can ask the tenant to move out.  One might ask where the tenant will go.  When that work is done and the BER rating has improved in the property, however, the landlord is then exempt from the limits in the rent pressure zone, RPZ, and can hike up the rents.</p>  <p>  Although by law the landlord can invite the tenant to move back into property, if he or she has hiked up the rents, the tenant can no longer remain in that property because the rents have been hiked up.  At the minute, property websites are advertising this loophole as a selling point for properties.  Threshold and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, have said this could potentially be a big problem with this scheme.  What is the Government going to do to afford protections to renters in private rental accommodation under this scheme and address the problems it may pose for them?</p></speech>

It will provide very significant resources to households generally across the country in terms of insulation and reducing energy costs for ordinary people over time.

As the Taoiseach may be aware, the turnaround time for applications and renewals for passports at the moment is totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  When I came into the Oireachtas 20 years ago, we had a drop box in Leinster House that empowered Deputies and Senators to facilitate urgent passports for members of the public.  Some 20 years later, that box is long gone.  It can take months, never mind weeks, particularly for young children and new applications.  Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that depending on who you know or what mobile telephone numbers you have, the turnaround time can be a little bit better but for the vast majority of us, it is disgraceful in the extreme.  The process to become a UN envoy seems clearer to the public than managing to get a passport for a child, to visit a sick relative or to go on a modest holiday.</p></speech>

An extra &euro;10 million was allocated for the passport service in the budget, which was an unprecedented investment in the service.  Passport service staff numbers have increased by more than 300 since June of 2021 and additional staff will continue to be recruited, which will bring the staff numbers to more than 900.</p></speech>

In south County Wexford, hundreds of acres of cereals were destroyed.  At the time, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine committed to look into this issue and seek the names of the farmers and lands involved.  To date, absolutely nothing has happened.

There seems to be an attempt to overestimate the number of spaces available at neighbouring schools.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about Sacred Heart Primary School in Roscrea, which had an exceptional review of its mainstream special needs assistant, SNA, allocation in October of last year.  The school made this request because in summer 2020, it knew the allocated SNA resources for its mainstream classes were not adequate.  Despite numerous emails to the visiting special educational needs organiser, SENO, who carried out the review, the school has heard nothing back since.  That has been going on six months into the school year.  As a consequence, the school has had no SENO in place since September 24, 2021.  As the Taoiseach will appreciate, this is a huge loss locally for the parents and children within the school community.  To keep a school in the dark in this way is unacceptable.  I am hopeful something can be done to address this immediately.  I certainly hope this is not the trend being experienced by other schools and parents around the country.</p></speech>

As I said, I raised this several times last year.  I even got the Deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Griffin, interested in the scheme as well.  We have had a new list since 2018, which includes applicants since 2007.  We got 19 roads done last year.  At this rate, it will take 34 or 35 years to complete or to exhaust this list.  These are public roads, not private roads like the Department of Finance has said.  There is no gate on any one of them.  People on these roads pay for everything, from motor tax, to property tax, to income tax.  They are ordinary working-class people, people who are going to work, farmers and elderly people who require carers and home help to visit them.  Other counties have been allocated funding in proportion to what is on the local improvement scheme list.</p></speech>

I also want to know if there have been any successes in the office for increasing competition in insurance, particularly in relation to public liability.  This is because there are just not enough players in the industry.  We are now at a disaster situation.  I know that majority of leisure, entertainment and children's entertainment companies, particularly people who are operating bouncy castles, are operating without insurance at present.  This is because they cannot get insurance.  I am engaging with Insurance Ireland myself.  I am also engaging with the Government.  We really need to deal with this because it is an absolute disaster.  This is the case for community centres, community groups and for businesses.

I will not go through all the details here.  In fact, an update and progress report will soon be published by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  Motor insurance has come down by 10% but the bulk of other insurance costs have not yet come down.  This is notwithstanding the changes that have been made in the legal system around awards and other measures that have been introduced.   Legislation is under consideration.  Some legislation about occupier's liability and so on is before the House at the moment.  A range of legislative measures is being taken and of course, the PIAB legislation is being piloted by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.</p></speech>

This is fitting, perhaps, because Aramark also makes money by running for-profit prisons in the US.  They have treated those who are in direct provision here appallingly over the years, by serving up terrible food, by intimidating those who speak out and, in one case, by locking the common room on Christmas to prevent families from having a celebration for their kids.</p>  <p>  The National Gallery has awarded Aramark a &euro;7.5 million catering contract.  Staff, artists and the community have protested against this.  Will the Taoiseach join me in expressing solidarity with those who are opposing this?

It is not for the Oireachtas to decide every individual contract.  There is a broader issue, if people wish to reform the procurement process itself.  I think we are entering into a new situation if individual Deputies are to decide who will win individual contracts from State agencies.  That is the road on which I am not clear that we should be going down, quite frankly.  It is not open to the State.  For example, local authorities have to go by EU procurement rules.  The State has to go by EU procurement rules in respect of all of these issues across the board, from construction, right across.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="13:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200026#Z02100"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the amendment of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to restrict developments in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure and to remove LNG infrastructure from listing as strategic development infrastructure projects. </blockquote>  <p>I want to introduce this Bill today by quoting the T&aacute;naiste in his speech in this House last week.  He said: &quot;Even if it was not for the climate crisis, for economic and security reasons, we need to wean ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels.&quot;  The position outlined last week in this House is meaningful and it is hopeful, because for once and at last, it places our communities, our children and our grandchildren at the forefront of policymaking in energy in this country.  It sets out our plan for energy security.</p><p>The LNG free Bill, which I have tabled today, was developed by the grassroots organisation Not Here Not Anywhere - who are here today and to which I am incredibly thankful - and it is sponsored by me.  It seeks to support the Government's agreed position, as outlined in the programme for Government.  This Bill is also supported by 30 national and international organisations.  It is to keep Ireland free of liquefied natural gas and to strike out towards a future based on energy sustainability and security, a future that will deliver us from the clutches of profiteers and despots who would happily allow this world to burn for the sake of a few more dollars.  This Government will not and cannot allow that to happen.</p><p>These have been a challenging two years for all of us.  Just when we began to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, inflation has skyrocketed, particularly in energy costs.  This is placing households in Ireland under terrible and sustained pressure.  No one should have to decide between heat or food.  It is our generation that will decide the pathway forward.  The pathway for which I advocate, and which this Bill serves, is one where communities can produce their own energy.  They own it.  They benefit from it.  It provides jobs to their communities.  It uses local natural resources, without destroying those resources or the landscape around them.  That is an attainable vision for energy in this country.  It includes wind, solar and perhaps wave energy.  It must include an integrated European grid.  Given our geographical riches and demographics in Ireland, Ireland has a better chance than almost any country on this planet of being entirely energy independent.  That will be mostly due to renewables.  We are the country that could achieve this.  </p><p>The other path to take would be the LNG path.  The impacts of that were outlined in detail this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, which issued a stark warning on just how close we are to devastation as a result of climate change.  Building large-scale LNG infrastructure in Ireland at this point will lock us into fossil fuel-use for decades to come.  It is an even worse path than that, because it is a polluted path.  It is a dangerous and dirty industry.  It is huge in the space that it requires but it is minuscule in the provision of employment. </p><p>The oppressive threat of environmental degradation and safety issues looms not just for those who suffer as their communities are ravaged by fracking and shale gas extraction in places like the US and Qatar, but for communities here in Ireland, where LNG terminals are to be built, as huge polluting tankers hover on the horizon and a meagre cohort of workers tend to often-empty storage facilities.</p><p>LNG did not protect France or Germany from price surges this year.  It did not protect their communities from inflation.  </p> <p>It did not protect communities in other countries from fuel poverty, even when it polluted them.  LNG is a plaything of private investors, and for this we will turn away from a truly fossil-free future.  We will give up our opportunity over the coming decades for an energy security that is genuinely ours.  The past two weeks has shown us how truly powerful the reliance on gas can be and how it can shape geopolitics.  If we are committed to peace and to standing for democracy, we can no longer blindly bind ourselves through energy dependence to other nations, especially when we now have options.  We can no longer place the future of our communities, their employment, their prosperity, their very environment and their water and air quality in the hands of other nations or, in particular, in the hands of private investors and interests.  The future should belong to us, to Irish communities, and it is for us to safeguard it for those who come after us.  There is no place for LNG in Ireland.  We do not need it.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Working closely with other Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the section provides me with advice and briefing on bilateral and multilateral relations and on international issues generally, including international peace and security, overseas development assistance and international human rights.  The section co-ordinates my international travel, including my engagement with Heads of State and Government and with other senior international figures and organisations.</p>  <p>  The international section oversees the implementation of the Global Ireland 2025 strategy and assists the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in its work co-ordinating whole-of-government efforts to implement the UN sustainable development goals.

Tonight in the D&aacute;il, we will discuss the Amnesty International report entitled, Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: A Cruel System of Domination and a Crime Against Humanity.  The report asks European governments, including the Taoiseach's Government, to condemn Israel for ongoing, systematic crimes against humanity.  Is the Taoiseach going to endorse that report and its recommendations regarding the referral of Israel to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, a total arms embargo against the state of Israel, and targeted sanctions against Israeli officials who perpetuate the system of apartheid, very similar to the sanctions the Government has just agreed to against members of the Kremlin and Putin's coterie for crimes against humanity?  If the Government does not do those things, it will be guilty, as will the European Union, of gross double standards in supposedly opposing crimes against humanity and breaches of international law.</p></speech>

We desperately need laws ensuring corporate accountability throughout the supply chain, regarding human rights, labour rights and environmental rights, but it appears the Commission has gone for the lowest common denominator position, with loopholes to carve out the vast majority of corporations in this country and across the EU.  For example, 99% of Irish businesses would be excluded because the proposed legislation will apply only to companies with an annual turnover of more than &euro;150 million and with more than 500 employees.  That would exclude, for example, the Dublin-based Coal Marketing Company, which sells coal from the infamous Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia, from where communities nearby face pollution of their air and water.  Another loophole would allow companies to offload responsibility through a contract onto their suppliers.  Will the Taoiseach work to strengthen this proposal?</p></speech>

Two people in my town, Tanya, who runs Tanya's Kitchen, and her mam, both of them Ukrainian, will run a fundraiser tomorrow, while Ollie, who runs The Snug, is collecting money as well.  So much work is being done and we have much to be proud of.  I hope yesterday's D&aacute;il statements demonstrated our collective support for Ukraine and our deep opposition to Russia's morally bankrupt and illegal war.</p>  <p>  In light of Ireland's military neutrality, our seat on the UN Security Council and our position as an EU member state not aligned with NATO, we have a unique and important role in supporting Ukraine, making the case for peace and holding Russia to account for its war crimes.  As for sanctions and, specifically, the targeting of Russian oligarchs and their financial entities located in Ireland, just three of the 34 of these special purpose entities will be impacted by the current round of sanctions.  I am concerned there appears to be no intention to pursue the remaining 31 entities.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position?</p>  <p>  Over the past two years, my party colleague Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell has raised a special purpose vehicle provision in section 110 in Ireland's tax code that is used by these Russian entities and others to avoid regulation and tax.  Does the Taoiseach accept it is finally time to reform how the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and our tax code are used, how our financial regulation performs and how our rules on transparency of company ownership work?</p></speech>

Colm Keena published a report in 2020 that showed a network of bank accounts allowing Russia to funnel money into the West.  Cillian Doyle and Jim Stewart have carried out research that shows that &euro;118 billion has been moved by Russian companies through section 110 trusts based in the IFSC over a 12-year period.</p><p>All the rhetoric we use in this House will come to nothing if we do not show Ukraine that we mean business by ensuring these sanctions are not circumvented through the IFSC.

In his reply, he stated, &quot;we neither support nor have any evidence ... of any racist approach to facilitating migration into Poland&quot;.  There is plenty of evidence now.  Ignorance was not really an excuse yesterday, given a Government Deputy, Deputy Higgins, raised the matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday evening, but it is certainly no excuse today.  This has been reported by the BBC, CNN, Reuters, France 24, <i>The Guardian</i>and others.  I give the Taoiseach a second opportunity to join with me in voicing opposition to a racist border policy at the Polish border with Ukraine and to call for equal treatment for everyone fleeing this humanitarian crisis.</p></speech>

We all agree we need to hurt the Russian and oligarchs' war machine financially.  We need to deal with the section 110 companies and the various means by which money can be filtered that have enabled these people.  There has been great success regarding people who have contacted us about medical supplies, particularly insulin.  This was facilitated, but many people are still talking about the community response.</p> <p>The EU Commission is talking about this becoming a major part of dealing with migration into the future.

It is obviously doing important work.</p>  <p>  As we all will be aware, international affairs are dominated just now by the horrific Russian war on Ukraine.  The Taoiseach has engaged with a number of Heads of Government in this regard in recent days.  Can the Taoiseach give me a sense of where world leaders are at on this?  I think, in particular, of the Taoiseach's formal visit to Germany last week and his meeting with the German Chancellor, Mr. Olaf Scholz, just prior to the invasion.  It seems, after some initial apparent hesitation by the German Chancellor, he has now become one of the strongest supporters for harsh sanctions on Russia.  For example, he has cancelled the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.</p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach aware of any new initiatives by EU leaders as we witness the horrific scenes taking place in Ukraine?</p>  <p>  Finally, in his exchanges with President Biden for St. Patrick's Day, what will the Taoiseach be saying to him in this regard?  Have the Taoiseach's plans for his visit to Washington been finalised at this stage?</p></speech>

The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently examining the Amnesty report in respect of the plight of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  I have consistently opposed the policy of successive Israeli Governments in relation to Palestine.  It is my view that a two-state solution is the optimal solution to what has been a very long-running conflict.

I merely want to say that.</p>  <p>  In relation to section 110 entities, I made my position clear on that.  With regard to authorised investment funds, the Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held on 31 December 2021 is estimated at &euro;11.4 billion or 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of &euro;3.8 trillion, and this is evenly split between equities and bonds.  In terms of the special purpose entities, there were 3,000 Irish domiciled special purpose entities.  The Central Bank has undertaken an initial review of those and any links with Russian counterparts.  Some 34 of these entities have a Russian sponsor, meaning that they were established on behalf of a Russian company.  By the way, it does not mean they are all illegal.  Of these 34 entities, three have been identified as being directly linked to individuals or financial institutions covered in the 23 February round of EU sanctions.  Work is ongoing in respect of the subsequent sanction rounds.  I have given the figure in terms of the &euro;11.4 billion, which is 0.3% of the &euro;3.8 trillion.</p>  <p>  I would make the point that a breach of a financial sanction, and this is in response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n as well, is a criminal offence.  Accounts, funds or other assets must be frozen without delay in order that they cannot be made available, directly or indirectly, to the sanctioned person, entity or body, and all natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to comply with European Union sanctions.</p></speech>

It relates to the fact that services delivered to people with Down's syndrome have radically fallen over the past couple of years.  Of those surveyed by DSI, 65% have received no speech and language therapy sessions in the past year, while 44% have received no therapy of any kind in the past year.  Some parents responded that they have received no therapy sessions at all over the past three years.  Moreover, 40% stated they received no communication from the HSE in the past 12 months and nearly 25% of children with Down's syndrome under the age of five have received no therapy services in their whole lives.  Of young children, only 49% have had a speech and language therapist, while 22% have had access to occupational therapy.</p> <p>This is an abandonment of a whole section of Irish society.  This country flies the flag of inclusion but, unfortunately, in real terms, too many people with disabilities are being excluded.</p></speech>

It also represents the individual member states' priority rail and road transport corridors, ports and airports.  The latest 2021 CEF transport call under the 2013 TEN-T map is for proposals to make &euro;7 billion available to support infrastructure projects across the EU.  Why is the west and the Atlantic economic corridor excluded from the TEN-T core status when it is critical to provide investment certainty and to match EU and State investment in the infrastructure there?  People in the west need to know why they are being excluded and why they do not have the vital infrastructure that would create the opportunities that are presented by renewable energy and related industries in the west.</p></speech>

It is 5.8%.  The Taoiseach may have said it this morning, but it is breaking in the past hour.  There are big cost-of-living increases on the way that are not included in those figures.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine moves the cost-of-living crisis to another level.  The price of bread, groceries, heating and fuel will rise.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already warned of a massive spike in heating costs.  The Taoiseach is on the record as saying that there will be no new cost-of-living compensation measures for households this side of the budget in October.  I put it to him that this is no longer a tenable position.  I am for price controls on gas and electricity prices.  I am also for an increase in the national minimum wage to &euro;15 and for inflation-busting wage increases across the board.  What new measures is the Taoiseach prepared to consider?  What is his position, for example, on the idea that a &euro;200 credit be introduced to offset rising gas bills?</p></speech>

As a result, we are potentially looking at an inflation rate of more than 9%.  Against that background, and because I did not make this point earlier, could I ask the Taoiseach to condemn what Aer Lingus and International Airlines Group, IAG, are doing in terms of demanding pay cuts?  This from an entity that we subsidised during Covid.  I commend the workers on voting overwhelmingly against those pay cuts, particularly - I did not make this point earlier - because IAG, simultaneously gave British Airways workers, the same staff, a 10% pay increase as a reward for what they had done during Covid.  That is shocking.</p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach going to do to increase the minimum wage for low-paid workers?  I met this week with private security workers who are on less than &euro;12 an hour.  Do they not deserve a decent pay increase?</p></speech>

They very decisively rejected a proposal to impose a pay freeze and cuts to allowances on them today, voting 85% against.  Fair play to them.  These are workers who have not had a pay rise since 2019, and the Labour Court was pushing to continue with the pay freeze for almost three more years when the cost of living is through the roof, as the himself has now pointed out.  At the same time, IAG is now granting 10% pay increases at other airlines.  Does the Taoiseach agree that a pay freeze is simply not fair during this cost-of-living crisis?  Will he support these workers and oppose the attempts right across the aviation industry to use the pandemic to reshape labour relations in the interests of the bosses against the workers, for example, as we have seen at the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, where it got a significant number of workers to sign up for severance and has rehired people on substantially worse terms and conditions?</p></speech>

As he will be aware, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled legislation that was supported by his party in opposition in the previous D&aacute;il and which we will be reintroducing in the coming weeks.  This legislation, when passed, will give workers a choice to retire at 65 or to work on.  Forcing workers to retire at 65, as his Government partners are finding out, when they are fit and able and may want to work on, especially where they cannot access the State pension rate of pay, is deeply unfair.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on any discussions that have taken place and any work done on this important worker's rights issue by the economic division of his Department?</p>  <p>  This morning, Ms Patricia King, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, outlined deep concerns that she and ICTU affiliates have in relation to a complete lack of consultation on the right to request remote working.  The matter is being referred to in industrial relations circles as the right for employers to say no to remote working.  The lack of consultation led to deeply flawed legislation.  We do not want to see that mistake replicated.  What consultation and discussions have taken place on the abolition of mandatory retirement?</p></speech>

His question related to the economic division in my Department.  Suffice to say that throughout the Covid period there was, unfortunately, a retrenchment in services.  We have provided additional resources to the HSE in respect of the hiring of occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  I will discuss this further with the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability regarding the report on Down's syndrome and we will follow through on it.  There is a need to provide far greater therapeutic services to children with special needs more generally.  Additional funding has been allocated in successive years.  I am not clear whether the allocation has been provided specifically to services on the ground.  We need to interrogate a bit further the money that has been allocated.  Record funding has been allocated to the HSE in respect of therapeutic services, in particular in terms of the progressing disability model it has been pursuing for some years.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to the west.</p></speech>

The western seaboard will receive considerable investment for renewable energy.  The first phase is on the east coast and the west and south west will follow through.  There is great potential in particular for offshore wind on the western seaboard.  The potential is very exciting in terms of jobs and the economy in the future.</p>  <p>  The ring road around Galway, for example, is a major piece of infrastructure that has been bogged down in planning due to objections right through the process.

There has been very significant investment in the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, programme by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in respect of many towns across the west.  There is a whole range of investment vehicles from the State and the vast bulk of the investment is now generated by taxpayers and allocated through the various national strategies in terms of investment in the west.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Barry, as I referenced this morning, there is a significant issue facing the country in the context of inflation.  It is a global phenomenon.  There are no easy answers.  The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, an illegal war, is going to add to inflation, in particular in respect of energy prices.</p> <p>I said earlier that in 2020, the country spent approximately &euro;3.4 billion on imported fuels.  In 2021, it spent &euro;6.2 billion.  That gives an illustration.  There was a &euro;2.8 billion increase in the bill for imported fuels and that reflects the higher prices on the international markets.  A year ago, a barrel of oil cost $64 on international markets.  Today, it costs $110.  Oil prices have risen by $14 a barrel over the past week.  This is not the Government's fault.  It is just the reality of the international situation in regard to energy.</p></speech>

The same applies to natural gas, which costs 400p per therm today on international markets compared with 40p per therm last March.  Gas prices have soared 220p per therm over the past week.</p>  <p>  We are going to face a very difficult situation.  I gave the figures on wages, which have increased over the past while.  In terms of the Government's response, we have increased the fuel allowance from &euro;630 to &euro;1,039 since we came into office a little over a year and a half ago.  If we add on the &euro;200 electricity payment, that is &euro;1,239 we are giving to low-income families.  Basically, it is a doubling of support to low-income families in the context of fuel supports.  We have also taken other measures to support families, either with medical costs or in respect of reducing transport fees from the end of April, which will benefit approximately 800,000 users, and by reducing school transport fees.  The budget contained in the region of &euro;1 billion in measures to support people on social protection and tax relief for workers of about &euro;630 million.</p>  <p>  We are and will be working with the European Commission in respect of the energy situation and energy prices.  The European Commission will be coming forward with a further publication in that regard in the next ten days following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  We are facing a very difficult situation because of the war and because of President Putin's behaviour and activity.  There is no question about that.  There are no easy answers.  It is pointless coming in and making ideological points or whatever.  That is the point I would make.</p></speech>

Around 20 international leaders attended in person for Friday's high-level segment hosted by President Macron.  This event was held in the context of the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with the support of the UN and in co-operation with the World Bank and other public, private and civil society partners.  It feeds into a sequence of major international events on the oceans and seas in the first half of 2022, including a meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly, the second phase of the COP15 UN biodiversity conference and a UN conference to support the implementation of sustainable development Goal 14, which is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p><p>My contribution to the One Ocean Summit was on the theme of &quot;an ocean of solutions to climate change&quot;.  I took the opportunity to highlight the following: the vast potential of Ireland's renewable energy resources, including for export, and associated commitments in our climate action plan and programme for government; the new licensing and regulatory regime being established by the Maritime Area Planning Act, including establishment of the maritime area regulatory authority; and the launch this year of Ireland's new state-of-the-art marine research vessel, <i>RV Tom Crean</i>, which will make an important contribution to the Horizon Europe mission to restore our ocean, seas and waters by 2030.</p><p>The oceans comprise the largest component of the Earth's system that stabilises climate and supports life and human well-being.  Given that our maritime area is seven times the size of our landmass, it also has particular significance for Ireland.  I was happy to lend my firm support for this excellent initiative from President Macron to raise the collective level of ambition of the international community on marine issues.  I pay tribute to President Macron for the enormous individual effort that he put into this conference, staying there for the entirety of it and contributing very significantly to it.</p></reply>

Is the Taoiseach confident that Ireland can achieve the 5 GW of installed offshore wind generation by 2030, which is the Government's own target?  Is he confident that upon the establishment of the maritime agency, the marine area consents that would give effect to the potential for offshore wind will be realised?  There is a massive opportunity in our native Cork for sites like the Verolme dockyard to be staging posts to service that industry, particularly on the south and south-west coast.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200030#DD01800"><p>I want to raise with the Taoiseach the delay in advancing the urgently needed legislation to identify and guard marine protected areas as required under the marine strategy framework directive.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, Ireland has no legal tool with which to define, identify, designate or manage marine protected areas.  As a result, many species, habitats and processes occurring in our extensive marine area have fallen outside the scope of area-based conservation, with consequent risks to marine biodiversity and ecosystem services that benefit people and nature.</p>  <p>  These are not my words.  This is the advice of a senior Department official to a recent meeting of an Oireachtas committee.  It is also worth noting that under the directive, Ireland's marine protected area should have been identified and underpinned in legislation two years ago.  Nearly three years have passed since the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, yet numerous targets set out in the national biodiversity action plan have not been met.  Again, the Taoiseach will know from his keen interest in biodiversity that international best practice dictates that the marine planning framework should have been delivered in tandem with the marine protected areas legislation.  In addition to the marine biodiversity protection targets that Ireland has missed and has yet to meet, there are seven renewable energy legacy projects, as well as new planning applications, that will be dealt with in the absence of the marine protected areas legislation.</p></speech>

Fishing ports such as Burtonport, An Daingean, Schull, Baltimore, Kilmore Quay and Killybegs will be hit massively.  The Irish fishing quota has been slashed from 20% to 15% and the remaining 85% of fish caught in Irish waters will go to countries in the European Union.  That is incredible.  I would challenge the Taoiseach to name another Government anywhere in the world that has done such a wrong to an indigenous sector as has been done to the Irish fishing sector.  Aont&uacute;&rsquo;s Becky Kealy will host a meeting in Bandon this Friday night to fight for the rights of fishing families and Patrick Murphy from the Irish South and West Fish Producers&rsquo; Organisation will be there.  The Taoiseach may not be too far away from the event and I would ask him, if he can, to go along to that event, listen to the needs of fishing families in this country and guarantee that their livelihoods will not be destroyed.</p></speech>

It might be worth considering that more than 50% of our gas, for example, comes from Corrib and that we can produce up to 80% or 85% of our own electricity, yet the prices are going through the roof.  That is because we privatised it and we gave it away to for-profit companies.  There are now developers and multinational companies literally queueing up to grab sites all around the country.  They have identified the sites because the Government did not protect the marine areas as it should have, or only 2% of them when it was supposed to protect 30%.  They are queueing up to grab our wind energy potential and our oceans.  Will he acknowledge that when they develop that renewable energy, they will charge market prices for the use of those resources to the people of this country?</p></speech>

The latest report talks of a "rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all".  It says that up to three quarters of the world's population faces life-threatening climatic conditions this century due to extreme heat if we do not act to stop climate change.  The IPCC chair, Dr. Hoesung Lee, warned that half measures are no longer an option.  The report calls for 30% to 50% of our land, rivers and oceans to be conserved in order to maintain biodiversity, yet Ireland only has 2.4% of its seas covered by MPAs, MPAs.  Will the Taoiseach act on the science when it comes to the devastation facing us.  Will he act and agree to have 30% of our sea areas designated as MPAs?</p></speech>

Our oceans are the greatest habitat of all.  Anja Murray writes in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>today that &quot;The world&rsquo;s oceans contain the last great wilderness on Earth&quot;.  That is pretty powerful.  It is true and we want it to remain true.  I have often spoken of the abundance of whales, dolphins and marine wildlife off our coast.  We need to introduce steps to protect that wildlife.  There are two simple steps we can take immediately.  First, is to support the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in his push to increase the six-to-12 nautical mile fishing zone exclusively for the Irish fleet to 20 nautical miles.  That would be an incredibly positive step both for wildlife and the fishing sector.  Second, as other Deputies have noted, we need to urgently introduce legislation around MPAs and get to that target of 30% of MPAs.</p></speech>

The Government has been in office for about a year and a half or a bit more.  In that time, the marine planning framework has been published.  The Maritime Area Planning Act has been enacted.  There have been very significant developments, particularly in respect of the development of wind energy to give certainty to investors.  Unlike Deputy Boyd Barrett, I welcome investment in wind energy off our coast.  I do not think that the State on its own will be able to develop wind energy.  We will have to agree to disagree on that.  There is tremendous potential.  The sea is seven times the size of our land mass.</p></speech>

That is Ireland's goal in the climate action plan.  That depends on harnessing offshore wind in particular.  It is at approximately 43% of electricity generated now.  In that context, the development of a new regulatory consenting regime for the offshore renewable sector in Ireland, including the introduction of maritime area consents provided for through the Maritime Area Planning Act, a route to market for future offshore wind projects through offshore renewable electricity support options.  The Department of the Environment is working on all of this and has a very extensive work programme involving the development of a framework for offshore electricity transmission systems, updating the offshore renewable energy development plan and a cross-departmental offshore renewable energy delivery task force has been established to capture wider economic and business opportunities for offshore renewable energy, particularly in coastal areas.</p>  <p>  We are very concerned with regard to the issue raised by Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and O'Reilly in respect of the need to protect ocean eco systems for sustainability purposes, to protect fisheries as a natural resource and to ensure fishing opportunities for future generations.  That matter is constantly under review and is being developed in the context of fisheries policy.</p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's points are not valid because it is not the Government that did what he outlined; Brexit did it.  That is the bottom line.  Had we had a no-deal Brexit, it would have been far worse.  The Deputy just made a presentation that was a classic of spin and distortion.  He said that the Government is doing this.  The Government wants to do nothing of the sort.  Brexit caused this.</p>  <p>   It is a good idea and important to develop maritime protected areas.  We have to consult with all of the stakeholders because otherwise Deputies will be back in with me saying not to do it here or there for various reasons.  It is extremely important.  Ireland was one of the first countries to become a whale and dolphin sanctuary, for example.  It was the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, did that.  He was ahead of his time in the context of marine biodiversity.  However, we need to do more - and we need to do it faster - to protect our ecosystems because the IPCC report is very worrying indeed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="14:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200032#MM00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time".</p>  <p>  I am pleased to bring the Institutional Burials Bill 2022 before the House.  This legislation will provide us with a legal basis to finally exhume the remains of children so tragically interred at the site in Tuam, reunite them with their loved ones and afford them a dignified burial.</p>  <p>  What happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  Since coming into this role I have met with many of the families affected.  In those meetings I have heard that sense of urgency and frustration around why exhumation has not yet happened and I share that frustration.  These families want to give their loved ones the respect and dignity they were so grievously denied in their short lives.  The uniquely tragic nature of the site at Tuam means legislation is required to undertake this work.  This will be one of the most complex forensic excavation and recovery efforts ever undertaken, not only in Ireland but anywhere in the world.  While Tuam will be the first such excavation and exhumation, I am conscious there are concerns about other sites, like Sean Ross Abbey and Bessborough.</p>  <p>  Since the general scheme was published it has been scrutinised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth chaired by Deputy Funchion, as well as other stakeholders.  I thank the Chair and all members of the committee for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, report they produced.  I also thank those who engaged with the committee and those who have spoken with me directly for their constructive engagement on this legislation.</p>  <p>  In response to the PLS report and the wider feedback I have made significant changes to this legislation.  Among these, I want to briefly draw attention to three key improvements, namely, we have removed the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, the legislation now requires that the forensic investigation must be done to international standards and we have increased the transparency and accountability by increasing involvement for stakeholders like family members and former residents of institutions.</p>  <p>  I will now outline the key parts of the Bill as initiated.  Part 1 contains the standard Short Title, commencement and interpretation provisions.  Section 2 provides definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  A central term is "forensic excavation and recovery".  This means the excavation of the land and the recovery and treatment of human remains in a manner sufficient to satisfy legal requirements regarding the use and storage of evidence in connection with the identification of human remains, including in criminal proceedings.</p>  <p>  Part 1 sets out the procedures for the service of documents and provides that it will be an offence to interfere with, or obstruct, the work of the director of an intervention or to use samples or DNA profiles generated in connection with an identification programme for unauthorised purposes.</p>  <p>  Part 2 provides that the Government can consider a proposal by a relevant Minister to intervene at a site where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place of persons who died while ordinarily resident in that institution.  Where the Government is satisfied an intervention is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding important objectives of public interest, it can direct that Minister to establish an office of a director of authorised interventions.</p>  <p>  The Minister will appoint a director to oversee the intervention and an advisory board to support and guide the director in the role.  The director will be required to conduct a forensic-standard excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of human remains.  He or she will be empowered to employ or contract the range of expertise and disciplines needed to discharge these functions to international best practice standard at a particular site.  The director will also provide updates on the work of the office to relatives of persons believed to be buried at the site, other stakeholders and the general public.  The director may also be required to undertake a DNA programme of identification.  This is intended in the case of Tuam.  The advisory board will provide advice and guidance to the director.</p>  <p>  The board will be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise and will include scientific experts and - this is important - former residents, family members connected with a particular institution, or both.  Consultation with the advisory board will be required at regular intervals, including at key decision points during the intervention.  The addition of an advisory board responds to a number of recommendations made during the PLS process to enhance transparency and accountability, as well as to ensure meaningful engagement with families and with survivors.</p>  <p>  Part 2 also provides that a director can obtain information and documents from publicly-funded bodies and other persons to assist in the performance of his or her functions.  Importantly, a director can also obtain information from Tusla that is contained in the database and related records of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  It is an offence for persons to disclose confidential information obtained while performing their functions under the legislation.  This provision has been enhanced in response to PLS recommendations to give the director the power to compel, rather than simply request, the production of the information or documents concerned.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Bill provides for the forensic excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of human remains to be carried out by appropriately-qualified persons in accordance with international standards and best practice.  It provides that remains that are recovered will be sorted into individual sets in as far as is possible, that forensic testing will be carried out to establish as much information about the individuals as possible, including the circumstances and causes of their death, and that the director of an intervention will publish a general report on the findings.  This Part is another significant new addition to the general scheme that was published in December 2019.  This change responds directly to issues raised during PLS about the need the need to address how people died.  A director of an intervention will be required to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the relevant coroner where evidence emerges of a violent or unnatural death or where remains are not those of a person who died while ordinarily resident in an institution.</p>  <p>  Part 4 provides the legal basis for a DNA-based programme of identification to be carried out in respect of remains recovered from an intervention site.  The aim of an identification programme is to establish the likelihood that there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at a site and the human remains that are recovered from that site and, where a familial link is established, to identify those remains.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns raised by family members and other stakeholders, the provision for a pilot identification programme, which was contained in the general scheme, has been removed.  Instead the Bill provides that an identification programme will proceed where there are living family members of persons believed to be buried at the site who wish to participate in a programme and where DNA of sufficient quality is available from the remains to enable DNA profile comparisons.  The Bill also provides for a review mechanism, whereby a director can make a decision in relation to continuation of a programme based on the advice of Forensic Science Ireland and consultation with the advisory board.</p>  <p>  DNA testing is, as we know, a very powerful tool which may reveal information about familial relationships to persons other than to the deceased relative that a person believes may be buried at a site.  The legislation, therefore, has to balance the public interest of identifying remains buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner with the privacy rights of close living relatives.  The general scheme sought to do this by limiting participation in an identification programme to parents, children, siblings and half-siblings of deceased persons and also by providing that the highest-ranking of those relatives had to provide consent or a person would be blocked from participating in the programme.</p>  <p>  The PLS recommended expanding participation and removing the hierarchy in the general scheme.  I have responded to these recommendations by providing a much more inclusive and flexible approach to the balancing of the rights involved.  In summary, this Bill now expands the family members who are eligible to participate to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews of deceased persons.  There remains a provision for the closest living relative, that is, a parent, child or sibling, to object to the participation of another less closely-related person.  However, it is important to note an objection does not automatically mean a second order relative cannot participate in an identification programme.  Any objection will be considered by a director.  The director must balance the closeness of the genetic relationship of the person who wishes to participate and, importantly, the public interest of identifying human remains.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that before an identification programme begins a director will hold a public information campaign to raise awareness about the programme and how eligible family members and spouses or civil partners of a deceased person can register an interest in participating; an objection to another person's participation; and also that they are interested in receiving remains if they are identified as family remains.  They may also state their wishes in respect of the final arrangements for those remains.  Again, this information campaign is newly-added into this draft.</p>  <p>  The director will create and maintain a register to capture all of these notifications from eligible family members.  The benefits of this register are that it should allow eligible family members to express their wishes at a very early stage in the intervention process and assist in supporting wide-ranging participation, while providing a mechanism to recognise the rights of close family members.</p>  <p>Importantly, in expressing an interest in participating in an identification programme, eligible family members can include a letter of support from relatives who would otherwise be able to object to their participation.  The intention of these upfront letters of support is to help accelerate the process of approving an application to participate in an identification programme.</p> <p> In circumstances where neither an objection nor a letter of support has been received from a closer living relative who would be entitled to object to a person's participation, the director may make reasonable efforts to contact that closer living relative to establish whether she or he wishes to register an objection to the person's participation in the identification programme.  Given the significant privacy and data protection rights involved, the director is required to take these steps.</p> <p> Where a person applies to take part in an identification programme, the director will first establish that the person is an eligible family member and has provided the required evidence of her or his relationship to the deceased person.  The director must be satisfied that the person is fully aware of what is involved in the programme and is happy to participate.  The director must give consideration to any objection from a closer living relative who may be entitled to object to a person's participation.  The director will notify an applicant in writing of his or her decision as to whether that person may participate.  Where the director notifies a person that she or he may not participate in the programme, the director will set out reasons for this decision.  Importantly, a person whose participation has been rejected by the director can appeal the decision to an adjudicator established by the relevant Minister.  Where a person is notified that he or she may participate in the programme, that person is therefore known as a "relevant person" for the purposes of this Bill.</p> <p> The Bill provides for participants in an identification programme to nominate up to two people to be notified of the outcome of a familial matching process in the event that they die or become incapacitated before the outcome of the DNA identification programme is complete and where there is no other relevant person in respect of the deceased person.  Those people can receive remains where they have been identified.</p> <p> The DNA identification programme will involve taking samples from the human remains recovered from the site and relevant persons.  My understanding is that this will entail an oral swab.  Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, will generate DNA profiles from those samples and, at the request of the director, conduct DNA profile comparisons in respect of a relevant person to establish the likelihood of a familial link.  The results will be notified to the director by FSI and the director will consider the results and any other relevant information and inform a participant as to whether, on the balance of probability, a familial link has been established.  A finding that the data are not sufficient to suggest a familial link can be appealed to the adjudicator appointed by the relevant Minister.</p> <p> The final arrangements for recovered human remains are considered in Part 4.  The provisions in the Bill have been amended from those in the general scheme as a response to a number of the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The Bill now provides that, once identified, remains will be returned to family members or final arrangements will be made in line with their wishes.  This is clearly stated in the Bill.  Where identification of remains is not possible, final arrangements are similarly undertaken in line with the wishes of all those who consider they are family relatives of those interred at the site.  A director will make arrangements as soon as practicable after a familial link has been established or where an identification programme has concluded.</p> <p> In response to a pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation, and in order to facilitate potential developments in forensic testing, the Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations for further forensic testing of samples, subject to the consent of relatives, after an identification programme has been completed.  In this regard, a prohibition on the cremation of remains that have not been identified has been included in the Bill so that they may subsequently be tested if scientific advances allow for such.</p> <p> Part 5 provides for a director to acquire temporary rights of access to land required in order to undertake an intervention, with an obligation to provide reasonable compensation and to restore land to its original condition and use upon completion.  The compensation amount will be calculated by a relevant professional and will take account of a number of relevant factors, including the period for which access is required, the extent of the works and the disturbance to a trade or a person's peaceful enjoyment of land.  It is open to an landowner or occupier to challenge access to the land or the amount of compensation being offered.  A challenge to the level of compensation does not affect the work and the director can carry out the intervention while the case is before the court.  However, a challenge to access has the potential to delay the work of the director.</p> <p> The primary access provided for in this Bill is to a principal burial site described as "principal burial land".  Where the principal burial land is on residential land, access can extend up to the curtilage or 20 m, whichever is the lesser, of any dwelling on the land.  The Bill also provides for access to residential land adjacent to the principal burial land where burials associated with burials on the principal burial site have taken place, described as "ancillary burial land".  In this case, access does not extend further than 2 m from the boundary of the land or encroach on any dwelling on the land.  Access can also be obtained to ancillary land where burials have not taken place but where access is required in order to facilitate works.</p> <p> Part 6 contains provisions related to the dissolution of an office of a director.  On dissolution day, all functions, assets, liabilities and records shall be transferred to the relevant Minister.  It also provides that a director will prepare and submit a final report of the director prior to dissolution day.  Following submission of this report, the relevant Minster shall, within 12 months, undertake a review of the implementation of the legislation in regard to that particular intervention.  A report on the review will be published.  The review mechanism is included in the Bill as a response to a pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation.</p> <p> Before I conclude, it is important that I pay tribute to the work of all those who have worked to bring us to this point, in particular Catherine Corless.  She became a voice for these children and the State owes her a great debt.  What happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  We can never erase the immense tragedy of what happened there, but this Bill will allow us, at long last, to afford the children interred at that site a respectful burial.  It is long past time that we afford these children that basic dignity, which has been denied them for such a long time.</p> <p> I urge Deputies on all sides of the House to work constructively with me to see this legislation passed promptly so that we can finally begin the vital work of honouring these children by exhuming their remains, identifying them, allowing the return of their remains to their loved ones and affording them a dignified burial.  Everyone in the House is in agreement that this is the very least that we can do.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We welcome this legislation.  I wish to acknowledge all of the babies and children about whom we are speaking.  Sometimes, there are no words to describe a tragic situation.  As the Minister stated, we owe Catherine Corless a great debt of gratitude.  She was actually in the Chamber for the pre-legislative scrutiny discussions.  It was during Covid and, thankfully, we were able to open the Chamber up to a number of people.  It was fitting that she had the opportunity to address our committee.  I pay tribute to her and all of the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  There was an expectation during the general election.  People had been invited to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage during that D&aacute;il term and they had hoped that this legislation would be passed.  As such, I am conscious of how much time has passed and how anxious everyone is to see this situation resolved.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the considerable work that was done by the committee during our pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>Deputies Ward and Cairns who are here are also members of the committee along with others.  This was the committee's first pre-legislative scrutiny.  It took a long time.  I sometimes wondered if we would ever get it all together, but we did.  It is refreshing that some of the committee's recommendations have been taken on board.  I hope I do not regret saying this but it is the first time I have engaged in a process where one can see the work being reflected back.  This shows that when that process is done correctly and respected in the way it should be it can result in good and strong legislation.  In all legislation, we should be listening to those who are affected by it or those who work in the area.  Consultation is always key.</p> <p> I acknowledge the role of the coroner and that jurisdiction is going to be maintained.  That is really important.  That came up time and again.  It was a key concern for people.  They were worried around potentially disallowing the powers of the coroner.  We all know that that was really important so I welcome that.  I would welcome some more information in regard to the 20 m rule.  The Minister might provide more detail on that in his closing remarks.  It is one of the issues about which since publication of the Bill we have been contacted by people.  They are concerned that this might mean that there cannot be an excavation in certain areas.  If may not mean that, but I would welcome more information on it.  Given how near the Tuam site is many residential areas, will there be any negative affect arising in that regard?  I would welcome more clarity and information on that.</p> <p> Another concern brought to our attention was the criteria for an intervention.  Some people are concerned that the criteria are still a little too rigid or strict.  As with all aspects to do with mother and baby institutions and as has been acknowledged by the Minister in the past, there is a fear and a distrust among people.  They are always thinking worst case scenario.  I do not blame them for thinking that way because that has been their treatment at the hands of the State for decades.  I would welcome some clarity in regard to the criteria and the 20 m rule.</p> <p> I noted in the Minister's speech a reference to the family members and the hierarchy, which also arose in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  The Minister mentioned that there will be an appeals mechanism.  I would welcome more information on how the Minister sees that playing out.  On the chair of the board being a former coroner or having coronial experience, that is vital.  It is really important that we have people who know all of the ins and outs and various pieces of this, that there is stakeholder engagement and that involved in that would be survivors and other people who are relevant to that process and the consultation with the family members.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill and I am glad to note that many of the committee's recommendations from the PLS have been taken on board.  I ask the Minister to address my concerns in regard to the criteria, the 20 m rule and, in particular, the criteria piece for other potential sites.  People are afraid that if they come forward with real information on a particular site they will be told they do not fit the criteria.  They are some of the fears.  It is important to relay them to the Minister.</p> <p> We welcome the Bill and we look forward to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

We support the introduction of this Bill primarily around that statutory basis and framework to authorise interventions at Tuam where manifestly inappropriate burials took place.</p><p>I have some concerns.  The Minister touched on some of them, but some more information would definitely be welcome, particularly in regard to other sites, the role and function of the agency director, the 20 m distance mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, and the definition of what constitutes a relative.  We know that children died in greater numbers in these homes at a much higher rate than was normal at the time.  We know that they died of malnutrition, neglect and severe mistreatment and that they were cruelly discarded in unconsecrated grounds, septic tanks and mass graves.  It is because we know this that the role of the coroner will be crucial in any and all investigations.  There can be very little doubt that what happened in Tuam could most likely have happened in other institutions throughout the country.  I have some reservations as to whether this legislation will sufficiently address those other sites.  They too also deserve to be thoroughly investigated.</p><p>I would like to read into the record a quote from email that I am sure the Minister also received this afternoon from Breda Murphy, the PRO of Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance.  She says: </p> <blockquote> 	The proposed legislation will outlive us to impact and dictate how we as a society/country treat our deceased who have not been afforded due rights at the time of death and subsequent burial or as in the case of Tuam, disposal of remains.  The report to State by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon focused on the rights of the deceased continuing after death; the rights to a dignified burial and the rights of family to know of how their deceased loved one lost their lives. </blockquote>  <p>As legislators, we have a responsibility to those who seek answers and pursue what is right that as technology and science advances we remain open to, when necessary, amend legislation to ensure it delivers that truth for those who seek it.  Fundamentally, people want to know the detail and the context in which their loved ones died and to ensure they have a proper and dignified burial.</p></speech>

The incarceration of girls and women and the forceable removal of their children is something we as a society carry to this day.  This generation must undo the wrong done to them and so not pass this loss and trauma to another generation.</p>  <p>  We support the introduction of this Bill.  There are some good provisions within it.  It shows what can be achieved when we work together in pre-legislative scrutiny.  My colleagues put a great deal of work into this under the chairmanship of Deputy Funchion.  It is really encouraging to see that so much of that work has been taken on board.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's speech.  There is still a bit too much vagueness in regard to the threshold sites will have to meet for thorough investigation, the precise role of the agency director, the distance requirement, the definition of what exactly constitutes a relative and the functions of the coroner.  Coroners have a vital role to play in our society, not least when it comes to institutional burial.  In north Kildare, we are blessed to have an outstanding coroner in Professor Denis Cusack.  His compassion and tenacity when advocating for the people who died during Covid-19 was to be admired.  I am concerned that in this Bill there is still a lack of clarity on the division of labour between the director and the coroner.  There is equally a lack of clarity on the circumstances in which the director will involve the coroner.  The coroner's involvement not being automatic or a given might be problematic not only for the families and relatives but for wider society given the weight and sensitivity and injustice of what is involved, what is being examined and what is supposedly being addressed in this Bill.</p>  <p>  Irish children died in these places at a rate higher than in the rest of society.  They died of neglect and hunger in their stomachs.  They also died of skin hunger, a condition that affects babies who are not held, cuddled or touched.  They died from lack of human affection.  Hungry in body and soul they were then, in the case of Tuam, abandoned in a septic tank.  This Bill must facilitate proper examination of all sites.  If it does not, it adds insult to the injury of the death of innocents.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that has gone into this Bill and I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the work of Catherine Corless.</p> <p>She has been a voice for those children and other groups.  What happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  This Bill is welcome and important.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to see some movement on this Bill.  It is welcome.</p>  <p>  The Minister and Deputy Funchion acknowledged the work that was done by the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Deputies Bacik and Cairns, who are members of the committee, are also present.  The role the committee played was collegial and we were all pushing in the same direction.  It is good that the Minister took many of the recommendations of the committee on board in the process of preparing the legislation.  I wish to particularly mention the Chair of the committee, Deputy Funchion, who steered us through a difficult and emotive journey.</p>  <p>  That said, I have a few concerns about the legislation, one of which relates to the role of the coroner.  That was one of the key issues in the discussions of the committee and for the advocate groups.  I welcome that the role of the coroner is now back in the process.  I recognise that the Minister has restored the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner.  That is important.  However, there is still some uncertainty around the role of the coroner.  This has already been said but I will say it again.  We know that children died in large numbers in these homes.  We know they died of malnutrition, neglect and severe mistreatment.  We know that babies were cruelly discarded in unconsecrated ground, septic tanks and mass graves.  However, we do not know if the role of the coroner in this Bill will be central to all investigations.  That is something we need to know.</p>  <p>  The test for interventions remains effectively the same as it was in the heads of the Bill.  While I accept that the legislation as currently drafted may adequately address the circumstances around Tuam, I have serious misgivings about whether the legislation will, in fact, sufficiently address other mother and baby home sites.  The criteria for intervention remain effectively the same as they were prior to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Despite positive reports in the media, particularly relating to Tuam, survivors who have contacted me and advocates, and no doubt the Minister too, are apprehensive that the make-up of this legislation suggests that the director of authorised intervention will only investigate or exhume bodies if they are accessible and not within 20 m of a dwelling.  That could be hugely problematic.  We need to be genuine about pursuing a programme of restorative justice.  We need more information on how the Minister thinks the 20 m rule and the role of the agency, in conjunction with the coroner, will work.  Have all possible scenarios been worked out and legislated for?</p>  <p>  The role and purpose of memorials at certain sites is still unclear.  There is an indication that the new director could choose the memorialisation of certain sites over thorough investigation or exhumation.  Will the new director be able to choose the option of memorialisation for certain sites?  If the director can do that, what is the justification and what are the criteria set down for such a decision?</p>  <p>  I thank all the witnesses and groups who sat before the committee and engaged with the process.  I also thank every individual who has contacted me on a personal basis for informing me and telling me their very personal stories about this emotive issue.</p></speech>

The is a fairly in-depth Bill.  I thank everyone who was involved in this process.  I have spoken in the Chamber many times.  Sometimes we can work together and achieve great things.  We are going in the right direction but, unfortunately, what happened in the past has brought us to where we are now.</p>  <p>  Nearly 30 years ago, I worked with my dad.  We worked on headstones, dug graves and whatever else.  I remember exhuming 92 people from a convent graveyard a number of years ago.  I know how sensitive it is for the relatives of those being exhumed.  I know how strict it is.  I also know how the county manager, county council, coroners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na get involved.  It is an in-depth process.</p>  <p>  I am not here to knock the Bill.  I genuinely believe we are going in the right direction.  There is a sense of fear among the public but to be honest, who could blame them?  That fear factor dates back generations, which is why we are having this discussion.  I am familiar with the situation in Tuam and, especially, the situation in Bessborough in Cork.  Every year, we go down there to meet survivors and listen to their stories.  Unfortunately, the numbers are getting smaller each year.  It is harrowing to hear those stories.  All Deputies have heard personal stories.</p>  <p>  I welcome the removal of the pilot programme because many concerns were raised about it.  Balancing privacy rights and the public interest is very difficult.  I am sure the legislation can be tweaked again in that regard.</p>  <p>  The information campaign could be an asset.  As can happen in any Department, if the public is left without proper information, the truth can get lost, the process can be broken and the fear factor can return.  That fear then turns to suspicion and we are left in a position where nobody works with anybody else because of fear and suspicion.  We do not want that.  We need to push forward.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the survivors and family members watching this debate.  Sometimes politics can be left at the door and we can work together collectively.  As I have said before, we are legislators.  We are servers of the people and we are supposed to work for them and their betterment.  Sometimes we have to put down the hatchet and sit around the table to work together collectively to do the right thing.</p>  <p>  I thank everybody who was involved in this process.  This has been going on for a very long time.  I congratulate all parties because we have done the right thing.  Working together, it is possible at times to get things right.  I will be watching the progress of the Bill.  As I said, this is a happy day but also a sad day.  We are discussing the past and what happened but, on the other hand, it is nice to be able to say that while the legislation might not be perfect yet, we are moving in the right direction.  It is going to give solace and closure to the people affected.  I hope this country will learn from the mistakes of the past and we will never have to see these things again.</p></speech>

We are seeing the deaths of children and civilians.  That makes us all reflect on the importance and privilege of being able to debate legislation in a debating chamber in a parliament in a peaceful democratic republic.  We must all reassert the true value of democracy.  The war in Ukraine reminds us all not to take that for granted.  I wanted to preface my remarks with that.  I know that feeling is shared across the House.  I did not get to speak in the debate on Ukraine last night but I will be speaking later in the debate on Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will express that view again.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, spoke passionately in support of, and in solidarity with, the people of Ukraine in the debate last night, as did many others in a genuinely cross-party manner.  I acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill and to express our support for it.  I express the sincere sympathies of the Labour Party and my colleagues to the survivors of Tuam and other mother and baby homes, and their families.  I also pay tribute to the tireless work of Ms Catherine Corless who did so much to uncover the fact and true extent of the burials at Tuam.  Her work has been crucial to the development of our knowledge on this issue.</p> <p> Like other speakers, I have had immense levels of correspondence from constituents and survivors, who have been so courageous as to get in touch with us to share their personal stories and those of their families.  I thank them for this because it really does enrich our knowledge and understanding as legislators when we come to look at Bills in this area.  We legislators must, therefore, do right by survivors by ensuring the swift passage of legislation to address the outstanding issues that remain following the scandalous treatment of women and children in mother and baby homes throughout the 20th century, until as recently as the late 1990s.</p> <p> I recognise the Minister's commitment to bringing this legislation forward swiftly.  I also acknowledge the immense work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, led by Deputy Funchion.  I have been fortunate to work with her and colleagues on the committee in recent months.  Indeed, we are engaging later this evening on amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.  A great deal of work has been done by committee members, including Deputy Cairns and others, on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill before us today.  I thank my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, who was our representative on the committee for that process.  I acknowledge that the Minister, as he said, has made changes to the Bill in the light of some of the recommendations made by the committee.  That is very important and welcome.</p> <p> The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis to enable some closure, finally, for survivors and the families of the children and babies who are buried at Tuam.  Much of the Bill is technical, the aim being to create the statutory framework to enable exhumation and excavation to take place.  The need for legislation was made clear upon publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters.  On Tuam, we might reflect that the commission found there were 978 child deaths, 80% of them of children under a year old and 67% involving infants aged between one and six months.  These are horrendous figures.  We know the worst years were 1943 to 1947, when many of those deaths took place.  It is very difficult to fathom the scale of what happened when we read the figures in the report but it becomes clearer when we think of each of those human stories and the impact on the mothers and families.</p> <p> When the report was published, there was unity in this House in calling for its recommendations to be given effect as quickly as possible.  I am conscious that many of those who have contacted us are older persons who are worried they may not be alive to see the culmination of the legislative process.  It is important that we deal swiftly not only with this Bill but also the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which, as I said, we are debating in committee later, and with establishing the new redress scheme.  I look forward to working constructively with the Minister and on a cross-party basis to ensure this key package of legislative measures is brought into place as swiftly as possible, albeit that we need to ensure the proposals are given adequate legislative scrutiny.</p> <p> I welcome the Minister's response to the report of the children's committee and the changes made as a result, including the removal of restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner and the alignment of the forensic investigative process with international standards.  There are still some concerns being expressed to us by survivors that the language of the Bill may mean there are unnecessary limits placed on the coroner.  It would be good to hear more about how that is being addressed in the Bill.</p> <p> Another positive development is the expansion of the survivor engagement provisions.  I very much welcome the expansion of family participation in DNA identification in particular.  We need to ensure such engagement is not just expanded through legislative provision but also through the processes that are put in place.  The Minister has spoken about the public information campaign, which is very welcome, but we need more detail about it and about mechanisms for the involvement and engagement of survivors and families.  As we all would acknowledge, there have been some unfortunate breaches of trust with survivors, such as the manner in which details of the commission's report were leaked, for example, and the initial inadequacy of communications with survivors who did not or do not have access to IT.  There also were issues around misrepresentations of testimony in the report.  All of these issues can and should be addressed.  The public information campaign is a very welcome measure in the Bill because it will provide a better framework for consultation and involvement of stakeholders and survivors.</p> <p> We know a large number of people are affected by the issues dealt with in the Bill.  A total of 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children passed through the mother and baby homes under investigation by the commission.  Thousands more were resident in other institutions outside its terms of reference.  We have spoken before in this Chamber about the shocking mortality rate for babies, not just at Tuam but also in the other institutions.  It is shocking indeed that one in seven, or 15%, of babies, numbering 9,000, died before their first birthday in the homes covered by the report.  Within the confidential committee section of the report, we learned of the true extent of abuse suffered by survivors, the widespread practice of forced labour and the extensive practice of coerced or forced adoption.  We will be debating some of those issues at the committee this evening.</p> <p> In this regard, I note the powerful contribution of Carmel Cantwell, who spoke to Brian O'Connell on the "Today with Claire Byrne" show yesterday about her experience.  They discussed a map dating from the early 1950s that labelled a site in the Bessborough home as a children's burial site.  That is worth mentioning because this Bill, as the Minister said, has import beyond Tuam, albeit the latter is the main focus.  We are all very conscious of some of the revelations about Bessborough as well.  This map labelled a particular site as a burial site but, listening to those who appeared on the show, it appears there was no physical or documentary evidence of burials at the site.  This sort of discrepancy is very upsetting and concerning for families, who naturally will wonder what it means when there is a burial site marked on a map.  It is the sort of issue that was taken up so powerfully by Catherine Corless.  In her appearance on the programme, Ms Cantwell spoke about her brother, William, who died and was labelled as an unclaimed baby, despite this not reflecting the reality of their experience.  This very powerful interview gave a name to, and identifying details about, just one of the babies who apparently died at Bessborough.  As I said, when we look at figures, we can sometimes forget the individual, human stories behind them.</p> <p> On the survivor engagement point, we are hearing from survivors and those affected, such as Ms Cantwell, that the voices of the mothers who went through the homes must be at the forefront and that all facets of the State response must be survivor-led.  Is it possible to broaden the parameters of qualifying family members in the legislation to ensure they are as inclusive as possible, in recognition of the complexities of families, particularly in the context of how much time has elapsed since many of these deaths took place?  I am conscious that we are all being contacted not only by people who were residents in homes but also those who may be cousins of babies buried there, for instance, or who know, through family folklore or history, that this happened.  They should be brought within the scope of the legislation.</p> <p> It is sensible that the Bill reflects the period examined by the commission but we are all conscious that there are concerns remaining about the exclusion of some survivors from the proposed redress scheme because they were incarcerated in institutions outside the remit of the commission institutions, such as Temple Hill, Westbank, St. Anne's, Cork, Mount St. Joseph's and others.  We also know there are issues around qualifying criteria in the redress scheme, which we will debate in due course when the legislation is brought forward  Again, I ask the Minister to consider broadening the scope of persons covered by that legislation.  Indeed, I wrote to him last month to ask that he revisit the matter.</p> <p> I am very glad to hear this Bill will not prevent future inquests or investigations into deaths at Tuam.  While it is important that the primary focus of the Bill should be to give closure to families and reunite them, it is also important that we are careful not to repeat mistakes of the past, whereby survivors and families have felt re-traumatised when legislation has had the consequence of preventing them from seeking further justice or speaking out about the awful abuse they faced.  I have in mind the residential institutions redress scheme, for instance, where that sort of gagging clause became very contentious and difficult for many survivors.</p> <p> There are a number of other concerns about the legislation, which we may address further on Committee Stage.  Advocates have lamented the retention of the controversial provision empowering Ministers unilaterally to decide whether a site is to be exhumed and investigated or if it will be subject solely to a process of memorialisation.  There are differing views among families and survivors about different sites and which is the most appropriate process.  The key issue is to ensure adequate communication with the families affected to avoid further distress to the many people who may be seeking different outcomes from legislative interventions on these sites.  I would like to hear from the Minister about that difference between those who might prefer simply to see a site memorialised and those who wish to see it fully exhumed and excavated.  These are difficult questions to address.</p> <p>I would like to raise a specific question brought to me by the Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative, which notes that the redrafted Bill refers to institutional burial grounds and the definition of &quot;institution&quot; within section 2 relates to premises occupied by women or children or both.  The Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative is asking whether this will cover illegal exhumations and reburials of women from institutions, which is another key point because we know that there may be scenarios that have, as yet, remained uncovered and that may need to be covered by this legislation.  We are all conscious that Catherine Corless's tireless work uncovered so much that had been unknown or only guessed at previously and that there may still be further revelations to come.  Without the key role that she played and that other historians and archaeologists have played, we would not know, for example, about reported burials in Bessborough or the horrendous mass grave uncovered at Tuam.<br/><br/>I want to again acknowledge Catherine Corless&rsquo;s work and the work of other historians.  In particular, I want to acknowledge Catherine Corless.  Her work in taking out the death certificates of each of the 796 children who died at the Tuam mother and baby home gave rise to such a powerful sense of outrage at this evidence beyond doubt of a culture in which institutional and structural abuse of women and children was widespread throughout the country.  The State owes her a great debt of gratitude.  The Minister rightly said that what happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience and people like Catherine Corless have been so important in uncovering those stains.  Throughout the past decades there are those who have shown incredible strength, resilience and determination in telling their stories.  They have faced up to a powerful State and church that have been happy to maintain the <i>status quo</i>and culture of silence that we have often spoken about.  I reiterate my gratitude and that of my Labour Party colleagues to those activists.  I look forward to further debate on this Bill on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I do not want to make this religious but I am acutely aware of the suffering that the families of the victims of those who have been buried have endured over the decades and that they still endure.  The Minister acknowledged that and he understands it and we need to put that to an end as quickly as possible, while also recognising the suffering of the babies who were neglected and the babies who suffered at the hands of the State and the religious institutions.  It must never happen again.</p>  <p>  Above anything else, I want to acknowledge Catherine Corless and to express my deep gratitude to her for doing what she has done, for being Catherine Corless and for being the tenacious person she is.  She is dedicated to justice and to getting justice for victims and families and without her, none of us would be standing here today.  I also want to acknowledge all those who have contacted me and other Deputies individually and I acknowledge the families who have shared their stories with me.  It is probably one of the most humbling experiences I have had as a politician.  I want to acknowledge Sheila outside the gate, who many of us will know here from speaking to here every time she is here.  She was out there in the rain today and she has suffered and tried to get the stories of victims across.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill and we have an opportunity here to do the right thing.  There are lots of good things in this Bill and I thank the Minister for that.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Funchion, for the work she has done on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in in the committee.  Everybody has worked together to make this legislation what it needs to be.  The families need to be front and centre of it and some of them have concerns.  Some of those concerns have been addressed in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution earlier on and I thank him for that but there are still some things outstanding such as the 20 m rule that was acknowledged.  The Minster will understand that Bills can be legalistic and that they have to be written in a certain way.  We need to make every effort to explain every line of the Bill.  Some will be concerned at the number of times the word "may" is used in the Bill.  Trust needs to be built up again and we need to listen to families at this point and whatever amendments need to be put in must be put in.  One person who contacted me said that as this is the legislation that will be there for generations to come, we need to make sure that the families, victims and survivors are front and centre of all of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-02a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="14:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030200037#RR00300"><p>I want to acknowledge that today will be another difficult day for the survivors of mother and baby homes and other institutional systems.  This is an extremely sensitive topic, which unfortunately is compounded by the timing of this session on the same day the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will discuss the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.</p><p>Chrissie Tully, now 90 years old, recently described how as an 18-year-old, she was incarcerated in the Tuam mother and baby home and her son, Michael was stillborn.  He was immediately taken away from her in the Central Hospital in Galway and Chrissie believes he is in the Tuam site.  She is rightly angry and confused as to why this law is necessary.  She said:</p> <blockquote> 	Legislation?  For what?  To open a grave full of dead babies?  I never heard such nonsense.  They don&rsquo;t want to open the grave, that&rsquo;s the truth.  ...  Where are the children?  Where is my son?  We&rsquo;ve looked and looked.  It&rsquo;s like he never existed. ... What did they think the babies were?  Would they like that done to their own?  My son could be in the tank, he could be but we don&rsquo;t know because they won&rsquo;t open the thing.  What&rsquo;s the delay? </blockquote>  <p>I have to agree with her and with her son, who I spoke to this week.  I still cannot understand why we need this legislation.  Why has the coroner not investigated known mass graves?  Why has the Garda not investigated the thousands of recorded unnatural deaths in mother and baby homes and other institutions?  This Bill comes after years of inaction and the refusal of the State and successive Governments to acknowledge existing laws and to provide justice.  For example, we have the Coroners Act 1962, in which coroners are obliged to act if remains are found in their district or if somebody dies in State care or custody.  This Bill goes some way to addressing these issues but it is still not aligned with transitional justice and international human rights standards.</p><p>The legacy of the Irish State's institutional past impacts individuals and families every day.  Abuse, violations, and crimes continue to have real effects on people.  Trauma, unrecognised injustice and stolen identities are living issues for thousands of people.  This legacy is also embedded in the landscape in places where some of the worst crimes perpetrated by or facilitated by the State, often in conjunction with religious orders, occurred.  Former mother and baby homes, county homes, industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions have a deeply troubled past which we must come to terms with.  Not only were these sites of incarceration, abuse and violence but they are also where people died in suspicious and unlawful circumstances.  The scale and horror of Tuam forced action on this issue.  The callous and criminal disposal of the remains of babies and children is still overwhelming.  Even more disturbing is the reality that Tuam was not an isolated case.  It is most likely the most severe example but we know of similar practices in other institutions.  The State is compelled to act and Irish society needs a transitional justice approach to respond to the scale of this issue.  Part of the process will be the challenging and painful excavation of known and suspected burial sites.  We have a social and emotional aversion to disturbing burial grounds.  However, the babies, children and adults who died in these institutions deserve graves, justice and to truly rest in peace.  There is an obligation to investigate any and all deaths or inappropriate burials.</p><p>Although it is hard to understand why we need this legislation in the first place as I said, I welcome this Bill as hopefully and finally presenting a mechanism to respectfully respond to our cruel past.  I also want to recognise the work of the committee and its Chair, Deputy Funchion, and I recognise the work of the Minister in taking on board some recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Some of the issues identified then have been addressed and the entire membership of the committee is grateful for that.  I was especially relieved to see the removal of the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, the strengthening of the role of the director and the expansion of the identification programme.</p> <p>The care and attention given to this Bill by the committee contrasts with the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which we will discuss in committee later.  Similarly, there still are several significant deficiencies in the Bill which the Minister needs to fix. <br/><br/>It must offer a robust and determined framework to provide justice without political or official interference.  The State needs to ensure we effectively investigate unlawful or suspicious deaths, as well as allegations of torture or ill-treatment.  The &quot;Director of Authorised Intervention&quot;, as the new office is referred to in the Bill, must have the capacity and certainty to be able to intervene for all victims and survivors.  It also must be able to support survivors and families in providing information about the disappearance, the fate of the disappeared person and the progress and results of any investigation.<br/><br/>My first and major concern is about the requirement to establish a separate director and office to intervene in each site, rather than establishing a standing body which has the capacity to examine any known or potential site.<br/><br/>On one level, this is a nonsensical approach.  It is like setting up a separate police force for each individual crime, instead of a one for all crimes.  A well-resourced office could build up knowledge and expertise in dealing with these highly sensitive matters.  It could foster relationships with all stakeholders, especially survivors and family members.  This would be more effective and reassuring for those affected.  However, even more worrying is that this is a bureaucratic barrier.  The Bill permits the Government, if a location meets a set of criteria, to set up an investigation of the site.  This means that survivors, families, and campaigners will now be forced to advocate for interventions at known or suspected sites.  Once again, the responsibility is being put back on survivors to ask for and seek justice.<br/><br/>It is safe to say there is no doubt that the Tuam site will be examined.  It has to be.  The national outrage and international headlines that forced the Government to act in 2014 have guaranteed that.  What about the many other sites throughout the country?  How many of those will be deemed eligible?<br/><br/>To quote from the Bill, &quot;the Government may, from time to time, having considered a proposal made by a relevant Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by order&quot; and in this context, &quot;may&quot; is the crucial word, as &quot;shall&quot; is the legislative language for something that will happen whereas &quot;may&quot; means it might happen.  With everything we know about the horrors and abuse that happened in these institutions, the public outcries and the glaring need for truth and justice for survivors, the best the Government can say is that we might, in the future, do something about these mass infant graves.  We might.<br/><br/>Perhaps even more restrictive is the line, &quot;with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&quot;.  Here is the cold, cruel reality of this Bill.  It is about money, not justice.  Any intervention at a site must legally get the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This hurdle is deeply troubling, given the Department&rsquo;s position on the mother and baby homes redress scheme.<br/><br/>One of the major defects of the Government's proposed scheme is the highly insulting requirement for individuals to have spent at least six months as a child in a mother and baby home.  Recent revelations show that officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were central to this cruel stipulation.  They were concerned with this precedent having &quot;far-reaching policy and financial consequences&quot;, that is, giving redress to the survivors of the worst forms of human rights abuses may see other survivors seeking redress.  That is not to mention the fact that they also think somebody should potentially get &euro;5,000 for something like a forced family separation, when we all know one could get more for slipping on a pavement.  Money is their main concern, not justice.<br/><br/>Then, they delayed the progress of the scheme.  This is the Department that will now be given a veto on interventions at each and every site.  Transitional justice or an obligation for truth are clearly not priorities for them.  Survivors and campaigners have been scarred enough through interactions with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and other Departments and bodies and now they will be obliged to jump through hoops for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well.<br/><br/>Given all we know about mother and baby homes, illegal adoptions, other institutions and the treatment of survivors, the need for a separate office for each site is an intentional barrier that is contrary to transitional justice and human rights standards.  Unfortunately, the Minister, so far, seems unwilling to acknowledge this point.  The need to act on Tuam is pressing and highly necessary but this Bill will result in very few other sites being examined and it is hard to believe that is not its intention.  I ask the Minister to give all survivors and their relatives the certainty of a standing independent office which has the capacity and commitment to intervene.<br/><br/>There are still too many conditions and restrictions.  This is another barrier.  The committee&rsquo;s report focused strongly on enabling as many sites as possible to be included in the legislation and for the capacity of a State agency to examine these sites.  We warned that a high volume of conditions and restrictions may prohibit the Government from acting to facilitate exhumations, examinations, identification and investigation.  Unfortunately, this is very much the case with the current Bill.  At all stages, the Bill should be orientated to facilitate survivors and their relatives.  It should work in their favour to address historical and living injustices.  Whether the people affected want an intervention at a site is a separate issue, but they should all be entitled to that option.<br/><br/>The most obvious restriction is that the register of manifestly inappropriate burials is still the primary criterion, while there is not the same emphasis on suspicious or unlawful deaths.  The committee recommended that interventions at sites should give due consideration to suspicious or unlawful deaths, as well as the existence of inappropriate burials.  We also recommended that the Bill include any burial site where the circumstances surrounding the death or body disposal method or both warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness.  These elements are not properly present in the Bill.  Human rights experts and those advocating a transitional justice model pushed strongly for these criteria.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has strongly highlighted the State&rsquo;s obligation to effectively investigate unlawful or suspicious deaths, as well as allegations of torture or ill-treatment.  There needs to be a clear prioritisation of action because of suspicious or unlawful deaths, alongside what the Bill calls, &quot;manifestly inappropriate burials&quot;.<br/><br/>Section 8 also contains restrictions on when an intervention can apply.  The inclusion of the need to respect the views of the relatives of persons buried in the land is an important aspect which featured prominently in the committee discussion.  It gives recognition of their role in the process.  However, other restrictions are too vague and unnecessary, to the extent that they seem like intentional barriers.  The provision regarding the &quot;social and economic interests of the State&quot; is the clearest example.  What does it mean and what possible measure could be used to objectively measure that?<br/><br/>Economic interest means money, again.  An intervention could be refused because of potential cost or the budget situation in any given year.  This is an ambiguous and relational standard; one that is not compliant with human rights and transitional justice and has no place in law.  The history of injustice surrounding this issue, and the refusal of state bodies to engage with survivors, give them basic information or recognise their rights at all combine to indicate that these criteria can and will be used to refuse interventions.  It is also worth noting that this would be the State&rsquo;s social and economic interest, not the people&rsquo;s, and certainly not the survivors.  The inclusion of &quot;public health&quot; is another ambiguous criterion and is ironic given our chronic underinvestment in that area.  Similarly, archaeological features, which are regularly paved over for infrastructure projects, are being elevated in significance to prevent examinations of sites.  Are we serious with these restrictions?  An investigation and evacuation of a mass grave may be refused because it is near a standing stone.  If this was not such a serious topic, it would be comical.<br/><br/>The Minister has to recognise these features for what they are; barriers.  Outside of providing for the views of relatives and the dignity of the deceased, section 8(3) has to go.  This Bill has to be about facilitating interventions, not putting more barriers in place for a group of people who have suffered oppression and injustice for all of their lives.  The committee&rsquo;s first recommendation is very clear.  It states:</p><blockquote>	The focus of the Bill should be on victims and survivors and their rights.  The Bill should not limit the extent to which the various sites can be investigated. </blockquote> <p>Currently, the Bill does not do this.  There are multiple interconnected and reinforcing limitations.<br/><br/>The next point concerns a contradictory element in the Bill concerning justice for people who died in violent or unnatural circumstances.  The Bill requires the director to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner if a body is discovered with evidence of death in violent or unnatural circumstances.</p> <p>This evidence can be assessed only if an intervention occurs, however.  I outlined multiple obstacles in the Bill that will vastly restrict the number of examinations</p> <p> There is documentary evidence of thousands of deaths in State-run or State-funded institutions.  However, because the Bill does not allow for interventions based on unlawful or suspicious deaths, the majority of these crimes, of which we are all aware, may never be investigated.   State and religious bodies are being protected by this contradiction while survivors and their relatives continue to live with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones.</p> <p> While I welcome the changes that remove the exclusion of the coroner in this process, we need a more proactive approach to include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and coroners in examining known mass graves.  The committee found that there was enough evidence from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes to trigger coronial investigations into how individuals in institutions died.  I have no sense that this is happening or that this Bill will encourage this action on the scale required to deal with the volume of sites around the country.  I am deeply concerned this Bill will fail to provide justice for so many families.</p> <p> The complex issue of contested intervention is highly sensitive.  Survivors, relatives and the wider community will have mixed feelings about disturbing burial grounds or even inappropriate ones; the resting places of victims of Ireland's cruel institutional past.  We have a responsibility to be respectful and precise in discussing this.   At the committee, fears were being whipped up around forcible excavations of angel plots, which is untrue and unhelpful.</p> <p> The specific mention of respecting relatives&rsquo; views is important. The mechanisms to achieve this will, however, need to be very finely tuned to engage affected people respectfully to balance and weigh up different perspectives and ensure justice for the deceased.  It is a deeply complicated issue that was the subject of extensive discussion at committee and, to be fair, we passed on responsibility to the Minister.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It is morally dense and emotionally fraught but the Minister has responsibility in this area.</p> <p> We have sites where some survivors and relatives want memorialisation rather than intervention.  Simultaneously, other survivors want examination to know if their loved one is buried there and larger principles of transitional justice must be considered.  There is no perfect outcome in these situations.  Nonetheless, we need transparent and accessible mechanisms, which are as equitable as possible, to accommodate deeply held but potentially conflicting views.</p> <p> The Bill needs a stronger articulation of the principles underlying this process.  While the Bill recognises these decisions, there is no architecture for it to occur.  How will these decisions be reached?  Who will make them?  What systems will be available to people?  Whose voice counts?  How will a relative be defined in this context?  This is an incredibly important point and there are still too many uncertainties.  The Bill needs to include these elements to avoid potential upset, conflict and even litigation.</p> <p> Finally, I acknowledge the progress made in improving the Bill.  There is clear evidence of the Minister listening to the submissions from different witnesses who shared their experiences with the committee.  There is still more work to be done, however.  This Bill currently has too many restrictions on survivors and relatives being able to seek interventions.  It has ambiguous terms and ill-defined processes to engage with affected people and balance differences.  It does not have a basis in transitional justice.</p> <p> Mother and baby homes, industrial schools and other institutions are the most horrific parts of Ireland&rsquo;s recent past.  They mark some of the worst crimes committed by agents of the State and religious orders.  The buried remains of victims are one of the most tangible and raw aspects of this history.  Across the country, there is a dark geography of mass unmarked graves.  It is essential to respond to that awful past.  It is part of the process of acknowledging abuse and violations of girls, women, victims of rape, disabled people, people who were illegally adopted and so many more.  There is a clear and crucial focus on Tuam.  That cannot detract from the many other sites and survivors.  Every one of them deserves justice and needs this Bill to guarantee that justice.</p></speech>

Before I continue, I acknowledge how engaged the Minister and his staff have been.  He listened to families, survivors and the wider community and made changes in this legislation that were recommended to him.</p>  <p>  We had a very lengthy process at committee but it was good that we did so.  The Chairman, Deputy Funchion, and committee members from all parties worked extremely hard.  We were honoured to listen to the stories we heard and we were all affected by them .  There is no question about it.  I know that when we left that particular committee, we went home and thought back on what happened, and it was very hard.  It is important today that we have really listened to the voices of the survivors.</p>  <p>  We have waited a long time for this legislation and now it is vital that we see it pass.  Relatives are ageing.  That is putting it bluntly, but they are.  The babies in Tuam particularly have already been left too long.  The site at Tuam is complicated; probably one of the most complicated in Europe.  The Minister&rsquo;s introduction into this Bill of intervention to be carried out by professionals, in line with international standards and best practice so as to maximise what is scientifically achievable with regard to the identification and return of remains, gives us the best chance of reunification.</p>  <p>  We must see this Bill pass quickly and enacted so we can begin the process.  We need this lawful basis for a forensic excavation, recovery and analysis of remains at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam, undertaken to international standards.  We will need this at other sites too and this Bill will allow that.</p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made to the legislation since the general scheme was published to ensure it does not restrict any further investigations elsewhere.  This is so important.  I raised my concerns regarding the restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner in the general scheme.  I am glad to have seen it removed entirely.  That is important.  The Bill will now require forensic excavation, recovery and analysis of remains to support, where possible, establishing circumstances and cause of death.  This was a chief concern for many witnesses who appeared before committee.</p>  <p>  This Bill will allow DNA-based identification to be undertaken to reunite families with the remains of their loved ones.  While this is complicated, broadening the contributors who can actually come forward to grandparents and aunts is really welcome.  A parent or a sibling can still request that only first-order relatives can be considered but the director can assess these requests now and make a decision so that the children have the best possible chance of having a dignified burial, service and resting place with the family that was denied to them when they died.  That is so important.</p>  <p>  We all know the excavation, recovery and identification process will be extremely complex because of the numbers, the ages of the children, the manner in which the remains lay and, of course, the passage of time.  This legislation allows that to happen for those babies, however.  I will support this wholeheartedly for the families, the communities who mourned them and this country to begin making amends.</p>  <p>  Again, I am honoured to have been part of that committee.  This has to happen really quickly.  As I said, people are ageing and they need to know.  It is important now that they know we have been listening to them.  I thank the Minister.  This has been very hard for all of us.  We are moving to a good place where we can now give people the answers for which they have been looking.</p></speech>

I will quote the Minister, who said, "What happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience."  That is what happened at Tuam and in all the various mother and baby homes with the incarceration and treatment of women and children.  At Bessborough, Sean Ross Abbey and in all the various institutions, the State failed to look after its citizens, from the youngest to the oldest.</p> <p> We all welcome this legislation, which is not before its time.  It must be accepted that a huge amount of due diligence has been done by the committee and Deputy Funchion.  We need to make sure in the future that if any difficulties or anomalies arise, we get over them.  It is vital that we would not in any way put through legislation that could impede.  We want to exhume the remains of the children who were tragically lost in Tuam and elsewhere.  That is necessary for them and for their families.</p> <p> We have all met with people who have been directly impacted.  There is a time constraint on us because many of these people are very old.  We need not only to be seen to do justice; we have to offer them the justice that they have not received for a significant part of their lives.</p> <p> I acknowledge the work that has been done by Catherine Corless and others in highlighting this issue.  We might not be in the place that we are if it was not for their efforts.  I welcome the interaction with the Minister, particularly in terms of the key recommendation not to remove the jurisdiction of the Coroners Act.  All of these things are vital.  There is still work to be done around the 20 m criteria.  We need to ensure like that this does not become an obstacle.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister will personally ensure that whatever piece of due diligence needs to be done is done.  This will ensure that this legislation is fit for purpose and that we can have justice for those people who have been failed so badly by this State.  I have no doubt that there will be full support across this House in doing this.  Justice is better served late than never.</p></speech>

They were very detailed.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to them.</p>  <p>  On their way in here, I am sure most Deputies will have noticed that, yet again, Sheila is outside the gates with her display on the mother and baby homes and the suffering that went on.  In that, she mentions the 9,000 children who are alleged to have died across the 18 homes.  Sean Ross Abbey is mentioned, as are Bessborough, Castlepollard, Dunboyne and more.  This reminded me of what happened about year ago when I watched a very interesting documentary on Al Jazeera.  It showed aerial archaeology of Castlepollard and, around it, what are suspected to be graves.  Whatever comes out of all of this, as well as from the legislation and the complications around it, we cannot just stop at Tuam.</p>  <p>  I want to begin by acknowledging that the Minister listened to the campaigners and the relatives in respect of the Tuam case.  Catherine Corless has said that the Minister has taken on board issues that she and the campaigners had with the original draft of the Bill.  I welcome that.  I specifically refer to issues around the disapplication of the Coroners Act to those sites.  To listen to and involve relatives in the process of the exhumation of remains and the identification of those remains has been hugely important.</p>  <p>  I also want to quickly raise a couple of issues that were brought to my attention today from the Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative.  They have concerns regarding the Bill.  They say that the Minister has retained a highly controversial provision that empowers Ministers to unilaterally decide whether a site is to be exhumed and investigated or subject to a process of memorialisation.  It also says the proposal of advisory panel is unambitious and it severely limits the input and guidance for so many survivors and their representative groups.  Notwithstanding these concerns, it is important to acknowledge that the Bill is much changed from the original version.  Legislation that continues to ignore the wishes and views of those who were directly involved in this terrible travesty in our history cannot proceed.  It is good that the Minister has listened to survivors and their campaigners on this.  However, I hope this also shows that if there is a political will to respond to witnesses and to those who are affected, we can also bring it into other aspects of legislation around the mother and baby homes and their legacy.  This is because we have acknowledged, in relation to this specific Bill, that there are serious questions on the wider issues connected with Tuam and other sites in the context of the loss of all these children, and their mothers and what happened to them.</p>  <p>  The first issue I want to mention is the redress scheme and the attempt to place a time limit on it to those who can access it.  There is an idea that those who spent less than six months in mother and baby homes should not be able to access the scheme.  The Minister should listen to campaigners on this issue, as he has done in respect of the specifics of the Bill.  It is certain that trauma and lifelong effects follow all of those who were in these homes for less than six months.  That choice is an arbitrary and unscientific limit without any justification, either morally, ethically or legally.</p>  <p>  The second issue is the predicted cost of the redress scheme.  According to a report, a redress scheme covering all 58,000 survivors of mother and baby homes would cost &euro;1.6 billion - civil servants are alleged to have warned the Government that this will be the case - and could derail attempts to support the survivors who are most in need.  Let us be clear about this.  I really want to emphasise what I am about to say.  Many of the institutions and orders that operated these homes possess enormous assets and lands.  Others have built medical and hospital facilities - empires, really - on the graves of those infants.  Again, if we have the political will, we can and should seize the assets of those orders and whatever remains of the legal entities that they have evolved into.  We cannot repeat the disaster of the Woods deal whereby a subservient State and political class allowed the church and its institutions to put a figure on what it agreed to donate to the redress scheme relating to the torture and abuse of children in this country over decades.  Those in the church were allowed to manipulate and drag their heels for years.  They are still allowed to do so.</p>  <p>  I the Minister to show the political will to deal with the gaping wound that the commission's report has inflicted on the people who have been affected by this entire episode of our history.  Let us be clear that the findings detailed in the commission report are not acceptable to many victims and survivors, full stop.  This is not even to speak of a political level by Deputies and Senators, but of the people who are mostly affected.  Several witnesses who testified to the commission found that excerpts from their evidence were taken out of the report.  The report also contains inaccuracies, misrepresentations, etc.  We all know how seriously damaging it was.  We know that 9,000 children died in the homes that are under investigation.  It is stated in the report that the commission found little evidence relating to issues such as forced adoptions, abuse and involuntary detention.  Survivors have told us that the commission's findings flatly ignored and contradicted their personal testimonies.  That cannot be allowed to stand.  Moreover, it is not acceptable that a State-appointed commission should leave on the record the findings that institutions and religious orders were no more culpable for the torture and deaths in these homes than general society was.  The attempt to lessen the responsibility of those directly responsible by referencing societal views is and remains the most egregious aspect of the report.  We need to see a political will in this House to address and correct that.  The attempt to absolve the sins of religious orders by blaming us all is further abuse of the victims.  I will conclude by asking the Minister to show the same political will in addressing those issues as he has done in addressing the Tuam issue in the details of the Bill before us.</p></speech>

I was about to say that this a painful part of our past but it is not.  For many people, this is a painful part of their present.  It is likely to be a painful part of their future too.  I hope that this Bill can help to ease that pain.  Perhaps it will not be a painful part of their future, because this Bill will enable us to get truth.  From truth we can get justice.  From justice we can hopefully bring some healing.  Ultimately, it is essential that we do that in order to help heal the scars and the wounds that have been caused by the horrific actions and the horrible things that happened to mothers and their children in these homes.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  I will return to specific aspects of it.  I thank also Deputy Funchion, as Chair of the committee, for leading our pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill was one of the first big items of pre-legislative scrutiny we took on as a committee.  We found a way to work together and I thank her for herding the cats on the committee and making it work.  When we started the pre-legislative scrutiny, there was a sense that the Bill was simply about providing dignified burials, which had been denied, for the children who were lost and had been buried in sites such as that in Tuam.  Survivors wanted and needed more, however, and they came before our committee and said that.  We started looking for this in our pre-legislative scrutiny, as is detailed in the committee's report, and I am glad to say much of that has made it into the Bill.  That has made the Bill stronger and it makes our hope for truth, justice and, ultimately, healing more likely to be achieved.</p> <p> I note the involvement with the Minister of Dr. Niamh McCullagh.  Dr. McCullagh possesses particular expertise.  It is important that any exhumation be conducted in accordance with international best practice, that is, the high forensic standard that allows us to understand the truth of what happened, from which we can foster justice and healing.  Including in the Bill assurances regarding international best practice and that high standard is very important.  There was a promise from some in the Department that that would happen, so I am glad to see that standard has made it in because it needs to be provided for in the Bill to ensure it will happen.  Equally, the post-recovery analysis and identification is very important in that quest for truth and justice.  It will allow those who have lost relatives or family members or those who have questions about themselves, their past and their family to get answers.  It is important that provision has been beefed up and improved and that it is included in the Bill in black and white.  That is a very welcome addition.</p> <p> I echo the words of other Deputies regarding the role of the coroner.  It is important we keep that aspect of the Bill.  I will save my remarks on the need to reform the office of the coroner for a more appropriate time, but keeping that jurisdiction in there and alive is an essential part of the apparatus of the State to lead, again, to truth, justice and healing.  We talk often in the Chamber about matters such as truth, justice and healing.  We talk about them in the context of Northern Ireland, the collusion reports and other issues relating to the Troubles, but they are very real in this context too.  With the Bill, we have something that will facilitate that and enable us to take a site that has nothing but questions and, in a respectful manner and in accordance with international best practice, find out who is buried there and where their relatives are, and from that be able to piece together truth.  From that truth, we will bring justice.</p> <p> I am grateful the Bill will do that, and I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation to enable us to do it.</p></speech>

I will not call it a home.  She identified that there were death certificates but no burial records.  The manner in which children's remains were discarded at this site was absolutely outrageous, and but for the work of Catherine Corless, we would probably not even know about it.  She shone a light into the darkest part of our history and forced us to confront the legacy of 100 years of conservative Governments that abrogated their responsibility to the churches and left children at the mercy of people who did not have those children&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</p>  <p>  The Bill will provide a statutory basis and framework to allow for interventions at sites such as that in Tuam, where inappropriate burials took place.  At long last, the children interred at the Tuam site and other sites can have a dignified and respectful burial.  While the Government's efforts to finally address this issue are to be welcomed, they fall short in a number of areas.  There are some concerns about the threshold that sites will have to meet in order to be thoroughly investigated.  Further clarity is needed on the role and function of the agency and director, the new 20 m distance requirement and the definition of what constitutes a relative.  The definition of eligible family members must include all family relatives.  The role of the coroner is unclear and further distinctions are required between the roles of the coroner and the director.  It is clear our current coronial laws are inadequate to deal with the scope and nature of burial sites at former mother and baby institutions.</p>  <p>  The legislation, as drafted, may adequately address the specific circumstances of the Tuam site, but there are serious reservations as to whether it will sufficiently address those of other sites.  These too deserve to be thoroughly investigated.  I recently read Dr. Marie Cassidy's book, in which she writes about her work excavating mass graves in the former Yugoslavia.  We may require international assistance given the possible scale of burials throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Finally, on the issues of memorials and their funding, Kildare County Council unanimously passed a motion last year proposing to erect a memorial at St. Mary's cemetery, Athy, to remember all those who had died in the so-called county home.  The Government should fund these memorials.  The people of Kildare do not begrudge the money, but Kildare County Council is poorly funded and it is time to do the right thing.</p></speech>

It came about as a result of the discovery of the mass grave in my local town, Tuam, County Galway.  Last weekend, I met some members of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance and I have taken on board their concerns relating to the legislation, which, they advised, demands amendments that will be submitted by them and others.  Many experts have written about the recovery and the importance of exhumation to restore the identity, the physical location and the care that were denied to victims who were buried in unknown circumstances or in mass graves.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged in the draft legislation that a director will be appointed as head of the office following enactment.  It appears the director's role is intended to replace that previously suggested as that of the agency.  Many human rights experts, including among the people I have spoken to, are adamant that the role of the coroner is central and that he or she must take primary responsibility for any site under investigation where human remains are located or where the cause of death, or the medical certification of death, is not clear.  In the case of Tuam, as the Minister will be aware, the death records were not medically certified.  Rather, the vast majority were signed by a domestic worker from the former institution.  It is proposed the advisory board that will be set up will include one survivor of the institution and one family relative of a lost child.  The Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance suggests that is too narrow to accommodate contributions from the groups of both relatives and survivors who are involved, and has argued the board should include at least three people from each category.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that DNA samples from certain relatives will be safely stored for matching.  It has been stressed on a number of occasions that primary relatives, particularly in the case of the Tuam site, are often elderly or in ill health.  As a result, every effort should be made to obtain DNA in a timely fashion to allow for the best opportunities for matching when the infants' human remains have been recovered from the site.  While the category of those eligible to participate as relatives has been extended beyond mother and father and sibling and half-sibling to include grandparent and grandchild, aunt and uncle and niece and nephew, the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance has stressed the requirement to extend those categories to include cousins.  We spoke about this yesterday but I reiterate it now.  The reason for this demand relates to the fact the Tuam site operated between 1925 and 1961, and those searching for loved ones may include cousins of the deceased.  Individuals who are first cousins have contacted me and, I understand, other members of the Oireachtas committee.  The committee will hear representations when the Bill moves to Committee Stage.</p> <p> Another concern expressed by the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance relates to the extraordinary powers afforded to the Minister of the day to opt for memorialisation instead of site excavation and recovery of human remains.  In recent times, and included in the bulletin received from the Minister this week, the focus leans further towards memorialisation, with funds available and accessible.  It is premature for memorialisation at this stage, certainly in the context of Tuam and also the sites to which due consideration has not yet been afforded.  Survivors living in my constituency and elsewhere and connected to the Tuam home have waited a considerable time for closure.  Some have waited decades.  We must ensure that the wishes of surviving relatives and our commitment to and respect for the relevant human rights treaties are afforded the highest priority.</p> <p> This legislation is not a once-off.  It will remain on the Statute Book and will facilitate the overseeing of excavation works, including those relating to exhumation, at other sites in the future.  As a result, every effort should be made to get it right.  I am sure the Minister will do that.</p> <p> The effect of the excavation on residents living in proximity to the site and whose properties will be excavated needs to be part of the process from the start.  Open engagement is important.  A full-time, dedicated liaison person should be appointed to deal with residents' concerns.  There are concerns that people's properties will be excavated.  This would represent an enormous intrusion on their lives.  I hope that those living there will be afforded the respect and dignity they deserve.</p> <p> I appreciate the work the Minister has done on this matter and what he has undertaken to do to date.  It is important to say that in order to ensure that his efforts are recognised.  I commend the former Minister, Dr. Zappone, on her work in this regard as well.</p> <p> Before I finish, I would like to also acknowledge Ms Catherine Corless's work in unearthing this terrible issue and bringing forward the research that has brought us to where we are right now.  It is important that we acknowledge all of that.</p> <p> I look forward to working with the Minister right throughout the process to secure the passage of this Bill in order to ensure that we get it right for everybody involved.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister on getting the Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il and seeking to progress it.  Much work has been done in developing the legislation.  Much discussion has gone into it as well.  Nonetheless, as Opposition Deputies, it is our job to critique the Bill, identify failings in it and suggests improvements that might be made.  There are some difficulties with the Bill as it stands.</p>  <p>  In the region of 800 babies died in the home in Tuam.  I can find burial records for only two of them - Vincent Hanon, who died aged one month in 1936, and Mary Margaret Jordan, who died at the age of one in 1932.  Vincent and Mary Margaret were buried in the graveyard on Athenry Road in Tuam.  Other than that, I can only presume that the remains of the other 800 babies are at the site in Tuam.</p>  <p>  The Minister's press release on the topic from last week talks about the identification programme that has been expanded to include the participation of grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces.  I understand that it is complex and confusing, but there is a difficulty with this in that the Minister may be out of touch with the situation as it stands.  Does he really believe that babies who died in the mother and baby home between 1925 and 1961 will have grandparents who are still alive?  The remains that will be exhumed will be those of babies and young children.  The commission identified the presence of remains at the site and was clear that these are infant remains, yet the Minister has included in the Bill a reference to grandchildren.  It is confusing.  How would someone who died when he or she was a baby or a young child have grandchildren alive today?  If these are grandchildren of the parents of those young children, they are uncles or aunts of those children or siblings.  I would be grateful if the Minister could explain this.</p>  <p>  The Minister does not seem to have identified the likelihood that there will be many unidentified babies' remains in the grave in Tuam.  In my view, the proportion of the 800 babies' remains that may not be identified under the current scheme could be as high as half.</p>  <p>  Any one of us in this Chamber could have had an aunt or uncle who died in a mother and baby home as a child and who we will never know existed.  It is my understanding that the people of Tuam will not be able to come forward to provide DNA samples unless they know or suspect that they had relatives who died in the home.  If that is the case, it will be impossible to identify the remains of every child at that site.  What plans does the Minister have for the remains of the many children who may be unidentified?  I would take the lead from survivors on this, but it may be appropriate for Galway County Council, which owned and controlled the mother and baby home, to provide respectful graves for these unidentified babies.</p>  <p>  I am not sure whether the Minister comprehends fully the culture that surrounds this matter.  There is certainly a culture of secrecy in relation to it-----</p></speech>

I have been talking to my D&aacute;il assistant, Mr. Luke Silke, who has also been in contact with the Minister's office.  Mr. Silke comes from Tuam, and he thinks we would have a much better chance of successfully identifying the babies' remains if the invitation to provide DNA samples was extended everyone in the area and not just to those who already know or suspect that they have relations there.</p>  <p>  Outside of the 800 babies who died in the home, I have found burial records for 11 unidentified babies who died in Tuam between 1885 and 1939.  I want to make sure that these babies are also mentioned here in this debate today.  Seven of them died in the workhouse in Tuam, three of them were shockingly found discarded and one record refers to an "unknown infant who died in May 1936 and was found near the Tuam train station".</p>  <p>  Before the mother and baby home opened in Tuam in 1925, for three years a mother and baby home operated in Glenamaddy.  It was operated by the same organisation.  Aont&uacute; has found records for more than 50 babies who died in that home between 1922 and 1925.  The commission of investigation stated in its report that it regarded the Tuam and Glenamaddy institutions as one and the same.  Therefore, we should be talking about 850 babies, not 800.  Nobody seems to know where those 50-plus babies who died in Glenamaddy are buried.  This is something the Government must also look into.  I want to mention Kate Lynskey and Christopher King in particular who died 100 years ago this month in the Glenamaddy mother and baby home.  Kate was ten months old and died of pneumonia on 12 March 1922.  Christopher was a year old when he died from congestion of the lungs on 29 March 1922.</p>  <p>  After the exhumation has taken place in Tuam, we need a memorial garden.  We need a place where all names of these babies are gathered together to ensure that none of them will be forgotten.</p>  <p>  Aont&uacute; is calling for the expansion of participation - to allow anyone in Tuam who wants to find out if he or she is related to anyone at the site to come forward and provide DNA.  I agree with the provisions for mothers to object to more distant relatives receiving information.  That is a good provision.  Notwithstanding this, we need to allow an open invitation to everyone to come forward.  Otherwise, we will run into serious difficulty and see a situation where maybe up to half of those babies remains will simply not be identified by this scheme.</p>  <p>  I also want to pay tribute to Sheila.  I am sure many people will know Sheila.  She is outside the D&aacute;il again today.  She cycled through the rain to get here.  Sheila will never give up in her campaign for justice and I hope that the other Deputies will engage with her as they pass through the gates of Leinster House at Kildare Street.</p>  <p>  Is &aacute;bhar uaf&aacute;sach deacair &eacute; seo agus &aacute;bhar truamh&eacute;alach gan dabht.

I pay tribute to all of those who may be watching proceedings today, who have fought so hard to shine a light on Ireland's deeply dark past.  I have no doubt these proceedings are difficult for many to watch and listen to for a range of reasons and I respect them for their continued courage.  Tribute must also be deservedly paid to Catherine Corless, without whom it is likely we would not even be discussing this legislation today.  In a recent interview Ms Corless said her work would not be finished until all the babies wrongfully buried in Tuam had been exhumed.  She said: "There are babies and young children down in the chambers of a sewage facility, they were discarded, frowned on, treated like dirt, there's no getting away from that and the only way to rectify the past is to give them a bit of dignity and exhume them."  I hope this Bill will bring that closure not just to Ms Corless but to the many families affected.  What this Bill seeks to accomplish is unprecedented: a reflection of Ireland's uniquely shameful history and repugnant attitudes towards unwed mothers and their children.</p>  <p>  I have said on many occasions in this House that I do not believe there are enough actions this Government could ever take to right the wrongs of the past, such was the nature of the crimes committed against these mothers and their babies.  At long last, the children interred at Tuam will be afforded the opportunity of a dignified and respectful burial, which is the very least that they deserve.  The process to date had been very frustrating for families, a fact which the Minister himself has acknowledged.  I ask that we proceed swiftly in establishing the agency to oversee the process and that we begin working to retrieve DNA on site as soon as is practicable.  I welcome that this legislation will give the newly established agency the power it needs to access the highest technical services possible, and to have the necessary resources to identify the remains of these babies.</p>  <p>  The legislation has been broadened to include a wider circle of relatives than anticipated, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces who may provide DNA to compare with remains.  This will provide a greater chance of identification and the dignity of reuniting these families, that were often torn apart, to grieve for lives shown so little dignity in their short time on Earth.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister makes the process of application and identification as straightforward and compassionate as it can possibly be.  We cannot right the wrongs of the past.  It is an unimaginable shame that these women and their children were born in a time so much less tolerant and more blatantly evil than the Ireland in which we live today.  We can honour the babies of Tuam by continuing to fight to make our society a more tolerant one where those in power stand up for and protect the vulnerable and the innocent so that we never return to those very dark days.  We cannot right those wrongs, but we should not stop until each of the babies so wrongfully interred in Tuam is afforded the dignity and respect of the final resting place that they so deserve.  I welcome the work on this Bill because I know it undertakes to achieve that.  I thank the Minister for his compassion and dedication to this extremely important piece of legislation.</p></speech>

Attempts to deal with the legacy of the mother and baby homes that were allowed to operate here have been fraught with attempts to go over the heads of those who should have been consulted properly, and with actions that denied the memories of those who, sadly, are no longer with us.  I hope that is changing.  The work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, chaired by Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputy Funchion, and the recommendations it published have made a big difference.  I acknowledge that the Minister listened to those views.</p>  <p>  Shortly, I will talk about Sean Ross Abbey, which is in Roscrea, in my constituency of Tipperary, but first I ask the Minister to provide clarity on Part 2 of the Bill that concerns the director giving the go-ahead for excavation works.  It states that the Government may refuse to make an order where other substantive reasons exist which cause it to form the view that memorialisation of the burials on the land, without further intervention, is more appropriate.  There is a level of vagueness to this that does not set me at ease.  I ask the Minister to outline what precisely the director will take into account, and whether there will be a level of discourse between the director and those seeking intervention.  Pursuing a programme of restorative justice cannot leave any room for vagueness.  I ask this because it is connected with the points I want to make to the Minister on Sean Ross Abbey.</p>  <p>  First, I acknowledge and thank the Minister for the engagements that he has had with those associated with Sean Ross Abbey and Tipperary County Council for working steadily with them.  As the Minister knows, much work is going on in preparations to determine the location and condition of unmarked burials at the site.  I would appreciate if the Minister could tell me if he is in a position to issue a set of guidelines and resources for those who are at the stage of preparing to scan an area for this purpose.  People with a close association with Sean Ross or any other institution are naturally unfamiliar with a project of this nature.  It is also new territory for Tipperary County Council.  It would be useful to provide a roadmap featuring the requirements that would be made of those seeking scans and the provisions that would be made available to assist them.  I am not talking purely financial assistance here; I am also talking about directing those concerned towards the contractors they may need.  If the Department is willing to provide any resources, I ask whether they would be made available directly or through the local authority.  What I am suggesting to the Minister here is that there should be a duty of care to assist in the preparations needed to determine the extent of the need or otherwise of excavations on a particular site.</p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister to expand on the extent to which work at other sites can take place at the same time as Tuam, or if he intends the process at Tuam to inform works at other sites.  I would appreciate if he could provide interested parties with updates in relation to his engagements with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue of memorialisation.</p>  <p>  I would like the Minister to provide some more detail on intervention at other sites.  The 20 m rule is a particular issue here, as are concerns that it could become overly-restrictive, particularly for sites where more information needs to be gathered.</p></speech>

Is sampla de na ceisteanna seo ceist a bh&iacute; muid ag pl&eacute; n&iacute; r&oacute;fhada &oacute; shin, ceist na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh agus na mn&aacute; t&iacute; a mhealladh ar ais chun cinnte a dh&eacute;anamh de go mbeidh na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh ag obair i gceart.  T&aacute; breis airgid, breis maoinithe agus breis taca&iacute;ochta ag teast&aacute;il &oacute;n na hoifigigh phlean&aacute;la teanga.  T&aacute; an obair sin ann.  Caithfimid d&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil an taca&iacute;ocht sin ann.  </p><p>Chomh maith leis sin, caithfimid d&eacute;anamh cinnte de n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go bhfuilimid ag cur na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta chun cinn agus ag s&aacute;samh an &eacute;ilimh, ach go bhfuilimid ag dul amach agus &eacute;ileamh a chruth&uacute;.  Is r&oacute;l an St&aacute;it &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag an St&aacute;t maidir leis sin agus caithfidh s&eacute; d&eacute;anamh cinnte de n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go bhfuil an Ghaeilge chun cinn, ach go bhfuil daoine &aacute; mealladh chuici freisin.

T&aacute; na comh&aacute;bhair ar fad liost&aacute;ilte i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla aige.

Taca&iacute;onn na Daonlathaithe S&oacute;isialta le st&aacute;das na Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r seo.  T&aacute; leagan Gaeilge againn d&aacute;r su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;n agus t&aacute; polasa&iacute; againn chun st&aacute;das na Gaeilge a threisi&uacute;.  T&aacute; na Daonlathaithe S&oacute;isialta thar a bheith s&aacute;sta taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&rsquo;fhorbairt na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar acmhainn don chult&uacute;r, l&aacute;mh le l&aacute;mh leis na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn againn fuinneamh nua a insileadh sa Ghaeilge agus feabhs&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</p>  <p>  This is an historical occasion for us, celebrating the first Seachtain na Gaeilge since the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted last year.  This is a very important part in our history in terms of the development, protection and support for our language.  It is particularly important for the Gaeltacht community and it is long overdue but it is also important in terms of encouraging the everyday use of Irish when interacting with the State.  This is important for the rest of the population in terms of signalling the importance of the language to us all.  There are very ambitious targets within this Act, which is very welcome, but we need to see progress in terms of reaching those targets.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  Another area that needs a great deal of attention at the moment in terms of supporting our language is education.  We have 45,000 pupils attending Irish primary schools nationwide yet there is capacity for only 13,900 students at second level.  To put it another way, we have 8% of our primary school children in Gaelscoileanna around the country but only 4% of our second level students in Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;.  This means there is an access issue for those second level students who want to access second level education through the Irish language.  The Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; have been incredibly successful.  There is a large amount of work that needs to be done to remove the barriers to second level education through Irish for those students who want to do it.  That is very important in terms of the support that we can give for the language.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Gaeltacht areas, in the past couple of years, due to the pandemic, we have seen the closure of Irish-language summer courses in particular and the significant economic impact that has had on Irish language-Gaeltacht community areas.  My colleague in Galway, Councillor Owen Hanley, estimates that has had a &euro;50 million impact on the local economy.  The survival of Gaeltacht communities and the thriving of Gaeltacht communities is very important to us overall on this island.  There are issues that need to be addressed there on the housing front in particular and around planning.  With the increase in short-term rentals and holiday rentals, there has been an impact on housing needs for people in Gaeltacht communities where people have not been able to afford homes in their local Gaeltacht areas.  This is putting their contribution to the Gaeltacht areas and the existence of the Gaeltacht areas under threat and in jeopardy.  That needs to be addressed at Government level.  </p>  <p>  I want to mention two other issues, the first of which is the importance of making progress in terms of a national policy on bilingual packaging.  That would be very welcome.  It would give people, in particular Irish language speakers, the ability to access products through the language but it would also provide opportunities in terms of employment in translation in product and service marketing.  There is also the issue around communications, especially from the Government.  In terms of social media posts from the Government, as previously pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Cairns, last year less than 4% of all social media posts by various Departments were in Irish.  By comparison, in Wales, approximately 50% of posts were either in Welsh or bilingual.  There is a lot of progress that could be made there.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt ar an oile&aacute;n seo for the last 2,500 bliain.  Caithfear gach taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt chun &iacute; a choinne&aacute;il beo.  D&uacute;irt Antonio Gramsci gur doras &iacute; teanga do chult&uacute;r na ndaoine.  T&iacute;r gan teanga, t&iacute;r gan anam.  Bainig&iacute; sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge. </p></speech>

The Seanad discussed this matter yesterday and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence did so last week.  I welcome those debates and the opportunity to set out Ireland's position.</p>  <p>  Let me first say that I greatly respect Amnesty International and its important work, especially in terms of the contribution it makes to the promotion and protection of human rights.  Ireland values the role Amnesty and other civil society organisations play in this regard.  I note the publication of this detailed, substantial and comprehensive report, which paints a stark picture of the situation of the Palestinian people across Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territory.  I have directed my officials to review the report in depth.  My Department has already met representatives from Amnesty for an initial detailed exchange of views on the report.</p>  <p>  The assertions in the Amnesty report echo those we have seen in a number of recent similar reports.  Undoubtedly, these reports raise difficult questions for the Israeli Administration.  I am extremely troubled by the way in which the human rights of Palestinians are impacted by the policies of the Israeli authorities and I look forward to a comprehensive debate on the issue.  Our position on these matters will continue to be based on international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law, which sets out obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention for Israel as the occupying power, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p> <p>Ireland's approach is rooted in the illegality of Israel's occupation and the right of Palestinians to self-determination.  Ireland has been consistently clear in that the occupation undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, a right that is at the heart of a two-state solution.  I have been frank and direct in my bilateral engagements with Israel on these issues, with my EU partners and at the UN Security Council in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in the occupied Palestinian territory.<br/><br/>It is important that, as a member of the UN Security Council and the EU, Ireland remain a credible and effective actor in international forums in the context of our views on the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli Government.  We are conscious of how the language we use will be interpreted.  I have stated that the Irish Government does not use the term &quot;apartheid&quot; because we do not think it is helpful in this context.  However, I share Deputies' concerns in this regard.  Indeed, I am very concerned by some of the issues highlighted in the Amnesty report, for example, the widespread use of administrative detention for Palestinians, which allows Israel to arrest and detain a person without charge.  International humanitarian law is clear that administrative detention should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  I renew my call on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law in this regard.  Ireland and the EU have repeatedly raised the treatment of Palestinian prisoners with Israel.  At the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland has called on Israeli authorities, in accordance with their obligations under Article 9 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to refrain from conducting arbitrary arrests and to follow the acceptable procedure established by law regarding arrest and detention.<br/><br/>The Amnesty report refers to the human rights situation, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory, but also in Israel itself.  It is imperative that the rights of non-Jewish citizens of Israel not be infringed and that there is respect and tolerance for the diversity of its population.  I am fully committed to raising such issues of equality with Israel.  Where Ireland has concerns about laws and practices that undermine equality among citizens and disregard the rights of minorities, particularly the Palestinian minority in Israel, we make our views clearly known to Israel.  For example, we have expressed our concern about the nation-state law, in that we have concerns that it might enable discriminatory practices against non-Jewish citizens.  Deputies can be assured that I will continue to be frank with Israel on my concerns in this regard.<br/><br/>It is important that, as a member of the Security Council and the EU, Ireland remain a strong voice in international forums in respect of our views on the treatment of Palestinians.  Ireland will again raise these important issues in its statement on accountability at the Human Rights Council tomorrow.<br/><br/>I wish to address the expansion of illegal settlements.  Ireland has been consistent and vocal in its opposition to settlements, which are unlawful under international law.  This House adopted a resolution last May that declared that the scale, pace and nature of Israel's settlement policy amounted to unlawful <i>de facto </i>annexation.  The constant expansion of settlements has a negative impact on the living conditions of Palestinians and undermines prospects for peace by further entrenching division and inequality.  I have witnessed this myself, including when I visited the Palestinian community in Nabi Samwil just outside Jerusalem in November where I saw first-hand the impact of settlement expansion in Area C.<br/><br/>There are clear differences in how the planning system applies to Palestinians and settlers, which negatively affects Palestinian communities on a daily basis.  Settlements degrade adjacent Palestinian agricultural land, severely impacting the olive harvest in particular.  They also affect the availability of already scarce water resources and cause pollution.  However, settlement expansion continues, along with associated infrastructural projects designed to meet the needs of an ever-increasing settler population.  I am seriously concerned by the recent announcement of further settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the Lower Aqueduct plan in East Jerusalem.  These plans threaten the contiguity of a future Palestinian state, and the world should take note.<br/><br/>Ireland has urged the Israeli Government to cease settlement activity.  I raised these issues directly in my meetings in Israel last November with President Herzog and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Yair Lapid.  This is an issue that we consistently raise at the UN Security Council, including at the monthly briefing on the Middle East on 23 February.<br/><br/>Another issue that I wish to highlight in this debate is the intensification of settler-related violence in recent years.  According to the UN, the total number of settler attacks across the West Bank that have resulted in injury and-or property damage in 2021 increased by 46% compared with the same period in 2020.  The disparity in conviction rates between Israeli settlers and Palestinians who have committed acts of violence is acutely worrying.  Those responsible for carrying out violent attacks must be held fully accountable, as victims of such brutal attacks deserve justice regardless of whether they are Israeli or Palestinian.<br/><br/>Turning to the broader issue of the space for civil society, I wish to restate my support for the essential role that civil society actors play in scrutinising the actions of governments globally, including in Ireland and Israel.  As I have previously stated, I am deeply concerned by Israel's decision last October to designate certain Palestinian civil society organisations as terrorist entities.  Ireland will continue to support Palestinian civil society and human rights defenders and their critical role in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values.  Ireland has been proactive in ensuring these issues are highlighted in the UN Security Council, including by supporting the call for a debate in November on the NGO designations as well as on announcements regarding planned expansion and the construction of illegal settlements.  I raised our concerns directly in my meetings in Israel last November.<br/><br/>I am troubled by the ongoing tensions in East Jerusalem and the clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police that took place last Monday.  Reports of excessive use of force by police must be investigated.  These incidents serve only to inflame an already tense situation.  Ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, I would recall the need to respect the <i>status quo</i>of holy sites fully and call for the utmost restraint on the part of police in line with the principles of international law.  Peaceful worshippers must be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of religion and worship freely and without threats, violence or provocation in accordance with the <i>status quo</i>.<br/><br/>Ireland is firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution that ends the occupation that began in 1967, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states, on the basis of international law, including relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  That has been Ireland's position and it continues to be.  We will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law - in this regard, I have been speaking to a number of international partners about how Ireland may be able to show leadership in the months ahead - that ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties.  This is something that I state clearly and often, but I know it is not easy to achieve.  Nevertheless, it is vital to establish a genuine political horizon.<br/><br/>The principles of equality, inclusion and human rights are essential components in the achievement of lasting peace and democracy.  Repressive, discriminatory and provocative policies and actions, such as those documented in the Amnesty report, take us further away than ever from the prospect of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.<br/><br/>Ireland has nine months or so left on the Security Council.  As I have told some of the Deputies opposite, I intend to try to use the influence and role we have on the Security Council to make some progress through Irish leadership, in partnership with other like-minded countries, in the context of the Middle East peace process.  Unfortunately, the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians has gone backwards in recent years.</p></speech>
