Families are missing out on holidays because of long delays in issuing passports, hotels are charging between &euro;350 and &euro;400 for one night and now the State's main airport is experiencing chaos.  Dublin Airport on Sunday was a nightmare for those caught up in the mayhem.  People waited hours in queues that stretched outside the terminal buildings.  Passengers received no communication, updates or explanations for the delays.  Indeed, many had not even made it to the security check before their flights took off without them.  More than 1,000 people missed their flights.  Big money had to be forked out for hotel rooms, connecting flights were missed and would-be holidaymakers had their holidays ruined.  Now, confusion surrounding what any compensation package will cover is sowing further frustration.  This is not only about tourism and holidays.  As a small island nation, we rely heavily on our airports to ensure our connectivity with the rest of the world.  We simply cannot afford this chaos.  Last week's events at the airport risk damaging Ireland's international reputation for international business and investment.</p>  <p>  All of this has its roots in the laying off 1,000 workers by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, during the pandemic and the subsequent lack of workforce planning as international travel reopened.  At the time of those lay-offs, SIPTU's Jerry Brennan told the airport authority, "you will need to be hiring people because your queues will be extending through the carparks".  What foresight.  It seems he was the only person with any foresight.  Yet, as we speak, Dublin Airport is still only at 70% of pre-Covid staffing levels.  How can we expect the country&rsquo;s main airport to operate at such low staff levels at the busiest time of the year?  It was entirely foreseeable, after two years of lockdowns, that people would be very eager to get away on holidays again.  Sunday&rsquo;s chaos did not come out of the blue.  There were warnings in the major delays in March and April.  What action, if any, did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, take then to get ahead of all this?  Did he meet the airport authority back in March to work out solutions and prevent an escalation of the problem?  He is now calling for solutions in the wake of chaos.  He has shown up again a day late and a dollar short.</p>  <p>  Teip thubaisteach ar thaobh an Rialtais agus an DAA a bh&iacute; sa phraiseach ioml&aacute;n ag Aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar an Domhnach.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in gur chuir s&eacute; isteach go m&oacute;r ar thaistealaithe ach rinne s&eacute; dochar do ch&aacute;il idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann.  An bhfuil muid ag s&uacute;il le n&iacute;os m&oacute; den chine&aacute;l ruaille buaille sin in Aerfort Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath an deireadh seachtaine seo?</p>  <p>  Of course the Dublin Airport Authority should be held responsible for its part in this mess but let us be very clear on this.  When the operation of the most important airport in the State breaks down, it is the business of the Government to get ahead of that.  The public is in disbelief at this fiasco and those planning to travel through Dublin Airport this bank holiday weekend are now very worried.  Can the Minister guarantee today that we are not facing more chaos at Dublin Airport this weekend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100004#B00100"><p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising what is such an important issue.  The scenes at Dublin Airport that we all witnessed on our screens at the weekend are completely unacceptable.  Passengers going through the airport should not have had to endure an experience like that and I can only imagine the stress, anxiety and anger that was caused to so many of them.  Many of them had been saving long and hard for a well-earned holiday and, in too many instances, did not make their flight through absolutely no fault of their own.  What we saw was unacceptable and it cannot be allowed to happen again.</p>  <p>  It is the case the DAA has statutory responsibility for the running of Dublin Airport but of course, as a Government, we take a direct interest in this matter because of the impact it has on the people we represent and on Ireland's reputation, both domestically and internationally, and the importance for us as an island nation of having international connectivity and airports that are well run and well resourced and that meet the needs of the people.</p>  <p>  These issues began to emerge in March and there was significant intervention at that point, which continued.  In particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, had very regular meetings - every second day, in fact - for a period with the DAA to ensure this issue was properly addressed.  To be fair, for the great bulk of that period, the issues were addressed and the types of scenes we witnessed at the weekend were not evident over that period.  Since the weekend, there was a meeting yesterday involving the Minister for Transport, the Minister of State and the DAA's senior management to express the Government's deep frustration and unhappiness with the scenes we witnessed at the weekend.  There was a further meeting this morning at which the DAA was asked to come forward with an operational plan to ensure we do not see scenes like this again, and to provide a reassurance to passengers going to Dublin Airport this coming weekend, which will be a busy, long weekend, that adequate resources are in place to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, DAA senior management will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  The Minister and the Minister of State have asked that the details of the operational plan be conveyed publicly and discussed at that meeting.  Importantly, they have asked that there be an effective communications campaign in order that passengers who are relying on the services at Dublin Airport know exactly what is ahead of them and precisely how long they should allow to safely get through the various stages of check-in, security and so on.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point out a voluntary severance scheme was operated by the DAA over the course of 2020 and into 2021, which was the authority's judgment as to the resources it would need for the period ahead.  It was also in the context of a period when passenger levels had simply collapsed and the DAA was losing enormous sums weekly, and it proposed a severance scheme.  In recent months, it has recruited several hundred staff.  About 300 of the 370 additional security staff required have been recruited and about 170 of those are fully trained.  The DAA has had more than 5,000 applications for the positions since the start of March.</p>  <p>  It is important the public are given a reassurance that what we saw at the weekend does not happen again.  The Government has reinforced that message to the DAA directly and the public will see tomorrow the details of what it is proposing operationally to ensure it does not happen again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100004#B00200"><p>The Minister said there was a significant political intervention in March and April, when these problems emerged.  I have to tell him, that intervention did not succeed in its purpose and Sunday showed us the evidence of that.  The airport is still operating understaffed, at 70% of its pre-Covid strength.  The management of the Dublin Airport Authority, it seems to me, grossly misjudged what the capacity requirements would be as travel reopened, as was always going to be the case.</p> <p>I must say I do not hear anything from the Minister, as a Minister in government, that would reassure me or reassure the public that in fact the airport authority or the Government have got on top of this issue.  I ask the Minister again to perhaps be more categoric and reassuring for the public.  Will he tell us we are not going to face scenes such as those we saw on Sunday again?  Is he satisfied that is the case?  Is he satisfied the airport authority can and will mobilise the required numbers of staff, including full use of overtime, over the coming bank holiday weekend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100005#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The message from the Government could not be clearer.  The DAA needs to do whatever it takes to ensure this issue is addressed and that we do not see those kinds of scenes again, especially on the forthcoming bank holiday weekend.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, reinforced to the DAA executives the imperative to get on top of this because it is just not fair.  It is not fair on the members of the public who rely on the services at the airport to go about their business, travel abroad, see loved ones, return home after a trip to Ireland or go on business abroad.  They should be assured that if they turn up in good time for their flight, the airport will do its job and get them through the various stages and get them on board.  There was a detailed discussion today about what is required to ensure that is achieved, including measures to improve queue management and maximising the availability of staffing resources to increase the number of security lanes at peak times.  The DAA is now finalising those operational arrangements and we expect to hear much more about them in the next 24 hours and of course the authority will appear before the Oireachtas joint committee.  The message from the Government, as conveyed by the Minister and Minister of State today and by me here in the D&aacute;il could not be clearer, namely, the DAA must ensure this is not repeated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100005#C00300"><p>I also raise the outrageous delays in Dublin Airport over the weekend.  Clearly, these have had a devastating effect for so many people.  We know 1,000 people have missed their flights and that people missed out on job opportunities, work-related travel, funerals, weddings, holidays and so much more.  Clearly, this is a huge issue of consumer rights and a huge issue for those passengers who were so seriously inconvenienced over the weekend.</p>  <p>  However, it is not just a matter of poor planning by the DAA, although that is clearly a serious issue in itself, but also points to two broader issues for which the Government must take responsibility.  The first is a failure of our national aviation policy, specifically, a failure to ensure effective distribution of flights among our airports, because it is not just about Dublin Airport and we are conscious many people are now looking to other airports like those in Cork or Farranfore.  They are looking at airports where there is capacity and seeing the contrast between them and the chaos we saw at the weekend at Dublin Airport.  It is, therefore, about a national aviation policy that must take into account distribution of workload among our regional airports.</p>  <p>  It is also, at a broader level, about workers' rights.  That is something our transport spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith, has been raising consistently for some time now.  We saw the DAA lay off staff during Covid in significant numbers and we saw the Government failing to put in a no-redundancy clause as a condition of the State supports that were being granted.  We know the DAA took advantage of those supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that comes to an end today, yet there was no conditionality around workers' rights in that.  We heard this morning from an anonymous worker at Dublin Airport about the serious issues around workplace conditions and pay that pertain for the many staff at Dublin Airport.  Many of them took the brunt of understandable passenger frustration at the weekend and so many of them are in such a low-paid sector.  The real concern we have is we have seen Dublin Airport become a low-cost airport, as the preponderance of low-cost airlines has dominated and we have seen a race to the bottom as a result.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister first to reassure passengers that we will not see the same chaotic scenes at the airport this weekend.  Will he also assure the House there will be a proper and effective national aviation strategy put in place to ensure this imbalance between one airport and our other airports does not occur again?  Will the Government also take steps to ensure the serious staffing issues and the low-pay conditions for so many staff at Dublin Airport are addressed and that we see better conditions for staff and a genuine commitment to move to a living wage, as we saw in our Labour Party Bill on a living wage?</p> <p>Last week, we welcomed the T&aacute;naiste's announcement that the Government will introduce legislation on a living wage.  We are conscious that Ireland has a serious problem with low pay, with one in five of the workforce low paid.  It is not just about Dublin Airport, but clearly that was a major factor in the staffing shortfall that led to such chaotic scenes for so many at the weekend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100006#D00200"><p>The decision of the DAA in May 2020 to embark on a voluntary severance scheme was against the backdrop at the time of a collapse in the aviation industry and the commercial reality that it was losing an enormous amount of money daily.  It proposed a voluntary severance scheme and there was significant uptake of the scheme.  It is also fair to say that the recovery in aviation has exceeded the expectations of the majority of commentators, and I believe it has exceeded the DAA's own expectations, to be frank.  That is why in recent weeks, as manifested and crystallised at the weekend in such a terrible way, it simply did not have the level of staffing resources that it needed.  It is a good thing that aviation has recovered much more quickly than was forecast, but it is important that the DAA upholds the integrity of the security arrangements at the airport to the highest possible standards.  Its first priority is to ensure the safety of the passengers who are going through the airport and, indeed, those who work in the airport.</p>  <p>  There has been significant interest in the recruitment campaign.  I heard what the Deputy said about terms and conditions but more than 5,000 applications since the beginning of March indicates a high level of interest in the security roles that are available.  It is important to point out that the terms and conditions of employment are negotiated and agreed on a collective basis between the DAA and the trade unions representing the staff there.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Government's wider aviation policy, we have a policy that supports the regions.  There is a regional airports programme.  Just last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, announced capital funding not just for the airports that traditionally avail of the regional airports programme and of the public service obligation, PSO, such as Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock, but also included for the first time the State regional airports at Cork and Shannon in the regional airports programme.  Both of them benefited from capital funding, which I believe was the correct decision.  By virtue of the size of passenger numbers at those airports, they are now eligible for funding under the programme.  It is anticipated there will also be a round of operational grant aid under the regional airports programme.  Almost &euro;22 million is available in operational support during this year to support measures such as air traffic control, fire services and security-related operations at airports.  There will be invitations to apply for that operational aid and it will issue to eligible airports towards the latter half of the year.</p>  <p>  The Government's strategy is to support regional airports, including the State regional airports, which all provide an excellent quality of service and provide competition for Dublin Airport, which is needed too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100006#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his response on the aviation strategy as it relates to airports such as Shannon, Cork and Farranfore.  I also heard what he said about the recovery of aviation.  However, this was not unpredictable.  Airlines sold flights, so the number of people who would be flying out of Dublin Airport last weekend was utterly predictable.  Clearly, there was a serious problem, a serious failure of workforce planning.</p>  <p>  In terms of the issue of staff conditions and pay, the trade unions at Dublin Airport have been raising this for some time.  There is a serious issue again with retention of staff and that is related to the pay levels and the conditions that apply to staff at the airport.  That has to be addressed to ensure we do not see these shortfalls on an ongoing basis.  I repeat our concern about Dublin Airport effectively becoming a low-cost airport at a time when inflation is rising above 8% today and there is a cost-of-living crisis that is really biting into so many people's pockets and incomes.  That is why the Labour Party has been saying that Ireland needs a pay rise and why we have been pushing for enactment of a Bill that would transform the minimum wage into a living wage.  We call on the Government to adopt the principle in our Bill.  That would bring about a much quicker transformation, a much speedier increase in the incomes people earn and would address some of the issues with low pay that are affecting staff numbers in Dublin Airport and in so many other places around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100007#E00100"><p>The DAA has major obligations as an employer.  It now has a duty to ensure that it reaches a full staffing complement in order to ensure the safe and efficient running of Dublin Airport and Cork Airport, which also comes under the remit of the DAA.  That is why it is in the process of a significant recruitment campaign, which has attracted a lot of interest.  It has offered existing security staff contracts with a minimum of 30 hours per week.  The contract requires staff to be available to work 40 hours across a 24-7 roster, with employees notified 30 days in advance of their next four-week schedules.  In reality, most staff work more than the guaranteed minimum hours, and overtime is available.  Permanent security staff are employed on a pensionable and secure basis, and all the DAA arrangements are collectively bargained for.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's wider point in respect of pay, there are, as she knows, negotiations under way on public pay in Ireland.  That will impact on 365,000 public servants across the country.  I hope we will be able to reach a successful conclusion on that matter in the next short number of weeks.  That is important not only from a public expenditure and an industrial relations point of view but also from the point of view of the thousands of workers who provide essential services to us all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100007#E00200"><p>The recently established Cost of Living Coalition is calling people out onto the streets on Saturday, 18 June, for a national demonstration and day of protest to demand a comprehensive, urgent and radical package of measures to address the cost-of-living crisis that is absolutely crucifying workers, pensioners, students and people on low and middle incomes.  It will be a protest against the Government's spectacular failure to address the cost-of-living crisis.</p>  <p>  Today, we have more evidence of the Government's failure in this regard.  EUROSTAT has indicated that we are facing inflation of 8.3%.  This means that the value in purchasing power terms of workers' wages, pensions and incomes will drop by more than 8%, meaning real cuts in income for the people who can least afford them.  Then we have the Taoiseach warning of a new era of high energy prices.  That is on top of a 42% increase in energy and heating costs for ordinary people in the past year alone.</p>  <p>  Against this background of a cost-of-living crisis, the Government acts like a helpless, innocent bystander that can do absolutely nothing about it.  The Government is not going to do anything before the budget, and it is totally unclear whether it will do anything at all.  That is why people are coming onto the streets.</p>  <p>  Even the crisis in Dublin Airport is linked to this problem.  In a word, the problem there is that the DAA, which has executives on total packages in excess of &euro;366,000, expects the security workers it hires to operate on rubbishy flexible contracts for &euro;14 an hour.  When they cannot even plan and will not even know what hours they will have and, therefore, what income they will have in a week's time, is it any wonder that the DAA has difficulty recruiting people?  The chief executive overseeing this is on a package of &euro;366,000 a year.  That is the problem in the context of the bigger crisis we face.</p>  <p>  More than 600,000 people in this country are suffering deprivation and there are hundreds of thousands of workers are on low pay.  However, spectacular profits are being made by the energy companies.  Last year, Energia's profits were up 46% and the ESB's were up to nearly &euro;700 million.  Even Boris Johnson, a Tory, can introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to try to get some revenues to protect ordinary people from the cost-of-living crisis, but this Government will not do what even Boris Johnson is doing - and, my God, he is no left-winger.  When is the Government going to bring in emergency measures in respect of housing costs, the slaughtering of people's incomes and a cost of living that is crucifying ordinary people?  What is going to be in that package?  So far, the Government has done nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100008#F00100"><p>I do not expect Deputy Boyd Barrett to come in here and give any kind of fair assessment of what the Government has done, but to come in and say it has done nothing is just blatantly incorrect.  He knows that.  In the most recent budget, and the measures since, we have introduced a package of approximately &euro;2.4 billion of taxpayers' money to support households because we recognise and acknowledge the impact of the extraordinary level of inflation that is currently being experienced.  Of course, an inflation rate of more than 8% is a real concern because it impacts on people, living standards and the competitiveness of businesses.</p>  <p>  This is a global phenomenon.  We have to acknowledge that.  In the UK, the rate is 9%.  In the US, it is 8.5%.  In today's EUROSTAT publication, 12 of the 19 eurozone countries have rates of inflation that are higher than Ireland's.  That is why we responded.  It is why the Government continues to ensure that we can fund the measures we have already announced, including the reduction in VAT and excise duty.  As the Deputy is aware, we have brought in two separate bullet payments for fuel allowance recipients, a &euro;200 energy credit in respect of electricity bills for all households and a cut to the PSO levy from October.  There is a major multi-annual national retrofitting scheme.  We have put caps on school transport fees for families.  We have cut transport fares by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people.  We reduced the drugs payment scheme threshold to &euro;80 per month, benefiting more than 70,000 families.  We brought forward the changes announced in the most recent budget in respect of the working family payment.  We completely abolished any hospital charges for children overnight.  There are also targeted measures.  For example, the 9% rate for tourism and hospitality has, as the Deputy will be aware, been extended.  We also introduced specific measures in the haulage sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, introduced a suite of measures to support the tillage sector, farmers, and rural communities.  I do not expect Deputy Boyd Barrett to give the Government any credit for that.  He wants more to be done.  That is a reasonable political position to adopt.</p>  <p>  What we, as a Government, are seeking to do is navigate our way through this.  In order to help the country to get through this period, we are engaging in social dialogue with the main social partners, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the trade unions and the employer bodies.  The national economic dialogue will take place on 20 June.  This will provide an opportunity for a wider set of stakeholders and Opposition parties also to set out their positions.  However, we also need to be honest with people.  These are extraordinary times.  This is a record level of inflation.  It has never happened before in the eurozone.  In fact, it is global.  We will do the best we can as a Government to support and assist people, and we have to date, but it is not possible for any government to introduce measures to completely offset the impact of a terrible war in Ukraine, which has caused such dislocation in the energy markets and in relation to so many foods and materials across the supply chain.  We acknowledge that it is having an impact and that is why we have responded to date.  That is why we are finalising our budgetary position as we move towards the summer economic statement and the preparation of the budget.</p></speech>

The key point is that people are acutely aware that this is a tale of two crises.  Ordinary working people, pensioners and students are being hammered with the cost of inflation, but they see simultaneously that some people are doing very well out of it.  The Oxfam report published last week shows that Ireland's nine billionaires saw their assets and wealth increase by 55% last year.  The energy companies see their profits going through the roof.  The billionaires, millionaires and the CEOs of the DAA, who seem to be more interested in setting up airports in Saudi Arabia than in sorting out the problems at Dublin Airport, are doing very well.  For workers, pensioners, students and ordinary people, however, the measures the Government is taking are simply not enough.  This is because the Government will not address the elephant in the room, namely, the gross inequalities in income and wealth that exist in our society.</p></speech>

I do not accept that &euro;2.4 billion in measures represents a drop in the ocean.  For a country the size of Ireland, the use of taxpayers' money of that magnitude is a major decision.  It is not one we made lightly but it was absolutely warranted.  To take those interventions outside the normal budgetary calendar, to reduce VAT and excise, and to introduce once-off payments and better social welfare supports is not something any government would consider in normal times.</p>  <p>  We also have to be cognisant of the wider picture.  There are increasing risks to the global economy and as a small, open, trading economy, Ireland is not immune to those risks.  The Deputy will be aware the cost of borrowing for our country has increased significantly in recent weeks.  We will work our way through this.  The priority now is to agree in the summer economic statement, taking all those factors into account, what the appropriate budgetary stance is for Ireland and how much money we should be spending-----</p></speech>

It called for the establishment of an independent national adult safeguarding authority, a recommendation I fully support.  The chairperson commented:</p> <blockquote> 	There needs to be a Statutory obligation on State bodies to do more than respond to crises.  They also need to have accountability to take steps which prevent adult abuse and uphold people's rights. </blockquote>  <p>It is a timely reminder for a number of reasons, as this week we debate the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Bill and, disturbingly, over the weekend, we saw revealed in reports by Maeve Sheehan in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, Kitty Holland in<i>The Irish Times</i>and Catherine Reilly in <i>The Medical Independent </i>further major concerns arising from the Brandon case in Donegal and the safeguarding issues it highlighted.  The latest report, apparently delivered internally within the HSE, now contains allegations of rape going back to 1992.  It is also revealed in correspondence between the HSE and HIQA, dated 7 March this year, that HIQA's deputy chief inspector of social services called for &quot;The review of governance structures should not be limited to local... level but should also include the overall national governance and oversight structures used to identify and respond to issues that may arise...&quot;.</p><p><i>The Medical Independent </i>revealed that a social care risk register for the safeguarding and protection team, SPT, dating from 2021, showed that risks related to staffing were ongoing.  The SPT has been operating at 75% capacity since March 2020 due to staff redeployment.  There was a risk of the SPT &quot;not being able to continue to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 if staffing falls any further due to leave or illness of remaining staff&rdquo;.  On 28 June 2021, another staffing risk was recorded, which was due for review on 3 July.  It read:</p> <blockquote> 	Due to 50 per cent reduction in staff there is a significant risk that the safeguarding team may not be in a position to provide a cohesive service across CHO 1 [again].  We currently have no staff in Donegal and have lost 0.5 of our staff in Cavan/Monaghan. </blockquote>  <p>This was all happening while I was being told by the HSE that everything was fine.</p><p>I do not believe these allegations are new to the HSE.  They were part of what the whistleblower told me in 2006, they were part of what I brought to the HSE at that time, and were in the available HSE files at Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court.  I believe they were suppressed by management within the HSE at all levels, right up to the very top, and only for the dogged determination of the whistleblower, these journalists, myself and, thankfully, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, all this would have been conveniently swept under the carpet.</p><p>I am calling on the Government and the senior Minister finally to stand up to the HSE, to stop accepting mediocre management and lack of transparency and to get the Brandon report and other linked reports published in full, so we can confidently put in place the measures to ensure this never happens again.</p></speech>

We can respond to the Deputy on a bilateral basis in more detail.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 does not extend to people who are involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 or detained subject to an order under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The Attorney General's office has identified legal issues that need to be addressed before the 2015 Act can be extended, specifically around ensuring that detention orders continue to be valid in cases where all treatment is refused.  The Government supports the extension of the principles and provisions of the Act and its 2022 amendment Bill to individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  The Government will extend these provisions to this cohort of people through the mental health Bill, which is being drafted.</p>  <p>  People accessing mental health services generally can avail of decision-making supports under the 2015 Act, including people receiving treatment on a voluntary basis in approved centres.  The Act provides for the introduction of decision-making supports to help individuals with impaired decision-making abilities to make decisions about finances, healthcare and personal matters.  The Act is not yet fully commenced.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has prepared an amendment Bill, which is expected to pass through the Oireachtas this month.  Its amendments will allow the Act to be fully commenced.  Currently, the 2015 Act's provisions do not apply to people whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act, those being, people who are involuntarily detained under that Act and people detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.</p>  <p>  On a parallel track, the Department of Health is progressing a mental health Bill based on the general scheme agreed by the Government last July.  It is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has put a considerable amount of work into it.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office.  While the official advice has not been received, the Department has been informally told that, if the 2015 Act is amended so that its provisions fully apply to people detained under the Mental Health Act, there is a risk that, where such an individual refuses all treatment, the basis for his or her detention may become invalidated.  The Attorney General's office has advised that further work is needed to safeguard against a situation arising in which people who pose a risk to others cannot be detained and treated where they refuse all treatment.  The office has also advised that this policy work would be more appropriately addressed in the mental health Bill.  That Bill will significantly update and overhaul existing mental health legislation, including provisions relating to consent to treatment under Part 4.</p></speech>

I will speak to the Brandon report.  This is a long, drawn-out saga and what stands out to me is that HSE management failed the residents of Ard Greine Court, who are vulnerable adults for whom we as a society are asked to care.  HSE management also failed Brandon, a highly vulnerable adult.  Importantly, in the ensuing mismanagement of the case, the HSE has failed its front-line staff as well.  The concealment of the truth at any cost, which to my mind is the only conclusion one can draw as being the <i>modus operandi</i>of the management's response, is dictated from the very top of the HSE.  This leaves the staff on the ground abandoned even though they were the ones highlighting the problems throughout.  This is not a Donegal or CHO 1 problem alone.  It is a national problem.  Previous Governments tried a similar thing with Garda corruption, in that they tried to box it off and claim it was only in Donegal.  We saw where that got us.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is conducting a review of safeguarding in Donegal.  It should be published when completed and I ask the Minister to ensure that it is.  The Minister of State intends to, but the whole of the Government must ensure that it is because doing so would be vital for all of our citizens.</p></speech>

She has been to Donegal and held a series of meetings on the matter there.  She is most anxious that the full details in the Brandon report be published as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is introducing a safeguarding Bill.  She expects to have it before the Oireachtas before the end of this year.  That will provide an opportunity for the Oireachtas to tease out these issues in detail and ensure that we have adequate safeguards in place for vulnerable people who are under the care of the State.</p></speech>

The price of these goods is skyrocketing and it is driving inflation mad.  We need an urgent debate on this in this House.  The Minister talked about the &euro;2 billion the Government spent but that is wiped away on a daily basis because people cannot afford to heat their homes and put fuel in their cars.  They have to choose between heat, food and petrol or diesel.  Unless the Government grasps the nettle and does something, facing into the late summer and autumn, we will have terrible problems, which we have already.  We need an urgent debate on this issue.</p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group has written to the Minister's colleague to take action and he has refused point blank.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100013#N00200"><p>On Friday we had another very depressing sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>in respect of family homelessness when the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage reported that we are now back to pre-pandemic levels of homelessness, with more than 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, nearly 3,000 of whom are children.  This is the sharpest edge of the housing crisis that has been created, perpetuated and presided over by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Make no mistake, this scandal is of the Government's making.  It consistently fails to provide an adequate level of real social housing, refuses to address the problems in the private rental sector and also refuses to introduce rigorous protections against eviction.  It is now time to see sense.  I do not know what will shame this Government into action, if these figures and almost children 3,000 children in homelessness do not.  People are sick of kids growing up in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  When will we see sense?  When will we see the Government take the actions that will work to address this crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100013#N00300"><p>Any increase in the level of homelessness is deeply regrettable and disappointing and warrants action from Government.  That is why we are acting.  This is the number one priority for the Government.  We are investing a record amount of money to increase the supply of all forms of housing, including public and cost-rental housing as well as the introduction of new affordable schemes.  We are also working with the private sector and the Land Development Agency.  We are seeing progress in relation to supply and that is ultimately the solution here.  Nearly 35,000 homes commenced construction in the year to March 2022 which is the highest rolling 12-month figure since records began.  We will deliver close to 12,000 social homes this year, of which 9,000 will be new builds.  The cost-rental model is now being rolled out.  It is about delivering as much as we possibly can to address the homelessness challenge, which is growing and is of serious concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100013#N00400"><p>Truly shocking figures on homelessness were released over the weekend, with over 10,000 people without a home nationally, almost 3,000 of whom are children.  There are more than 7,000 people in Dublin without a home, a shocking figure.  We also have obligations to the Ukrainian community here.  I welcome the Ukrainian Action in Ireland representatives who are in the Public Gallery.  We are all very conscious of the need to deliver on housing and to deliver an effective housing policy.</p>  <p>  Earlier I attended the re-launch of Raise the Roof and commend all those involved in this very broad-based coalition which has put forward very reasonable and sensible proposals to ensure that we see a supply of affordable homes coming on stream and that these affordable homes are delivered swiftly in order to address the really serious and chronic needs of so many communities across the country and in our capital city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100013#N00500"><p>I also welcome the Ukrainian representatives to the House.  I share Deputy Bacik's view about the level of priority that this must be afforded.  The Government is investing a record amount of money and that has to be translated into the delivery of homes.  Ultimately, what will make a difference here is the breadth of different types of tenure and making progress on that.  This includes cost rental, which is a very welcome innovation in Ireland.  It is good to see individual schemes coming on stream now.  There will also be affordable purchase schemes, including in Cork city, coming on stream in the coming weeks.  That is very welcome.  Private supply is increasing as well.  We are investing in tackling voids.  We had over 5,200 exits from homelessness over 2021.</p> <p>Additional local authority homes are being brought on stream, with more than 6,000 delivered across 2020 and 2021 via the voids programme.  A further 2,000 homes will be remediated this year.</p></speech>

These subsidies will be used to build apartments that, according to an analysis by the <i>Business Post</i>, will only be affordable for people on the top 15% of incomes.  In the D&aacute;il and the national media, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has repeatedly stated that the subsidies will be going directly to homeowners and not to developers.  This is simply not true.  Documents published by the Housing Agency state clearly and unambiguously that these subsidies will be paid straight into the accounts of developers' solicitors.  When the Cabinet signed off on this, were Ministers aware that these subsidies would be paid directly to developers or were they given the same incorrect information that the D&aacute;il has been given?  Were the Minister and his colleagues misled and told that the subsidies would be given to homeowners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100014#O00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  This is one aspect of Housing For All.  The starting point is to acknowledge that we have a problem in that we are not seeing build-for-sale apartments being built.  We are not seeing them in Dublin to any great extent and we are not really seeing them elsewhere throughout the country to any extent at all.  In my city of Cork, the last private sector development where apartments were built for sale was finished back in 2008.  Since then, the only apartments built in the city were those built by local authorities or approved housing bodies, supported by the State.  We have a problem.  If we want to implement our national planning framework, if we want compact development and if we want all of these exciting, brownfield regeneration sites to be developed in our cities, we are going to have to do something.  This initiative is designed to ensure that apartments are built for sale for owner-occupiers and will make the development of such apartments viable where that would otherwise not be the case.</p></speech>

It held a similar protest five months ago.  One of its main calls at the time was for a meeting with the Taoiseach.  At today's protest, there was a sense of music and a sense of poetry but there was also a deep sense of hopelessness and despair within the Traveller community regarding Traveller mental health.  It is an atrocious situation.  On "Morning Ireland" earlier, a member of the Traveller community spoke about the 29 members of her extended family who have died by suicide.  That is an absolutely atrocious situation.  I have two questions.  Will the Taoiseach meet with representatives from the network immediately?  Will the action plan for Traveller mental health be implemented as soon as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100014#O00500"><p>I thank Deputy Gino Kenny for raising this matter.  I will not speak for the Taoiseach, but I do not believe he would be reluctant to have a meeting.  This is an issue that we will refer to his office.  I wish to reassure the Deputy that the finalisation and publication of the national Traveller health action plan is a priority issue for the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Mary Butler, and the HSE expect to publish the Traveller health action plan in the coming weeks.  We look forward to seeing that published and implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100014#O00600"><p>Budget 2022 contained an announcement regarding free GP cards for the under-sevens.  Some 80,000 children will be able to avail of the scheme.  The problem for my constituents is that not all GPs are accepting these cards.  People are being told that if GPs are not going to accept the card or are not taking on any more patients, they have to find other GPs who are doing so.  Families are familiar with their own GPs.  When can we expect these GP cards for the under-sevens?  How will the parents of these children get GPs to accept the cards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100014#O00700"><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is very keen to advance the extension of free GP care for children aged six and over.  He has had ongoing dialogue with the representative bodies of GPs to ensure that this can be implemented as quickly as possible.  I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy with the specific update as to the timeline involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100014#O00800"><p>There are many crises at present.  I refer to those relating to housing, mental health, the Passport Office and other areas.  I welcome Mr. Tom O'Callaghan, of the Independent Postmasters Group, to the Public Gallery.</p> <p>Our post office network is forgotten about.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported the previous Government by means of the confidence and supply agreement.  Now that it is in government, it is paying lip service - not even that - to the private contractors who are operating the post offices.  Throughout the Covid situation, they dealt with everything.  They ponied up as always.  The Government has interfered with them now as regards passports.  What is the Government going to do?  Will it take any meaningful action to save these post offices?  Hundreds of them will be lost to the service.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  It is a great pity because these are the people who are in the communities looking after people daily and looking out for them.  They provide that service for a pittance and the Government is paying lip service to them.  They are not even being mentioned now.  Hopefully, the Government will do something.  We have had report after report.  We need action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100015#P00200"><p>I too welcome Tom O'Callaghan to the Public Gallery.  The Government strongly acknowledges the important role of post offices in urban and rural communities all over the country.  Sometimes they are held up as being important only in rural areas but they are important in urban areas too.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has been working on this issue and is about to bring a proposal to Government in respect it.  We are conscious that the transformation payments that were in place are due to end at the end of this year.  The Government is very anxious to support the post office network.  I expect confirmation of a Government initiative with a view to safeguarding as many post offices as possible around the country very shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100015#P00300"><p>I joined my colleague, Senator Eileen Flynn, earlier outside the gates of Leinster House, where the National Traveller Mental Health Network held a protest calling for accountability in relation to Government commitments.  In particular, the programme for Government includes plans to publish a Traveller and Roma mental health action plan.  That has not happened yet, halfway through the term of this D&aacute;il.  I understand that it is to be published in the next few weeks, and I welcome that.  Will the Minister, who has responsibility for public expenditure, commit to funding that action plan when it is published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100015#P00400"><p>The action plan will be published in the coming weeks.  It will certainly be published by September, if not sooner.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, informs me that it will be September at the latest.  Funding is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health when they set out their priorities in the Estimates process.  That process will get under way in the next number of weeks.  The Government policy in this regard is clear.  If we are going to publish a health action plan for Travellers, it will need to be resourced and we will do the very best we can to make sure it is adequately resourced and can be implemented.  We acknowledge the very serious health issues the Travelling community are facing with regard to life expectancy, mental health challenges, addiction challenges and so on.  We will do the best we can to ensure the plan is properly funded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1455" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100015#P00500"><p>In the days ahead, secondary schools will be finishing up and primary schools will also finish their terms in the weeks ahead.  School secretaries will be finishing work as well.  A great deal of background work has been done in getting an agreed plan together, and I acknowledge everyone who has been involved in that.  There are more than 3,000 schools involved across the country.  Time is very tight.  Is it envisaged that the new pay system for school secretaries will be in place for when they finish up?  What kind of work is involved in that?  Will some secretaries get it as soon as it is up and running or will all the schools come on together at the same time?  I ask the Minister to give an indication on that.  It is especially relevant for people who are retiring.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100015#P00600"><p>There is an agreement in place and the focus is now on implementing it.  Work is ongoing with F&oacute;rsa.  It involves a complex process of assimilating information to capture accurate data in respect of each individual secretary and the application of these data to ensure each secretary is correctly assigned to the new terms and conditions if they so choose.  Secretaries will also be provided with an opportunity to confirm whether they wish to move to the new terms and conditions or retain their current terms and conditions, as the benefits of either option will be determined by their individual circumstances.  I am assured by the Minister for Education that additional resources are being put in place to provide capacity to manage this process.  I cannot give an exact timeline but it is a priority to get this implemented as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

If not, does it plan to put plans in place?  It is a case of being ullamh and having other plans.</p></speech>

This is a matter of ongoing consideration, led by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  His Department is working with my Department and other Departments to make sure the issue of energy security is fully addressed, particularly in the current climate where there is a greater question mark than before regarding the secure supply of energy.  This issue underlines the need for us to accelerate the transition to renewables.  As a Government, we passed legislation in respect of offshore wind and modernised the licensing and regulatory system.  The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that contingency plans are in place and continue to be worked on by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in particular.</p></speech>

Senator Eileen Flynn has previously highlighted that the suicide rate is six times higher for Traveller women and seven times higher for Traveller men compared with the general population.  Life expectancy for Travellers is 15 years lower than that of their settled counterparts.  The protest is seeking accountability from the Government over the lack of culturally appropriate mental health services for the Traveller community.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a Traveller and Roma mental health action plan.  What progress is being made and what can we expect in this regard?  I am aware of what the Minister said in response to the other Deputies who raised this matter but we cannot leave these people waiting for months on end.  The Minister stated that he is not responsible for the Taoiseach, but will the Taoiseach make a commitment, at the very least, to meet these people and talk about their concerns?</p></speech>

I reassure her that the Department of Health is fully committed to providing leadership and resources to ensure the implementation of the Traveller health action plan once it is agreed.  The priority now is to get it finalised and publish it and then make sure it is resourced.  As an initial step towards implementing the plan, the Department provided &euro;270,000 to expand Traveller health units last year and further measures will be considered in the context of the budget.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will be meeting with Pavee Point in the next number of weeks to further discuss how we can help and make sure this agenda is progressed as a priority.</p></speech>

For well over a decade now, successive Governments have known they were in breach of employment rights legislation.  There have been years of talking about implementing this directive and repeated commitments to doing so but very little in the way of action to actually do so.  This denial of basic employment rights cannot continue.  Is it the Government's intention to honour the recommendation of the Commission on the Defence Forces to end the free labour aspect of service?  Will the Government act on its commitment in the programme for Government to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 in order to bring the Defence Forces within the scope of its provisions?</p></speech>

The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, and I are in dialogue on that issue.  The Minister will be bringing a proposal to Government in the coming weeks in the context of its response to the commission's recommendations.  That proposal will set out how we intend to move forward into the future.  As the Deputy knows, it is the right of all workers to have their legal rights upheld.  We will be responding to the commission in all respects when that memorandum is brought to the Government in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It was a terrific game of football.</p>  <p>  With the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in the Chamber, I want to refer to the wonderful and buzzing weekend in Clones with the excitement of the Ulster final.  There were almost 30,000 fans in St. Tiernach&rsquo;s Park and that makes a huge difference to the local economy in a town such as Clones in a Border county such as Monaghan, which borders Cavan.  A conservative estimate would be that this can bring about &euro;3 million to the local economy.</p>  <p>  While it will be really welcome when the redevelopment of Casement Park happens, the Ulster final will then be moved there.  Will the Minister consider speaking to the Ulster Council and the wider GAA in regard to whether it would be possible to have a rotating Ulster final, whereby Clones would not completely lose its 100-year tradition of holding the Ulster final and, perhaps, as is the case in Cork and Kerry, a rotating final could be considered?</p></speech>

This issue has been raised in the House numerous times and there are issues in the past that need to be looked into, but there are also issues that need to be addressed to prevent harm into the future.  There are to be six specialist nurses to support people who take sodium valproate medication but only two have been appointed.  The final four positions have been outstanding for some time.

The Taoiseach was recently lobbied by Wesley Edens of New Fortress Energy, and only last week the same company distributed leaflets in the Shannon and Clare area promoting the use of liquefied natural gas and quoting all three coalition party leaders as being supportive of it.  Are we walking into the building of LNG terminals in this country, which will blow up any hopes of us reaching our climate targets or of staying within the Paris Agreement limits, and gives two fingers to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report and even to the International Energy Agency, which has stated that no new gas or oil infrastructure can be built if we are to have any hope of limiting the increase in temperatures?  Will the Government recommit to the programme for Government and bring in legislation to ban the building of LNG terminals in this country?</p></speech>

An energy security review is under way, with which the Deputy will be familiar.  She will no doubt have heard the Taoiseach earlier today emphasising the importance of the transition to renewable energy sources and the importance of us doing that in an accelerated fashion.  That is where this country and the Government are going in regard to energy policy because that is where the future is.  We want to reduce our dependence of fossil fuel quickly, although certain fossil fuels will continue to be there as a transition fuel and a back-up fuel.  The position on LNG is as set out in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

Last December, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann overwhelmingly passed a motion that, among other things, called on the Government to design a strategy in conjunction with the European Commission to fund and construct an Atlantic electricity interconnector that would plug west-coast renewable electricity directly into the European grid.  This would provide large quantities of clean and green electricity to the EU and create tens of thousands of jobs along the western seaboard.  This measure would also significantly reduce the cost of electricity for Irish homes, providing us with the cheapest electricity in Europe.  To do this, we need to establish an offshore renewable development authority to drive the type of change and strategic thinking that is needed in this country to make this opportunity a reality.  When will the Government implement the content of that motion?</p></speech>

That is why the Government passed legislation in respect of, and is setting up, the new maritime area regulatory body, which will early next year assume the full suite of statutory functions, in essence to make sure we have a system that is fit for purpose in licensing and regulating this sector.  I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to revert to the Deputy in detail in regard to the Atlantic electricity interconnector the Deputy suggested.</p></speech>

The purpose of this motion is to instruct the D&aacute;il in committee, pursuant to Standing Order 187, that it has power to make amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, I propose to introduce amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, to be held in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later this afternoon.  The Committee Stage amendments to the Bill in the motion are twofold and comprise amendments to the Electoral Act 1997, and amendments to the provision for island voting in the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.</p><p>I will now set out the amendments to the scope of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 relating to the Electoral Act 1997, or Part 6 of the amended Bill.  As the House will be aware, Programme for Government - Our Shared Future commits the Government to reviewing &ldquo;our current electoral laws and the conduct of politics in Ireland, to ensure that donations and resources from non-citizens outside the State are not being utilised to influence our elections and political process.&rdquo;  It goes on to state we will legislate to prevent this if necessary.</p> <p>In late January 2021, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I wrote to all 25 political parties on the register of political parties seeking their views on the regulation of electoral funding from outside the jurisdiction of the State and on other related matters in the context of the Government commitment.</p> <p> The amendments I intend to move on Committee Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 arise as a result of that consultation process and were informed by further engagement between my Department and Government parties.  In summary, the proposed amendments will: strengthen the definition of "subsidiary organisation" to clarify that it includes a body or association which maintains an office outside the State; amend the definition of "donation" to confirm that it includes any donation from a subsidiary organisation located outside the State; update the definition of "institution" in the light of changes in the financial services sector and to include credit unions within its meaning, which will allow political donations accounts to be opened within credit union institutions for the first time; prohibit the acceptance of donations of any value in the form of a cryptocurrency; impose a new obligation on the leaders of political parties to provide a written statement and an accompanying statutory declaration in respect of each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, stating that all donations from outside of the State, whether in cash or in kind, have been declared and that no other donations, either in cash or in kind, took place; insert new requirements into the Act to confirm that the preparation of the annual statements of accounts must be in accordance with guidelines published by SIPO and with the relevant requirements of the FRS 102 financial reporting standard and the inclusion of all property in the ownership or control of the political party and its subsidiary organisations when the annual statements of accounts are being prepared; and provide a wide range of investigatory powers to SIPO, as the body currently responsible for regulatory oversight under the Act.</p> <p> These provisions are modelled on similar powers in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  The proposed amendments are designed to strengthen and enhance the transparency measures already in place around the funding of our political system and will further protect our democracy against malign foreign influence at a time of unprecedented global threats.</p> <p> The second set of amendments to the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 included in this motion will amend the Electoral Act 1992, the Presidential Elections Act 1993, the Referendum Act 1994, the Local Elections Regulations 1995, the Local Government Act 2001 and the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to provide for same-day island voting at all elections and referendums in Ireland.  These amendments will ensure polling at elections and referendums on the islands will take place on the same day as the rest of the country.  The amendments would be inserted into the Bill by way of a new Part 7 and an amendment to section 3 of the Bill, and will amend the Electoral Acts mentioned as follows.  The amendments will remove the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts that currently allow returning officers to take the poll on islands at elections and referendums up to five days before the appointed polling day where, in the opinion of the returning officer, it would be impracticable due to stress of weather or transport difficulties to either take the poll on the appointed polling day or to deliver the ballot boxes to the count centre by 9 a.m. the following day, if the poll were to go ahead on polling day.</p> <p> The amendments to the Bill will also insert new provisions into all electoral codes to allow the Minister the power to make an order to shorten polling hours on an island at an election or referendum where it would be unnecessary or impracticable to have full polling hours due to local circumstances and taking account of the advice of the returning officer.  Such an order must be made no later than seven days before polling day and the amended polling period must not be less than four hours.  The returning officer would be required to give public notice in the polling district of the times and date of the poll.  The local circumstances to be considered include the size of the electorate on the island, distance between a polling station on an island and the count centre, advance weather forecasts or foreseen transport difficulties.  Accordingly, the amendments to the Bill will amend the existing provisions in the Electoral Acts, which currently allow for polling hours on islands to be reduced on polling day itself where weather or transport difficulties affect the commencement of the poll or the timely delivery of ballot boxes to the count centre, in order to clarify that these are emergency provisions to be used only in the event of unforeseen weather or transport difficulties on polling day itself.  The amendments to the Bill will amend the preliminary procedures for the counting of votes in the Electoral Acts to allow returning officers, in the event of weather or transport difficulties at an election or referendum that would give rise to the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island, to proceed with the opening of ballot boxes and the verification of ballot paper accounts for each box that have been received.  These tasks typically take a number of hours to complete and the proposed amendments would allow these tasks to be commenced pending the late arrival of ballot boxes from a polling station on an island.</p> <p> I look forward to the debate on the motion.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that in a debate that will last an hour, there are 50 minutes for opposition statements and seven and a half minutes for the 82 Members on the Government side.  If we are talking about electoral reform, perhaps the Business Committee might start with those disproportionate arrangements.</p>  <p>  Both the Chairman of the relevant committee and I are anxious to put on record the extensive pre-legislative scrutiny process that took place last year.  I think there were seven specific meetings with some held during the depths of Covid and the restrictions.  I thank all the members for contributing to that.  This week we will hold 12 hours of committee hearings and every Member of the House is welcome to come.  There will be many amendments.  It is important we debate this because it affects every Member in this House and everyone who will be a Member of the Houses.</p>  <p>  There is one area of concern that has not been addressed.  I welcome in particular the same-day island voting.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has worked hard on that and I welcome that progress.</p>  <p>  There is the issue of transparency in regard to donations which we will address later.  The issue of online political advertising remains regulated, but I regard it as facilitated.  I refer to the ban on broadcast media - radio and television.  Why are we allowing authoritative news sources to be deprived of revenue activity while permitting online political advertisers to benefit from it?  They do not regard themselves as publishers but they will benefit from that advertising.  We should ban online political advertising until we have properly regulated this space and until we treat all media outlets equally.</p></speech>

On the Bill itself, this legislation is of enormous importance.  Repeatedly during our discussions both as part of pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage, it was described as a once-in-a-generation Bill.  I echo Deputy McAuliffe's description of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was probably the most detailed done in this Oireachtas and a very significant amount of time was taken by members and witnesses.  It was also one of the most collegiate and cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny processes we have had.  There was broad agreement among members, irrespective of party, on the need for the most modern, well-resourced and independent electoral commission, electoral register and subsequent processes to ensure our electoral processes into the future are free, fair, democratic and of the highest possible integrity.</p>  <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he indicated early on there was an intention to bring a range of non-consequential amendments and he wrote to members of the committee outlining the general areas in which he intended to do that.  I thank the Department and its officials for organising a detailed briefing yesterday that a number of us attended.  It was helpful because, even with the best will in the world, some of these amendments are very technical and it is much better to have had that briefing before we go to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in warmly welcomes both sets of non-consequential amendments.  During the last D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had a Private Members' motion on modernising the voting arrangements on the islands passed and we supported that.  My colleagues, in particular Deputies Doherty and Mac Lochlainn, were very vocal on it in the last Oireachtas and previously and we are very happy to support those amendments.</p>  <p>  With respect to the amendments dealing with the Electoral Act 1997, anything that increases the transparency, accountability and visibility is warmly welcomed.  We have no difficulty with the amendments whatsoever and will be supporting them later on.</p>  <p>  It is important to echo what Deputy McAuliffe said.  The Chair of the committee and the committee itself have made it clear there is no guillotine and we will take as much time as we need to go through these amendments.  Members may have technical questions on the consequential or, indeed, the non-consequential amendments.  There will be plenty of time for debate around that.  We will return here for Report and Final Stages before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</p>  <p>  I have a final point, and again it is in the spirit of collegiality we had during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Deputy McAuliffe made a fair point on the speaking time.  If he had spoken to me beforehand, I would have happily given him a few minutes of my time if he needed it.  We need to return to the issue of the regulation of online social media platforms and advertising on those platforms and our electoral processes.  There was a very strong sense from all members of the committee - opposition and government members - that while the provisions in the Bill are welcome, they are weak.  It is incumbent on us, once this Bill is passed, to return and have a wider conversation about that.</p> <p>I believe there is an appetite in the committee to ensure that the same principles and values that underpin the strong restrictions on buying advertising in mainstream media should apply to social media as well.  We are very fortunate that we do not have the type of malign influence that certain forms of financial investment have in other liberal democracies around the world, and we should ensure those same principles apply to media.  I assure Deputy McAuliffe he has friends on this side of the House if he wants to pursue that.</p> <p> However, we must get this Bill through and get the electoral commission established.  It has to be an electoral commission of strength and substance, with adequate resourcing and with the power to conduct the crucial pieces of research that the Government was not willing to include in this Bill, so it can recommend further reform into the future.  I look forward to the committee's debate today, tomorrow and Friday and, indeed, next week, if that is deemed necessary by the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100018#S00200"><p>I agree with what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and McAuliffe said.  The pace of change in the evolution of online platforms is such that we will not be in a position to wait two, three, five or ten years for a reappraisal of the utility and effectiveness of this legislation.  It is an important start, but we have to remain ahead of the game and keep a watching brief on how the evolution of those platforms impacts on the way we do politics in this country, the way we campaign and the activities of citizens and others, especially those from outside the State, in that regard.</p>  <p>  I welcome this debate, but I do not think it is a debate that we should have had to force, in essence.  It became abundantly clear that the amendments tabled by the Minister of State for the select committee strayed well beyond the original intentions of the legislation as initiated and as debated on Second Stage a few weeks ago.  For a long time my party, a party that is largely responsible for much of the ethical framework that now governs Irish politics and for the change introduced some years ago relating to corporate donations and so forth, has been campaigning and committed to updating and modernising the framework in respect of how we fairly finance politics in this country.</p>  <p>  The rules we introduced about a decade ago succeeded in flushing big money corporate donations out of Irish politics to a real extent, but the bequest of cash and assets worth more than &pound;2 million from the late William Hampton to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and that party's acceptance of it exposed some of the frailties of our system and some of the anomalies that exist between both jurisdictions on this island.  It appears that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, agrees.  That was clearly outlined in correspondence it issued to the Labour Party in response to concerns we raised with it.  It seems that a party that is registered and active in both jurisdictions can accept limitless amounts of cash in the North regardless of the restrictions here.  I am not saying that as a criticism necessarily; I am saying it is a fact of life.  That is the reality and it is incumbent on us as legislators and on anybody who wishes to see a more transparent system of politics and the financing of politics on this island to call that out and to propose solutions to what is a real problem.  Frankly, I would not look to what I describe as the corrupt and amoral UK system of political financing to set a benchmark for the framework of ethics in politics in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The amendments from the Minister of State reflect some of the reforms that I proposed in my Second Stage contribution on this Bill.  Little did I think that such extensive reforms would be proposed to be inserted into the legislation at this point, welcome as the amendments are in principle.  The way in which the Bill has been wholesale amended with the intention of shunting it very hastily into the select committee, as we will do from this afternoon, is no way to do business.  I hope the House will accept that.  As I said on the Order of Business last week, these reforms are critical to the proper functioning of politics and of our democracy.  The D&aacute;il should have been given ample time to interrogate the proposals from the Minister of State properly.  I accept we will do that on Committee Stage in the select committee and on Report Stage and that the process will be mirrored in the Seanad, but we should have been afforded the opportunity to have sight of the Minister of State's proposals on Second Stage.</p>  <p>  We also did not have ample opportunity to propose amendments to the Minister of State's amendments.  Two amendments have been circulated this afternoon.  One of them is from me and one is from the Minister of State.  That is an imperfect way of doing business late in the day.  Quite frankly, it is unsatisfactory and it can lead to the making of bad law and to unintended consequences.  Officials in the Department said at the very welcome briefing yesterday, which we all welcomed and found very useful, that many of the ideas reflected in the amendments came from the consultation that was undertaken with the political parties in 2021.  That was an important consultation.  However, if we are to accept that, surely we should accept that those changes should have been reflected in the initial Bill and not brought forward in such a hasty fashion.</p>  <p>  In the short time I have left I will speak to some of the amendments.  Bringing so-called subsidiary organisations into the ambit of the financing and donations sphere is very important, as is the requirement to declare all properties owned by political parties and subsidiary organisations and put them into the ambit of the system.  We know that most wealth in this country is held not in cash but in assets, such as land and property.  Where there are assets such as wealth in property there is wealth and that has to be recorded.  We must be very clear about who owns those properties and assets.  That is in the public interest.  It is important, too, that annual statutory declarations will have to be made by party leaders and that these will include all donations from subsidiary organisations from outside the State.  It is interesting that the Department confirmed in the briefing yesterday what I had suspected from my first reading of the relevant amendment, which is that this will not be governed by donation thresholds currently in place but instead it will apply to all donations in cash or coin from outside the State.  That is an interesting proposal and I expect we will have some detailed debate about it.  My understanding is that donations can still be made by citizens residing outside of the State in the normal way, once they are within the SIPO personal and corporate donations thresholds.</p>  <p>  It is also very welcome that official accounting standards in terms of the recording and presentation of accounts will be required if the Minister of State's amendments are accepted, and I expect many of them will be.  Again, this is very important for transparency and consistency.  It will mean that every party will know what its obligations are, what the reporting and accounting standards are and, significantly and critically, the general public will be able to compare and contrast the financial position of each registered party.  Nobody involved in politics in this country and nobody who is committed to democracy should fear transparency.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage later today and throughout the week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-31a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022053100018#S00300"><p>First, I welcome this Bill.  It is important legislation.  Establishing an electoral commission is long overdue.  It is an important measure, and the main thrust of the Bill is one I welcome.  As I outlined on Second Stage, I have a slightly different take on this from that of other parties.  While I welcome the legislation as very good, it is weak in some places and must be strengthened, especially in areas around voter education.  I have tabled amendments on that which we will discuss shortly on Committee Stage.  I hope the Government is able to accept some of those amendments.</p>  <p>  I agree with the other Deputies about the importance of ensuring there is strong regulation of what happens online on social media during elections.  It is an area that is not sufficiently regulated, and the Bill does not do it sufficiently.  There has to be very strong transparency regulation and restrictions in that area.  It is certainly something on which I am happy to work with other Deputies and other parties.</p>  <p>  Regarding the process in respect of the later amendments that have been introduced by the Government, I have no issue with being flexible and efficient in the legislative process but we must have a certain amount of time built in to allow for sufficient scrutiny.  To explain, we were given the briefing note from the Department on these new amendments when it was emailed to us at 12.05 p.m. today, approximately three and a half hours before this debate.  We have other things to do so it is not as if we can simply drop everything else and go straight to the briefing note and analyse it.  A group of these amendments are about more transparency in the electoral process, but we need more transparency in the legislative process, which means that if a briefing note is circulated about new amendments, and it a good idea to have a briefing note circulated, and it is received three and a half hours in advance, after only receiving the briefing yesterday, there is insufficient time to engage and to scrutinise properly.</p></speech>
