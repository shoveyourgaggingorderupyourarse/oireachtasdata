For those who do not understand that challenge, I encourage them to listen back to the recent  "Drivetime" reports by John Cooke who gave views from the ground.  I want to discuss with the Minister how the town and village scheme and the scheme to encourage people to move back to towns and villages are progressing.  Will he also outline his key priorities in this area in 2019?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300003#A00600"><p>The town and village renewal scheme forms an important part of the Action Plan for Rural Development and has the potential to stimulate economic recovery and job creation in towns and villages across rural Ireland.  The scheme is specifically focused on rural towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000.</p>  <p>  The town and village renewal scheme was introduced in the second half of 2016.  To date, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country.  The projects cover a range of activities, from improving the public realm to make towns and villages more attractive for locals and visitors alike to job creation initiatives such as the development of enterprise and digital hubs.  Details of the 2019 town and village renewal scheme are being finalised by my officials.  I anticipate that the scheme will be announced during the first quarter of the year, with approvals being announced in the second half of the year, as was the case in previous years.</p>  <p>  The scheme to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages is under way.  I launched the initiative last October and announced the six rural towns which had been invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme.  The scheme is being led locally by the local authorities, in close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and my Department.  Up to &euro;100,000 is being made available for each participating town.  The funding will be used by the local authorities to engage with communities and local businesses and identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in rural towns.  I expect to receive a report from each of the local authorities in the first half of the year on the progress they have made.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified in the six pilot scheme towns will lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the rural regeneration and development fund in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300003#A00700"><p>The Minister has said funding of &euro;53 million has been approved for the town and village renewal scheme.  Will he confirm for the House how much of that sum has been drawn down?  The replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister indicated that there had been a &euro;2.5 million underspend under the programme in 2018.  Will he confirm whether the money has been spent since and if all of the money allocated in 2018 was spent?</p>  <p>  The Minister and I see the effects of both schemes daily.  There is significant potential in towns and villages, but there is no sense in the Minister ploughing away with this initiative in his Department if other Departments are ignorant of what is going on or not co-operating with his Department.  For instance, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should provide for rates remissions for those who invest in their properties.  Instead, if someone invests in a business property in a small town or village, he or she receives a bigger rates bill.  There is significant space overhead in many properties in towns and villages that would be ideal for use as assisted accommodation or accommodation for older people who want to live near services.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should engage with the Minister to devise a scheme for existing properties to get people back into services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is dragging its feet on the GP contract.  A GP service is essential in any local community.  It, too, would help to keep people in rural areas and encourage others to move back.  The schemes should be bigger.  What else is going on at the Government table to provide services in local communities?</p></speech>

To be fair to the local authorities, the schemes were always intended to be run over a 15-month period.  We allocated the funding in October and expect it to be spent this year.  It is a rolling scheme and that is the way it will operate, regardless of who will have this job in the future.  That is the way it has to be because local authorities are not able to deliver schemes within the year.</p><p>They need a bit of time to get their Part 8 projects in place and there is other work they need to do.  Local authorities have not had themselves in glory around the country on this programme or any other.  I will ask my officials, over the next number of days, to write to the local authorities about all of the funding I have allocated under the CL&Aacute;R programme, outdoor recreation, rural recreation and I will seek four-monthly reports from the local authorities to see what they are delivering.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, the town and village scheme has been very good.  We allocated &euro;200,000, for example, for the community centre and Ballinglen Arts Foundation in Ballycastle.  That was with the local developer who developed the street.  The C&eacute;ide Fields Visitor Centre gets &euro;1.5 million.  The signature point in Ballycastle and the GAA there are also getting funding.  It is not all about funding but Ballycastle is a town we should use as an example because it has been given a lift.  That has happened all over the country.  The same thing has happened with the funding we have given for the walk scheme in Drumshanbo.</p> <p> The town and village scheme has been very good, as the Deputy knows.  We allocated &euro;200,000 to Ballycastle, for example, for the community centre and the Ballinglen Arts Foundation.  That was with the local developer who developed the street.  The C&eacute;ide ields there are getting &euro;1.5 million.  Signature Point in Ballycastle is also getting funding, as is the GAA.  It is not all about funding, but what it has done for that town, which we should use as an example, it has given it a lift.  That has happened all over the country.

Out of &euro;53 million drawn down, &euro;13 million has been spent.  The Minister needs to start kicking heads.  Local authorities are great at showing up for openings but there is no sense in the Minister allocating money that is not being drawn down and spent in the communities where it is needed, and it is badly needed.  I encourage the Minister to get that information and publish it.  It is time for the Minister to start publicly calling out local authorities that are letting their communities down by not spending this money.</p>  <p>  There are substantial under-allocations and funds that are not being drawn down across many of the Minister's programmes.  Members and officials of local authorities need to be told they are letting their communities down by not drawing down this money.  The Minister needs to do more that write to them.  He needs to name and shame those poor performers.</p></speech>

Of course, civil servants do not like to give out to other civil servants and they will protect one another whenever they have to, but local authorities have not had themselves in glory.  Every week, I read cuttings from local papers all over the country and it annoys me to see Fine Gael councillors, Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and Independent councillors criticising the Government for not providing funding.  There has never been as much funding put into rural Ireland.  There has been &euro;22 million given through the LEADER programme.  The town and village scheme has provided &euro;53 million.  There has been &euro;41 million for outdoor recreation.  The CL&Aacute;R programme has provided &euro;25 million.  The local improvement scheme has provided &euro;38 million.  The SICAP programme has provided &euro;190 million.  It is not that the funding is not going in.  Sometimes the local authorities are not doing what they should do and I will tell them, in the next rounds of these schemes, that they are not to make application for schemes if they are not ready to deliver them.  That is a message that will go out loud and clear.</p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary is right that it may be the time to put out figures that show what local authorities have got from my Department.  I have a list here showing how much money each county got from my Department last year but I do not have the corresponding list of how much they have then spent and that is something I need to start working on.</p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary was talking about a pilot scheme earlier and he is quite correct.  I want to sit down with all Departments when the report comes back from the six towns.  Deputy Calleary touched on something I do not want to see happening.  I do not want every other Department throwing schemes over to the rural regeneration scheme or over to my Department.  It happens regularly that letters come in from Deputies or community programmes and the Departments wish to state they do not wish to touch them but that it is a matter for my Department.  It is not.  We need to sit down and start working that out and we will do that when we get the results from this pilot scheme.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00600"><p>My question regards the impact of Brexit, even if there is a deal but particularly if there is no deal, on the entire country and particularly rural Ireland, which will be most badly affected.  That is particularly true of the Border corridor.  The INTERREG programme recognises border corridors throughout Europe as areas of economic disadvantage by the very fact that they have a border running through them.  The Border in Ireland is a most unnatural border because it breaks townlands and parishes and cuts through the whole of rural Ireland.  It runs through a very rural area.  I seek an assurance from the Minister and his Department that plans are in place to invest in those areas in the context of Brexit.  Those areas will need an absolute commitment that we can pour money into them to try and ensure the negative impacts of Brexit will be curtailed.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00700"><p>My Department has been undertaking appropriate planning for various Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.  As is the case for all Departments, this planning has fed into the cross-Government preparations being led by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.  Planning by Government and at the EU level, for all possible outcomes, has been ramped up and will continue.  The Government published a contingency action plan, which my Department inputted into, on 19 December.  This plan sets out the Government's approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit.  We are determined that Ireland will be as ready as it can be in mitigating any impacts from Brexit and of a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  In the case of my Department the preparations in advance of Brexit have been focused on engagement and awareness in relation to our stakeholders in the rural and community development sectors.  My focus is on anticipating and preparing for all such outcomes which may lead to impacts on rural Ireland and communities generally.  I am very conscious that the potential effects of a disorderly Brexit on communities and on certain economic sectors, such as the agrifood sector, will have a major regional impact.  Therefore, a key element of my Department&rsquo;s contingency planning is to ensure maximum flexibility in our programme of funding initiatives, to allow for needed responses to emerging needs and to continue to build resilience in all communities.  The funding provided by my Department to communities throughout this country will become even more important in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00800"><p>What I take from that answer is that the preparations the Minister has made is that he will allow greater flexibility to exist in respect of funds.  While I understand we need flexibility, and we will be looking for flexibility in funding arrangements in any case, we really need a plan to seek additional funds particularly from Europe because this is a European problem, not just an Irish problem, although Ireland will meet the biggest impact of it.  We need to see from where we can get additional resources to support the small businesses that will be under threat in the Border corridor and, indeed, across the entire country as a consequence of Brexit.  These are businesses in transport, agrifood and a whole range of sectors.  I spoke to a man last week who is importing products.  He feels he will face serious problems, particularly with VAT, because, if Britain is out of the European Union, he will have to pay the VAT when he imports goods, rather than when he sells them.  That will have a huge impact on him and his business and he is not even prepared as to how to do the paperwork around that, let alone how he will pay for it.  He spoke to the bank about it.  Will he get the resources he needs?  Will he get an extension of the credit he needs to do that?  There is no answer there.  It is issues like that on which the Government needs to come in and show that it has the resources in place to protect these small businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00900"><p>I can only speak for my Department, but as a member of the Government and Cabinet, I can say that preparations are taking place on a daily basis.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that there is flexibility in my Department and there will be more flexibility.  When the time comes and if there is a no-deal Brexit, which puts certain communities and areas in bigger difficulties than others, that is where I will have to target funding.  I will do that and that is my plan.  There is flexibility within all the schemes in my Department and that is a good thing.  I will continue to leave that flexibility there.  We will deal with the areas where there is the most need.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Government.  We have played our part with regard to the plan that has been announced and we have to wait and see the outcome of Brexit.  My job, as Minister for Community and Rural Development, is to make sure that I am there to support rural communities.  At Government level, I am there on a daily basis and I policy-proof whatever decisions are made to ensure that rural Ireland is protected.  We have to wait and see what will actually happen but I stress the word "flexibility".  My Department is flexible and we will target the areas that need it most.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B01000"><p>I acknowledge that the Minister's Department is prepared to be flexible but the issue here is about more than that.  It is about the additional funds that will be needed.  I would like to hear from the Minister that the Government is working, through all its Departments, to put together a package of anticipated needs and then go to Brussels and put it on the table and say that, as a consequence of Brexit, we have many small businesses, particularly in the Border region but across the whole country, that will need additional resources.</p><p>We also need additional infrastructure to be put in place. The Minister's Department is key to that.  I welcome the funding that came, for instance, to places like the Food Hub in Drumshanbo as small businesses in places like that will need additional resources.  </p> <p> The reason why we are in this position, is because of a conflict between a member of the European Union and the European Union itself.  For that reason, it is important that Government seeks the initial funding that it requires.</p> <p> If Europe is saying it is prepared to stand behind us when it comes to the backstop and all of these matters, funds must be put in place to do this.  There is no good in saying that they stand behind us in poverty.  That is the way it is going to end up in a lot of areas in rural Ireland where we be do not have the resources or the capacity to build into the future.</p> <p> The Minister's Department is key to this and he has a role in rural Ireland.  As most of the Border corridor is very rural, he needs to come up with the goods in this respect.</p></speech>

We published a plan on 19 December.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have a fund to help small businesses prepare for Brexit.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has such plans, as does every other Department, including my own, for when the time comes.</p>  <p>  We are not in a position to talk about funding yet, until we know the nature of the problem. </p></speech>

At the start of this year, the Minister made a substantial announcement regarding the groups that were successful in securing funding and the amounts of funding.  My question specifically asks the Minister to indicate the level of supports that have now been targeted at the most disadvantaged urban communities, as had been represented by RAPID communities in the past.</p></reply>

The new programme does not ring-fence funding for specific locations.  Instead funding is allocated to each local authority area, taking into account the relative deprivation levels.  Local community development committees, LCDCs, administer the programme locally to ensure that funding is provided to groups and areas that need it most in order to address disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The LCDCs monitor the problem closely using local knowledge to ensure that funding is benefitting communities in the fairest way possible.  Over 3,000 projects have been approved to date and a list of all approved projects is available on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  RAPID areas were identified a significant number of years ago.  Over time, demographic changes meant that it is no longer appropriate to ring-fence funding to these areas.  Instead my Department takes into account the relative disadvantage of each local authority area when allocating funding and LCDCs then administer these funds at local level.</p>  <p>  The 2019 programme has not yet been finalised, as it currently being considered by my Department.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I disagree with the comment of the Minister that there is no longer need to have RAPID areas.  Such areas are the most disadvantaged urban areas.  The problems that existed ten and 20 years ago in many of those communities exist to this very day.  They do not need a level playing field; they need positive discrimination to support them and to give them an opportunity they have never had before.  The merging of these two programmes means the clarity that existed previously, where there was identified targeted funding to the most disadvantaged communities, has been taken away.</p>  <p>  The report on why these programmes should be merged has no basis.  It is a convenience rather than a practicality.  The Minister has walked away from those most disadvantaged communities.  I am not opposed to the community enhancement programme.  I am not opposed to any of the groups getting funding.  What I am opposed to is that urban disadvantaged areas, which have been disadvantaged for many years and which came through the last recession having seen their funding cut, now see that when funding is reintroduced, it is not prioritised and targeted towards those with greatest need.</p></speech>

This funding is targeted to the greatest disadvantage.</p>  <p>  On the RAPID programme referred to by the Deputy, the value-for-money report that was produced on it specifically stated it was not to be run in the way it had been run in the past.  I was obliged to change it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy must agree with me that the LCDC groups are drawn from the community.  They include elected representatives and representatives of community groups in the disadvantaged areas.  If these groups do not know where the disadvantage is, then who does?  I have tried this scheme and I am prepared to give it a chance.  I will evaluate it, however.  I, like the Deputy, want to ensure that this funding is given to those who need it most and I do not want it used for anything else.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's points on board.  I am reviewing but I do want to see that funding targeted.  I believe the people on the LCDCs are those who should know best, as they are the people on the ground and they should know their own local communities.</p></speech>

The additional funds will be made available to it where there are particular problems.  There are particular problems in a range of urban areas around the country.  These areas are not getting that targeted level of support, which the Minister clearly believes and understands makes a difference.  There are communities right across Dublin that are not receiving anything like the level of support that the inner city is receiving.  In previous parliamentary questions, the Minister referred to rural issues but what I do not wish to see is a raid on an urban fund for disadvantaged communities.  That is what RAPID funding was all about, namely, for the most disadvantaged communities with the least capacity to provide for themselves and with the greatest challenges.  Those challenges were clearly identified in the past.  They have not gone away.  The Minister has clearly articulated that in relation to the inner city.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to hear the Minister will keep this under the review. I acknowledge the great work many of these projects do.  They cannot be funded, however, at the expense of our most disadvantaged communities.  I urge the Minister to look through those programmes and identify how much of the funding he is allocating is going to those with the greatest level of need.</p></speech>

The Dublin inner city received was allocated &euro;6.5 million this year.  Last year's funding for South Dublin County Council was &euro;737,700, which provided for 120 projects that have been approved to date. These projects were ring-fenced.  I also gave funding to the Men's Shed programme and ring-fenced &euro;500,000 for this programme.  The Men's Shed is working particularly well in disadvantaged areas.  I wish I had more money to give to that group, which does a lot of work on the ground.</p>  <p>  Staying with the question the Deputy has asked, I am glad the scheme is open and that I was in the position to open it.  I put a substantial amount of money into the scheme last year from savings in other Departments.  That scheme was worthy of more support.  I could have allocated this funding to roads or other areas but I wanted to put it into disadvantaged areas.  I, like the Deputy, want to see the areas that need to be targeted receive this funding. The Deputy is quite correct in saying that these areas are to be found in both urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  I visited Dublin inner city with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I would love to bring some of the rural people up to see the level of disadvantage.  There is disadvantage in both urban and rural areas.  It would do one's heart good to see the respect these people have regarding the small level of funding that was available to them and what they do with it.  There is a great community spirit there and I would like to target more areas like that and give them the support and finances they need.</p></speech>

In the Minister's last reply he referred to the fact that the Department provided funding for men's sheds.  The Department has great capacity to provide a relatively small amount money which has an impact on a wide range of people.  Will the Minister consider putting a funding scheme in place for Tidy Towns projects, as he did for men's sheds?</p></reply>

The programme is aimed at improving community facilities to address disadvantage.  In 2018 I allocated a total of &euro;13 million for the programme, which included &euro;500,000 that was ring-fenced for a men&rsquo;s sheds fund.  The issue of whether I will be in a position to allocate funding in 2019 to Tidy Towns committees will be considered by me at later date.  However, Tidy Towns committees are free to apply, with any other community group, for funding under the general programme.  Under the 2018 programme, 158 applications from Tidy Towns groups were approved for funding under the community enhancement programme to a total amount of &euro;536,816.  They also received funding in 2018 and previous years under other grant schemes operated by my Department.  Under these other schemes, funding of &euro;2.8 million was allocated for provision for Tidy Towns committees between 2017 and 2018.  </p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the great work carried out by Tidy Towns groups across the country.  They are all independent voluntary groups and can apply for funding under this scheme.  I will look again this year to see what I can do for Tidy Towns groups which do a tremendous job in many areas.  They are cleaning up rubbish dumped by people on a regular basis.  They have to be complimented on doing so.  The time has come to start looking at ways and means to give them some support and recognise the great work they do as volunteers.</p></speech>

Tidy Towns is a national organisation which impacts positively in every community throughout the country.  It would be worthwhile if there was an annual grants scheme which, for very small money, would have a huge impact.  I encourage the Minister to look at such a scheme.  Before I came into the Chamber, I looked at the results in my area for the Tidy Towns committees that had entered the national competition this year in Clondalkin, Lucan, Newcastle and Palmerston.  Each one of them has improved its score every year and people living in the area can see the value of it.  With it comes pride of place.  While I acknowledge committees can apply under the general scheme, I encourage the Minister to consider a designated scheme similar to the one for men's sheds specifically to develop Tidy Towns on a national basis.</p></speech>

It is something at which I could and might look as no other group is more worthy of it, but it is all about the finances.  I was able to allocate the money from savings in the Department.  Perhaps I might look at having something on a more permanent basis.  In the rules and regulations I used for this and the community enhancement scheme which probably did not suit everybody, I did not stop them from applying under both schemes because whatever funding they receive they spend very wisely.  The criterion I used for Tidy Towns groups was they had to participate in the Tidy Towns competition.  Last year marked its 60th anniversary, which is why I gave a further one-off grant.  The groups do a superb job.  They have great volunteers who do not receive the recognition they deserve for doing a tremendous job which is always done by the same three or four people in every community.  As Deputy Calleary will tell us, there are voluntary groups in Castlebar, Westport and Ballina.  Those involved are out working at 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. cleaning up.  Perhaps we might support them more.  The local authorities are receiving funding from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to catch people who are dumping, a problem which is getting bigger.  It is very serious and one we need to tackle.</p></speech>

Tidy Towns committees have a positive impact on all of our communities.  I mentioned the four towns in my area in which the results have all improved year on year.  In areas which have not traditionally been part of Tidy Towns competitions Tidy Towns committees are also being established and beginning to take part in the process.  It is important that they be seen to be supported at Government level.  This year we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the competition.  Most Tidy Towns committees work in collaboration with the local authorities.  They do not operate in isolation.  They link with other community and environmental groups and the overall benefit is enormous.  They fundraise locally.  It is small money from the Department, but the difference &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 makes to a Tidy Towns committee in terms of its annual budget is significant.  The indications the Minister has given are positive.  Those of us on this side of the House will give him every support and encouragement in developing a national grant scheme for Tidy Towns committees.</p></speech>

Like the Deputy, I have a lot time for Tidy Towns groups.  Perhaps I might look at the community enhancement programme and ring-fence money for them.  It is something at which I will look because they are worthy of support.  As I move across the country to visit every town and village, I see certain projects which people tell me were carried out with the assistance of funding made available to them by the Department.  It is money well spent.  The local authorities work with the Tidy Town groups.  They need to work with them because they are doing a tremendous job and should be supported.</p></speech>

Many of the initiatives form part of the Government&rsquo;s published Action Plan for Rural Development and framework policy for local and community development which include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in communities.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I will continue to advocate for a cross-government approach to ensuring the rural and community voice is heard in matters of policy.  My Department is committed to the successful delivery of a number of programmes which provide financial and other supports for organisations throughout the country to assist in combating rural and urban isolation.  They include the seniors alert scheme, the social inclusion and community activation programme, the LEADER programme and the community services programme.  In addition, groups can input into the policy-making process through the local structures established by my Department, the public participation networks and local community development committees.  </p>  <p>  On volunteering, the call for an input paper is a first step in developing a new national volunteering strategy.  We want to hear from stakeholders as we draft the new strategy and there will be further opportunities to have an input via public consultation later in the process.</p></speech>

Since I became my party's spokesperson on mental health and engaged on various issues, there has been one issue that has consistently exacerbated any mental health issue and that is loneliness which results largely from isolation and affects both physical and mental health.  Whether in the urban centres of Gorey, Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross and the surrounding rural areas or Dublin city or Cork where I meet various groups, isolation is consistently raised as an issue when discussing loneliness and its effect on mental health.  There is much we could do.  Many of the traditional structures that helped to prevent isolation and loneliness are no more.  The State could do a lot to develop new structures where people could meet, interact and engage to combat this epidemic.</p></speech>

It is why some of the schemes in my Department such as the seniors alert scheme have worked very well.  In 2018 we spent &euro;6.984 million in supporting 19,000 new participants.  There is a new initiative which I will introduce and for which I would like to receive the Deputy's support and that of everybody else in the House.</p><p>It is the national community weekend event we intend to run in May.  We have announced some details, but we will have a national launch shortly.  We will try to get communities to host events to allow people to get to know their neighbours to reduce isolation which is one of the issues at which we are looking.  There are many people who would be prepared to visit on a voluntary basis neighbours, friends and others who need visitors.  The scheme commenced in September and will shortly be the subject of a national launch during the weekend event in May.  I hope it will encourage people to get to know their neighbours.</p> <p> I note our other schemes.  We have provided for investment of &euro;190 million under SICAP between 2018 and 2022.  To date, over 25,000 individuals have received assistance.  The men's shed movement is working in that regard also.  Another scheme people do not consider in the context of rural isolation is the local improvement scheme, under which funding is available to help people to get into and out of their homes.</p></speech>

Some villages are strong in that regard, but they tend to be the ones with schools and shops.  There are many small villages in rural Ireland that do not have that centre and we must find ways to encourage greater interconnectivity in them.  Obviously, people with disabilities and older people are vulnerable, but there are many young and healthy people, in particular, farmers, who are being isolated also.  The creamery man collects milk without talking to the farmer, while the postman leaves post in a little green box at the bottom of a lane.  Farmers can go days without speaking to anyone, which is a serious issue.  Equally, there is an issue in urban settings, including large cities.  Sometimes the loneliest place someone can be is where he or she is surrounded by people, especially if he or she is elderly.  I ask the Minister to do whatever he can to combat this epidemic.</p></speech>

In 2019, &euro;46 million has been allocated for that programme to support more than 400 organisations to deal with many of the issues raised by the Deputy.  We also have social enterprises and voluntary groups targeting disadvantage, albeit sometimes they do not fit in with the schemes I have set out.  I am carrying out a review of the community services programme and want to protect its community aspect, in particular.  At &euro;46 million, the programme receives very significant funding and the 400 organisations and groups it supports do a tremendous job for their communities.  I hope some of them might look at the issue of loneliness raised by the Deputy to determine what they could do to support elderly persons.</p></speech>

Under the programme funding is provided for small-scale projects in rural areas which have experienced significant levels of depopulation.  While the amounts available to fund projects under CL&Aacute;R are relatively modest, the impact of that funding is significant.  I have visited many projects and seen at first-hand the difference they make to local communities.  Funding of &euro;25 million has been approved under CL&Aacute;R to provide for 1,200 projects since 2016.  They have included the provision of safety measures around schools and community facilities, the construction of play areas, support for emergency first responders and a measure to provide vehicles to transport people to cancer care and respite centres.  I intend to launch a further call for proposals under CL&Aacute;R this year and will make decisions shortly on the specific measures to be supported in 2019.  I anticipate that the programme will be opened to new applications in the first quarter of the year.</p></speech>

I have seen the brilliant and positive influence it has had in the provision of playgrounds, first responders and many community events.  I have received a great deal of feedback on the impact on local primary schools of traffic calming measures, in particular.  I have raised with the Minister the application of Killinkere national school for CL&Aacute;R funding for traffic calming measures.  It is a rural school in a thriving community, in which well over 100 pupils are being taught by a significant number of teachers.  The principal and parents' association are very anxious that traffic calming measures be introduced.  There are few sources of funding available to small primary schools, but the CL&Aacute;R programme has been used to make provision for measures such as this.  Will the Minister outline whether traffic calming measures will be included in his next announcement and when might it be made?</p></speech>

Deputy Calleary was, however, correct in the issue he raised earlier.  I do not want to start to take on matters which it is the role of other Departments to address.  I had to do that in respect of the local improvement scheme when other Departments would not take on the role, with the result that no scheme was in place for many years.  Deputy Smyth will know how important that scheme is to County Cavan and rural areas in general.  She is correct that if there is one good scheme, it is CL&Aacute;R.  While it is small money, a great job is done.  I will look at the issue raised by the Deputy in that context.  I am looking at new schemes to support rural communities that cannot draw down funding from other Departments which are not coming forward to support them.  In particular, I have no difficulty in supporting the provision of child safety measures at schools.  To be fair to the Deputy, she has acknowledged that the CL&Aacute;R programme has worked well.  We have done a great deal of very good work on school safety, including providing warning signs that there is a school ahead.  I am sure we have saved many lives nationally as a result.  I will be opening the scheme again shortly and considering ways to improve CL&Aacute;R.  However, I do not want to find myself taking on the work of other Departments as the minute one starts to do so, the funding will be drawn away.  I need to sit down and work with other Departments also.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that LIS funding should come from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If it did, there would be more money for the Minister to give to rural communities which is what he is all about.  Killinkere national school is very curtailed in what it can do and there are many schools in the same position across the country.  For instance, the car park is actually located across the road from it and there is no safe drop-off point.  The principal and school management do their best to ensure the school is as safe as possible, but the car park is still located across the road and tremendous worry, angst and frustration have been experienced in the community for many years.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to be mindful of the need for flexibility in that regard in any further announcement he will make on CL&Aacute;R funding.  Funding for projects such as this is not easy to attain for small primary schools in the countryside.  The Minister's role is making countryside communities and rural areas thrive.  CL&Aacute;R funding has had a great influence in that regard.  However, I make the case again for Killinkere national school.  It has applied unsuccessfully for CL&Aacute;R funding before, but the parents' association, board of management, staff and management are anxious to access it now to make their school a safer place.</p></speech>

Under the scheme support is provided for schools in the provision of community safety measures.  When it comes to safety measures, there is some flexibility.  As such, I ask the Deputy to send on the details and I will have a look at them.  The other area at which I looked last year was the provision of support for mobility and cancer care transport services.  I found that it was a major problem in rural Ireland and that the resulting scheme worked very well.  Many patients had not been able to get to their cancer care appointments and the HSE had reneged in the provision of funding to support them.  Voluntary groups had taken up the call, but they were finding it very difficult to source funding for their buses to bring patients to and from cancer treatment appointments.  It was one of the schemes I introduced last year and I continue to look at ways and means to introduce schemes to help to provide a benefit for communities in rural Ireland.  That is what it is all about.  As such, the Deputy might send on the details of the individual case and I will have a look at them.</p></speech>

To date, 1,644 projects with a grant value of more than &euro;55.8 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.

Of this total, more than &euro;12.5 million of project expenditure was incurred in 2018 compared with just under &euro;700,000 in 2017.

The Minister said 1,644 projects are worth &euro;55.8 million.  When is that money anticipated to be drawn down?  Will it be during 2019 or 2020?  With only two years remaining, does he envisage an extension to the LEADER programme?  What is the final date on which he expects LAGs to be able to draw down money in the context of the programme?

As I said in my reply, there has been a major improvement, given that two years ago there was only &euro;700,000 in expenditure whereas last year there was &euro;12.5 million, and I expect that to be further ramped up this year.  It is expected that 80% of the project budget will be approved by the local action groups by the end of 2019, and further funding can be allocated to projects up to the end of 2020.  Project promoters have a further three years to complete the proposed works and submit claims for payments.</p></speech>

As Minister, I have made all the possible changes that were sought.</p>  <p>  Approvals have been made and now it is a matter for promoters and the people who received the grant aid to do the work and draw down the funding.  It is similar to what the Deputy rightly said earlier in that I can deal only with the issues that are in my remit.  I addressed the issue of the logjam that existed and I made it easier for the LEADER programme to be implemented.  The funding has been allocated and the groups must spend the money.  To be fair to the Department and everybody involved, we pay groups as the receipts are received.  As the Deputy will know, I must be careful.

Since its inception, the competition has grown from 52 entrants in 1958 to 883 entrants in 2018.  The continued success of the competition is due to the countless hours of effort from Tidy Towns committees the length and breadth of the country.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring was delighted to be in a position to announce grant funding to Tidy Towns committees of &euro;1.4 million for each of the years 2017 and 2018 to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition.  This funding has allowed the committees to prepare better for the annual competition through the purchase or upgrade of small equipment and other materials.</p>  <p>  Under the 2017 allocation, 906 Tidy Towns committees received grant funding of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;4,000, depending on the size of their town or village, while under the 2018 allocation, 722 Tidy Towns committees have received similar levels of funding to date, with a number of applications still to be processed.  Later this year, the Minister will consider whether he will be in a position to allocate funding to the Tidy Towns committees through this funding stream in 2019.  It should be noted, however, that Tidy Towns committees can apply, as community groups, for funding to other schemes within his Department, such as the community enhancement programme, which is administered through the local community development committees, LCDCs.  In 2018, 158 applications were approved for funding of &euro;536,816 to Tidy Towns committees under the community enhancement programme.</p></speech>

I come from a village, Rathvilly in Carlow, which has the honour of winning the Tidy Towns competition on three occasions in the early years - 1961, 1963 and 1968.  Considerable effort has been made in recent years in my community, as in every other community, to try to return to former glory.  It is important that communities are made aware of any potential funding early in the year in order that they can plan and develop whatever projects they may have.  While funding is always welcome, if it is received mid-summer, it is too late because much work will have been done to get ready for the visit of the judges in June, July or August.</p>  <p>  It has been indicated that funding may be made available.  When exactly does the Minister of State expect that to happen, given that plans need to be put in place at this stage of the year in order that communities can have a fair idea of what to expect later in the year?</p></speech>

The Minister is discussing the matter with his officials and he will make his decision as soon as possible in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While on the subject, it is important to acknowledge that SuperValu has been involved in the competition for many years and it provides much support and cohesion to communities throughout the country.</p><p>I want to congratulate Listowel, even though I do not believe there are any Kerry Deputies here but perhaps there are, on winning the national award, which is a great honour for any town.  I was in Abbeyshrule in December presenting the certificates.  The pride in the members of every community who arrived on the night for the regional awards was palpable.  The local authorities play a great role in that respect also.  To answer the question, the Minister will make his decisions as early as possible in the coming months.</p></speech>

I come from a village that won the award on three occasions.  Carlow has quite a good history in that regard.  Only two years ago the village of Clonegal won the tidiest village national award, which was a great achievement for it.  Previously, Leighlinbridge, in County Carlow, also won a substantial award.  The clarification is welcome but it is important that the plans are put in place early in the year.  Some communities are looking at different ideas including developing community gardens, which is a different initiative.  It is important that that can be put in place.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the sponsorship, on which I compliment the Minister, and ensure that sponsorship is continuously available.  SuperValu plays a major part not only in sponsorship but in its promotion on national television and media.  I compliment everybody in that regard.</p>  <p>  I reaffirm the importance of having an early date for the announcement of any potential funding that might be available to ensure that communities can put their plans in place in terms of the extra expenditure that may be available to them.</p></speech>

He has had discussions already with the Department.  The important point is the valuable work being done by the Tidy Towns committees, which is so relevant when we talk about our environment, climate change and keeping communities tidy.  The committees do a great deal of work on a voluntary basis picking up rubbish on a Saturday or whenever that has been dumped by people who are selfish.  It is important that we recognise the work they do but also that we cite those who do not have any regard for the environment or pride in the areas in which they live.  I hope we will see Kilkenny coming back up again-----</p></speech>

There was a huge level of interest in the programme right across the country following its launch so I was delighted to be in a position to allocate additional once-off funding to the programme later in the year, and the final amount allocated was &euro;13 million.  This included &euro;0.5 million that was ring-fenced for Men's Sheds.  More than 3,000 projects across the country were funded, all of them targeted at enhancing facilities in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  The details of the 2019 programme are currently being considered and will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

In the areas RAPID used to deal with, we do not see the impact of it as clearly as one would see it in a rural village or area.  I stay in the north inner city when I am in Dublin and I notice there are major problems of deprivation and decline in the area.  Entire streetscapes need a major amount of enhancement and other work to be done.  The people in those communities want a chance and any effort that can be made to invest in those areas, as well as in rural areas, is absolutely necessary.</p>  <p>  The amount of funding provided seems to be very small compared to that made available last year.  While I acknowledge the Minister said that the &euro;8 million allocation was a once-off, we hope it will be a once-off allocation every year, and perhaps a bit more, because it is a scheme that has made a huge difference.  We should recognise and acknowledge when something is done well.  That particular scheme has made a big difference to many small communities throughout the country.  The level of funding available needs to be increased at least to the level available last year but hopefully a little more, if that was possible.</p></speech>

As I said, in 2017 we allocated &euro;2.5 million for inner city Dublin, &euro;3.5 million for 2018 and &euro;6.5 million for 2019, in addition to the funding we allocated for South Dublin County Council.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about his own constituency.  In the Sligo-Leitrim area more than &euro;433,000 was allocated.  When I amalgamated the community enhancement programme and the RAPID scheme, there was &euro;2 million in each of them, making a total of &euro;4 million.  The Deputy is correct.  From savings in my Department last year I made a political decision.  I felt this scheme was a good one.  It was targeting the areas it should target.  As I said to Deputy Curran earlier, I have to monitor the scheme to make sure this funding is going to the most needy and disadvantaged areas.  So far, I am happy that is the case but I will be monitoring it to identify the areas that got the actual funding.  It is important that if this fund is allocated for a specific purpose it is spent on a specific purpose.  I am giving the local community development committees, LCDCs, the opportunity to do that.  I know they have done a good job this year but I will have to monitor that.  For this year, however, we have &euro;4 million in a programme.  If I can get some savings later in the year, I will look at that again.</p></speech>

Nobody is living in them and nothing is happening with them.  That is another aspect of this.  While this funding is for public and community works, there are many people who own buildings that are a liability rather than an asset.  If some element of a scheme could be brought in to provide funds to help people turn those liabilities into assets in which people could live in towns and villages throughout the country, it would make a huge difference.  I have spoken about that to the Minister previously but at this point we know there are major problems in many areas of the country.  One of the big problems we have is housing, which is an issue all of us and every Department has a responsibility to try to do something about in a proactive way.  I am aware some local authorities put the squeeze on people through threats of compulsory purchase orders and so on.  In most cases they cost a lot of money and they do not work.  If some incentive could be put in place to encourage people to generate these buildings into housing accommodation for people they would become an asset they can use: the Government would get tax on it as well.  It makes common sense and I implore the Minister to do something around that issue.</p></speech>

This is a very good programme and I believe the funding was allocated fairly.  I gave &euro;125,000 to every local authority.  I then looked at disadvantaged areas and gave 60% for those.  I refer to 40% of the population.  It was distributed fairly throughout the country.  The funding can be used for CCTV equipment, energy efficiency projects or community amenities.  It is a scheme that can be used at local level.  The LCDCs will look at it.  They will make the decisions.  They are the ones on the ground who should be able to identify the areas with the most need.  That is why I am hopeful this scheme will work and that we give the funding to the people who need it most.</p></speech>

Since then, more than 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R.  The type of projects which have been supported include safety measures around schools and community facilities, the provision of play areas, supports for first responders in emergency situations, and a measure to provide vehicles to transport people to cancer care and respite centres.  Total payments under the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2018 amounted to &euro;6.9 million.  This figure includes some payments in respect of 2017 CL&Aacute;R project approvals where projects continued into 2018.

CL&Aacute;R is an important scheme.  We did quite well in County Clare in last year's allocations.  We scored in Kilmaley, Quilty and O'Callaghans Mills under measure 1.  That funding allocation means a lot to those communities.  The school communities of Coore, Doolin, Drumandoora, Labasheeda and Rineen also benefited from funding.  I compliment the Minister on allowing an appeal for the first time under the CL&Aacute;R grants last year with regard to measure 2 projects.  Two schools in County Clare, Lisdoonvarna national school and Tubber national school were successful on appeal.  They were able to draw down in the region of &euro;50,000 each.

He is right that the CL&Aacute;R programme is great.  I can target it and look at ways to deal with rural and urban disadvantage to see what can be done.  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme in light of the 2016 census figures.  Many areas may not need to be in CL&Aacute;R now, but there are many which should be in it.  I find that myself in my area, where I see areas that have moved on.  I need to look at ways to get areas in that are not in the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The Deputy is quite correct that the measures we have introduced have worked well.  I have seen the benefits of it from schemes that I went around the country to look at and that I have opened.  The community itself contributes to it.  It is a great scheme and I am delighted that I reopened it.  It works well.  I want the money we have allocated to be spent.

Some &euro;220 million of this has been allocated to the local action groups, LAGs, which deliver the programme throughout the country.  The allocation is used by the LAGs to administer the programme and to fund individual LEADER projects in their areas.  The remaining &euro;30 million in funding is available for schemes which will be administered at a national level.  This includes funding under the LEADER food initiative and funding to support local action groups that come together to deliver projects on a collaborative basis.</p>  <p>  Total expenditure to date under the LEADER programme is in excess of &euro;38 million.  Project payments, in particular, have increased significantly in the past year, as approved works are completed and project promoters submit claims for payment.  Approximately &euro;13.6 million was spent on projects since the commencement of the programme up to 14 January this year.  Over &euro;12.5 million of this amount was spent on projects in 2018 compared with just over &euro;700,000 in 2017.  This is a substantial increase in the past 12 months.  More than 1,600 projects with a grant value of almost &euro;56 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.  A further 355 projects, requesting funding in excess of &euro;22 million, are at various stages in the approval process.  The progress being made by the LAGs, together with the administrative improvements introduced by my Department, will result in a continued increase in project approvals and payments.  As a result, I am confident that all of the funding allocated to LEADER will be fully drawn down during the course of the programme.</p></speech>

We sincerely hope that every cent of the allocated money will be spent by the end of the programme.  I note from figures the Minister gave me recently that in my counties, Cavan and Monaghan, local action groups have a substantial programme and a good level of commitment.  I realise that between the end of November and the end of December there was a substantial increase in the number of applications and funding committed.  I sincerely hope that will be replicated throughout the country.  As we are in 2019 now and the programme is to end in 2020, does the Minister envisage a reallocation of some funding towards programmes and local action groups that have moved the projects forward and have been to the fore in approving projects and drawing down funding to date?  Early consideration should be given to reallocation of funding if there is a possibility that some of the overall funding programme would not be drawn down.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Calleary, the level of funding in 2018 is double the amount that was approved in 2017.  That is important.  We made many changes in the programme.  I will give a straight answer to the Deputy's specific question.  I and the Department wrote to the LAGs in October or November allowing them, in their programmes in their counties, to move 25% of the funding into another programme if one set of funding was being used very well and there was not spending on another programme.  I have allowed that to happen.  I will monitor the situation with regard to funding and spending over the next months.  Some of the companies have done very well, for example, in Carlow.  It might be asked what is going on with other counties on the list.  The same rules and regulations apply to Carlow, Kerry and Mayo.  They are all doing well, as is Deputy Smith's county.  It has to be asked why it is working in some counties and not in others.  I will monitor the situation.  For now, I have allowed LAGs to transfer money that is not being used in certain programmes to other programmes without funding and I will monitor the situation.</p><p>I want to be honest with the Deputy.  I do not want to take money from any county, but if they are not spending it, I have to do something.</p></speech>

I know that the two groups with which I am particularly familiar, Cavan and Monaghan, will ensure that the taxpayers&rsquo; funding is put to good use.  That discretion is welcome.  I am sure many colleagues in the Oireachtas would have made representations to the Minister to have the application processes streamlined.  There was some movement in that respect which helped to speed up the application process.  The Minister should have an ongoing review of the way the system is working.  There should be a dividend for the groups that have been to the fore in ensuring projects are progressed if there is money unspent elsewhere.</p></speech>

We have made approximately 32 changes regarding the programme, especially to the administration of it.  I changed many actions to make it easier with respect to applications, groups and the administration of the LEADER programme.  I want to see it working.  I want to see the money spent.  I want to see these local action groups, LAGs, delivering on the programmes.  Some counties are doing very well in that regard but others are not doing as well.  I need to monitor that.</p>  <p>  I have been told that 80% of the funding for project approvals will be approved by 2018.  Allocations can be made up to the end of 2020 and project promoters have a further three years to get the work done to draw down the funding.  I cannot do any more as the Minister responsible, and neither can the Department, to simplify this scheme.  The Deputy will be aware, as he has been very much involved in the programme down the years, that there have been difficulties in some LEADER programmes throughout the country.  There have been difficulties in the way some of them were run.  I have a responsibility to the taxpayers of this country and also to Europe which is co-funding this scheme.</p></speech>

To date, 24 projects with a combined value of &euro;966,042 have been approved by the local action group.  This amounts to approximately 19% of its project budget.  In addition, a further five projects seeking total funding of &euro;247,846 are at various stages of the approvals process.

In a previous response the Minister said that 80% of the budget will be dealt with this year nationally, but only 50% of budget for County Meath will be dealt with by May 2019.  Therefore, we are significantly behind.  The Minister said projects to the value of approximately &euro;966,000 have been approved and funding of &euro;6.9 million has been allocated.  That is very weak.  County Meath, which has very few of the official urban areas and almost the entire county qualifying under rural development, badly needs this money.  We cannot stand by while there are major delays with this funding because our expanding communities, which effectively were former villages and rural areas, badly need the types of projects that LEADER funds.  It is shocking to see the amount of money that has been spent under the LEADER programme in County Meath in recent years.  It is appalling.  Much more needs to be done to ensure that money is allocated, drawn down, spent and the facilities and community development provided for.</p></speech>

No better man than the Minister to thump the table when it is required.  This needs to happen in respect of County Meath because we need this funding more than anyone.  The drawdown of a little more than &euro;37,000 is outrageous, disgraceful and needs an explanation.  The county has a population of 196,000 people in what is a rural LEADER area and we badly need these projects.  We need much more than &euro;37,000.  The Minister would allocate &euro;37,000 for breakfast for the CL&Aacute;R programme etc.  This is not what we need.  We need substantially more.  We are entitled to more and also to greater efficiency.  Clubs seeking this money have asked me what the story is with the LEADER funding.  The story is that vast improvement is needed in respect of this funding for County Meath.  It needs vast improvement.  I urge all those responsible, including the Minister and the local companies, to get their act together as quickly as possible to ensure we can benefit from this funding to which we are entitled.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, women have died of cervical cancer.  Over the weekend, I was sad to hear of the passing of Orla Church, a campaigner and cervical cancer victim.</p><p>The CervicalCheck programme has been in place for a long time and has saved many lives, however I understand that it is now in crisis mode.  To work effectively it must work within certain parameters and timelines.  The capacity must match the volume of tests per annum.  When the scandal was exposed last year by Vickie Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and others, the Minister immediately announced that he had decided to provide free smears to every woman in the country who had concerns.  On 9 January we learned from <i>TheJournal.ie, </i>through freedom of information, that the Minister took this decision against official and expert advice, that the decision would damage the efficacy of the programme, would delay and cause backlogs and was not clinically warranted.  On average, CervicalCheck tests about 230,000 smears annually.  The Minister's decision last April added an extra 90,000 to 100,000 to that volume.  The Minister was warned repeatedly over a long period that this was wrong yet he proceeded without any additional resources being provided.  The additional volume of tests as a result of the decision has created an unacceptable and enormous backlogs and women have been waiting for up to six months for the results of their tests.</p><p>There is a further problem.  I understand that the delay has impacted on the quality and efficacy of the tests and has rendered a significant number invalid.  There are two elements to the test.  Cells are put on the slide and there is also viral loading which, in the detection of low-grade cell abnormalities, indicate whether colposcopy or further referral is required.  Because of the backlog and time delays this part of the test in many cases, I understand, has been rendered invalid, null and void.  Normally they would be done within ten days but because of the Minister's decision the resulting backlog has compromised the quality and efficacy of the tests.</p><p>This has serious and obvious consequences.  I asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, a specific question on this issue on 15 January.  I asked for the rationale of announcing the repeat cervical smears against expert advice and why he did not make that public at the time.  He avoided answering that part of the question and I have officially complained about this under Standing Orders.  The Minister has withheld information from the D&aacute;il and the public on developments in the CervicalCheck programme that are clearly in the public interest.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this development and the serious implications that arise from it?  Was he informed by the Minister?  Why did the Minister ignore expert advice and why did it take until December to discontinue the free smear tests?  Why again the secrecy and the withholding of information?</p></speech>

I was filled with sorrow over the weekend when I heard of her untimely passing.  I also pay tribute to her and thank her for her contribution to helping the health service to update its guidelines for GPs and others in relation to cervical screening.  I recognise that it was a very important contribution which will help women in future.</p>  <p>  I have always said, as have others, that we want some good to come from this terrible tragedy and the controversy around CervicalCheck.  Some good has come from it.  The Scally report was undertaken and is being implemented.  We put in a package of supports for the women affected by the audit including medical cards, experimental medicines and other supports.  We have taken the decision to extend the HPV vaccine to boys this year and to introduce a new, more modern smear test - one of the first countries to do so - which is more accurate.  That will be done this year.  Important progress is being made.</p>  <p>  We all know that cervical screening works.  It has helped reduce the instance of cervical cancer in Ireland in recent years and has reduced the number of deaths.  I am pleased that, notwithstanding the controversy around CervicalCheck, that women are still attending for smears and the programme is still working well.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Martin said, in May the Minister for Health decided to offer free out-of-cycle smear tests to any woman who was concerned about her health and about the accuracy of previous smear tests in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme.  The Minister made the decision in good faith to answer the considerable fears and anxieties of many women in Ireland who were worried that their recent smear tests may have been misread or inaccurate.  In the months after that, there was a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests.  This not only included the women attending for the out-of-cycle tests but an increased uptake in testing in general by women.  That increased demand put immense pressure on laboratory capacity.  The HSE has worked actively with the laboratories to manage this and to improve turnaround times for smear tests.  The HSE tells us that the laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, to provide overtime and to manage annual leave in an effort to minimise and reduce the backlog.  In addition, the HSE is trying to source additional screening and laboratory capacity which would improve turnaround times for results.  The HSE advises us that sourcing capacity and resources is a serious challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening to the new test, there is a shortage of capacity, not only in Ireland but also internationally.  However, they are undertaking to provide that additional capacity and get on top of the backlog.  Now that the out-of-cycle free smear tests have stopped, we expect that it will be possible to reduce the backlog over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Normally, the virus would be tested for within ten days, yet people are facing six-month delays.  This was discovered last year but not revealed by the Minister or anyone.  In essence, that information has been withheld.  That is why the service was discontinued.  The Minister's decision went against expert advice that warned him repeatedly that this would damage the entire programme.  It is my understanding and information that the programme is in jeopardy because of this and that further significant decisions and communications will have to occur.</p> <p> I asked the Taoiseach whether he had been made aware of this by the Minister.

Those free tests ceased to be available at the end of December last year.</p>  <p>  I was made aware of a backlog a few weeks ago.  The Minister informed me a few weeks ago-----</p></speech>

What is most worrying is that, despite the fact that this overrun is set to blow a hole in the capital budget for years to come, no one seems willing to take responsibility for it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, whose function is to supervise Government procurement and public expenditure, has gone into hiding.  Its Secretary General has refused to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to account for the Department's role in this process.</p>  <p>  On "The Week in Politics" at the weekend, the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Teachta Kyne, said that the position of the Secretary General was not sustainable.  He was right.  He offered up the view that the Comptroller and Auditor General could review the spiralling cost of the children's hospital.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed that suggestion and were hopeful that such an investigation would be forthcoming, but lo and behold, a few hours after the suggestion was made, it was rebuffed by a Government spokesperson.  It would seem that the Minister of State either misspoke or was slapped down.  Which was it?</p>  <p>  There are serious issues to be examined.  The original tender from BAM was &euro;131 million lower than the next bid.  Did anyone in government raise questions as to how the accepted tender could be delivered when others were indicating clearly that it would cost over &euro;100 million more to deliver?  Surely the Taoiseach will agree when I suggest that someone or a group of people have messed up seriously.  Will he now act without hesitation and agree to a full public investigation into what has happened and who is responsible?  This is serious stuff.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to capital spending of &euro;3 billion over the next four years.  An overrun of more than &euro;450 million will reduce that amount by up to 15% and will stop projects that have been provided for going ahead.  That is the reality.  There is significant concern in communities across the State about how the overspend will impact on them and on commitments made to fund badly needed projects.  For example, what of the commitment for a new MRI scanner at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar?  What about the second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford?  What about the Drimnagh primary care centre?  I could go on.</p>  <p>  What projects will be cut because of this scandalous cost overrun?  People want an answer to that question.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether he agrees with the Minister of State that the position of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not sustainable and that he should make himself available to answer questions?</p></speech>

It requires a reprofiling of the budget of somewhere between 1% and 2%, half of that coming from the Department of Health and the other half coming from other Departments.  Where there are overruns in expenditure, there are consequences, but it is not true to say that any project will be stopped or cut or cancelled.  Some may well be deferred.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the children's hospital, I really think we need to understand the value of this project as well as the cost.

God knows, people have waited long enough for it, but that is not the source of my questions.  I am questioning the efficacy and effectiveness of the procurement procedures of the State.  The Taoiseach should bear in mind that in the term of office of the previous Government his party made a virtue of the fact that it had overhauled procurement procedures to avoid precisely this type of scenario of cost inflation and potential wastage of expenditure by the State.  It is for that reason that Mr. Watt needs to present himself to the Joint Committee on Health.  I am well aware that Mr. Breslin is the Accounting Officer for the Department of Health, but I am with Deputy Kyne, the Government Chief Whip.  I do not believe Mr. Watt's position is sustainable and see no good reason he should not present himself to the Joint Committee on Health.  A review by PwC is all well and good, but it is not in government and running Departments.  Where we need accountability for this cock up is among people in government and the senior civil servants who advise, guide and implement Government decisions.  The Taoiseach is dancing on the head of a pin in saying matters are simply being deferred in respect of other spending.  Neither people living in Waterford who are waiting for a second catheterisation laboratory, nor people living in the midlands or Drimnagh will welcome or feel in any way reassured by the Taoiseach's distinction between a cut and a deferral.  Will he confirm for the House that he will make available a full and comprehensive list of deferred and re-profiled projects in order that people can make a decision for themselves?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, in the procurement process for any project there are a number of steps along the way.  A project must have planning permission; it must then to go to tender and be built.  We may find other projects have been delayed for reasons beyond our control.  For example, sometimes a project will not receive planning permission, which in itself creates a saving.  When we have the list, we will provide it.  However, I can assure the Deputy that none of these projects has been cancelled and stopped.  The report on the inquiry being carried out by PwC will be made available.  The Deputy correctly states PwC is not in government.  It is also not in opposition, which means that it will be objective and not political in coming to the facts.  When we come to the facts, the report will be furnished to the Government and then published.  People can take it from there.</p></speech>

On the surface, that sounds reasonable enough.  The problem is the commission does not deal with the issue of the time it has already had.  It was set up to do a job in three years, but what we have after its four years of work is four interim reports, in the first of which it looked for a time extension.  In the second it told us why it had asked for a time extension in the first report.  Incidentally, its publication was delayed for eight months by the Minister because it also stated Bethany Home survivors should never have been excluded from the redress scheme, which issue has still not been addressed.  In the third interim report which devastated the survivor community, the commission looked for an extra year just before it should have concluded.  Now, at the eleventh hour, in another report it is looking for another year.  Is this a joke?  Do Members honestly think it is acceptable that we should wring our hands for a little while, offer a bit of sympathy to the survivors and then move on to the next issue?  I am not blaming the Taoiseach for this, but he is the one in power who could sort it out.  We need to know why the commission has not completed its work and who will be held to account?</p>  <p>  The report talks about there being a considerable workload to cross-reference documents.  It also talks about delays in obtaining evidence from the authorities which ran the institutions which could not be examined until the commission had finished the examination of the documents.  Why has this not been done?  Is it a question of resources?  If so, why did it not flag it before now?  If it is a question of non-co-operation, why did it not highlight it before now?  Why did it only receive the first tranche of documents over two years after it had been set up?  Did it not ask for them?  Was it obstructed in getting them?  Why did a commission set up by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and reliant on information from that Department and the Department of Health, in its words, to produce a "comprehensive" and "accurate" report only receive information recently, a year after its business should have been concluded?</p>  <p>  The commission talks about being dismayed that so little information had been kept by the HSE.  It finds it difficult to understand how relatively recent documents are not available.  It does not understand why the HSE does not have any system for archiving material.  Does the Taoiseach understand it?  What has he done about it?  Let us remember this is the same HSE which two years before in 2012 had produced a report on the 500 baby deaths at Bessborough.  It beggars belief.  These are fundamental issues, but there are so many more.  How come the commission can come in within budget?  How come it is not costing any more money in continuing for two extra years?  Will it not pay for remaining an extra two years in its Baggot Street offices?  Will it not pay salaries?  Did we get it wrong the first time?  These are fundamental questions, but there are so many more.  The only conclusion one can draw is either the commission is grossly incompetent or it is being deliberately misled.  My question to the Taoiseach is which is it.  Is allowing the commission to continue without scrutinising these matter in the interests of the people whom on Monday the Taoiseach so accurately and articulately stated had been betrayed by the State?</p></speech>

None of us believed at the time that it would take as long as it has for the commission to do its work and issue its report.  The commission is independent.  The whole point in having a commission of investigation is that it is independent of government.  It is not a creature of government.  Therefore, I cannot answer questions on its behalf.  If I was able to interfere in the work of a commission and answer questions on its behalf, it would not be independent and would defeat the purpose in having such a commission of investigation.</p>  <p>  The commission has informed us that it has more work to do.  So far it has interviewed 519 former residents.  It wants to interview more and everyone to have his or her opportunity to be interviewed and his or her story heard.  It has received new material which needs to be considered and a mass of documents - I am informed over 100,000 documents - all of which need to be considered properly.  It tells us that it has adequate resources and that, notwithstanding the delay, will come in on budget.  It has not requested additional resources, but should a such request be brought forward, it will be considered.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that we must wait another year before anything happens.  We will receive a comprehensive report on the burials.  It is scheduled to be presented in March.  It will give us more information on the burial grounds.</p>  <p>  We have already taken a decision as a Government, a few months ago, that investigations will be carried out at Tuam, with a view to identifying, if possible, the remains of some of the children buried there to give them the appropriate burial they should have had when they died.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, working through the consultative forum, is drawing up proposals for how we might do something to assist and support the health and well-being of former residents while we await the final report.</p></speech>

How does he know that the commission will carry out its work now?  He has referred to other interviews that need to take place and extra documentation received.  Does he not know that the report published yesterday referred to the interviews being concluded this month?  Can he tell me if they have been concluded?  The commission stated it had been expecting 277 files to be delivered in December.  Were they delivered?  Does the Taoiseach know?  If he does not, why does he not?  I do not expect him to be on top of every detail, but there is a considerable problem in this House where we set up commissions of investigation in response to appalling scandals and horrific abuses perpetuated on people in that we let them carry on and ask for extra time.  The Taoiseach does not pose or answer any of the valid questions I have raised about the reasons for the delay.  It is not acceptable.  It is a feature of Irish political life, for the Opposition and the media, that nobody follows them through.</p><p>Last May, the Taoiseach told me that in response to the CervicalCheck scandal and the lack of action on mandatory disclosure the Government would progress and implement a patient safety Bill.  That was not seen through and has been forgotten.  In response to the Grace scandal, the Government set up the Farrelly commission.  Everybody forgot about it and the time to finalise its report has been extended.  The Government must see these issues through.  I ask the Taoiseach to answer the questions he was asked about why this commission has not done the job it was supposed to do.  Is it being obstructed or is it just incompetent?  There is no other explanation, although the Taoiseach may invent one.</p></speech>

According to census figures, there are 195,263 carers, of whom 118,000 are women and 3,800 are under the age of 15.  They provide 6,608,515 care hours each week.  Women provide more than two thirds of the care and young carers under the age of 15 provide 2.2 million care hours each year.  They provide 24-hour care for some of our most vulnerable people and save the State billions of euro each year.  The most recent figure of which I am aware indicates an annual saving of approximately &euro;4 billion.  They provide care for thousands of people in their own homes, keeping them out of nursing homes and freeing up thousands of hospital beds.  I dread to think what our health and hospital services would be like without these carers.  The current health crisis would become absolute mayhem without them.</p>  <p>  However, carers receive very little financial or other support in return.  If they successfully overcome the massive 17-week delay in processing carer's allowance applications, they will receive the princely sum of &euro;1.20 per hour on the full rate or &euro;0.60 per hour on the half rate.  There is little or no respite care available to give carers a break.  Many have health problems arising from their caring duties.  Carers may be housebound due to lack of support, suffer from exhaustion or experience emotional and mental health difficulties.  The 17-week wait for decisions on carer's allowance applications is unacceptable.  Some 40% of applications are refused but, following a wait of up to 12 months for the review and appeal of applications, more than 60% of the appeals and reviews are granted.  </p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach agree to resource and staff the carer's allowance section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to enable it to issue a decision on these applications within a reasonable time limit such as six weeks?  Will the Government increase the carer's allowance payment in line with the minimum wage and ensure that respite care is available to support the health and welfare needs of carers?</p></speech>

As a Government, we are determined to support them.  Those are not just words, as we have demonstrated in the past couple of years.</p>  <p>  We fully restored the carer support grant which was cut by another Government some years ago.  The carer's allowance and carer's benefit will increase in late March to a level higher than that in place before the financial crisis.  Last year, we extended free GP care to those in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit because carers also need to be cared for.  When I was Minister for Social Protection, I brought in a 12-week rule whereby carers continue to receive carer's allowance or carer's benefit for three months after ceasing to be a carer, such as when their loved one passes away or goes into a nursing home, for example, in order to give them time to get back on their feet, readjust and find a new life for themselves.  I am very proud to have been part of making some of those changes.  Carers are allowed to work part time because some carers who we support financially are not full-time carers and are able to undertake part-time work.  The means test is among the most generous internationally and carers are allowed to earn additional income on top of the carer's payments, which are among the highest in the world.</p>  <p>  Crucially, last year and this year respite services were and are being extended because carers need time off.  The best way we can support them in that regard is to ensure that more respite is available for those for whom they care.  That is why an additional respite house is being established in every community care area in the country, a process that is very much driven by the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has apologised already for the delays in processing applications.  Work is being done to improve the situation and allocate more staff to the section to ensure that applications are processed far more quickly than is currently the case.  The applications are not always straightforward.  The process differs from other applications because in addition to a means test, a medical report to verify that the person being cared for needs full-time or close to full-time care is required.  That is one of the reasons why they take somewhat longer to process than other applications.  However, we accept that the processing times are too long and are resourcing the section and changing procedures to speed them up.  Of course, as is the case with many social welfare allowances and benefits, arrears are paid once eligibility has been determined.</p></speech>

If he were to telephone the carer's allowance section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, he would be told that the current waiting period is 17 weeks.  That is worse than was the case six months ago.  In June of last year we were told that the waiting period was 15 weeks, which was also unacceptable.  However, the situation has worsened.  I and many other Deputies are aware of cases in which those being cared for passed away during the application process.</p>  <p>  An urgent and comprehensive review of how we deal with the caring situation, including the role of and support for carers, is needed.  One thing the Taoiseach could do today would be to fully resource and staff the carer's allowance section of the Department to ensure a reasonable turnaround time of no more than six weeks for applications.  Carers are waiting for that to be done.  This is a very significant issue which the Taoiseach and the Government should address immediately.</p></speech>

However, the vast majority of applicants do not wait that long.  Some 70% of carer's allowance applications and 90% of carer's benefit applications are decided in less than 12 weeks.  However, I fully appreciate that the delay can be very distressing for the 30% and 10% of applicants who must wait more than 12 weeks.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, is working on the issue and I have discussed it with her.  I will ask her to furnish the Deputy with more detail on the actions being taken by the Department to reduce the waiting times.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach indicate how many women will have to have tests repeated?  Could he indicate when the women concerned will be contacted by the Department and CervicalCheck?  One should bear in mind that the programme covers 230,000 annually and that there are to be 90,000 to 100,000 extra because of the Minister's decision.  There is no extra capacity and there are no extra resources.  I understand quite a significant number of tests are null and void because of the delay.  The backlog is resulting in a delay of six months.  The programme is in crisis mode.  I asked the Taoiseach a number of questions.  They call for an up-front, comprehensive statement from the Minister for Health.  In the public interest, he owes it to this House to appear before it to make a comprehensive statement on this issue.  I ask the Taoiseach to allow for this.</p></speech>

The Government sits on its hands.  Last April, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a motion to the D&aacute;il that was agreed unanimously but the Government has refused to implement its recommendations.  It called on the Government to work with unions to draw up a roadmap for full pay equality, with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe, not the eight years the Government had in mind.  Despite this, at the eleventh hour letters are being sent informing patients of cancelled surgeries.  It is clear that the Government has failed comprehensively to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis.  It refuses to accept pay is an issue and that this needs to be resolved.  I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health to appear before the D&aacute;il to explain to its Members, who voted last April and set out a series of reasonable, thoughtful steps that the Government might take, why he has ignored the motion agreed by the D&aacute;il and allowed this situation to escalate to the point of industrial action, which we are facing.</p></speech>

I will deal with each of the Deputy's contentions in turn.  Her first was that the Government has sat on its hands regarding this issue.  She will be aware that we had a commitment under the current pay agreement to put in place the Public Service Pay Commission.  We honoured that commitment.  There was a commitment that this issue would be the first that the commission would examine.  That is what happened.  The commission then issued a recommendation, which the Government accepted immediately, in the next few days.  We made a specific commitment in our budget to honour those commitments.  Since then, extensive engagement has taken place between the HSE and the representatives of the nurses.  The matter is now very likely to be referred for further engagement in our industrial relations machinery and the Government will play its full role in this process.  We have to be conscious, however, of all the other public servants, the tens of thousands of others, to whom we have also made commitments.  We have a duty to them just as we have a duty to seek to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's final point was on the effort we made to deal with new entrant pay and determine how the matter could be dealt with.  We put in place a comprehensive plan in this regard that was accepted by the leadership of many of the key unions.  We are now engaging actively with them to determine whether there are ways in which this issue can now be resolved.</p></speech>

It is just as well because the Taoiseach has obviously had to leave.  In the context of budget 2019, one of the tax measures that was not provided for in legislation but that seems to have been sneaked in was a 23% rise in the price of food supplements, which is to come into effect on 1 March.  This was not done by way of legislative change, whereby Deputies of this House would have been able to deal with it in the Finance Bill.  It was done by way of reinterpretation by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The practice of zero-rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil supplements has applied since 1972.  This is a very significant issue.  There are hundreds of thousands of people across the country dependent on taking vitamins as part of their health regime.  Such a fundamental change deserves much better consideration than has occurred.  Will the Minister for Finance agree to halt the increase and engage with the stakeholders to determine whether some compromise can be arrived at?</p></speech>

It is one that I am now aware of.  As the Deputy fairly acknowledged, this is not an issue that was dealt with in the Finance Bill, nor was it legislated for in the House.  It concerns an interpretation of our tax code by the Revenue Commissioners which, as everyone knows, are independent of direction from me.  I had been aiming to deal with the matter through the tax advisory group, which publishes papers on topics such as this each summer that allow the Government and stakeholders to explore options to determine how issues can be dealt with.  In the case in question, the Revenue Commissioners have now made a decision on the interpretation of the law.  I have to accept its right to do so and the consequences of that.  In answer to the Deputy's question on whether we will engage with stakeholders on the matter to determine how it can be dealt with, we will do so but I am bound, as Minister for Finance, to abide by the interpretation of the Revenue Commissioners, which I will do.</p></speech>

It is an important and modest Bill.  I want to ask about an issue related to it but that is not covered by it, namely the arms trade between Ireland and Israel in the context of human rights commitments given by the Government in the programme for Government.

In particular, we have an interest in the huge overruns in building the national children's hospital.  Mr. Watt's Department is responsible for public procurement.

The climate forum held last Friday at Croke Park was very welcome, until the moment everyone present realised that while the Government was stating it wanted to be a champion of dealing with climate change, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment had just issued another frontier oil exploration licence in distant Atlantic waters.  The Government cannot do this while in the same breath stating it is a champion of dealing with climate change.  Yesterday, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we had yet another debate on Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's climate emergency Bill.  The Government is using amazing Kafkaesque techniques to put the Bill in limbo.  There is the amazingly weird technocratic issue of whether there is a report of the committee.  Because of the inability to decide, the the Bill is going nowhere, which is a disgraceful abuse of the power of the Parliament to manage legislation.  One of the ways to unlock the issue, apart from getting into an incredibly legally dense row about the powers of Parliament, is for the Minister to allow a debate on the fundamental issue of climate change.  Are we with the global environmental community in stating we must keep fossil fuels in the ground or will we keep playing on both sides and be hypocritical in what we are doing?</p></speech>

On the wider issue of Deputy Smith's Bill, it is not one I support.  The reality is that in any transition to a carbon neutral environment Ireland will have a high dependence on gas.  Until the discovery of the Corrib gasfield, we were 90% to 95% dependent on imported gas to support our needs.  As a result of the discovery of the Corrib gasfield, this figure has dropped to one third.  I must be mindful of the need for energy security in the path to decarbonising the energy environment.  I recognise why Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has brought forward the Bill, but I do not believe it is consistent in following the path we need to follow.  I am wholly committed to achieving the decarbonisation of the economy along the lines we have committed to following.</p></speech>

I am sorry the Minister for Health is not present as there are five Ministers in his Department.  If the number who die by suicide were killed on the roads, the roads would be ploughed up and grass seeds spread all over them such that people would have to travel through fields.  What I am asking for is proper one to one personal treatment for those who go to doctors or emergency departments and proper facilities.</p></speech>

They were schoolgoing and the number excludes 17 and 18 year olds who should have been in school.  If, tomorrow, 70 children were to die when a school bus overturned on the M8, it would be mentioned in every newspaper.  When I see nodding heads here, I become angrier and angrier and I am sure it can be heard in my voice.   The days for talking are over.  We have to start to take people's lives seriously.  The people who have been left behind have been torn asunder.  There are no excuses for it.  It affects people in schools and sports clubs.  It is across the board.  I appeal to the Government, for Christ's sake, let us get real and listen to the people affected.  We speak about the health service and overspends.  Who will staff the services?

Over Christmas and new year period hundreds of people vented their fury to me at how the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, had been allowed by the Government, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, to freely inflict almost complete lack of movement in rural Ireland without any rural-proofing of the effects it could have, or an examination of how a proper transport service could be put in place to counter such a mess that could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs in the pub and tourism industries and to allow hard-working people to come and go on a night out, something now they cannot do.</p><p>Thousands of young drivers are now not allowed to drive unless accompanied by the holder of a full licence.  That is another piece of work by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, without any measures set in place.  Young people in west Cork are waiting six months for driving tests.

The ministerial management board met yesterday in the Department.  Rural transport issues were again to the fore.  Many issues were discussed, such as the extension of the Nitelink bus service.  That is a recent decision.  The Department is also exploring how we can best serve rural communities further with alternative and newer types of rural transport.  These matters are under consideration in the Department.</p>  <p>  It is important that information is available for people awaiting driving tests and who need a driving licence for work or for college.  I advise Deputy Collins, or any other Deputy approached by members of the public seeking a test, to contact the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  There are numerous cancellations every week and there are vacancies.  If somebody needs a test at short notice, that avenue exists.  The rationale behind the legislation on unaccompanied drivers was that, statistically, such drivers were far more likely to be involved in a fatal accident and the cause of that accident.</p></speech>

I raise the situation in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9 covering Dublin north city and county.  I refer to the early intervention team, early intervention services and access to multidisciplinary teams provided by Beechpark Services and St. Michael's House.  There is a waiting time of 27 months for these services, which involve children seeing psychologists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, paediatricians, social workers, educationalists etc.</p>  <p>  There are complex problems in that part of the city.  There is also an increase in the number of children and a resultant increase in the numbers presenting, as well as those presenting with complex needs.  Parents are at their wits' end.  In some cases, children are receiving no services at all.  I refer to children with autism and other forms of intellectual disability.

The examinations are a stepping stone to college placements for many students.  One young student, Ms Rhona Butler, who is no relation although I know the family, was in the middle of her examinations during the summer when, unfortunately, her 50 year old mother, Margaret, died of cancer.  Ms Butler had to sit her leaving certificate business exam 12 hours after her mother passed away.  I am sure this is not an isolated incident and it happens throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am calling for a reasonable accommodation scheme for students who find themselves in this position.  If Ms Butler had not sat her examination that morning, she would have had to wait for another 12 months.  Examinations are stressful enough, but losing a parent during the examination makes it even more difficult.  Some form of bereavement process must be put in place.  A student who loses a parent during the examination process should have the opportunity to resit the examination two to four weeks later at some examination centre in the country.</p></speech>

It is also stated that to remedy this situation for the next 25 years is to guarantee the delivery of next generation broadband in every household and business.  We all know that is not happening.  That is a major issue in my own county and in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  We have heard announcement after announcement and yet nothing has happened.  When can we expect an announcement on the roll-out of the national broadband scheme?  I ask that because it is so important for many towns in my constituency.  Very progressive work is being done by community groups but they are being held back because we cannot deliver broadband.  It is essential that we do that.

However, 23% of our community can only get access through a national broadband initiative, which is a non-commercial initiative supported by the State.</p> <p> A submission of a final tender was made in September.  However, because of the nature of the development of that tender, there is considerable due process to be undertaken to make sure that I can bring this forward to the Government.

Families and communities throughout the country have been visited by heartbreak and tragedy because of mental health issues and County Meath is no different in that respect.  Before Christmas we witnessed tragedy when seven men died by suicide within ten days, leaving communities in Kildalkey, Athboy, Trim, Kells and Duleek in shock and grief over the period.  As a society we need to start asking ourselves really serious questions about what is happening.</p><p>In many cases mental health issues are very difficult to resolve and it is not necessarily in our gift within the Chamber to do so.  Nevertheless, some issues can be tackled by us.  As a state, we need to ensure we tackle the socio-economic reasons which lead to some people suffering from mental health issues and believing suicide is the only answer.  We can affect the way the health service treats and supports people suffering from mental health problems.  Every county has a reason to complain, but County Meath is at the bottom of the ladder when it comes to the provision of resources.</p><p>I discovered recently that before Christmas there were 32 staff vacancies in the mental health service in counties Louth and Meath.  The chief officer of the community healthcare organisation, CHO, for counties Louth and Meath confirmed to me that the 32 vacancies were in a range of grades, including that of psychiatric nurse.  It is an inordinately high number and extremely worrying that there is such a gap in the provision of key medical professionals in such an area of crisis.  Last summer we found out that the child and adolescent mental health teams in counties Louth and Meath had just over half the staff they needed to fulfil their duties.  In the midlands and counties Louth and Meath there are over 50 children waiting for over a year for their first appointment.  The Minister of State must understand mental health matters are urgent and that those involved require support and treatment fast to ensure things will not deteriorate.  This figure is the second highest in the State and has grown significantly in the past three years.  This is not something the Government has inherited but rather a problem that has been created by its lack of ability, inaction and funding.</p><p>This is unacceptable and County Meath is an outlier of how bad things are in the country.  Ireland is an outlier when it comes to how bad things are with respect to teenage suicides in the European Union.  Ireland has the fourth highest rate.  In September the HSE confirmed to me that the spend on mental health services in counties Louth and Meath was the second lowest <i>per capita</i>in the State, at &euro;121.67.  It is not hard to join the dots - when we invest so little and employ so few staff in an area, there will be high rates of suicide because of mental health problems.  Every community has been affected by teenage suicide, but it is clear that the Government is either not equipped, unable or not sufficiently motivated to tackle the problem.  Again, County Meath is at the bottom of the resources list.  We need to ensure radical investment of resources and energy by the Government in order that it can start to tackle this problem in counties such as Meath.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important and serious matter.</p>  <p>  In the recent budget an additional &euro;55 million was provided to progress new developments in mental health services this year.  It brings overall Health Service Executive, HSE, mental health service funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019.  This, in turn, will allow for continued improvements in all aspects of mental health care across the nine HSE community healthcare organisations, including CHO 8 which incorporates County Meath.  Louth and Meath mental health services continue to strive to improve the level and quality of service being delivered and the environs in which it is delivered.  The service supports clients in their recovery and rehabilitation as close to their home and community as possible.  All of this is being done within the resources available.  Referral to community psychiatric services is through general practitioners.</p>  <p>  There is a range of care options provided by the mental health service for the population of County Meath.  Acute inpatient beds for counties Louth and Meath are located in the department of psychiatry at Crosslanes in Drogheda.  Referral for assessment is either through a GP or an emergency department.  With regard tp community adult outpatient services, three teams are based in An T&aacute;in and cover Navan, Kells and Trim, and one is in Ashbourne.  The psychiatric day hospital service covers Navan hospital and Ashbourne primary care centre.  Examples of services provided from the day hospital include stress management, cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy, alcohol counselling and a Clozaril clinic.  Therapeutic interventions in line with national clinical care programmes are also being delivered, including, for example, for first episode psychosis and eating disorders.  A first episode psychosis team is being established.</p>  <p>  The day hospital provides an enhanced package of care for clients in the community, all of which is in line with A Vision for Change.  A community high support residence is based at R&aacute;th na Riogh, Leighsbrook Lane, Navan.  There is an assertive outreach team for County Meath which provides continuing support for clients in their own community.  The team is moving to a seven-day service.  In addition, a home-based treatment team provides support for acutely unwell patients in their own home.  Other services available to the population of County Meath include the psychiatry of old age team based on Kennedy Road, Navan, while there is an advanced technology room for persons with dementia.  The child and adolescent mental health service is located in Hazel House, Navan and Trim primary care centre.</p>  <p>  The recently agreed HSE service plan for 2019 outlines the priorities and actions to enhance mental health care nationally this year.  This relates also to CHO 8 and County Meath and encompasses a range of services covering acute or community-based child and adolescent mental health services, general adult services and psychiatry of late life.  The service plan also acknowledges widely accepted challenges in developing services, including increasing demands and difficulties in staff recruitment and retention, but the objective for the Minister and the HSE is to deliver overall service improvements this year.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change is really important, but if we do not have the funds we meed for change, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.  In County Meath we have three Ministers or Ministers of State in various guises, as well as two Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, but we are not getting the funding we need.  County Meath remains an outlier because of the number of vacancies in critical health care service grades.  It is also an outlier because of the lack of funding.</p><p>Does the Minister of State not agree that it is really hard for these healthcare professionals to function and carry out their job regarding the level of need they face if they do not have the adequate resources to do so?  Given the current state of the economy, the State has an opportunity to intervene in so many individuals' lives, to bring people back to good mental health and to ensure they do not end up thinking that suicide is some kind of solution to their situation.  However, we can only do this if we have feet on the ground and the funds available for them to do their job.  Despite the rhetoric we hear year after year, the figures are getting worse.  I looked at the figures recently.  The rate of self-harm in 2016 was 10% higher than it was in 2007, the year before the economic recession.  The rate was highest among the young.  One third of children's mental health beds in the country are closed at present due to staff shortages in child and adolescent mental health units.  There are vacancies for psychiatric nurses while 52 children have been waiting more than a year for an assessment for child and adolescent mental health services.  If we must tell a child not to come near us for 12 months before we will even talk to him or her regarding mental health services, we are failing those children radically.  </p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State has met him in the past regarding this issue.  In addition, within the past few days, the Minister of State's office has been in touch about arranging another meeting with the Deputy in the near future.  If the Deputy needs to bring all relevant local representatives to that meeting, that would be fine.  This meeting would review mental health services in Meath.  As the Minister of State asked me to tell the Deputy that this meeting will take place as quickly as possible, perhaps the Deputy could contact the Minister of State's office.  The Minister of State continually liaises with the HSE to monitor all aspects of mental healthcare, including implementing new initiatives agreed under the executive's service plan.  The recent budget provided an extra &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health, which adds up to exceptional funding in 2019 at just over &euro;1 billion.  The construction of the national forensic mental health complex in Portrane is progressing with the facility due to open in 2020.  All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE to reduce waiting lists, although I know there are difficulties.  The Deputy's points are well made and well taken.  I met the Minister of State yesterday to discuss them and he told me that he would be glad to meet the Deputy and representatives, that is, whoever represents the mental health community in that area.  That meeting will take place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This opportunity has presented itself to Waterford through the hard work and efforts of Waterford City and County Council under the leadership of its CEO, Michael Walsh.  The proposed investment in Waterford city by the Alhokair Group from Saudi Arabia has provided a much-needed confidence boost for the city and indeed the whole south east.  The proposed development at a cost of &euro;350 million will be a game changer for Waterford.  The south east needs a regional city of consequence and that city must be Waterford.  Waterford must be enabled for propulsive growth.  For regions to be strong, they need a strong city.</p>  <p>  However, this project is so much more.  It has the additional potential to place an emphasis on additional permanent services such as healthcare, education, and transport.  The economic benefits will be significant.  The proposed development will happen on approximately 17 acres of substantial and spectacular river frontage.  The proposal includes development of a total of 60,000 sq. m to include retail units, leisure and office space, 200 apartments and a relocated train station, which will result in an integrated transport hub.  This will have the effect of providing a sustainable transport corridor and improving access from north to south by creating a pedestrian bridge linking the north quays to the south quays and the remainder of the city centre.  This development will act as a catalyst for other developments like the Ard R&iacute; Hotel and the Michael Street shopping centre.  The north quays development will provide an increase of 50% in Waterford's retail offering.  It is envisaged that 2,300 direct jobs will be created on completion of the project.  </p>  <p>  Under the national planning framework, Waterford metropolitan area has been designated for population growth of up to 30,000.  If Waterford is to realise this aspiration, there is no doubt that the development of the north quays is crucial.  In 2017, Waterford City and County Council applied for funding of &euro;20.1 million from the urban regeneration and development fund for the first phase of this development.  It received &euro;6 million, which is well short of what is required.  This is incredibly disappointing.  The Government hyped up its support for this project consistently and now the city community has once again been left short-changed by this Government.  The Government must accept that life exists outside of the M50.  Waterford can and must act as a release valve for the pressure that is building in the capital.  The city and county council has done an amazing job in getting the project to the current stage with the support of politicians, Waterford Chamber of Commerce, the Alhokair Group and other stakeholders.  We now need to see how seriously the Government views promoting regional economic development.  What we need to see now is certainty and indeed commitment by the Government to progress this invaluable project.  The key words here are certainty, commitment and a timeframe to progress this project.  Certainty to enter into contracts is required relatively soon.  The investors are committed, as are the local authority and the people of Waterford city and county.  Now we need the absolute commitment from Government.  At a time of economic growth and balanced budgets, commitment is needed from Government.  </p></speech>

It gives me an opportunity to discuss the north quays project in Waterford and, in particular, Waterford City and County Council's successful bid for funding for the north quays under the urban regeneration and development fund.  It is a project with which I am very familiar having met many of the stakeholders involved in it on a few occasions over the past couple of years.  It is a very worthy project that has been outlined quite well by the Deputy.  It is an essential part of the region, not just Waterford city and county.  In Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, we recognise the importance of having regional bases like Waterford to serve regions and help them grow.  In Project Ireland 2040, we are taking a long-term view about how we plan the shifting of population growth in the future away from the east coast and Dublin and build up other cities in order that they can compete nationally and over time, have an international footing.  The chief executive officer of Waterford City and County Council, Michael Walsh, has done a great job in working with everybody to make this happen and put it on the map.  We all know it will take time for it to roll out but great work is being done that is being led by the local authority, which is the way development should happen.  Again, it had the co-operation of various Departments over the years.</p>  <p>  The north quays in Waterford were the subject of a strategic development zone, SDZ, order made by Government in 2016 recognising the social and economic importance of this flagship "brownfield" site to the State and designating the Waterford north quays for mixed-use development subject to preparation of an SDZ planning scheme, which has been done.  I met Senator Coffey a couple of times.  It was a very important issue when he was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment.  It was important that this designation was made thus enabling all the plans for the future.  </p>  <p>  The national planning framework, NPF, launched early in 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040 includes objectives to achieve both more compact urban growth within Ireland's cities and the significant further development of Waterford city.  Further to the NPF, a ten-year urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, worth &euro;2 billion to 2027 was established with &euro;550 million of committed Exchequer grant funding available to 2022.  </p><p>Bids were invited from public bodies throughout Ireland for funding under the URDF.  Waterford City and County Council submitted a bid for &euro;104.5 million of grant funding in September 2018, seeking a sum of &euro;20 million for 2019.  The Waterford north quays bid was made as a category A proposal, on the basis of development being ready to go in 2019 and to continue in the years immediately thereafter.  It was well recognised that Waterford, as a city, was well prepared for funds like this but I also want to point out that it was moving these plans on before any fund was established.  That is key.  It was not the case that it needed a fund to make this happen; it was getting on with the plans and making this happen.  It had big visions.  I give my thanks to all involved including the investors who also put great work into making this happen.</p> <p> In November 2018 my Department announced an initial tranche of &euro;100 million which was awarded to a total of 88 projects throughout Ireland for 2019.  The Waterford north quays project was awarded &euro;6 million for 2019, which is the single largest award made to any bid under the URDF.  In comparison, awards made in respect of multiple bid proposals from each of the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway resulted in awards of &euro;6 million to &euro;7 million to each city for a combined total of 24 projects in 2019.  Later in the first quarter of this year, there will be a further call for URDF bids for funding in 2020.  This URDF grant to Waterford, as with all other successful bid proposals, is approved in principle subject to agreement with my Department and may be regarded as the starting point of ongoing support for a significant city centre urban renewal project.  As a successful category A project, the award signals commitment to further funding in future years.  The overall URDF will increase for 2020 and it is expected that large integrated multi-annual urban projects will comprise a greater element of future overall allocations, as these more complex proposals require sufficient time for design, planning, procurement and construction to be advanced properly.</p> <p> I have more to say but I am conscious that I am eating into the Deputy's time.</p></speech>

I welcome what the Minister of State has said, which is that the overall URDF will increase for 2020 and that it is expected that large integrated multi-annual urban projects will comprise a greater element of future overall allocations.  However, we have to look at where we came from.  As the Minister of State said, we were ahead of the pack on this.  Mr. Michael Walsh and Waterford City and County Council had plans in place.  When considering the amount of money that was allocated, one has to look at the overall picture and at the catalyst the north quays will be for the whole south-east region.  We look at the likes of Cork, Limerick and Galway, which are already doing very well.  This absolute game changer of a project has to be recognised.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;13 million is required in 2019 to start the process and a commitment of &euro;30 million is required for each of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Much of the infrastructure development that will be involved in this project would have had to come in the future anyway.  What this project is doing is accelerating that hugely important infrastructure and increasing the connectivity between the north and the south of the city.  Sustainable transport infrastructure is the essence of this project and development of this site can and will act as a catalyst for the city and county of Waterford.  The employment opportunities, housing opportunities, and health opportunities cannot be underestimated.  We are constantly talking about cardiac care in Waterford and about a university for the south east.  This north quays development will act as a catalyst for all these things because it will lead to population growth and to Waterford and the south east acting as a release valve for the overcrowding in Dublin.  To reiterate, in order to sign contracts and move forward, we need a timeframe, certainty, and commitment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300022#AA00400"><p>Without a doubt, the north quays project will provide many opportunities for the city and region.  It is a project of major significance.  I compliment all involved in getting it this far.  Together with the total amount of lifetime URDF grant funding sought, the proposal that came forward this time included four very significant elements of enabling infrastructure which are: relocation of the city&rsquo;s railway station to the east to form a new public transport interchange, expected to cost approximately &euro;35 million; a new bridge over the River Suir for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport and an associated urban greenway, expected to cost more than &euro;33 million; site access roads and road realignment, expected to cost &euro;26.8 million; and off-site roads in the wider north bank of the Suir area in Kilkenny, which will cost approximately &euro;10.3 million.  I am constantly telling people in this room that there is also mention of Kilkenny in this plan.  This project will serve the area very well.  All of these infrastructural works will open up and make more accessible the north quays site, and will enable the special development zone planning scheme to be realised.</p>  <p>  Further discussion with the local authority and other relevant agencies, such as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, is ongoing to conclude the grant agreement for 2019 in the context of a project lifetime commitment for future years, which has yet to be agreed, subject to necessary public spending code and state aid considerations.  I can confirm that for approved category A projects, such as the Waterford north quays, subject to a grant agreement being entered into that will result in ongoing multi-annual contracts starting in 2019, there will be a commitment to the agreed Exchequer share of such contracts for future years.  I also wish to confirm at this stage that there is priority commitment to funding in excess of &euro;6 million for infrastructure to enable the mixed-use development of the Waterford north quays project.</p>  <p>  Again I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of this project and I reiterate the Government's ongoing commitment to the future development of Waterford as one of Ireland's principal cities and as the regional growth driver for the south east.  I cannot be any clearer on that.  Today we are discussing one fund under Project Ireland 2040 but there are many other funds and many other ways of accessing money.  It is important that the quays project looks at them all.  I have no doubt that it will and that it will apply for funding in different areas.  I am glad that we are able to kick-start the project with funding through this scheme, but there are many other ways to fund it including bringing private capital and money into the system.  It is a great project and the Government is looking forward to working with the local authority on it.  We are constantly engaging with Waterford City and County Council on this project.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that it will not happen with a big crash-out.  I believe that is the hope of everybody in this House and of the people at large.  My question relates to energy supplies in the event of Brexit happening.  I first raised this issue as far back as three years ago and I have raised it a number of times since including during an exchange with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Naughten, on 9 May 2017 to which I will refer in a minute.  The issues relate to the supply of gas, electricity and oil.  For better or worse, at the present time we depend on these supplies for our energy.  Large amounts of them come through Britain.  I will deal with them one by one.</p>  <p>  Some 55% of our gas supply comes through the island of Britain - England, Scotland and Wales.  We have an all-Ireland single electricity market, which is very important.  Important work has been done on that.  Some 40% of the State's oil reserves are also held outside the State - 20% in England, 11% in Scotland, and 9% in the Six Counties which are still occupied by England, Scotland and Wales.  This 9% is held close to Derry.  Some 55% of our natural gas comes from Britain.  If that is interrupted or stopped, perhaps in an emergency scenario, we would be in a serious situation in respect of the supply of domestic home heating gas but also in respect of power generating plants.  If it was cut off or if there were interruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit is there a possibility of World Trade Organization tariffs applying to this gas?  Will we have higher gas bills in nine weeks' time?  This would also affect electricity bills because the gas is used to generate electricity.  We must bear in mind that we already have the fourth highest electricity prices in the European Union.  What provisions are being made for those two scenarios?</p>  <p>  With regard to electricity, we have a 32-county electricity market which has been functioning very well since 2007, although there is other infrastructural work to be done in that area.  Can we guarantee that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there will be no tariffs applied to cross-Border electricity?  The new all-Ireland integrated single electricity market, ISEM, design which started in October was meant to save householders and businesses up to &euro;200 million.  What will happen in that regard?  We also have an electricity interconnector with Britain which goes directly across the Irish Sea.  Will tariffs be applied to electricity coming through that interconnector in nine weeks' time?</p>  <p>  With regard to oil reserves, earlier I referred to the fact that 40% of the State's oil reserves are held between the North of Ireland and Britain.  Under EU rules, this will not be counted towards our EU obligations after Brexit.  What discussions has the Minister and his Government had regarding what will happen to those oil reserves in nine weeks' time?  Under EU rules we are required to have a nine weeks' supply as a minimum.  As a member of the European Union we must continue to have that reserve, but not only for that reason.</p><p>We need those nine weeks of supply to be sure that we will have enough energy to keep the wheels turning on this island, for industry and transport and all of the other areas where it is used.</p> <p> In reply to a question in May 2017 the Minister said that the State was refurbishing facilities at Poolbeg in Dublin and Great Island in County Wexford.  Are they finished and ready?  Can the State now cater for the level of oil reserves that are required to get us over the minimum nine-week period?</p></speech>

As the Deputy has outlined, there has been great co-operation between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK in the energy market.  It is certainly our desire that this will continue.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the security of the supply of gas, Ireland has two main sources.  One is from the Corrib facility, which is a very important supplier, as Deputy Stanley has indicated.  The Corrib field delivers nearly half of our gas needs.  The balance of our supply comes from two wholly Irish-owned interconnector pipelines between Ireland and Scotland.  These pipelines are governed by intergovernmental agreements with the UK from 1993 and 2004.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, have indicated that gas trade across the two interconnectors will not fundamentally change in the short to medium term as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  Gas trading contingencies are being further examined as part of ongoing engagement with the Directorate General for Energy and the European Commission, as similar issues arise for member states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.  They are secure but an interruption to gas supply from an unpredictable event is always possible.  Brexit, however, of itself does not make that more likely.  Ireland has a considerable advantage in having the Corrib provision.</p>  <p>  The practicalities of gas trading on the interconnectors are governed by a series of mutually reinforcing agreements, contracts and trading rules, variously between the Irish and UK Governments and between the transmission system operators in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, with the latter overseen by their respective regulators.  With regard to the World Trade Organization, WTO, I have been informed by the Department that electricity would continue to trade and a tariff would not apply.  There may be a very small tariff on gas in the order of 1%.  Even in a WTO context the impact on this sector would be relatively small.</p>  <p>  The position on oil products, is that Ireland is dependent on imports that are predominantly supplied by UK refineries.  There are no indications, however, that we should be concerned about the continued availability of these products, post UK withdrawal.  In the event of any unexpected supply disruption occurring in the UK, the industry has indicated that alternative supplies can be sourced elsewhere, such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands.  On the issue of emergency oil reserves, Ireland is required under EU legislation and International Energy Agency, lEA, rules to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports for use in an emergency.  Currently 57% are held in Ireland, 22% within the other EU member states - all of which are readily accessible - and 21% of our emergency stocks are held in the UK, including Northern Ireland.  Post UK withdrawal, these stocks will still be accessible.</p>  <p>  I will get information for Deputy Stanley on the works that have been done but I know that NORA has stepped up its own capacity and has been onshoring the reserves that are being held.  That has made-----</p></speech>

Legislation underpinning this was amended in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The legislation is contained in sections 7 and 8 of the Energy Act 2016.  The position of Northern Ireland, including with regard to the single electricity market, remains a priority for the EU, Ireland and the UK.  We are working to maintain the beneficial structures of the all-island single electricity market whatever the outcome of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As one of the elements in the whole-of-Government initiative, I will be introducing some powers to ensure that the CRU has sufficient powers to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EU energy market requirements in the event of a UK withdrawal.</p></speech>

Some information has been provided there but it comes across that there is still some work to be done.</p>  <p>  On the gas situation, the Minister indicated there may be a small tariff.  It is a concern that there may be a tariff on gas coming into Ireland from England, Scotland or Wales.  This will be a concern to industry, to householders and to citizens up and down the country.</p>  <p>  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions over the last years, including at a conference organised by the Government two years ago in Roscommon.  The conference was organised by the current Minister's predecessor and it was very useful.  I ask that further information be shared on the issue as it becomes available.  We are aware that any type of tariff or charge can start off as a penny but can wind up as &euro;1 million because it is the thin end of the wedge.  A charge can increase over time.  Does the Minister have any information as to whether that tariff could be increased and if Britain holds all the cards?  Is it within Britain's gift - the mother of parliaments - to decide whether there is a tariff on gas coming into Ireland?  Some clarity on this issue would be useful.</p>  <p>  With regard to the oil reserves, and in answer to previous questions on the matter to the Minister's Department, he said that 20% is in England, 11% is in Scotland and 9% is held in the North of Ireland.  Could we have some clarity on that?  Obviously it would be better if it was on the island of Ireland from a logistical perspective.  Perhaps the Minister could illuminate where we are at in developing the capacity for storage in this State.  Will he also explain what is happening in Wexford and in the other facilities that were supposed to be developed and which are leased from the ESB?</p></speech>

I am aware that work has been ongoing in increasing capacity in order to have the oil storage onshore.  We have good contracts to ensure the stores are accessible wherever they are held.</p>  <p>  On the potential crash-out and the WTO rules becoming the rules, this is a market where there are very low tariffs and these are within the WTO rules.  These tariffs would not be decided at random.  They would be the fallback and, as I have said, they are 0% in electricity and very small tariffs in gas.  It is not like the agricultural sector, which would face very big obstacles to trade under WTO rules.</p>  <p>  The main area in which we need to take action, which is included in the omnibus legislation that the T&aacute;naiste will bring through, is in ensuring that Ireland continues to comply with all European Union regulations around the electricity market.  This is where we need to take certain reserve capabilities for the CRU to ensure we can be compliant.  That will be included in the legislation that is due to be published in the near future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300023#BB00800"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p><b></b>I am pleased to present to the House the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I commend Senator Frances Black on initiating the Bill and bringing it through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>If passed, Ireland and her Parliament will be sending a strong message, that it condemns the occupation of territories which are deemed illegal under international law.  This Bill, at its most basic, is about upholding international law.  It applies to illegal occupations anywhere in the world and not just to Israel and Palestine.  However, I am conscious that it is this occupation that has been the main focus of discussions on the Bill.  I want to state clearly from the outset that, if passed, this Bill will not ban trade in Israeli goods.  It will only ban those goods produced in settlements built illegally beyond Israel's borders.</p> <p> The Bill does not propose a boycott of Israel, and Fianna F&aacute;il does not support such a boycott.  We recognise and fully support Israel's right to self-determination and to self-defence.  We denounce violence against the state of Israel and its citizens, and we wholly and unreservedly condemn the persecution of the Jewish people and the evil that was the Holocaust.  Furthermore, my party very much values the strong links forged between our countries.  While in Israel I had the opportunity to meet Isaac Herzog, who chairs the Jewish Agency.  Ireland recently commemorated the centenary of the birth of his late father, Chaim Herzog, who was born in Belfast, raised in Dublin, and later became the sixth President of the state of Israel.  We want the strong ties between our two countries to endure, and we want to continue to work to find a way forward that will help bring about lasting peace in the region.  To those opposing this Bill, I state very clearly that our door will always be open to dialogue and constructive engagement.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has a long-held interest in the peace process in the Middle East.  It was under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led government in 1980 that Ireland became the first European member state to propose the two-state solution, based on a fully sovereign state of Palestine, independent of and co-existing with Israel.  The objectives we had then remain largely the same today.  We continue to advocate for a two-state solution, an end to this protracted conflict, and the full realisation of human rights for both Israelis and Palestinians.  The decision by Fianna F&aacute;il to support this Bill was not taken lightly or without due consideration.  I recognise that it is a difficult and multifaceted conflict.  Grievous wrongs have been committed by both sides, and it is fair to say that both Israeli and Palestinian authorities have acted at times in a manner that is clearly and deliberately counterproductive to peace.  However, as a party we are growing increasingly concerned about the actions of Israel and its continued and blatant disregard for international law.  We are deeply frustrated about the imbalance in power, the lack of progress in achieving the two-state solution, the non-existent peace process, the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank, home demolitions and land confiscation, unjustified restrictions on movement, and the sustained systematic expansion of settlements on Palestinian territories which are deemed illegal under international law and which represent physical obstacles to peace.</p> <p> More recently, the passing of the nation state law in the Knesset, which states that only Jews have the right of self-determination in Israel and downgrades the status of the Arabic language, has only served to make the prospect of peace more remote.  Coupled with this, Israel has been emboldened by the US Administration, which has ceased funding to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, UNRRA, closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington and moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  These moves have only served to alienate Palestinians and to discredit any peace initiative that is supposed to be forthcoming from the US Administration.</p> <p> I visited the region with my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, and saw at first hand the reality of the settlement project and the conditions the Palestinians have to endure.  We were struck by the fact that the two-state solution will very soon be unachievable because of the manner in which the settlements are interwoven throughout what is internationally recognised as Palestinian land.  Land is divided by walls and fences.  Certain roads are restricted for use of Israelis only.  There is a clear disparity in living standards.  Conditions in the West Bank and Gaza are now well below an acceptable standard of living, and reports indicate that Gaza will very soon be considered uninhabitable.  We met the NGOs, Al-Haq and Breaking the Silence.  We listened, learned, and came to the conclusion that criticism of the settlements alone has proved a futile exercise.  Repeated condemnation of Israeli actions by the EU and many in the international community has failed to deter Israel from continuing its settlements project.  Even UN resolution No. 2334 in December of 2014, which states, "[Israel's establishment] of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, ha[d] no legal validity and constitute[d] a flagrant violation under international law", has had little or no impact.  The situation has in fact worsened since then.</p> <p> No condemnation has been strong enough to change Israel's approach, and it would appear that the Israeli authorities have become accustomed to tuning out criticism.  It has no impact on the actions of the Israeli authorities.  It is clear to me that we have to change tack and take time to take a different course of action.  If change is to come, we must make the settlement project a less desirable policy for Israel.  This Bill is an example of a different but moderate approach and one that I hope can be a vehicle for some change in some small way.  To those who have tried to dissuade us from supporting the Bill and say that it is not the time for such a Bill, I say if this is not the time to act, when will that time come?  It is evident, given the expansion of the settlements, that unless action is taken, the two-state solution and the sovereign state of Palestine, independent of and co-existing with Israel, will very soon not be feasible.  This Bill should not be seen as a radical departure.  It is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I want to address an issue that is relevant to this issue as well as many other Private Members' Bills.  If this Bill passes Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it is not the case that it becomes law.  It necessarily requires that the Bill goes on to Committee Stage, Report Stage and Final Stage, before being promulgated by the President.  My concern, shared by colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, is that if this matter proceeds to Committee Stage, the Government may seek to invoke Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  As Members are aware, that provision provides that: "D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not pass any law ... for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by a message from the Government, signed by the Taoiseach."  That provision has become known as a money message.  It was an innovative proposal, inserted into the Constitution by Eamon de Valera, and intended to ensure that the Government would retain control of the purse strings.  However, it would be fanciful and inappropriate for the Government to seek to rely upon Article 17.2 for the purpose of preventing this legislation proceeding to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The concern Fianna F&aacute;il has in respect of this matter arises because of what was said in the Seanad by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when this Bill was going through the Seanad.  It was suggested that this legislation could impose significant and recurring damages on the State because it might involve fines from the European Union or the European Commission, or it may cost money because it creates new offences.  The suggestion that a money message is required because fines may be imposed by the European Commission is inappropriate.  Anyone who knows the workings of the European Commission will know that Ireland will be given a warning if it brings the matter before a court, and that after a court decision has been made, we will be given the necessary time to ensure that the law is compatible with European Union law.  This is provided for under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  We could bring in this change readily without any fine being imposed upon us.</p>  <p>  Another concern is that an individual or corporation could take a case against the State.  However, that would only give rise to damages in circumstances where the State manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion.  I also believe that the suggestion that new offences are being created by this Bill which would create a charge on the Exchequer is inappropriate.</p><p>Simply because new offences are created does not mean the Garda will require more money for the purposes of investigating any new offences.  The Government is perfectly entitled to oppose this legislation on substance, but it would be inappropriate for the Government to seek to misrepresent and misuse the Constitution for the purposes of blocking this legislation or stopping it from getting through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Frances Black and our colleagues in the Seanad who passed this Bill.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, previously when I had the role of Opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs, we engaged specifically on this legislation.  I was happy to be involved at the time in the preparation and the first presentation of the Bill.  Back then, we afforded time to Government.  We afforded over six months for Government to respond to a very simple request.  The request was that the T&aacute;naiste would raise the issue of settlement goods with his EU counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council.  I asked him to do this in a letter dated 15 February 2018.  In his response the T&aacute;naiste said that a discussion on the Middle East was expected to be on the agenda of the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February 2018.  He said, however, that it was likely that discussion would focus mostly on the preparation for a lunch with the foreign ministers of key Arab states.</p>  <p>  Deputy Niall Collins has outlined the matter perfectly.  The time for waiting is over now.  We have tried to engage and gain agreement on this question.  Over 46 separate resolutions from the UN Human Rights Council have been ignored by Israel.  This Bill would send a message not only to Israel but to other states that illegally annex territory and seek to benefit from the use and exploitation of such territory.  The message is that Ireland will stand and be first to say that is not appropriate, like back in 1980, when the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first to propose the two-state solution.  There is no reason why Ireland should not lead.  I am proud of the track record of my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in that regard.  I am proud to be working with colleagues across the House to pass legislation that will make a difference and that will send a message.  We would be the first EU state to do so and others may follow.  The time for waiting for a pan-European approach is over at this stage.  We have tried that.  We tried it with the T&aacute;naiste when we asked him to raise this issue on numerous occasions and when we asked him to work with us on the Bill.  That has failed.  I am happy to support the Bill and I hope the House passes it.  As my colleague has said, I hope it is not blocked at subsequent stages by the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300025#DD00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, the Second Stage debate of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  The enactment of legislation to prohibit the purchase of goods or services produced in settlements deemed illegal is a proportionate response to breaches of international law.  It sends a strong message from Ireland on the need to respect such laws.  Ireland and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have a long history of standing up for international law and the Bill is in keeping with that history.  Our Bill will not end illegal settlements but it will demonstrate Ireland's significant opposition to them and will send a message to countries flouting international law.</p>  <p>  The Bill is not to be interpreted as an encouragement to boycott the state of Israel, the Israeli people or those of the Jewish faith.  Israel's right to exist and its right to self-determination are things that I will always support.  Like any country, Israel has a right to defend itself with proportionate action.  However, Israel also has a moral obligation as a member of the international community to adhere to international law.  International law is clear in holding that the occupation of lands in the West Bank and Gaza as well as the establishment of illegal settlements on those lands are illegal.  Internationally accepted standards of human rights, proportionality and responsibility must be adhered to by all sides.</p>  <p>  I travelled to the West Bank and Jerusalem with my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy.  There is little of the state of Palestine left to recognise.  Palestinians have fewer rights and less land and freedom than ever before.  The restrictions placed on them that I witnessed mean their homeland is little more than an open prison.  The despair and hopelessness that I saw among Palestinians was horrifying.  They live under a crushing and suffocating administration that denies them dignity.  They have been destroyed economically.  The situation is desperate and deteriorating.  Nevertheless, I met people who refused to surrender.  These people demonstrate the courage to endure on a daily basis.  We met families whose homes have been knocked down or who have been thrown out of their homes.  We met farmers who are not allowed to take stones from their land so that they can grow crops for their families or be productive.  It was disturbing to stand in a field where the farmer could barely grow enough food for his family and, yet, when I looked over the brow of the hill I could see a neighbouring field that was as lush as any field in Ireland.  That can be attributed to human rights abuses.</p>  <p>  A two-state solution whereby Israel and Palestine co-exist side-by-side peacefully is the only solution.  Unless a political solution is found the extremists will prevail on both sides.  Conciliation and dialogue represent the only path to a political solution.  However, the actions of Israel defence forces have made that more difficult and have strengthened the hand of those on both sides who oppose peace.  The international community must provide leadership.  It must provide a resolution to the conflict.  I believe this Bill is a step in that direction.</p></speech>

However, in the context of illegal occupied territories the case is obviously one of the most high-profile and significant on our globe.</p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand the impact that the occupation is having on Palestine as a state and on the quality of life of Palestinians.  It is difficult for us to continue to pretend that we are sending out condemnation through the UN and the international community since nothing is being done to advance the cause in terms of promoting the two-state solution.  There is no use in making that point if we continue to prevaricate as an international community or if we continue to deny the fact that the Palestinians are living in an open prison.  If we continue to deny that, then by the time good minds come together the Palestinian state will no longer exist.  Time is of the essence.  There is extraordinary pressure on the Palestinian people, including those in the West Bank, which I visited, as well as those in Gaza.  Other Members visited Gaza and relayed their testimony.  It is incumbent on us to try to keep this very much to the fore.  UN resolutions are all very fine, but if we continually allow a state to ignore and flout international law by illegal occupation then the international community does not stand for much in terms of condemnation alone.</p>  <p>  I urge people to consider this Bill and look at it.  It sends out a message.  Although it is from a small nation, it is a powerful message.  It is from a country that has a history of major difficulties and political turmoil.  We know full well that eventually dialogue and discussion will have to take place.  Talking to people on an equal footing is the only way to bring about a lasting peace in the Middle East.  I am not naive enough to believe that it is easy to do.  This is probably one of the most protracted difficulties and has been with us over many centuries.  It has been problematic not only in the context of Israeli versus Arab but Christian versus Arab as well.  For many years this has been a fault line between religion, civilisations, ways of life and how we view the world.  At this stage as a small nation I believe we owe it to the people of Palestine and other occupied areas to declare that international law must be supported and upheld.  Otherwise, we stand for nothing as a parliament, a people or as an international community.</p>  <p>  We are aware of proposals on the table from the United States on the Middle East peace process.  There have been many initiatives but the initiative most supported - it was put forward by this State initially - is the two-state solution.  I am firmly of the belief that if we delay and prevaricate then the two-state solution will cease to be a means to an end.  This is because the second state, Palestine, will no longer exist.  It is now at a crisis point.  Humanitarian issues relating to water, refuse and the breakdown of social order are to the fore.  Spitefulness is something that I have seen in terms of the cutting of funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and others.  The agency was providing educational facilities for Palestinian children.  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to use his good offices.  I know he is a champion of the Palestinian people.  I urge him to support this Bill and send out a strong message from a small nation expressing solidarity with a people who are oppressed.  The T&aacute;naiste should support this Bill and allow it to frame the discussions across the European Union and elsewhere in the context of the occupied territories.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300026#EE00100"><p>I am glad to be able to speak to this Bill.  The Bill merits very careful consideration in all its aspects.  I have addressed this Bill already in the Seanad.  I will not therefore repeat what I have said about my activities on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  I trust Deputies will recognise the priority I have attached to this issue, the time I have devoted to it and, indeed, the public funds that I have committed to it in the context of support for the Palestinian Authority and to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, in recent times.  This has included three visits to the region in my 12 months as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, work on the political process and on Gaza, and keeping up consistent pressure at EU and international level against the expansion of settlements.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been to the fore in shaping EU policies on settlements, including the exclusion of settlement products from normal tariff levels, preventing EU research funding being spent in settlements, preventing misleading labelling of settlement goods, and providing for the specific exclusion of settlements from future EU agreements with Israel.  Ireland also supports Israeli, Palestinian and international NGOs which defend Palestinian communities under threat from settlements.  No Member of this House attaches greater importance than I do to bringing Ireland&rsquo;s influence to bear to help end the occupation of the Palestinian territories, to promote a two-state solution that works for Israel and for Palestinians, and to deliver a sustainable peace after decades of conflict.</p>  <p>  However, speaking on behalf of the Government, I do not agree that the Bill is the right way forward now.  I wish to set out carefully for the D&aacute;il why this is so.  There are three broad reasons: legal, political and practical effects.  The overriding point that frames the Government&rsquo;s view is that the Bill asks the State to do something that is not within its power.  Ireland is part of a single unified EU market.  Trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union.  Everyone who is informed in this House should know that.  We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that it is prohibited to bring to Ireland, for sale or personal use, goods which enter the EU legally and are freely circulating elsewhere in the Single Market.  This is the meaning of the Single Market, the defence of which is something which the EU takes very seriously, as we have seen in the context of Brexit.  The integrity of the Single Market is in Ireland&rsquo;s overall interest.</p>  <p>  The formal advice to the Government of the Attorney General on this matter has confirmed clearly that passage of the Bill would put Ireland in breach of EU law and would expose Ireland to legal action by the European Commission as guardian of the treaties.  Some supporters of the Bill have put forward legal opinions which highlight a so-called public policy exemption, which states that provisions on free circulation of goods do not preclude &ldquo;prohibitions, quantitative restrictions or surveillance measures on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security&rdquo;.  However, I am strongly advised that the European Court of Justice has shown in previous cases that it will not allow this term to be interpreted broadly.  A broad interpretation of the public policy exemption would so obviously have implications for the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence on trade that it is entirely foreseeable that a challenge by the European Commission would follow.  Our informal soundings lead us to consider that very likely.</p>  <p>  Should Ireland be found to have breached EU law, as we would expect, the State would be exposed to potentially very significant fines as well as legal costs.  Fines recommended by the Commission in such cases can include lump sums of more than &euro;1.5 million plus daily fines.  Cumulative annual costs of these fines can range from hundreds of thousands of euros per year at the lower end of the scale, up to tens of millions of euros per year at the highest end.  No Government, nor any responsible Opposition, could support intentionally breaking EU law and exposing the State to such significant penalties.</p>  <p>  The Bill could also be challenged by companies or individuals claiming to be adversely affected by it.  In addition to legal costs arising in these circumstances, a finding against Ireland in favour of a private party could give rise to damages being awarded against the State.  In addition, costs would also arise for the relevant authorities in the implementation of the law, which would create new offences, the investigation, enforcement and potential prosecution of which would have resource implications for the customs authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system more broadly, including, perhaps, the Prison Service.  Our view is that additional costs will also arise from voted funds for certain Irish diplomatic missions abroad should this Bill be enacted.  I should state clearly at this point that because of these costs across a wide range of areas, there can be no doubt that the Bill will require a money message to proceed to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The political effects of the Bill are also an important consideration for this House.  Ireland has a stronger voice and greater influence on Middle East issues generally at UN and EU level than our size alone would justify.  That is where we are able to be of most help to the Palestinian people, which is my priority - indeed, both the Israeli and Palestinian people - in achieving a just and lasting peace.</p>  <p>  My fear is that if Ireland adopts this Bill, we would be choosing to be a principled voice in the wilderness, satisfied in the righteousness of our course, but largely unable to influence the real action.  I am in no doubt, from my experience of discussions on this issue at EU level, that a unilateral move by Ireland on this matter would weaken our ability to influence overall EU policy, not strengthen it.  If we allow ourselves to be discounted in the calculations that other states make, about where the centre of gravity on Middle East policy lies, then we cease to shape that political centre of gravity.</p>  <p>  The third basis on which the Government must oppose the Bill is the assessment of its practical effects, including practical challenges and costs of compliance for Irish companies which trade internationally.  For example, US companies in Ireland and Irish companies in the US could be placed in an impossible conflict of jurisdictions.  Legislation was under discussion in the United States Congress in 2018 to forbid companies based in the US from co-operating with trade bans on Israel and Israeli settlements.  Such proposals have enjoyed strong cross-party support in the US, so such legislation may well be passed into law.  Similar legislation exists at state level in many US states.  Irish missions and State agencies in the US have received queries from companies concerned about this impact of the Bill and the lack of clarity on their legal obligations.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a sincere attempt to address a real issue.  I recognise that and recognise Senator Frances Black who began this Bill&rsquo;s journey.  If enacted, it would provide a moment of solace for Palestinians at a difficult time.  However the solace would only be momentary.  Legislation must be designed by the head as well as the heart and it is the job of any Government to assess the balance of positives and negatives of any policy option.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us will not significantly impact on Israeli settlements.  Conversely, it will place Ireland in breach of EU law.  That alone should be enough to make it impossible to vote for it.  It will also lead to Ireland facing legal challenge and the strong likelihood of very significant penalties, as well as being obliged to repeal the law and possibly pay damages to those with economic interests in settlements.  It will diminish Ireland&rsquo;s influence on behalf of the Palestinians at EU level, which is my main concern.  It will also create difficulties for Ireland and for companies in Ireland with compliance, including with US legislation.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, despite being well and sincerely intentioned by its original authors, this Bill will do serious damage to Ireland and bring only momentary consolation to Palestinians, and we owe them more than that.  For these reasons, no responsible party of Government could support this Bill and this Government must and will oppose it.</p></speech>

It is my privilege to support the Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in and I commend Senator Black on advancing it.</p>  <p>  I listened with a sinking heart to the T&aacute;naiste's speech.  He spoke about the centre of gravity as it pertained to Palestine.  Let us assess the centre of gravity and the progress that has been made.  The Palestinian people are victims of a process of colonisation and an onslaught of building of illegal settlements.  Land is taken and rights are denied.  People are imprisoned using a form of internment known as administrative detention, a British law that still stands.  Their numbers include more than 400 children.  Children have been maimed, with their eyes gone, thanks to Israeli defence forces aggression.  Young men were jailed - actually, they were children - at the age of 12 years and released at the age of 15.  A young woman aged 16 years, Ahed Tamimi, spent six months in jail for standing up to Israeli soldiers.  Last year 312 Palestinians, including 53 children, died at the hands of the Israeli army.  That is the centre of gravity.</p></speech>

The Irish people are prepared to take on the argument at EU level.  Public opinion understands this is necessary.  People are prepared to take on the commercial complications set out by the T&aacute;naiste.  What they are not prepared to do and what no Government worthy of the name should do is stand over trade with illegal settlements or stand by as the state of Israel comprehensively and brazenly flouts international law day in and day out.  Above all else, the Government and the State should stand for the rule of international law.  In the final analysis, that is what the legislation is about.  The T&aacute;naiste can give his political, legal and diplomatic rationale and come up with every excuse under the sun not to support the Bill, but we only need one good reason to support it.</p>  <p>  I was in Palestine before Christmas.  The Palestinian people look to Ireland to lead and stand in solidarity with them.  They want this legislation.  I did not meet one person who was opposed to it.  As the Palestinian people believe this is the right move, let us make it and lead from the front.  That is the honourable and Irish thing to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300027#FF00500"><p>The Bill seeks to prohibit the importation and sale of goods, services and natural resources originating from illegal settlements in occupied territories.  It is not extreme.  It seeks to establish a legal framework to ban these imports from settlements that are already illegal under international humanitarian law and, most importantly, domestic Irish law.  Goods and services only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be on sale in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A clear example of how the Bill would work is the stopping of goods and services from illegal Israeli colonial settlements from entering Ireland.  Israel has occupied the West Bank region of Palestine since 1967 and in that time transferred more than 600,000 of its citizens to that territory.  This has been facilitated by the diversion of water supplies and the widespread confiscation of Palestinian land, particularly fertile farmland.  It has also created a system of apartheid between illegal Israeli settlers and Palestinian citizens.  For decades Israel has attempted to destroy the two-state solution by increasing the building of these illegal colonial settlements in Palestine which violates international law and is a war crime, yet Ireland continues to allow and facilitate trade with the illegal colonial settlements.  As long as we continue to allow the Israeli Government to impose apartheid, maintain its illegal occupation and violate international law with impunity, it will never make the transition and necessary compromises to create a just and lasting peace settlement.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government must make a strong and unambiguous statement that Israel cannot continue its illegal occupation of Palestine with impunity.  Nothing is going to change in Gaza or on the West Bank until the international community moves on from empty rhetoric and actually applies pressure on Israel.  Ireland must stop sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right moment.  When real, concrete and tangible steps are proposed, it must give leadership.  The Government has refused to abide by the Sinn F&eacute;in motion to recognise the state of Palestine that was passed unanimously by the House in December 2014 and is refusing to support the Bill.  In the face of war crimes and human rights abuses, the time for empty words is over.  It is time for action.  That is the call coming from the House.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not focus on one occupation or country; rather, its focus is solely on the primacy of international law.  It could apply to occupations and breaches of international law anywhere in the world.  A "relevant occupied territory" is defined as one that has been confirmed as such by the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court or an international tribunal and designated as occupied for the purposes of this legislation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a strong case for Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara to come with the remit of the Bill.</p></speech>

Like many of us, I would love to see that advice.  Senator Black has released her legal advice received on the Bill.  The legal basis of the Bill and its compatibility with EU law are detailed in the legal opinions of Mr. Michael Lynn, senior counsel; Professor James Crawford and, most recently, Professor Takis Tridimas.  Last year the Government published a summary of the Attorney General's advice on why it should opt for repeal of the eighth amendment.  The T&aacute;naiste should now publish a summary of the Attorney General's advice on this Bill in order that all parties would see the legal perspectives and make up their own minds.  I am in no doubt that the Bill is fully compliant with EU trade rules and that we should pass it urgently.  Let us not forget that South African goods, produced under a system of apartheid, were banned from Ireland in 1987 after a long campaign by Irish workers and anti-apartheid activists.  That was done despite the advice of the Attorney General that it was not possible under then EEC trade rules.  The Government should drop its opposition to the Bill and join all members of the Opposition in supporting this important legislation.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or-bhu&iacute;och go bhfuil seans agam caint ar an &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I commend the Seanad on passing the Bill.  In particular, I thank Senator Black for her work on this crucial humanitarian issue.  By contrast, the Government's policy is reprehensible, but that is not new.  Fine Gael's refusal to honour its programme for Government commitment and implement the democratic votes of both Houses to give formal recognition to the state of Palestine is wilfully shameful.  Today and yesterday, there were Israeli attacks in Gaza.  Ten years ago this month, Israeli forces invaded the Gaza Strip.  It resulted in 13 deaths on the Israeli side, while 1,417 Palestinians were killed, including 313.  I visited Israel, the Gaza Strip and Gaza city not long after the first assault and was horrified by the scale of the human tragedy.</p><p>The UN report into that invasion concluded that it was a deliberate, disproportionate act by Israeli forces designed to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population.  The Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, the separation law, and the theft of water rights and of land for illegal settlements have all been well documented and all are in breach of international law.</p> <p> The State of Israel is a First World, nuclear-armed and economic power oppressing a largely powerless, impoverished Palestinian people.  Despite the fine work being done by many Israeli citizens and NGOs, despite support in Israel for a peace process, the Israeli state snubs diplomacy, rejects international criticism, has no interest in peaceful alternatives and does not see armed force as a measure of last resort - on the contrary, it sees brutal military force as its measure of first resort.</p> <p> We recognise the State of Israel, despite its flagrant breaches of international law and human rights.  I have no issue with that.  Fair enough, but why is one state recognised and not the other?  Why are no sanctions being brought forward?</p> <p> On Monday, we celebrated an Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il.  That was an illegal act.  If we follow the rationale of this Minister, those who assembled would not have done anything.  They would have sat and decided to do nothing.  Women still would not have a vote and slavery would still be legal if we followed his rationale and no one anywhere in the world would have won a single right if we followed his rationale.  If we, as a former colony still partitioned, still occupied in part by a Government we do not want, with our proud history of freedom struggle and resistance and our peace process, do not support the people of Palestine, then who will?</p> <p> There is no wrong time to do the right thing.  The Government should support this Bill and I would urge all Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to do likewise.</p></speech>

The oppressive Israeli Government cannot be allowed to continue to act with total disregard for human life, and with complete disdain for international law.  As a nation of people who lived under a brutal occupier for hundreds of years, we should be acutely aware of the need for other states to show their solidarity with nations living under occupation and assist them in any way possible with their aspirations for statehood.</p>  <p>  This Bill would prohibit the import and sale of goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements, restrict Irish involvement in the provision of services in such settlements and ban the extraction of resources from occupied territories without the consent of the recognised authority of that territory.</p>  <p>  The Bill would not impose a ban on Israeli goods in general.  It would only affect goods produced in occupied territories built beyond Israel's borders, deemed illegal under international law.  This is entirely appropriate and justifiable.</p>  <p>  It is completely unacceptable that Fine Gael has steadfastly refused to implement the will of the D&aacute;il by recognising the state of Palestine, in line with a Sinn F&eacute;in motion that was passed here in 2014.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to address this issue and tell us when Ireland will officially recognise the state of Palestine or why the Government will not do so.  I also call on the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Halligan, and the Minister, Deputy Ross, to use their influence within the Government to ensure this is progressed immediately.</p>  <p>  I commend Senator Black on her tireless work for the Palestinian people.  I hope the passing of this Bill will be followed by the official State recognition of Palestine and will set an example for other countries across the world to follow and, in turn, force the Israeli Government to change its deplorable behaviour.</p></speech>

That is it.</p><p>If I can, I will say the following.  This Bill lays down a marker.  The Irish people stand with the people of Palestine against the Israeli apartheid regime.  The Irish people stand for the international rule of law.  The Irish people, who have suffered in their own history from the theft of land, will not allow Israel to normalise its illegal occupation and settlement of the West Bank.</p></speech>

I also recognise the contribution of civil society organisations, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and Sadaka, to the development of the Bill and, indeed, of Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing it into this House today.</p><p>This Bill has been given detailed discussion and deliberation in the Seanad where I think it is fair to say that all sides - all speakers in the Seanad - recognised that this Bill is designed on sound moral principles and seeks only to do what is right.</p><p>Labour supports this Bill, as Labour has a long history of support for the people of Palestine.  Although it has been said and repeated already, it is important to restate that this is not a boycott-of-Israel Bill or a Bill to place a ban on Israeli goods.  This Bill is not anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli in any respect.  Without equivocation, I utterly condemn anti-Semitism and deplore its rise in the world today.  The State of Israel is internationally recognised and is a legitimate member of the international community, and I reject any assertions to the contrary.  We want Ireland to continue to be a friend and partner to the people of Israel.  Equally, Ireland is and will continue to be a friend and supporter of the people of Palestine.  Labour wants to see a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and we support international efforts to restart and re-energise the process of finding a durable two-state solution.</p><p>I will focus on the Bill itself.  It is a simple Bill, but one that addresses a complex topic.  The Bill seek to make it an offence in Ireland for a person &quot;to import or sell goods or services originating in an occupied territory&quot;, <i>simpliciter</i>.  The Bill seeks to make it an offence for a person &quot;to extract resources from an occupied territory in certain circumstances&quot;.  The Bill carefully defines an &quot;occupied territory&quot; as a territory which is confirmed as &quot;occupied&quot; by a decision or advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, by a decision of the International Criminal Court or by a decision of an international tribunal, or else designated as such for the purposes of this Act in a regulation made by the Minister.  This definition obviously includes the occupied Palestinian territories but it also includes the territories belonging to Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia that are recognised internationally as illegally occupied by Russia, and there are other territories, some already mentioned by other Members, around the world that have been occupied by armed forces operating under the control of a foreign power.</p><p>While this law has obviously had its origins in concern for the Palestinian people, it may prove to be significant legislation in respect of the recent aggression by Russia and Russian-backed armed groups all too close to the European Union's own borders.  The Bill is addressing one of the most basic aspects of national sovereignty, which is the territorial integrity of a state.  It is a blind spot in our law that we do not already make it illegal to trade in goods originating in occupied territories.</p><p>As well as being an affront to international law, occupation by armed forces is a costly undertaking.  The cost of occupation and warfare, including the costs of reparations, is one of the ways in which Europe has sought to eliminate warfare as a policy choice by aggressive governments.</p><p>In that context, it is clear that we should have a law to prevent occupying forces making economic gain from illegal occupation.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste stated that the Attorney General told him that it would be unlawful under European law to implement the Bill but other legal opinions disagree.  There is no doubt in my mind that we should proceed with this legislation.  Let us test it in the European Commission or European Court of Justice and see what they decide.</p></speech>

However, he is aware that the Attorney General regularly provides a written list of potential challenges against the State for breaches of European law.  It is a regular part and feature of government and should not prevent us pursuing what is right in this case.</p>  <p>  Most Deputies belong to parties that are represented in Brussels and Strasbourg.  I will undertake to share a copy of the Bill with my colleagues in the Party of European Socialists and ask them to support this initiative at European level and, indeed, in their home parliaments across Europe.  If the law is incomplete or has unintended consequences, those can be addressed.  If nothing else, this Parliament is taking an important stand on the issue of the economic exploitation of any unlawfully occupied territory.</p>  <p>  Such economic exploitation of occupied territory is an issue that resonates with Ireland&rsquo;s history.  Last Monday, we remembered the Democratic Programme written by the then leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson, and which is recorded as one of the first documents to be placed before the First D&aacute;il.  Two excerpts from it are directly relevant to this matter.  One hundred years ago this week, Johnson wrote &ldquo;we declare that the Nation&rsquo;s sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation&rsquo;s soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation&rdquo;.  Our declaration of independence from the British Empire required the nascent Irish State to wrest control of the economy, including the soil and natural resources of the territory of Ireland.  There could not be meaningful independence if the economy was excessively under foreign control.  That is true for any territory, nation or nascent country if its resources are bled or removed from it before it has a chance to come to full existence.  The Democratic Programme further states &ldquo;while undertaking the organisation of the Nation&rsquo;s trade, import and export, it shall be the duty of the Republic to prevent the shipment from Ireland of food and other necessaries until the wants of the Irish people are fully satisfied and the future provided for.&rdquo;  All Members know that shipments of corn farmed for absentee landlords continued to leave Ireland during the Great Famine of 1845-49, which left a million dead and caused two million to leave Ireland in the space of ten years.  Economist Cormac &Oacute; Gr&aacute;da calculated that in 1845 alone, more than 26 million bushels of grain were exported from a starving Ireland to England.  Research by Christine Kinealy of the University of Liverpool shows that nearly 4,000 vessels carrying food left Ireland for England in 1847, at the height of the Famine.</p>  <p>  We know from World Bank studies and other analyses that the occupation of the territories of Palestine has had a great cost for the people of Palestine and to their economy.  The UN Conference on Trade and Development went so far as to state that &ldquo;fifty years of occupation have driven the Palestinian economy into de-development and poverty&rdquo;.  Political leaders in Palestine obviously need to do far more to improve their governance.  However, Ireland and this Parliament has a long history of standing with them.  The least we can do now is to ensure that economic gains from illegal occupation are not paid for with Irish money.  We must support the Bill and its aims and encourage our sister parties throughout Europe to do the same.</p></speech>

If passed, far from being a principled voice in the wilderness as the T&aacute;naiste contended, it would represent a very important signal internationally as part of a global movement of solidarity against the oppression of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  The arguments that have been marshalled against the Bill and the Government response to it are shameless and utterly cynical.  The T&aacute;naiste put forward various spurious legal arguments against the Bill.  However, several newspapers today reported him as stating that the Israeli ambassador may leave Ireland if Ministers vote for the Bill, which belies the real story, namely, the pressure being put on the Government by the Israeli state.  If the words of solidarity that Deputies Finian McGrath and Halligan previously uttered mean anything, they will be tripping over themselves to run to the Chamber and vote for the Bill tomorrow precisely to force the Israeli ambassador to leave Ireland.   We should kick out representatives of the Israeli Government because of its crimes and oppression of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  When discussing the settlements, we should be clear that they are a weapon of war against the Palestinian people and a perpetuation of what began with the Nakba and continued in the 1967 war.  They involve the annexation and occupation of Palestinian land, creating facts on the ground and cutting across a contiguous Palestinian state through ethnic cleansing.  They are being expanded at a rate of knots in east Jerusalem in order to undermine the possibility of a Palestinian capital.  The project of expansion and settlements, encouraged by Donald Trump, is carried out with brutal violence and involves settlers and the Israeli army working hand in hand against the Palestinian people who live there.  It is about creating a system of apartheid within the occupied territories with blatant discrimination: there are different roads, buses, rights and laws for Israelis and Palestinians.  There are civilian laws for the Israeli settlers and military laws and rule for the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  Reference is often made to the international community when there is discussion of Palestine.  In my opinion, there are two international communities.  There is the international community of capitalist states and imperialist powers such as the United States and the European Union which, in spite of occasional crocodile tears, back up and fund the Israeli state and provide it with military assistance.  There is also an international community of ordinary working-class people who are part of a global solidarity movement.  It is they who have the capacity to assist the Palestinians as part of that movement.  They can do so through a targeted boycott of any company or goods which benefit or result from the oppression of Palestinian people, including companies such as Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, as well as the growing arms trade between Ireland and Israel.  Workers should have nothing to do with any such trade.</p>  <p>  I wish to conclude by making some general points from the point of view of the socialist party, Solidarity, and our sister party in Israel and Palestine, the Socialist Struggle Movement, about what can defeat the Israeli state's occupation and oppression when combined with this movement of global solidarity.  We point to the mass uprising from below of the first intifada and to strikes, demonstrations and marches on border checkpoints, which show the power of mass movements.  There was an important echo of those in recent months with the protest in Gaza against the siege, for example.  A new upsurge of struggle from below, democratically controlled by committees of struggle, is needed to end the siege of Gaza, the occupation of the West Bank, and the discrimination against Palestinians in Israel and to achieve the dismantling of the settlements.</p>  <p>  The working class in the region has enormous power and is a vital ally.  This week, there was a general strike in Tunisia and important strike movements in Iran, echoing the movements of the Arab revolution which began in 2011.  There are other key potential allies within Israeli society.  The Israeli Government represents the interests of the rich, rather than those of ordinary Israeli Jewish working-class people.  Recent social movements such as the strikes against violence in December and the demonstrations against LGBTQ discrimination have seen unity between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews.</p><p>We need an overthrow of the regimes in the region and the economic, political and social order they represent.  We need economic and political power in the hands of working class people and out of the private ownership of the parasitic ruling classes across the region.  On that basis, one could have the exercise of the equal right to national self-determination and an independent socialist Palestine alongside democratic socialist Israel.</p></speech>

It is a great Bill, although the economic impact it would have on the state of Israel would be limited.  It is highly significant for the rest of the world and, of course, the Palestinian people.  The world is watching and we hope the contagion of boycotting the state of Israel is just beginning.  People Before Profit would like to go further and have a complete boycott of all Israeli goods entering the European Union, including Ireland, and see the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from this country.</p>  <p>  The House has a moral obligation to pass the Bill.  The Minister's statements are complete drivel, an issue to which I will return.  We need to send a signal to apartheid Israel that its policy of murder and occupation can no longer go unhindered under international law.  There have to be economic consequences.  We can hide behind the legal jargon and protocols of the D&aacute;il, while the European Union cries crocodile tears on a consistent basis, but the trade in goods between Israel and the Union is worth &euro;35 billion.  On a daily basis, ordinary Palestinians are murdered and imprisoned for no reason.  Therefore, it is a matter of taking sides.  It is a matter of being on the side of the occupied rather than the occupier, the side of the Palestinian rather than the illegal settler and the side of justice, not injustice.  </p>  <p>  There is a precedent.  In 1987 in this House Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to ban the importation of fruit from apartheid South Africa.  That sent a signal across the world that a small country had stood up for justice and against the atrocities of apartheid.  Nobody in his or her right mind, regardless of political persuasion, would try to defend apartheid South Africa.  In 1990 Nelson Mandela came to this country to receive the freedom of Dublin.  On the Dunnes Stores strike from 1984 to 1987, he said "ordinary people, far away from the crucible of apartheid, cared for our freedom."  He said the strike had kept him going through the darkest days of his imprisonment.  That is what this Bill is about.  Thousands of people have been killed in the past four or five years by the Israeli forces, but the Bill is giving the Palestinians hope in the darkness of occupation.  We must pass it and not hide behind the bureaucracy and jargon of EU law.  Public opinion favours the majority in this House.  The Minister is on the wrong side of history and public opinion in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is so incredibly rare here to express pride in something we are doing as a Parliament.  Like everyone else, I compliment Senator Black and salute Fianna F&aacute;il for introducing the Bill to this House.  Obviously, the Government is the odd one out.  Since its arguments against the legality of the Bill are so utterly and transparently nonsense, I am not even going to waste any time on them; suffice it to say it feels as if the only time anything positive is achieved here, it happens against the will of the permanent government.  That sends a signal to me.  Is it not a mark of how bleak things have become that we are proud of ourselves for taking steps to end trade with illegal entities and illegal settlements that are the result of war crimes committed against the Palestinian people?  It is a mark of the nauseating hypocrisy of the European Union that we are doing this alone and that no move has been made by the Union as a bloc to end trade with the settlements, even as EU sanctions are imposed on other countries.  </p>  <p>  On Israel, there is absolutely nothing.  It is worse than nothing.  Israel is one of the partners in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a key initiative that implies we have a privileged relationship with Israel because of our common values.  Let us be clear: Israel is a violent, criminal, racist, apartheid state that is engaged in a slow but relentless genocide of Palestinians.  It is wonderful that this parliament is standing up on behalf of the Palestinian people.  The Bill is not a panacea, but it does send a signal.  It is incredible and I am delighted that it is is before the House.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Niall Collins for introducing it.  I also congratulate Senator Black who initiated it and the Senators who passed it in the Seanad last year.  I thank those campaigners outside the D&aacute;il who put in a huge amount of work to highlight it.</p>  <p>  It is important to state what the Bill calls for.  It has been and no doubt will be denounced by the Israeli embassy as anti-Israel, or even anti-Semitic, because any criticism of Israeli policy in the illegally occupied West Bank always is.  The Bill calls for a ban on the importation of goods produced in Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine.  These settlements are illegal under international law and constitute a policy of colonisation on the West Bank.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased to sponsor a public meeting in my constituency last year at which Senator Black explained the purpose of the Bill.  The meeting was packed and there was great support for the Bill.  The meeting was addressed by a husband and wife, Fayez and Mona al-Taneeb, Palestinian farmers who are not allowed to work their farmland because of its proximity to the Israeli settlement.  It is fenced off.  On the occasions the two farmers have gone onto their land and planted crops the crops were destroyed by the Israeli army.  Fayez and Mona made it quite clear at the meeting that they would continue to try to farm their own land and that they fully supported the Bill.</p>  <p>  The settlements serve a number of purposes for the Zionist project.  There is a great difference between the concept of the state of Israel existing side by side with an independent, viable Palestinian state and the project of Zionism, the ultimate aim of which is the annexation of all of the West Bank and its incorporation into a Jewish state.  The settlements are a key part of the project.  They provide a foothold in Palestinian territory, justify the presence of the Israeli army and are blocking the creation of a Palestinian state with a viable economy.</p>  <p>  Recently there have been leaks about US President Donald Trump's so-called deal of the century in finding a resolution of the conflict on the West Bank.  The so-called deal is extremely favourable to Israel, accepts the reality of the settlements and Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  What has been reported as being included in the deal has been rejected by spokespersons for the Palestinian Authority, but it has also been rejected out of hand by a Likud Party Minister.  He has called for the imposition of sovereignty over the West Bank and the acceleration of settlement construction to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Passing the Bill would be an important step forward.  I hope it would be followed by other states in applying international pressure on Israel and forcing it into meaningful negotiations to recognise the rights of the Palestinian people.</p></speech>

What he did not say was that Palestinians were living under the tyranny of a brutal apartheid state.  They are suffering and dying every day at the hands of the Israeli Administration, its military and settlers in the illegally occupied territories.  The Bill by Senator Black, in attempting to uphold and, in a small way, enforce international law, acknowledges the right to exist of the Palestinian people and other oppressed peoples of an occupied land.  Since the brutality of the Israeli occupation of Palestine has driven the Palestinian people to the point where merely existing is their greatest act of resistance, acknowledgment by Ireland that this is a gross violation of international human rights law would provide valuable moral support for the people of Palestine.</p><p> The Israeli Administration does not hear the voices of Palestinians or anyone else calling for equality.  The ambassador says we are dealing with a complex issue.  We are not.  It is about equality, human rights and dignity.  In the actions of the Israeli Administration we see the most sustained violations of the principles of law.  If the Palestinians appeal to the United Nations or the International Criminal Court, the Israelis call it diplomatic terrorism.  Peaceful protest is terrorism.  Every form of resistance is terrorism.  Even the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement and its supporters are smeared by the Israeli lobby as supporters of terrorism.</p> <p> The Bill has been designed to uphold international law and impose a modest economic penalty on anyone who uses force and violence to steal and occupy another people's recognised territory.  This is being called extremism by Israel's representative in Ireland.  Standing up for human rights is anti-Semitic if those humans are being killed by Israelis.  The claim of anti-Semitism is used as a tool not just against people with whom the Israelis do not agree but also against people such as Mr. Jeremy Corbyn.  If it was genuinely concerned, I imagine the Israeli Administration might stop selling weapons to openly anti-Semite neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine.</p> <p> I listened to the T&aacute;naiste's speech and do not accept it.  He said trade was an integral part of the European Union.  Yes, it is, but there is more to life than trade.  He stated that if the Bill was passed, Ireland would be found to be in breach of EU law.  Spain, Germany, Austria, France and Italy have all broken the 3% law in recent years, but none of them has paid a fine.  What about the fact that Israel is in breach of international law?  Does this matter?  Is it a factor?</p></speech>

We should stop defending the indefensible - the behaviour of the state of Israel.  We are not anti-Semitic, but we are certainly against the violence and brutality of the Israeli Government against the Palestinian people and several other entities in the region.</p></speech>

I am aware that the Government&rsquo;s position is that the matter is best dealt with at EU policy level, with all EU member states acting in a concerted manner to aid the finding of a just resolution to the ongoing crisis.  It has been ongoing for a long time and is very stark.  However, there are many aspects to how Israelis are treated that I find particularly disconcerting.</p>  <p>  On Wednesday, 17 January 2018, during the debate on a D&aacute;il motion on the review of the Irish Aid programme I asked the T&aacute;naiste to provide details of Ireland's bilateral overseas aid funding between 2011 and 2016.  There is a need for absolute clarity on where our overseas aid funding goes.  In particular, we need to ensure strong governance and accountability protections are in place.  I raised these matters because I was aware that some of the funding provided was being used to indirectly support non-governmental organisations with very dubious links with groups with questionable agendas.  I honestly believe this to be the case.</p>  <p>  NGO Monitor has claimed that Ireland, via its programme of overseas aid development, Irish Aid, provides millions of euros through direct and indirect funding processes for politicised non-governmental organisations operating in Ireland, Israel, on the West Bank and in Gaza.  It also claims that Irish Aid is funding lead campaigns and political activities that are inconsistent with Ireland's policies to promote peace and a two-state framework in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Some of the groups also promote anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish rhetoric and have alleged ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine which the United States, the European Union, Canada and Israel have designated as a terrorist organisation.  </p>  <p>  All of these questions and more need to be thoroughly examined.  In that light, I hope it is clear why I will not support the Bill.  The Jewish people, just as much as the Palestinian people, have a right to live in peace and security.  We must all endeavour to ensure this.  We know about our own fragile peace process and the pressure being exerted on the Good Friday Agreement at this time because of the impasse caused by Brexit and owing to the non-engagement of the two political parties.</p></speech>

I do not know what is going on, but we have no active government sitting and engaging.  I am not blaming one side over the other; I am just indicating how fragile it is, as we know from the negotiations last week with the T&aacute;naiste, the briefing on Brexit and what the Taoiseach said last night.  It was dearly fought for and hard earned.  Our former colleague, Dr. Martin Mansergh, was a negotiator and worked on that peace agreement, as did many others, including Teachta Adams, Mr. Martin McGuinness and Fr. Alex Reid.  We know how delicate the situation is.  We saw what happened last weekend in Derry on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the ambush at Soloheadbeg.  We are never that far away from mayhem, madness and the derailing of the process.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned that money can be misdirected within and around the perimeters of NGOs.  It is money given by Irish taxpayers for a specific purpose in order to take our rightful place in the world by supporting initiatives, but some organisations get carried away.  Perhaps some have been hijacked and skewed, not by a deliberate policy, but it can happen.  We have seen how money from abroad was used to interfere in the democratic process in this country.  We can also see it in how money is used at home, given that very wealthy entrepreneurs now control half of what we do.  We must be careful in our spending and providing support to protect our image.  Will they be fair and transparent and achieve what the House has voted for?  In what the T&aacute;naiste, in his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and his colleagues sign up to with the European Union and other international agencies we must get bang for our buck, not just in financial terms but also in terms of the integrity of the process.  Above all, there must be accountability for the funding provided.</p></speech>

The international community has to a large extent stood back and watched as the land bank that would have constituted the majority of the future Palestinian state has been carved up and fractured by illegal Israeli settlements.  The construction of settlements has caused untold misery for the Palestinian people.  Land is seized for illegal residential and commercial developments.  Olive groves are uprooted.  Palestinians are not free to travel in or cultivate their own farmland.  Access to water, electricity etc. is severely restricted.</p> <p> In the past 30 years, the lines between illegal military occupation and outright annexation have become so blurred that it is almost impossible to envisage a resolution to the conflict.  Today, the prospect of a two-state solution seems very remote and a lifetime away from the promises of the Oslo Accords.  The unwillingness of the Israeli Government to engage in meaningful talks on the future of Palestine, emboldened as it is by the rhetoric of the current US administration, means that as long as the Palestinians can be kept contained peace is unachievable.</p> <p> It is in this context that we must situate Senator Black's Bill.  The Social Democrats strongly welcomes the objectives of this legislation.  It amounts to a simple recognition of the illegality of the annexation and occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The status of these settlements was affirmed by the International Court of Justice in 2004.  It called on states not to render aid or assistance in maintaining them.  If we are to adhere to the Government and EU position that the settlements constitute a major obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible, then we simply should not be engaging in trade with those settlements.</p> <p> To continue to do so will further embolden Israel to annex more than the 42% of the West Bank that it now controls and to approve the building of more settlements.  The most common exports from the illegally-occupied territories are agricultural products such as fruit and vegetables, as well as some types of cosmetics that use Dead Sea mineral extracts.  This is simply theft.  While the value of products imported from the settlements into Ireland is low, somewhere between about &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million per year, the passing of this Bill would send a strong message of solidarity to the Palestinian people and also to other EU member states.</p> <p> As a whole, the EU imports goods worth &euro;230 million each year from the illegal settlements, whereas imports from Palestine amount to a mere &euro;15 million.  Make no mistake, through our inaction we have turned a blind eye and allowed this situation to continue.  In trading with the settlements we give them legitimacy and provide them with the vital economic support that allows them to sustain and, indeed, expand.  In supporting this Bill, we do not wish to position ourselves against the state of Israel.  We acknowledge it as a component state of the two-state solution, but only within the borders of 1967.  That means accepting that to engage in trade with the illegal settlements is to grant them an unwarranted legitimacy.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen as it is a disservice to the pursuit of peace in the region.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Niall Collins on introducing it here and Senator Black for initiating it in the Seanad, where it was co-signed by colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  I spoke briefly at the centenary anniversary of the founding of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and my central message was that we have to play our part in trying to create a world at peace.  It behoves us to take a position on one of the critical issues of our time.  What is happening in Palestine is simply wrong, it is not justified, it is not legal and it is not morally correct.  We have consistently taken that position.  We need to follow it up now and act to carry through what we state in words.</p>  <p>  In my few short minutes I want to reflect on some of the comments the Minister made in his speech and to make counterarguments to those.  He argued firstly that EU trade rules preclude us from doing anything and cited the example of our negotiations with the UK.  As we will argue, that shows that if there is a no-deal hard border the application of market rules on our Border has to have a political context as well as just a narrow reading of the rules.  Similarly, when it comes to trading with the settlements there is a political context that has to be taken into account.  This Bill is not against the State of Israel or the Israeli people and what we are proposing is very specific and targeted.</p>  <p>  On the Minister's supposition that in taking that political context into account we would be breaking EU law, I put it a slightly different way.  We would certainly be testing it or we could be testing that law if a challenge was made.  Sometimes it is the right thing to do to seek such a challenge, go to the European Court of Justice, make the case and then let that court decide.  Sometimes laws are there to be changed and the dial to be moved.  That can only be done by testing the law and that is what we would be doing here.  The Minister also argued against supporting this Bill for fear that we might affect the centre of gravity of what is happening in the Middle East, Middle East policy and that we might lose our influence.</p>  <p>  I am sorry.  I see the centre of gravity in the global political response to the Palestinian issue as wrong.  The centre of gravity is heading in the wrong direction as we see the US Government deciding to set up its embassy in Jerusalem.  We know that is completely contrary to the direction in which we should be going.  We need to act in our small way and sometimes, as small as we are as a State, we can shift the centre of gravity globally.  That is what we should be attempting to do here.  Turning to the Minister's contention that we might face difficulties with US companies and others in the application of these sanctions, I cite the example of where we take a directly opposite view, as I understand it.  I am referring to the threats made by the US Government to levy sanctions against those companies or countries not following its rules on the Iran deal.  That is a similar situation.  We do not always have to follow what that US administration states.  It is right and appropriate for us to set our own course.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned that the Minister is intimating in his speech that the Government would use the money message mechanism to stop this Bill going on to Committee Stage.  The Government has to be very careful with the use of that mechanism.  It is being used on a whole range of legislation now to stymie further debate and the progress of that legislation.  I believe the reason there is universal agreement, as I hear it, among the Opposition in support of this Bill is because it reflects the will of the Irish people.  We have to be careful that we are not using statutory or Standing Order mechanisms to stymie that effort.  I believe the Irish people want to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people.  This Bill is a completely appropriate, legitimate and, to my mind, legal approach.  We should take it.</p></speech>

At its most basic, this Bill is about upholding international law and surely that is something that we should do.  If passed, Ireland and our Parliament will be sending a very strong message to the international community that we condemn the occupation of territories which is deemed illegal under international law.  I was fortunate many years ago to visit Israel and spent some months there getting to know the Israeli people and, indeed, some Palestinian people.  One of the kibbutzim I was on was six miles from the Gaza Strip and, thankfully, there was a strong relationship between some of the Palestinians who worked on the kibbutz and the kibbutzniks themselves.  I found the Israelis to be very welcoming and kind to me as a traveller there.</p><p>Since then, I have always retained an interest in the politics of the region and always hoped a peaceful resolution to the conflict would come.  Alas, that seems further away than ever.  In 2004, the then Newbridge Town Council, of which I was a member, worked hard with the Newbridge branch of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign on twinning Newbridge and Bethlehem.</p> <p> As we reflect this week on 100 years of our independent democracy, it is a good time for us as a nation to reflect on who we are, what we stand for and our place in the world.  We may be a small country but our voice carries significant weight internationally, sometimes disproportionate to our size.  Accordingly, the Bill is important in stating our opposition to illegal occupations that take place in the world.  It is a moral imperative for the Irish people to protest against the infringements of the rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.  The Minister spoke earlier about the Bill&rsquo;s financial implications.  I feel strongly that the need to oppose injustice absolutely outweighs that.  We cannot be content to buy products from settlements which deprive the Palestinian people of their homes, farms and livelihoods.  Ireland needs to be a world leader in refusing to countenance illegal settlements built on Palestinian land.  This historic Bill is an important message from us as a small nation, expressing our solidarity with the Palestinian people who are living in dreadful conditions in the occupied territories.</p></speech>

I know he is a humanitarian but I expected him to have shown more of this.  He stated that, on behalf of the Government, he was unable to agree the Bill was the right way forward.  He said there were three broad reasons for this, namely, legal, political and practical effects.  That is worse than what Trump is trying to do with the wall between Mexico and the US.  By using those three words, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade closed off any attempt to deal with the issue.</p>  <p>  The Government is out of touch with the Irish nation on this issue.  Whatever their political beliefs, over many years the majority of Irish people have been outraged at the way the Palestinian people have been treated.  I recall the efforts of a former foreign affairs Minister from our party, Brian Lenihan Snr., who was outspoken on this issue and did much work on it as far back as 1980.  He was very much in favour of changes to ensure the Palestinian people had a better quality of life.</p>  <p>  Senator Black and Deputy Niall Collins must be highly commended on their work on this Bill.  I applaud them and will stand firmly behind them as they try to progress it.</p>  <p>  Much has been said here today about what has been done to the Palestinian people.  Access to and the distribution of water, a basic human right, has been for many years and still is an ongoing fundamental issue in this conflict.  The Israelis continue to try and disrupt the poor water supply to the Palestinians.  That is an outrage in this day and age.  It is completely unacceptable.  Water consumption by Israelis and Palestinians reflects these stark inequalities.  Due to the allocation of transboundary water resources agreed in the Oslo II Accord, Israel controls approximately 80% of water reserves in the West Bank.  Military conflict in Gaza in summer 2014 left more than 1 million residents without access to water.  The Israelis continue to disrupt the poor water supply in the area.</p>  <p>  We can all talk about this issue day in and day out.  However, Members in both Houses want to do something about it.  We can lobby Europe and have meetings about it like we have for other issues.  We can take a stand on this issue and fight the case in Europe.</p></speech>

I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, on introducing the Bill in this House.</p>  <p>  As my colleague, Deputy Eugene Murphy, said, the argument put up by the Government is that there are legal, political and practical reasons for opposing the Bill.  On the legal reasons, the Government has much greater access to legal advice than we have.  It always depends, however, on how one asks the question.  In other words, if one asks if such an approach is legal, the reply might be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The other question is much more pertinent when one is in government, namely, how does one legally achieve this political end.  I am sure the Minister of State will find a legal way to do what we need to do.</p>  <p>  There are times we are told we cannot do this because of Europe.  I think it is time we tested some of these rules.  If they are as draconian as they are made out to be, then we have a problem.  A small country like Ireland with our history should have the ability to stand up for other persecuted people.  I see no point in having commemorations of the First D&aacute;il in the Mansion House if it is only commemorating in a dead way something that happened 100 years ago.  I see them as reminders of from where we came, what we sought and what we did not get in terms of recognition from other countries at that time, recognition we had to fight hard to get.  We should never forget our struggle.  We all empathise with the Jewish people in their horrendous sufferings.  One would think, however, that would have given them an understanding of the need for generosity and openness.</p>  <p>  I have had reliable evidence from colleagues and other people of what is going on in this regard.  One interesting point is this Bill deals with the occupied territories.  If the cap does not fit, do not wear it.  Does anybody dispute these are occupied territories in Palestine and that Palestinian lands have been occupied?  That in itself is wrong.  The treatment meted out is doubly wrong.  It is time we took a stand as a nation.  If we get a rap on the knuckles after four or five years by Europe, so be it. </p></speech>

We reject attempts made in other jurisdictions to demonise people who sincerely support this political approach and we will continue to do so.</p><p>There are few foreign policy matters on which Ireland has been more consistently active than the Israel-Palestine conflict, and I share the major frustration expressed today because of the absence of movement to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory.  Settlements and the unjust and destructive policies associated with them are at the centre of this matter, and the Government is absolutely seized of the issue.  We know we are most effective when we work with others to maximise our impact rather than going it alone.  We have been active and instrumental in achieving EU policies to differentiate settlements from Israel and, nationally, Ireland has highlighted Israeli settlement policies, including in the T&aacute;naiste's address to the United Nations General Assembly last September and the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p> <p> On a practical level we provide support to Israeli, Palestinian and international non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that defend Palestinian communities under threat from settlements.  Irish and European Union representatives have visited communities under threat and have attended court hearings of their cases.  During his first visit to the region as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade 18 months ago, the T&aacute;naiste signed Ireland up to the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of countries working together to defend Palestinians under pressure in area C.  The Government remains very focused on the settlement issue.  However, the Government cannot support this Bill and must oppose it for the reasons set out in detail by the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p> The crucial overriding argument is the incompatibility with EU law.  It is our clear legal advice, in line with the view held by successive Ministers and Governments on precisely this matter, that Ireland would be in breach of EU law if it enacted the type of measures contained in the Bill.  The T&aacute;naiste has set out why Ireland would be exposed to legal challenge not only from the European Commission but also from secular interests or injured parties like traders in another EU member state who hold settlement goods legitimately present inside the EU market and who wish to sell them here.</p> <p> As the T&aacute;naiste briefly alluded to, in addition to the EU aspect, the Attorney General has identified other legal difficulties with the Bill, including the use of ministerial regulations to extend the scope of the Bill by designating further occupied territories without recourse to the Oireachtas, which is contrary to Article 15.2 of the Constitution.  The Bill provides for extra-territorial application, and as a matter of international and constitutional law, there are limits on the extent to which extraterritorial jurisdiction can be exercised.  There are difficulties in how the criminal offences are structured and defined, and this may give rise to constitutional difficulties with respect to legal certainty and capability of enforcement.  For example, the definition of "settlement services" is very unclear and may be unenforceable.  The essential problem with EU law is, however, fundamental to the purpose of the Bill, and even if solutions could be found to the constitutional issues we have flagged, that central matter would remain.</p> <p> I will respond to a number of points raised by Deputies in the debate.  Deputy Crowe asked if we would consider publishing the Government's legal advice from the Attorney General.  That advice is very clear and it has been summarised by the T&aacute;naiste.  All Deputies know it is a general principle of Government in aspects wider than this issue that the Attorney General's advice would not be published, and we cannot get into an argument of competing lawyers.  The Government takes the advice of its legal adviser, the Attorney General.  Many Deputies referred to private legal opinions, arguing there are provisions in international or EU law under which we are entitled to enact this Bill.  It is not for me or the T&aacute;naiste to engage in detailed legal arguments today, but I am clear that the Government has seen but is not convinced by these opinions.  The proponents of this Bill have, understandably, set out to build the test case that they can for their policy objective, which in this case is a ban on settlement goods.  On the other hand, the Government must weigh the legal arguments on both sides and determine the expected outcome.  Previous case law of the European Court of Justice has demonstrated that it will not allow the term "public policy" to be interpreted broadly.  Consequently, this exception could not be relied on to defend the Bill.</p> <p> Deputies Howlin and Eamon Ryan asked why we would not give this a try and lead the way.  They asked why, if there is at least an argument to be made that the Bill is compatible with EU law, would it not be attempted to see what happens.  That is the language of protest and not government.  No Government would choose to adopt a policy that it considers in breach of EU law.  It would not only expose Ireland to legal challenge, significant financial penalty and humiliating reversal-----</p></speech>

The Government is in no doubt that if the Bill is passed, Ireland would be brought before the European Court of Justice and found in breach of the treaties, with all the negative costs and consequences, as the T&aacute;naiste has outlined.  Any symbolic victory for the Palestinians that might result from the passage of the Bill would be eclipsed by the symbolic victory for their opponents down the road of such a setback at EU level.  This would not send the signal to Palestinians and Israel that Deputies in this Chamber hope for.</p>  <p>  For settlement interests, the overturning of the Bill at EU level could be more than a symbolic victory.  If the Bill entered into force and was later determined to be in breach of EU law, the State could also be vulnerable to claims of damages relating to any period within which the law was in force.  It would be misleading in the extreme to suggest there could be some sort of cost-free trial period for the Bill.  This action would instead marginalise and diminish Ireland's voice in the EU and international circles exactly in the areas where we are and can be of real help on an ongoing basis to Palestinians.</p>  <p>  Some advocates of the Bill have argued that other EU states will follow Ireland's example, but this is wishful thinking and we do not need to speculate.  Ireland is in nearly continuous discussion with EU partners about the Middle East and we know very well their views on all aspects of this conflict.  Many have inquired about this Bill but there are no partners that are ready to contemplate a ban of this nature.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies also queried whether the Bill requires a money message, but it is clear that a money message is required.  Although as a Private Members' Bill the legislation has not yet received full scrutiny, a number of cost implications are immediately obvious.  For example, the Bill creates new criminal offences, with consequent costs relating to the investigation and prosecution of crimes, as well as the prison system.  If the Bill were enacted, it is anticipated costs would arise because of EU legal proceedings against the State as well as fines and daily penalties relating to infringements.  Costs are also likely to arise as a result of private legal action against the State.</p>  <p>  Nobody in the Government is arguing for a moment that the Palestinian people are not suffering significant persecution.  No previous Minister responsible for foreign affairs has been as proactive as the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, in visiting Palestine, meeting leaders of the Palestinian community and allocating very significant funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA.  This is a relief and human development agency that supports 5 million registered Palestinian refugees.  Ireland's total contribution last year to UNRWA was &euro;9 million, with total funding from the Government to the Palestinian people at more than &euro;15 million.  At the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, the T&aacute;naiste also encouraged other member states to increase their funding to UNRWA.</p>  <p>  We want to see this problem solved and to do it we must remain influential and credible in our engagement with the EU in particular.  To pass a law that would immediately put us in breach of EU law and undermine our ability to engage, negotiate and advocate on behalf of the Palestinian people would, in effect, achieve the opposite of what this legislation attempts.  The past two years have underlined the harm that can be done when some individuals advocate policy choices that take no account either of the realities of international trade or the complexities of the EU Single Market.  The Government and the Oireachtas must weigh the real benefits and negatives in this proposed legislation as well as the significant financial costs associated with it.  Having done so, the Government is opposing the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300034#NN00400"><p>It is important to begin by saying that supporting this Bill is absolutely the right course of action.  It is morally correct to take a stand against legal occupations right across the globe, regardless of the strength of the state involved.  This Bill seeks to prohibit Ireland from trading in goods and services from occupied territories by prohibiting the import and sale of those goods and services.  It is no surprise there is such widespread support for the legislation.  I commend Deputy Niall Collins and Senator Black on their work, which they carried out despite strong opposition from the Government.</p>  <p>  To put it simply, this Bill is about upholding international law and every state should be held to account in the same way.  It is recognised that the conflict in the Middle East is complex and we have always supported a two-state solution between Palestine and Israel.</p><p>However, the continued expansion of illegal settlements on Palestinian land cannot be condoned and is contrary to international law.  The international community, of which we are a part, has a duty to call out and try to stop the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank.  We cannot just sit by and do nothing.  We have a moral duty to speak out.  Ireland has a proud peacekeeping tradition and we are well respected in the international community.  We also have our own history of war and violence on this island, so we acutely understand the challenges and the complexities attaching to that and what it takes to move beyond violence to peace.  We are not seeking to boycott Israel and we, of course, respect its territory, but we cannot support the illegal settlements.  What we need to see from both sides is a genuine commitment to achieving peace.</p> <p> This Bill very practically seeks to make it an offence for a person to import settlement goods or services that come from an occupied territory or to extract resources from an occupied territory.  If all countries adopted the same approach, it would make it far less worthwhile or desirable for a state to occupy a territory illegally, so the positive impact is obvious.  Why not lead the way?  It is a non-violent way of encouraging compliance with international laws.  The penalties are a fine or imprisonment and show that we are serious about tackling this issue.</p> <p> The Government's view of the Bill is that while Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are clearly illegal, Ireland cannot ban trade in settlement goods unilaterally because trade is an exclusive competence of the EU.  Generally this is true, but there are exceptions to this rule and the Minister of State knows that.  These exceptions are on a public policy basis.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il disagree with the interpretation of our EU commitments by the Government and have legal advice to the contrary.  The Government is hiding behind unpublished advice from the Attorney General.  In reality, there are other reasons the Government does not want to support this Bill and people know full well what those reasons are.  While it does make trade an exclusive competence of the EU, EU law also provides that member states can unilaterally introduce restrictions on trade if they can be justified as a matter of public policy.  We have had legal advice to suggest that, in this instance, this Bill can be justified on that ground.  To be honest, it does not really take a lawyer or expert to come to that conclusion.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has always respected the state of Israel and continues to do so.  We do not question the right of the Israeli people to exercise their right to self-determination and self-defence, but this does not extend to condoning illegal settlements.  The human rights infringements we witness are serious and very real.  The way in which the Palestinian people have been treated is appalling and has caused widespread anger.  We know there is pressure on the Government from other quarters not to get involved and essentially to ignore what is happening, but we cannot and should not bend to this pressure.  Money and power have a lot of influence in this debate, but when one strips them away and asks whether this is the moral and correct thing to do, the only answer is "Yes".</p> <p> Given that the Government's only reason for not supporting this Bill is its belief that it contravenes EU law, surely it should be looking for a way out of that to try to find a solution whereby it can support the Bill.  Will the Minister of State undertake to get a direction from the EU to see if the legal opinion we are putting on this side of the House holds up because we believe it does?</p></speech>

I also thank many of the NGOs that have played a very important role in informing all of us and advocating on behalf of people in the occupied territories who are negatively affected.  They include Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Sadaqah, which has done significant work on this.  I also thank NGOs in the Middle East that have given us their insight and advice such as Al-Haq and Breaking the Silence.  I also mention a fabulous Irish human rights activist, Dr. Susan Power, who works with Al-Haq and is very much to the fore in helping to advance this legislation.  Needless to say, I thank Senator Black, who has single-handedly spearheaded this legislation through the Seanad.</p><p>It has all been laid out quite clearly for the Minister of State.  This Bill is being supported because it is the right thing to do.  It is about people standing up to uphold international law.  Why should we turn a blind eye to blatant breaches and abuses of international law because of the agenda of others with which we do not agree?  We need to do the right thing here, which is simply what this legislation sets out to do.  It sets out to challenge the <i>status quo</i>because, at the moment, the <i>status quo</i>says it is okay for a country to occupy other people's territories illegally and profit, make a livelihood and benefit from occupying those areas to the detriment of the people who rightfully own those territories.  We must stand up, call it out and say it is wrong.  That is what we must do.  If there are challenges relating to EU law, we need to test it and change it if necessary.  The Government made a big play regarding the opinion of the Attorney General.  There is plenty of alternative advice out there.  We would love to see the Government's legal advice but it will not publish it.  Perhaps it could publish a summary of it.  The three reasons the Government is opposing this legislation do not stack up because the public policy exemption cites morality, security, and protection of human health and life, all of which are at the centre of the contributions of everybody here today.</p><p>The political objection raised by the Government is that we would somehow be out of step and become an outlier in Europe.  I would like to be an outlier for the right reasons.  There are many who are outliers for the wrong reasons, particularly in eastern Europe and the far side of Europe, advancing far-right agendas that are offensive to the LGBT communities and that seek to shut down democracy, freedom of speech and the proper openness and transparency that is required for our democracies.  I am happy to be an outlier on this issue and Ireland should take a stand, just as we did in 1987.  We were an outlier then but I remind the Minister of State that when the then Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, vacated the role and John Rogers assumed the role, the legal advice to the then Government changed and the Government was able to support the ban on the importation of produce from South Africa, and rightly so.  Look at the impact that had and how it changed apartheid and led to a pathway.  We should be brave and bold enough to learn from the experiences of the past and believe that we can bring others with us.</p><p>I do not agree regarding the practical effects.  We need to challenge two things in particular.  First, we must challenge the outrage and offence being built up by Israel that we are somehow anti-Semitic.  We are not and I have outlined in my speech how we recognise the state of Israel and will trade with it.  However, it is offside in terms of the occupied territories.  We also need to challenge corporate America.  Regarding the idea that we are now being offensive to corporate America, we all value the jobs that have resulted from foreign direct investment, but if we look at one of the leading figures in Facebook who came here this week to announce 1,000 jobs, we can see that one of the first things she did was to put her hand up and say that Facebook needs to do a lot more to clean up its act regarding electoral interference and people's privacy rights.  Airbnb has taken an especially strong stand.  It will not list any properties in the occupied territories.  While we value the jobs that corporate America brings, it must clean up its act in terms of corporate responsibility, morality and social responsibility in many regards.  We cannot give it a free pass on everything simply because it provides us with jobs.</p><p>The legislation has popular support, not populist support but popular support for the right reasons.  Given our history, experience and all that has been outlined here today, we intend to pursue this matter through Committee Stage and beyond and challenge the Government regarding how it intends to try to block this with a flagrant abuse of the money message system.  I will give two brief examples.</p><p>Legislation recently passed through this House which put new criminal offences on our Statute Book - the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 and the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018.  There were no issues with money messages in the case of those Bills.  This legislation will give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise expanded roles similar to those given under the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill and the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  There were no issues with money messages with regard to those Bills so the idea of a money message being required simply does not stack up.  This is about doing the right thing at the right time and taking the lead.  We should proceed and do it.</p></speech>

When this section was originally amended by way of a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which we supported in the D&aacute;il, it aimed to compel the Minister to introduce legislation in line with the outcome of the referendum.  Obviously I was not in the Seanad when this amendment was made but it seems tighter than the D&aacute;il amendment.  It says that not only would the Minister have to comply within the two years but it does not give the Minister at that time the option to outline the reasons why he or she would choose not to.

Parliamentary draftsmen felt that the wording of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment was such that, if it were to be given its strict legal interpretation, a report would have to be produced on the holding of plebiscites as opposed to a report on their outcome.  It is a tightening-up of the wording but the purpose of the amendment is to achieve the aim of Deputy Darragh O'Brien's amendment, which was to have a report produced containing and reflecting the outcome of the plebiscites.</p></speech>

I thank the Seanad for looking at this so diligently and for taking on board the arguments made in the D&aacute;il.  We are asking for the deletion of the sections set out in the amendment not on the basis of being negative, but on the basis of the reports that were produced for the Government.  There were three reports - a basic report and two interim reports following on from it.  This report said that giving funding to the city and county councils was a necessary precondition.  It said that this funding was absolutely fundamental before any changes took place.  It also recognised that the local authorities were working very well on the ground and already had existing shared services.  That was acknowledged.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since that report was released my attention has been drawn to research carried out by the economics department of the National University of Ireland, Galway.  It reviewed the literature relating to this matter.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to this research.  It is absolutely non-political.  It was produced by the university and made available to anybody who wants it.  The research evidence examining scale economies in the Irish case is virtually absent.  The proposal came from Government to merge Galway City Council with Galway County Council on a number of bases but primarily because it would be more cost-efficient and because of economies of scale.  This research points out that evidence for this is virtually absent.  It goes on to point to the notable exception of the work carried out by Dr. Mark Callanan in 2014, which raised concerns about the risks of intuition relating to the perceived benefits that flow from bigger councils and local authority mergers.  </p>  <p>  The paper goes on to look at international research.  The most basic conclusion of this research is that the evidence is inconclusive.  Some research says "Yes" and some research says "No".  The paper points out this great divergence.  In a sense England and Scotland are outliers because their local authorities are much bigger whereas many such authorities in other parts of Europe and the world are much smaller and work very efficiently.</p>  <p>  It is a very bad step from a democratic perspective - and I am glad that the Government has now gone back on it - to increase the size of local authorities on the basis of no evidence and in blatant disregard of the Lisbon treaty.  The Government constantly quotes the treaty in the Chamber for many reasons but it fails to comment on Article 10, which talks about decisions being made as close as possible to the people on the ground.  If the Government is in agreement with the amendment put forward by the Seanad, I welcome that.  Any future proposal in respect of Galway should come forward on a case-by-case basis and the Government should set out why it is necessary, why it is proposed, and on what it is based.  A fundamental condition is the giving of adequate resources and staff to the two local authorities, which are struggling on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300036#PP02300"><p>The Seanad made a very wise decision.  The people of Galway were basically being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  A document was prepared by some experts but, as is shown by the university document, it was not based on any real hard evidence.  These experts proposed the general principle of a merger.  As I pointed out to the Minister time and again, they also said that nothing should happen until the money issue is resolved.  That issue has certainly not been resolved in the case of Galway.  It is also fair to say that we seem to be forever tinkering with structures in this country.  I was not all that long mar Theachta D&aacute;la do Ghaillimh Thiar when I met an eminent management consultant.  He made a very wise observation to me.  He said that we are forever tinkering with the structures but that maybe it is time to start making the structures we have work.</p><p>My experience of local authorities is that some big ones are very inefficient and some are quite efficient while some very small local authorities are highly efficient and others are not so efficient.  It seems to me that often the quality of management and leadership, and not the size of a thing, are what make it work or not work.  It is the same with nations: some big nations are not very good at all while some small nations are tremendously effective in servicing their citizens and we can get the very opposite of that effect.</p> <p> If we are to change the structures in Galway it is fair to say there are three big choices we have to make.  One is the status quo.  The second is what I call the "Cork solution" where the experts have said to amalgamate but the politicians have said no, that will not work and then they plan to extend the city boundary.  The third choice is the merger.  Before we come to a conclusion on that we need some answers to some questions.  In any new arrangement we would need to know the financial arrangements pertaining to each scenario.  We would also need to know what powers in an amalgamated arrangement would devolve to the municipal authorities.  In this case the whole of Galway city would just be a municipal authority.  As a representative for Galway city I know that the people there are very curious and anxious to know what residual powers would be left in the county.</p> <p> There are also all of the rural municipal authorities that are screaming out for more power.  When town councils were abolished they were meant to be replaced with strong, powerful, municipal, statutory authorities.  The argument against the town council is around why towns should get something the rural countryside does not get.  They all need the same services.  It was not ever meant to be a recipe for centralisation into the heart of the county.</p> <p> Before we go any further we need an independent, objective study to work out how good the amalgamation has been in Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary.  We need to see if it worked out equally well across the whole of the new territory.  Were there marginal areas doing less well?  How did the socially disadvantaged areas in the urban areas do, for example?  It is not just in totality but also for each constituent part and with particular reference to those who got left behind in marginal, more isolated rural areas and in socially disadvantaged urban areas that are continually left behind even in the cities.</p> <p> If we are being told that we should accept the report on Galway I would like to know why the expert report on Cork was not accepted.  Galway is nearly as big and is certainly as diverse as Cork.  Linguistically Galway is a lot more diverse than much of Cork, and geographically it is nearly three counties; county east Galway - as I call it - Galway city and the county of Connemara.  County Connemara has very little in common even with east Galway, whatever about the city.  Why was the report not done in Cork?  We need to look at this.</p> <p> Representation is a big issue.  There will be 57 representatives on the new authority if one was just to add them together.  Does anyone really believe in the long term that we would have a local authority of 57 members?  Does anybody really believe that it would be an effective council chamber in which to make decisions?  The problem is that if it is decided to reduce the representation, and one extrapolates in the 40,000 extra people who are supposed to be situated in and around Galway city - say within a ten mile radius from Eyre Square - how much representation would there be in 20 or 25 years in the more sparsely populated parts of the county such as Woodford, Portumna and Dunmore in the very north of the county, and in the western parts of Connemara?</p> <p> If the whole area is amalgamated I am concerned that disadvantaged urban areas would be neglected.  Parts of our society where there are huge social difficulties are socially deprived areas where many people do not want to live.  I remember the first time I went canvassing for the Seanad.  I went to Limerick and I was brought into Southill.  I have been in many places in Dublin - I grew up there - and I have been everywhere in Galway but I have never seen anything as deprived as Southill was at that time.</p></speech>

We have, however, massive problems in our cities and this is why we have garda&iacute; with guns on the streets of north inner city Dublin.  These are not security problems; these are social deprivation problems.  I am not sure that when one puts the whole county together that the focus on these areas of disadvantage would increase.  I believe it would actually decrease.</p>  <p>  There is one interesting question that always arises in these amalgamation situations, and which I would love to see on paper before I sign for anything on the dotted line, which is around the status of the mayors or cathaoirligh of the various authorities.  Galway was the first to have a quincentennial year and other places such as Waterford and Dublin followed with 800 and 1,000 year commemorations to outdo us.  There is a lot of history attached to having a mayor in Galway.  What status would the mayor of Galway have in an amalgamated local authority?  Would it be equal to the chair of the county or the chair of what would be, effectively, a municipal district?  I believe these issues need to be looked at again and we need answers before we sign on the dotted line.  Another issue is how the mayors or cathaoirligh would be elected.</p>  <p>  I do not go along with the theory that what is good for the city is not good for the country.  I do not know if my own party colleagues agree with me but I do not understand the logic that cities need five-year directly elected mayors while the areas where houses are further apart, with bigger gardens and a few fields in between are somehow radically different just because they have more space and more greenery, and that those areas do not need the same sort of structures as the more conglomerated housing arrangements that we call cities.  Perhaps 100 years ago the areas were radically different because rural areas did not have water services, footpaths, sewerage systems or street lights, along with a million and one other things.  Now in rural areas, and certainly in the small rural towns and villages, there are the same requirements for services as in towns and cities.  I could never understand this fixation we have with cities and their status.  We think that those who happen to live outside the urban areas are some second-class citizens within their own State.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State can sum up what I am saying with this: I have always believed that in the case for Galway we should not buy a pig in a poke.  I hope today we can agree that what the Seanad did was right and that we can move on from here.  I hope that in the meantime the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, makes sure that Galway gets adequate finance now and not because there will or will not be a merger of the local authorities but because Galway, by all recognition and all independent studies, is not getting a fair share of the money.  This was highlighted by the expert group.  It is absolutely incumbent on the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, without any precondition to provide the necessary money for Galway city and especially County Galway which has been starved of cash.  When compared to other cities Galway city does very unfavourably.  They should all be funded on an equal basis according to need and an objective formula, which is not the way it is currently shared.</p><p>The formula we have is so archaic that it was months before the Department even admitted that there was a formula at all.  When I eventually received it, the Department could not explain it.  That matter is totally separate from the changes in structure and should be dealt with now.  If the Minister of State does not believe me, he should look at his own expert report.</p></speech>

I might be wrong, but the population of the city and county of Galway combined is in the region of 300,000.  County Galway is 6,000 sq. km in size which is a huge area.  Therefore, I do not agree that it should be represented by one entity.  That would be a huge mistake, one I hope will not occur.  It should be remembered that there are three separate constituencies, namely, Roscommon-Galway, Galway East and Galway West, which, in itself, is something of a record.  The area I represent which includes the towns of Ballinasloe, Moylough, Mountbellew and Ballygar is vast and feels neglected.</p>  <p>  The most important aspect is funding.  I have attended meetings with Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Connolly, among others, and know what a massive issue the lack of funding is in the city and county.  The Minister of State is well aware of this, as is the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Kyne, having attended the meetings.  It is vital that the issue of funding be addressed now.  We are all aware of the severe financial position in the county and city.  So much work that needs to be done cannot take place.  </p>  <p>  I support what has been said about the Bill by my two colleagues.  There is also a need to establish a town council in Ballinasloe, a town with a population of 7,000.  It is vital that towns like it have a town council.  There is a lot of work to be done and a need for forward planning.  However, I again say I am not in favour of a merger.  It is the wrong way to go.  County Galway is too vast and has too big a population.  Having only one council to represent would help to make it more efficient.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that it is often the case that a small entity can be run much more efficiently and do more work.</p></speech>

It must be a year since we had our first meeting, with almost full attendance by Deputies from the constituencies of Galway West, Galway East and Roscommon-Galway, to discuss the issue of funding with senior officials.  We were presented with a tabular statement, which was very interesting as it provided information on the finances in the past 20 years and a comparative analysis with the figures for other local authorities.  There have obviously been some changes in that time, including the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, among others.  However, it was quite clear that a gap had opened up 17, 18 or 19 years ago that had never been closed between Galway County Council and other local authorities.  I am not sure the issue was pursued as much as it should have been by Galway County Council, but it has been in the past few years.  Irrespective of questions about a merger, as I pointed out before Christmas, the issue of funding is absolutely critical for the county.  We face a number of challenges which include those related to the coastline, offshore islands and the size of the county that give rise to a potential need for extra expenditure.  I also pointed out that Galway city took in a huge amount in rates that in an amalgamated area would be distributed across the county.  There is a large interdependence between Galway city and county.  Many people live in the county but work in the city.  It could be argued that where rates are being gathered in the city, the employees of the companies paying them who are living in the county do not get the benefit.  These are the anomalies that need to be addressed.  Irrespective of questions about merging the councils, the issue of funding is paramount.  </p>  <p>  I am aware, from the discussions on the Bill, that officially Fianna F&aacute;il supported it for a long period, before deciding to change its mind.  That was its right and I am sure pressure was brought to bear on the Deputies who represent Galway.  That is democracy and it is the case that we do not have a majority.  However, with the proposal for a merger came the promise of a sum of money for the county.  What is the current status of that proposal?  In December a budget was formed by Galway County Council based on the promise of funding.  </p>  <p>  I apologise if this matter was mentioned earlier, but is it still the Minister of State's intention to progress a new local government Bill in the autumn which will specifically provide for a merger in Galway?  What does he plan to do between now and then in terms of cross-party engagement to get the views of Members from Galway and the population of Galway city and county?  Is there a process?  The Bill would be subject tjo scrutiny on Committee Stage.  In advance of that happening, what level of engagement is the Minister of State advocating?  I have had conversations with people in Galway city who, if a merger does not go ahead, still have a desire to see an extension of the boundaries.  I have heard suggestions that places as far out as Barna and Moycullen and as far as the motorway boundary in Athenry should be brought within the city boundaries.  I would have huge concerns about those suggestions, notwithstanding some of the positives that could accrue in the city if it were to happen.  I can see why people in the city would like to take that route, but I would have grave concerns for people in the county in terms of the availability of funding.  If a merger is not to go ahead because it does not have support of the House, as is clearly the case, is the extension of boundaries back on the cards?  What form would it take?  I would have concerns, if that is the route being proposed, owing to the effect on the availability of funding.  </p>  <p>  Plebiscites on the issue of directly elected mayors are planned for May to coincide with the local and European elections.  It was suggested people in Galway city and county would be asked for their views on the issue.  What would happen if the people in one of the two local authority areas said they were interested and people in the other said they were not?  As things stands, the merger is not going ahead.  Will the Minister of State now decide not to hold a plebiscite on the issue in Galway city and county in May?  </p>  <p>  Other anomalies have been pointed to also.  There has been agreement on the Galway city ring road project, on which the county council is taking the lead on behalf of the two councils.  Businesses in the east of the city, in Parkmore, for example, which skirt the boundary between the city and county are being charged rates for the parts of their premises in the county and the city, which is causing complications.  Concern has also been expressed that, while some services are shared between the city and county, for example, the fire service and library services, the city pays recompense for the services it receives from the county.  It does not, however, have a say in how they are delivered.</p><p>While many of us have spoken about shared services being the way forward, the idea may not be ideal in all circumstances.</p> <p> As I have indicated before, at this stage my preference is for a strong unified local authority serving a population of 250,000 and that is growing.  It would have the critical mass to be top of the pile after the local authorities in Dublin and perhaps Cork in terms of its weight.  Given that there has been so much interaction and engagement between city and county, it makes perfect sense to consider the opportunities the merger would allow in terms of a positive redistribution of funding.  I realise the concern is that the effect would be the opposite and that the county would suffer, yet I believe the opportunities for the city and county would be greater.</p> <p> Another issue is the strength of municipal districts.  As discussed, Galway city would have a municipal district in a unified authority.  The districts in Dublin City Council have 63 councillors, as I understand it, and there are five areas.  They meet monthly or more often and there is a less frequent plenary meeting of the full council.  The concern is that it would be a large and unruly or unwieldy council that would be unable to make decisions.  However, I believe making decisions and conferring powers at municipal level with a proper budget would be a positive step for municipal areas in a unified local authority.  That is what has been proposed by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p> I have several concerns.  Predominant at this stage are the questions of where the plans are and where we are going from now.  Will plans be submitted for an expansion of the city boundaries?  What impact could this have on the county?  What is the basis of shared services?  Is the Minister of State now proposing to move forward on that line also?</p> <p> Some genuine concern was expressed that the decision to enact the merger was included at the end of a larger Bill.  I share this concern.  It was not ideal.  I can understand the rationale because the Bill was related to provisions for a chief executive, but it was commented on that this was not ideal.  A stand-alone Bill for Galway, whether it was voted down or otherwise, would have been more ideal in placing the entire focus on our second largest geographical area and in having a full and proper discussion on the opportunities and threats a merger would bring.  In that way we could have brought the idea to the people of Galway and hear their views the length and breadth of the county.  In that way we could also have heard the stories and concerns about population decline.  Some believe this will isolate them further.  The counter-argument highlights the greater funding opportunities an amalgamated authority would provide and how there would be more resources to be spread around.  I look forward to hearing some of the replies to these questions.</p></speech>

Regardless of which side of the debate we are on, we should acknowledge that the Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Phelan, has met us several times to discuss the issue.  This compares favourably with has been done by any other Minister and needs to be respected.</p>  <p>  The report on Galway was clear in stating funding was the first issue.  When we met the Minister of State with his departmental officials, one of the figures went up a little.  The deficit in Galway compares to that in most other counties, although not all, is vast.  We have a county that is starved of funding.  Not only that, we need to consider the turnover.  I see it in the county council and the likes of Tuam Municipal District and Ballinasloe.  There is high turnover of staff who are moving to other places because the level of starvation of money is ferocious.  We have lost good people because of the greater level of certainty of funding in other places.  We have to address that issue.</p>  <p>  At our meetings the departmental officials discussed the local property tax and how at the end of 2019 there would be more euro in the kitty.  A small amount will not resolve the issues in Galway.  I am not suggesting the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has to be the financier.  There are many sides to it, including road infrastructure and the repair of roads.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, referred to the nature of the coastline of the county, while Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the islands.  It must be remembered that Galway is the second biggest county in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have spoken on numerous occasions to the Minister of State about peripheral areas.  Many are seriously concerned that they will be left as the forgotten people.  Galway has approximately 6,400 km of roads.  The budget the local authorities receive is something like 30% or 40% less than what it was in 2008.  That is causing difficulty, which is the problem.  Since a high proportion of traffic enters Galway, more money will be spent there than on a by-road leading to a few houses.  The people living in them feel aggrieved.  No matter what way the Minister of State moves forward &ndash; I understand he is talking about bringing forward a Bill in the autumn &ndash; the first thing he needs to do is show me the money.  Second, municipal districts throughout the country need to be in charge of their own destiny.  They need to know what budget will be provided.  This does not apply only to districts in Galway.  We cannot have a situation where district authorities would have their tongues out every year wondering what was to come.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, spoke about the extension of boundaries.  We all have to acknowledge that Galway cannot remain stagnant or stay the way it is and I would be the first to say it.  It needs infrastructure.  In fairness, I know that the outer bypass project is proceeding.  For many a year Deputy Connolly has been highlighting the need for public transport services in Galway city.  I live 40 miles from Galway, but I can get to Leinster House quicker than to the council buildings in Galway because of traffic congestion.  It is a city of culture and heritage, but these difficulties are causing major problems in attracting inward investment.  I know that the people who represent Galway city have reservations about the mayor proposal.  I do not claim to be an expert on it because when a person lives in the country, he or she does not know as much about it.  We have our own mayor on the county council.</p>  <p>  I will make one suggestion about the proposal of the Minister of State to extend the boundaries.  We must ensure funding is in place for rural areas, including Connemara, Portumna, Ballinasloe and Tuam.  We must ensure the areas on the periphery will be looked after.  It may be worthwhile looking at extending the boundaries because it is acknowledged that Galway city will grow.  There is vast potential that could be realised if the likes of Athenry had a sewerage scheme.  Oranmore is filling up well.  Galway can only grow in a couple of directions because, obviously, there is the coastline on one side.  That debate needs to take place, but I want to be clear on one point: I do not believe the people are against the Minister of State in trying to change things in Galway.</p><p>It is a matter of how we change it and how we put the steps of the stairs in place.  The funding aspect is crucial for County Galway and the people living in the affected areas.</p> <p> There has been talk that the Minister of State will introduce a separate Bill for Galway later in the year.  It would be worth working with the Deputies across the board - as the Minister of State has done, it must be acknowledged - when the changes are brought in.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has noted the money that is going into the five municipal districts, whether it is &euro;1 million or &euro;1.2 million.  Where does this stand?</p> <p> The situation in Cork was miles ahead while Galway was thrown in, as it were, near the end.  To be fair to all parties, nobody wanted to hold up that process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne asked whether some people had changed their minds, but to be fair, everyone was very clear.  They had the same message that they did not want to hold up the process in Cork which had been ongoing for some time.</p> <p> For all counties, we should ensure the autonomy of municipal districts and how they operate.  We must also be careful about Galway.  Whether people like it or not, and I think it is a good thing, it will move out so that other areas such as Oranmore, Bearna and heading out towards Athenry will build up and almost become another part of the city.  There is a genuine fear in those rural areas that they be represented and we must look at that.  One might have to travel a large distance to find 5,000 people living in a rural area.  Proportional representation is very important for those areas to prevent them from being overwhelmed.  It might be a solution to extend the boundaries, and the Department might look at whether that is needed.</p> <p> There is also a question of the number of staff needed by Galway.  They are under pressure.  Talking to council staff in Tuam or Ballinasloe, there are people coming and going, which is not the ideal situation when trying to provide all the services required in those rural areas.</p> <p> Once again, I thank the Minister of State for engaging with us.  He might not like some of the things that we have said but I want to acknowledge his engagement.</p></speech>

However, locals were realistic and recognised that the Cabinet had made a decision over a year ago and that the legislation and the boundary revision would follow.</p>  <p>  An important issue arising from this is the orderly handover of some 400 services operated by the county council in the transition zone, and that it be orderly and clean so that residents are not at a loss and there is no failure of services during the transition period.  People are worried that city councillors would be elected in the summer while the services would be run by the county council or other service operators.  Were something to go wrong in that case, it is not clear who to deal with.</p>  <p>  The implementation group wants to take on all 400 services in the first go, which is very ambitious and might not be wholly realistic.  That is one aim.</p></speech>

The county's concern about the financial package has been well made.  Several amendments were proposed earlier setting out a timeline on this.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the timing of the financial agreement review is not too soon that the county would be left exposed?  It was envisaged originally that it would last for up to ten years but then there were proposals that it would be shortened to three to five years.</p>  <p>  Finally, I refer to the fine-tuning of the line where it runs through the middle of fields, in Ballinore, for example.  There should be more realistic boundaries that would run along the edges of fields and other natural boundaries.  Does an opportunity remain for locals to put forward realistic changes so that the boundary would be fine-tuned in such a way?</p></speech>

An amendment was agreed to, which I tabled, to ensure that the financial review period is extended to ten years, specifically with a view to ensuring the situation with Cork County Council.  I have no role in boundaries, through fields or otherwise, but I agree with the Deputy.  I have always supported geographic boundaries being boundaries, whether it is a drain, river, or a motorway or road in the modern context.  However, the line was drawn and in some places it goes through fields.  It is there now and it is not my responsibility.</p><p>The question of services is a matter for the implementation group.  One thing that has been highlighted is the number of functions fulfilled by local authorities which are often unheralded.  The Deputy referred to 400 services.  It is envisaged that they will transfer on or around the same time.</p><p>On Galway, I assure Deputy Connolly that the Government does support the amendment and I do not expect it will be necessary to divide the House on the matter.  The Deputy can email me the report to which she referred at the Oireachtas email address which I still have, <i>johnpaul.phelan@oireachtas.ie</i>.  I will be more than happy to read it.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the original report on the merger in Galway being proposed by some experts.  The difference between Galway and Cork is that there was a split in the latter case and a minority report was produced on Cork.  Three people had favoured merger in Cork and two were against, and a second investigation was undertaken.  However, there was unanimous agreement about Galway.  It was a unanimous agreement that involved the chief executives of both city and county councils as well as the experts, although I would say that the chief executives are also experts, even if we live in a time when being an expert is supposed to be a bad thing.</p><p> Municipal districts have an extensive list of functions currently, but the situation is haphazard.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right in his assertion that some local authorities are better at performing some functions than others.  I have found that some local authorities have a strong municipal district structure, with the districts being where most of the nitty-gritty work of local authorities is done, be it roads, footpaths or lights.  Some do not have that structure, though, with decisions rehashed or debated again at the councils' plenary sessions.  That is one of the reasons the additional money that I was hoping to give to Galway County Council was targeted specifically at establishing a stronger municipal district structure.  Some local authorities - I will provide Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v with the details after this debate - have a strong structure in place, with local decisions being made locally.</p> <p> I do not want the Deputy to be under any illusion that there are no powers currently.  We have a problem in some of the local authorities across the country, in that there are elected members of all parties and none who do not want powers.  When I met councillors' representative groups a month or so after being appointed to this position, neither could list a single additional power that a local councillor should get.  While I do not believe that to be representative of every councillor, it is an issue that has never been addressed.</p> <p> Several Deputies discussed the merger proposal.  As I stated on Second Stage in this House and in the Seanad, the primary driver was never efficiency.  Efficiency would be expected in a new single organisation where two now exist.  Rather, the primary driver was to see the capital of the west coast, as it were, with a unitary authority that was able to cover the unique features of Galway that have been referenced by, among others, Deputy Fitzmaurice.  He mentioned how the location of Galway city was unusual, in that Galway Bay was on one side and Lough Corrib was on the other.  Lough Corrib and the bay produce a city that is almost a figure of eight in terms of its spread into the rural hinterland.  That figure will change and grow over the course of the city's development.</p> <p> I wish to reassure the House on the issue of funding for the Galway local authorities.  I have a very small amount of discretionary funding, and I propose to put half of that into Galway County Council over the next four years.  My door is still open for the council to come forward with local government reforms.  The discretionary funding is based solely on proposals for such reforms, so I cannot just give it to a local authority.  If the local authorities in Galway have such proposals, the funding that was committed to prior to the Bill being changed can be delivered.  However, it cannot legally be delivered if there is no reform proposal.</p> <p> The status of the mayor of Galway is a matter for the Galway merger Bill.  It is still Government policy that that Bill will be pursued in the second half of this year.  Obviously, the first half will be largely curtailed by Brexit legislation.  The merger Bill is still being drafted and remains a priority for me after the commercial rates Bill, which is the next legislation to cross my desk.</p> <p> There is some confusion about the position of directly elected mayors.  In Limerick and Waterford, people in the city and county will vote.  I want to see a directly elected mayor or chairperson of the county councils in Leitrim, Kilkenny, Wexford and every county.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is right, in that there should be no-----</p></speech>

A directly elected mayor is what is envisaged in the plebiscite legislation.  Cork city is a separate local authority.  It is the directly elected mayors of the single authorities in question that people will be asked about in May.  That question has been removed in the Galway context, but that is the legitimate decision of the Seanad, which I am sure will be agreed to by the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy spoke about the restoration of Ballinasloe Town Council.  My problem with town councils is that they allowed certain privileged citizens two ballot papers in a local election whereas the rest of us had to survive with one.  Regardless of where a town is located, it cannot be viewed in isolation.  That is why I will this year produce legislation on urban area committees relating to towns that cross county boundaries.  It is convenient if towns' hinterlands are located in the one local authority area, but Ballinasloe is on a boundary and the old town council structure took no account of its natural hinterland.  If one happened to live in an area that had become developed but was not inside the town boundary, one would not get a vote in the town council election.  No democrat could stand over the situation of two ballot papers, which is why I intend to reinforce the municipal district structure further.</p>  <p>  Among other Deputies, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, referred to the funding gap that had emerged.  Galway County Council is not the furthest away from the average funding received by the country's 31 local authorities.  A piece of work on the local property tax has largely been completed by my Department's local government section but has not been completed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The model that existed, with more than 100 different variables in the distribution of the Local Government Fund, LGF, was too complicated and outdated.  The new allocation model has not been finalised yet, but I intend to ask the Government to introduce a new model that is based on five variables, one of which will be the distance a particular local authority is from the average funding.  Over time, it will bridge the funding gap for all of the underfunded and less funded local authorities across the country, not just Galway.  It is important that we have clarity and a decision from the Government on the new LGF allocation model before the Galway merger legislation is before the House.</p>  <p>  Several Galway Members have raised the issue of the appointment of a joint chief executive.  This is exactly the same measure that was included for Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary.  I urge Members with colleagues and friends who represent those counties to ask them what influence the mergers had.  They were resisted at the time, but the feedback from Limerick and Waterford is positive.  Tipperary was different, as it did not involve the merger of a city council and county council.  Rather, it involved two separate counties in local government terms being merged into one.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about a process of analysing what has happened is a fair one.  I will endeavour to have such work done.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice discussed roads funding and other matters, some of which are outside my control.  If Galway County Council has a proposal for strengthening its municipal districts, the discretionary fund is still available.  It has not been allocated.  I would be more than favourable towards providing it, but I will not draw up the proposals for the council.</p>  <p>  I disagree with something else that the Deputy said.</p><p>The Deputy was talking about Cork.  Nobody wanted to hold up Cork.  There are a good number of Members who are not present who wanted to hold up the expansion of Cork - not Deputy Fitzmaurice nor any of the other Members present.  On both Second Stage and Committee Stage, there were several Members in the House who were opposed, but legitimately.  It is legitimate to oppose something.  We live in an age where everyone is expected to agree about everything but it is a legitimate tactic, both parliamentary and otherwise, not to agree on particular issues.</p> <p> I think I have addressed most of the questions.  The Government is accepting these three amendments.  It will be returning with a Bill on the Galway merger in the second half of the year.  I am more than open to Galway County Council or Galway City Council looking for discretionary funding for necessary reforms of local government that would allow access to that reform fund but also would ensure that the funding situation, particularly in the county, would be improved in the short term.  There is a longer-term funding solution, which I hope can be agreed in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300042#VV00200"><p>I listened carefully to the Minister.  The first statement I would make is, is leor nod don eolach.  A nod is a good as a wink.  It is incumbent on Galway County Council to put forward radical proposals within the next two to three weeks about strengthening the municipal districts, and with that to make the request for the &euro;4 million.  I certainly will be calling on the local authority to do so.  I thank the Minister of State for the invitation.  I hope that the request, when it goes in, will be honoured.</p>  <p>  On the bigger issue of funding, n&iacute; cheann&oacute;far muc i m&aacute;la.  We will not buy a pig in a poke.  If the Minister of State thinks that someone like me would sign off on a promise of distant vague equality in terms of rights of citizens to equality of funding for local services, he has got it wrong.  The Minister of State admitted in his speech that it is inequitable.  He stated grandly that Galway is not the most inequitable and there are people who are suffering even greater pain than us.  We will mobilise them too.  If the Minister of State thinks we will either sign off on any change or indefinitely accept the situation where we are second-class citizens, that day is gone.  Everybody should be treated equally.  That would be akin to saying, as was said but was wrong and was eventually put right, that equal pay for men and women doing the same job in the public service is a nice aspiration but they will have to wait because we do not have the money.</p>  <p>  There is an easy answer.  Whatever money the Government has, and it is always finite, the Government should divvy it out equally or fairly.  That should happen now.  If there are losers because they were getting too much for a long time, they should bless their lucky stars for the lucky years and say that this is equity.  If there are winners who have suffered for a long time, they will not be winners.  They will be catching-up but will still be at a loss of years of underfunding.  I am putting a marker down here today.  N&iacute; cheann&oacute;far muc i m&aacute;la.  N&iacute;l aon mhaith ann d'&eacute;inne teacht chugam le molta&iacute; mura r&eacute;iteofar ceist an airgid, mar a leagadh amach i dtuarasc&aacute;il na saineolaithe.</p>  <p>  The third point I want to make is that I respect expertise.  I especially respect expertise when they can provide independent evidence for their assertions and where they have done research on the subject that they are pontificating on.  The world is full of experts.  Those experts normally have specialties and an expert eye doctor is not much good to a person who has a heart complaint.</p>  <p>  There is another matter about which we are losing the run of ourselves.  Democracy is about the people electing the decision-makers.  It seems that democracy has become unfashionable in this country and we have decided that we will just become rubber stampers, so when we are elected to these Houses, maybe we should not be given computers or anything, just given a rubber-stamp that states, "the experts say", and leave out the human factors that often outweigh the so-called expert factors.  If it was as simple as the Minister of State says and if this logic of amalgamating Galway city and county was so overridingly good for everybody, then of course we would have to amalgamate Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon to provide critical mass because the same principles that the expert would be looking at would apply there.  I know why the Minister of State will not do that.  It is because people have what experts would consider an irrational emotional attachment to their county and they would be marching on Dublin, not for some financial reason but for the emotional reason of loyalty to a geographic area that they call their county and for which they shout at GAA matches throughout the country.  There are emotional issues, people issues or motivational issues that often overcome physical disadvantages that have to be taken into account in making decisions, and that is why we elect politicians.  Politicians often have a better grasp of these issues than the so-called experts.</p>  <p>  If the Minister of State got rash reports, as I know he did, that parts of Laois should go into Carlow, parts of Roscommon should go into Westmeath, and I know certainly that there was a favourable report to put a part of south Kilkenny into Waterford city to try to help the balance of hurling between Waterford and Kilkenny, then I am sure he can get experts who will objectively tell him that is what he should do.  As for all that area just over the border from Waterford city, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, might know that the experts could propose that but he, as a Kilkenny man, knows that if he were to do that, he would be signing his death warrant in south Kilkenny as an elected representative because there are issues there that transcend all of this so-called expertise, and they are not bad, wrong or unimportant issues.</p>  <p>  As a Minister, I always looked at the expert advice and I always took it into account.  As a Deputy and a county councillor, I did the same.  I am not one to ignore professional expert advice as long as I am satisfied that the professional expert is an expert in the subject concerned.  Having done all of that, however, I then had to weigh up factors that they might not have taken into account, particularly human factors, and ask whether it still stood up.  As the Minister of State said, and he must admit this, he will not put a bit of Kilkenny into Waterford, Laois into Carlow, or Roscommon into Westmeath to amalgamate it with Athlone.  He will come up with another solution because he knows, as a politician, that no matter what a town planner tells him to do, it just will not work.  Similarly in Galway, I know the county, the differences and the loyalties.</p><p>We have the right to point out that this proposal was wrong because it was a muc i m&aacute;la job, badly thought out on a human level and unacceptable to the majority of public representatives across the country.  One can be sure that if such a proportion of public representatives oppose a proposal, it is very likely that the same percentage of local people would have opposed it if it had gone to a plebiscite.  There are no better people to understand the public mood than local public representatives.</p></speech>

I wanted to allow the Deputies speaking on the section of the Bill relating to Galway to make their contributions before I spoke to amendment No. 7.</p>  <p>  As the Minister mentioned towards the end of his most recent contribution, the amendment proposes the deletion of the reference in the Title to the making of local area plans by committees for certain urban areas.  The Minister touched on his intention to come forward with proposals regarding urban area committees.  The Minister brought forward the wider proposals on this issue and, indeed, a host of others at the last minute on Committee Stage.  I know from the briefings provided by the Minister and his officials that spokespersons of all parties present on that Stage expressed a desire to reform the system and acknowledged that problems exist in certain areas in the impacted counties.  The areas in which urban area committees were needed to address deficiencies in planning that had developed over several years, sometimes decades, were identified.  Of course, that was also highlighted during the public submissions stage of the county boundary reviews, through which members of the public articulated their frustrations regarding how urban areas had developed, with residential areas sprawling into other counties and the resultant impact on services, accessing services and many other matters.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of these issues and the impact thereof due to the development of Drogheda, a major town in the north east which has experienced significant residential urban sprawl from its base in County Louth across the county boundary into east Meath.  Many of these proposals were brought forward at the last minute on Committee Stage, at which there was a desire among all members to address the deficiencies in terms of the debate that may have been required to get this right.  When the amendments made on Committee Stage filtered down there was kick back from public representatives at local level and officials in terms of how the proposed committees would be constituted, the statutory powers involved in local area plans and how that would impact across county boundaries.  We must acknowledge that and work with council executives and councillors to get this right for towns such as Drogheda and the other towns mentioned as suitable for the urban area committees.</p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice earlier quoted Tom Cruise saying, "Show me the money."  Money is at the heart of the problem in many of the relevant areas, whether in terms of rates, local property tax and other moneys collected in the areas or the issue of in which county council coffers the moneys will eventually rest.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments regarding local government funding and the model for that, as well as the fact that the Government is drawing up new variables in terms of addressing the deficiencies, with which I am very familiar.  County Meath is bottom of the list in terms of per capita local authority and central government funding.  It is a county of 200,000 people but it is bottom of the list in various funding strands.  Many people do not understand the reason for that.  If the Government is going to reform the system, I hope the Minister of State will come forward with a different model and address those variables to bridge the gaps which exist within a reasonable timeframe.  Last week, I asked the Taoiseach to explain his statement that there will be only modest increases in local property tax and that councils will be able to retain all of the local property tax raised in their areas.  One wonders how the Government will square that circle because less well-off counties are being told the deficit that will exist under that model will be met by central government funding.  The Government does not have a never-ending pool of money and one wonders from where it will raise the required funds.</p>  <p>  Of course, there is a need for us to address the deficiencies which exist in the areas for which urban area committees are proposed.  I look forward to positively engaging with the Minister of State to ensure that is done because it is citizens who are losing out.  A strategy must be drawn up to deal with these areas.  I look forward to positively working with him on this and ask that council executives and elected councillors be consulted to achieve what we all want, which is a better standard of living for citizens in the impacted areas.</p></speech>

In regard to the policy paper, I should give credit where it is due.  It was published in the Economic and Social Review.  I will send a copy to the Minister of State.  Three of its authors, namely Gerard Turley, John McDonagh and Stephen McNena, are based in Galway.  It was prepared in collaboration with a man from the Berlin School of Economics and Law whose name I will not attempt to pronounce.  The paper is worth considering.  It looks at the international evidence and the variation therein and at the need to look at other ways of achieving efficiencies, which is what all Members want.</p>  <p>  It has been a battle to get this far.  I wish that my energy had been used to examine public transport for Galway, for which there is a crying need, as Deputy Fitzmaurice stated.  We have a major housing crisis to which I will refer later this evening on Second Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.  I wish that the Government was zoning in on those real problems on the ground.  Neither the councils nor their councillors asked for the local authorities to be merged.  The proposal came from the previous Fine Gael and Labour Party Government which set up an expert group.  Those on the ground were appealing for the Government to work with local representatives and councils on regional imbalance in towns such as Ballinasloe which need to be developed.  I worked in Ballinasloe for many years.  Those are the types of problems on which I would like to work, rather than a nonsensical battle on a merger that should never have come before the House.</p>  <p>  I do not welcome the fact that the Minister of State will revert in the autumn as that is far too soon.  He and the Department should reconsider what this is all about and go back to the expert group which, regarding preconditions, stated "the Expert Group believes that the amalgamation of Galway City and County Councils must be preceded by the addressing of the existing deficiency in respect of both the human and financial resources available."  It further stated that the "financial resources available to both Galway City and County Councils fall[s] short of that available to comparable authorities and is insufficient to deliver on the role envisaged for Galway as an economic driver for the West."  I am a very proud Galwegian but I do not think that Galway city should be developed out of proportion to towns in rural areas of Galway.  We need balanced development.  If we have learned anything, it is that the county of Galway is very important.  The merging of the councils is not the answer.  I ask the Minister of State and the Department to go back and look at the evidence on the ground to find a better way to proceed.  As the Minister of State is relying on the experts, I ask that he, please, rely on their highlighting of the fact that the councils cannot effectively function because they do not have enough resources, rather than because they are too small.  Obviously, that should be dealt with in the first instance.</p>  <p>  I have previously spoken on this matter and will not take any more time except to once again thank the Seanad and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independent Deputies who have forced the D&aacute;il to see sense.</p><p>This is a very good example not of negativity but of the new D&aacute;il that prevents measures being pushed through without their being based on evidence.  What jumps to mind is the event in the packed audiovisual room recently.  A series of people came forward to talk about science-based evidence, yet a measure was introduced without it being based on anything.  I am delighted, therefore, that sense is prevailing and that the Minister of State has spoken about a discretionary fund.  I look forward to working with him but I certainly would like to focus on the real problems on the ground in Galway, including housing, public transport, health and an overall plan for the city.  There is no such plan because in my time as a city councillor, the city council told me it did not have the resources to produce a master plan for the city, putting the common good to the fore.  We are actually now reliant on developers for a plan for the city.  The council will have some input but it will not be the driving force.  The excuse given to me was that the council did not have the resources to produce a master plan.  Can one imagine that we are back to developer-driven development in Galway, a city whose housing crisis is equal to that of Dublin?</p></speech>

These amendments are very much based on Galway but circumstances similar to those in Galway exist in Cork city.  I offer my full support to the public representatives in Galway and its surrounds because they know at first hand the effects this measure will have on their area.  I can see what is going to happen in my constituency, Cork South-West, where there was not one shred of democracy.  Elected councillors from every party, including Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, as well as the independents, were totally against the amalgamation, especially the serious land grab, which will cost the rural communities severely.  It does not matter whether it is in west Cork or Galway; it is the very same issue.  It is the rural communities that will suffer.</p>  <p>  My main worry is that the public representatives were not listened to, regardless of their location.  Why have we elected representatives in councils who can speak on behalf of and working with the people on the ground if they simply do not have a say when it comes to issues such as this?  They are being overlooked.  Rural communities, be they in Galway or west Cork, are suffering and haemorrhaging terribly, and what is proposed will inflict further difficulties if it goes in my constituency in Cork.  The islands and all the other communities will suffer.  There was no proper consultation or dialogue.  It was dictation from the top.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State considered this.  I will be standing here again, please God, explaining to him where the Government went wrong and what it has cost the rural community of west Cork.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300044#XX01500"><p>The really significant innovation in this Bill is obviously that concerning Part 7, which is giving the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, the option to pursue criminal sanctions against landlords who breach the rules of rent pressure zones.  At the same time, it allows for civil sanctions and the powers to investigate and, where the board feels it appropriate, to impose sanctions for landlords in breach of the rules for both annual rent registration and rent pressure zones.</p>  <p> I have outlined the really important aspect of the Bill.  The rest is important also but this is crucial.  It is important that we take some time on Second and Committee Stages to get it right.  In reality, the criminal sanctions will be used very rarely.  First, the RTB will not have the power to carry out the investigations and therefore its burden of proof in the courts would be very significant, not to mention the costs.  In some senses, therefore, the criminal sanctions will be for repeat offenders, or landlords whose breaches have been continuous or of such severity that they fall into the criminal sanction category.  In reality, we know from various agencies that the sanctions will be rarely used.  Therefore, the really important sanction is the civil sanction.  That is the one we have to make sure works right.  What we need to come out of this legislation is a number of relatively speedy, high-profile cases in which landlords who are breaking the law are found to be doing so and where the sanctions are applied as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I have two very significant concerns.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his officials to examine them between now and Committee Stage.  The first concerns the timelines.  If one adds up all the timelines proposed, including the discretionary additional timelines that the authorised officer may consider, one realises there could be very lengthy investigations, and that is before one gets to the issue of Circuit Court confirmation.  The problem with that, of course, is that during the whole period in question, the tenant, who would more than likely be paying a rent above that dictated by the rent pressure zone rate of 4%, would still have to pay the rent, unless he or she separately took a complaint to the RTB for mediation or adjudication.</p><p>That could take six, eight or, in some cases, 12 months.  That is far too long a period.  I urge the Minister and his officials to look at this and bring it more in line with the average timelines we have in place for other RTB cases.</p> <p> For me the big problem is the requirement for Circuit Court confirmation contained in the proposed section 148Z(2).  What this means is the authorised officer will conduct an investigation and make a finding of fact.  The Residential Tenancies Board will then decide there is a breach and will want to issue a sanction but, unlike the power it has at present to deal with landlords significantly in breach of, for example, the provisions to deal with issues of antisocial behaviour of their tenants, the Residential Tenancies Board will have to go to the Circuit Court for court approval.  This will cost a significant amount of money for every case.  At current costs for barristers at the Circuit Court it could cost as much as &euro;5,000.  It could take weeks and, in some places, because of the court sitting schedules, it could take months.  This means it would not only be expensive but would delay the process.  It is also not legally necessary.  Yesterday, the Residential Tenancies Board issued a fine of &euro;20,000 to a landlord for non-compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Obviously, that landlord has the right to appeal to the High Court so there is due process.  No Circuit Court confirmation was required for it.  I do not understand why there would be any requirement for such a provision, particularly when the provision will actively undermine what the Minister is trying to do, which is to ensure the speedy address of landlords in breach of the Act.</p> <p> My understanding is that we have an Attorney General who takes a particularly orthodox view of the divisions between administrative justice and the more traditional practices of Judiciary sanction.  I have to say this is the wrong approach for us to take.  I suspect the Minister might have some sympathy with what I am saying and I am interested to hear his views and the views of the officials.  This will be a major issue on Committee Stage and I urge people to look at it.  Yes, we should have an appeal to the courts for a landlord when there are sanctions - this is absolutely required legally and constitutionally - but the idea that every case would be referred to the Circuit Court for confirmation simply makes no sense.</p> <p> I warmly welcome the Minister's confirmation yesterday, although he had given it to us previously, that he will bring forward amendments on student-specific on-campus and private accommodation.  It is very necessary.  I echo Deputy Darragh O'Brien's request that it might be useful, if the time allows, for us to have sight of the amendments before formal Committee Stage.  Having spoken to the officials when they presented at the most recent committee hearing on the issue we are absolutely on the same page and I welcome this.  My one concern is that we are beginning to see some universities increasing rents now for the 2019 to 2020 academic year, which is way earlier than they would do ordinarily.  One was in the news recently.  It might be helpful for the Minister to try to use even some soft power publicly to state it really is not appropriate for publicly funded bodies in particular to try to circumvent the changes he is seeking to introduce in the legislation.</p> <p> I welcome confirmation of the work on the rent register.  However, if it is a little more legally complex I would prefer if it were in the next piece of legislation than to delay the Bill.  As the Minister rightly said, we want to progress this as soon as possible.</p> <p> Yesterday, the Minister mentioned he will bring forward amendments to clarify the issue of what will happen to the rent pressure zones when they are due to expire under the current legislative sunset clause.  The sooner the Minister can publicly state what the intentions are the better because there is concern among tenants who are fearful the zones will stop.  I presume what the Minister is looking at is a mechanism to extend them.  Even if the Minister were to say it is his intention to extend them and that we will deal with the details on Committee or Report Stage it would be helpful, particularly for those tenants who are concerned.</p> <p> We are 95% of the way there with the Bill.  The Minister and his officials have done a very good job in dealing with some complex issues.  I urge some serious second thinking from the Minister and the staff at the Department on the Circuit Court confirmation and the timelines.  Whether by Government amendment to this Bill or further amendment in the next residential tenancies legislation, I ask the Minister to consider applying the power of investigation and sanction to all tenancies.  If a landlord is breaking the law outside of a rent pressure zone he or she is breaking the law.  Clearly, the powers of investigation and sanction should apply just as they do in rent pressure zones.  There is real value, in particular with regard to notices to quit that are clearly and deliberately invalid, in applying the investigation and sanction powers.  I emphasise the point I made yesterday that there is value in looking at, not in this legislation but in the next Bill, the issue of serious breaches of minimum standards and overcrowding, just as we have the issue of serious anti-social behaviour in the current Residential Tenancies Act, and possibly applying the investigations and sanction regime to them, albeit with the inspections done as they are at present by local authorities and environmental health officers.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.  The Minister was probably in contact with his office today.  The housing committee has time available next week and the week after for Committee Stage.  We are ready to proceed but we would like the Minister to consider some of the concerns I and other Members have raised and, I am sure will raise, throughout the remainder of the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300045#YY00200"><p>The Labour Party will also support the Bill on Second Stage.  There are many other measures we would like to have seen in the Bill.  The Minister is promising to bring further legislation.  One of the major causes of homelessness is people losing their private rental accommodation. Anything that can be done to strengthen the rights of tenants to maintain their tenancy and to control rents should be done.  This is one of the big crises of our time.  A very large number of individuals and families end up becoming homeless because of difficulties they have in the private rental sector with spiralling rents and notices to quit and move out of their homes.  Every opportunity needs to be taken to make the Bill as strong as it possibly can be.</p>  <p>  To quote from an unusual source, my contribution will be on what the Minister has done and what he has failed to do.  I will start with what he has done.  I welcome the strengthening of the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board, particularly the power to initiate investigations without receiving a complaint from tenants.  This has been long required and it is welcome.  There are issues about which Deputy &Oacute; Broin has spoken on the types of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions dealt with in the legislation.</p>  <p>  One of the concerns I have in general with residential tenancies legislation is that it is becoming more and more complex.  Threshold has called for complete reform of the legislation rather than adding, cutting and putting in extra pieces.  There is an argument for this.  In Ireland, whether we like it or not, we still have many accidental landlords and tenants who do not always have the time or energy in the situation they are in to be familiar with the detail of legislation.  Ideally, what should be done is to keep things as simple as possible.  While I welcome yearly registration, it needs to be kept relatively simple so landlords can register every year in a way that is not too complex for them, perhaps involving filling in something simple online.  Perhaps the Minister will come back on this.  I know the fees will be reduced but given that there will be yearly registration I wonder whether they should be as high as they will be.  This is another question to be raised.</p>  <p>  I want to raise a very specific issue in the context of yearly registration.  I have had representation from a person in a rent pressure zone who contacted me about the 4% limit.  I do not know whether the requirement for yearly registration will address this issue but she maintains some landlords increase the rent by more than 4% in a rent pressure zone even for an existing tenancy.</p><p>Reading from her email, she stated that her situation brought her attention to a loophole allowing rents to increase by more than 4% in rent pressure zones within a rental year.  Her rent was &euro;1,700.  The landlady let this tenant know that she would be increasing the rent, as allowed, by 4% to &euro;1,768 on the first anniversary of the tenancy.  That was done precisely three months in advance as the rule is that three months' notice must be given of a rent increase.  The tenant was informed that a named letting agent would be in touch on 1 October 2018 with an updated lease and associated paperwork arising from the allowed rent increase.</p> <p> So far, so in line with the rules.  The tenant, in her email, went on to state that toward the end of September she was aware that she had heard nothing from the letting agent.  Then, just at the end of the month, she got a call from the agent.  The tenant was informed that, in line with her landlord's wishes, the rent would going up in three months to &euro;1,790.67.  The tenant let the agent know that the expected rent increase was from 1 October and was to go up by 4% to &euro;1,768.  She then took a screenshot of the RPZ calculator showing that her figures were not wrong. </p> <p> In the circumstances, the landlady did not put up the rent to the amount the letting agent had suggested.</p></speech>

This is complicated but I am only bringing it up because I think it might be something that could be looked at in the context of the yearly registration of tenancies.  There are other issues with the rent pressure zones that I will come to at a later stage.  As has been said, I think the criminal offences will only be a last resort and that is as it should be.  It is important, however, that there are sanctions and that they can clearly be implemented.  That means ensuring that the Residential Tenancies Board is appropriately resourced.  We want to be absolutely assured that the Residential Tenancies Board will be able to carry out the kind of inspections and the follow up to those inspections that will be required under the legislation.</p><p>I also welcome the longer notice periods.  Tenancies of less than six months, however, should also have an increase in the notice period, and that is something the Minister might look at.  That point has been made.  I welcome also the rollover of Part 4 tenancies and the publication of determinations.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin, however, that the names should be redacted.  The definition of &quot;substantial change&quot; is something that has long been required as well because landlords have used that issue to give people notice where, in fact, there were only very minor changes.  It is certainly necessary to have a definition.</p><p>Threshold, however, raised the point of what the exact definition might be, with reference to the 50% floor area and the detail of what is in that definition.  It also raised a valid point on the number of rooms.  Does subdividing a room mean that an extra room is being added?  These things need to be stated much more clearly in the definition.  I also refer to building energy ratings, BERs.  They are part of the definition used in respect of improvement and they are also used where a landlord can avoid the restrictions of the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  I ask the Minister to look at that again as well.  If it is only a minimal change that does not cost the landlord an awful lot but does improve the BER, that is not a justification for being exempted from the restrictions in the RPZs.  That needs to be addressed and it is a small change.  The Minister has said that if an improvement is only bringing a property up to the minimum standard, that does not suffice for exemption.  It needs to be specified as a substantial change, however, because some relatively minor changes will bring a property up to a higher BER.  I ask the Minister to examine that issue as well.</p><p>On what is not in the Bill, I acknowledge the Minister stated that he is going to bring in some amendments and one of those will be on the publication of a rent register.  That is critically important.  I know the Minister said that he is talking to the Attorney General about it.  I was concerned with his contribution, as contained in the script that we got:</p><blockquote>I hope to introduce an amendment to allow the RTB to publish rental amounts in its register.  This proposal is receiving due diligence by the Office of the Attorney General.  Enhanced rent transparency is our goal, and it is an important one. </blockquote><p>The way I read that, I am not too sure that is going to be a quick resolution of the issue.  While we want to see the legislation brought through as quickly as possible, the rent register is an important element of it.  I am concerned and ask the Minister, again, to give us some indication if, for example, he has got preliminary views from the Attorney General on this.  A new tenant who does not know what the previous tenant paid then does not know if he or she is being charged more than 4% in a rent pressure zone.  The rent register is, therefore, an important element to what we expect from this legislation.</p><p>The other issue mentioned was student accommodation.  I agree we need to move on that as quickly as possible.  I have concerns about that as well, though.  Will the Minister give us some kind of timeline on when he expects to have clarification on including the elements of student accommodation not currently covered?  When will that happen?  I do not want to see the legislation delayed.  We know much Brexit related legislation is probably coming down the tracks.  At the same time, however, the rent register and the inclusion of student accommodation are very important to this Bill and we need clarification on those issues.</p><p>Regarding closing the various loopholes that exist in the area of termination of tenancies and notices of termination, I would like to have seen something stronger on those aspects.  I refer, for example, to the sale of a property not being an allowable reason for giving someone a termination notice.  There is no reason a landlord should not sell a property with an existing tenant in place.  It is about balancing rights to private property with people's social rights and the right to a roof over their heads.  The least we should have is a system of verifying that the property was sold.  The landlord should also have to indicate clearly, in advance, that the property was for sale and what way it was proposed to sell the property.  There needs to be some tracing of that.</p><p>The same applies in respect of the family members of a landlord.  Tenants can also be put out of a property because the landlord needs it for a family member.  We have proposed legislation on some of these issues, as have other Opposition parties.  We wanted to tighten the definition of &quot;family members&quot; so that it would be close and not distant family members.  A number of reasons are given for putting people out of a property, including doing up the property, which is addressed in this legislation to some extent, the sale of the property, or the use by family members.  These reasons are given far too often when people are put out of their home.  People then find it almost impossible to find an alternative home and they end up in homelessness.  All of these issues are areas where we need to make the legislation as strong as possible in favour of the tenant because people are finding it so difficult now to find alternative properties when they lose their homes.</p><p>I would also like to see that there would be advance notice of eviction and that the landlord would have to advise the Residential Tenancies Board.  The RTB, in turn, would have to advise the tenant and the local authority that there was a termination notice.  In Britain, there is a requirement for the intervention of the local authority in advance of people becoming homeless rather than when they become homeless or almost homeless.  There is much more we could do in preventing homelessness in this area.</p><p>I have spoken many times in the House about extending rent pressure zones to areas such as Limerick and Waterford.  We had this debate last week during priority questions.</p><p>At the end of the year, the current rent pressure zone legislation will come to an end.  Will the Minister advise us on how he actually intends to proceed following the end of the current period?  We should have plenty of time to debate and understand what replaces the current legislation, whether it will be extended or redrafted.  We have to look at those areas which are constantly chasing the national average.  I have made the case again and again about Limerick, the area I know best, where local electoral areas include rural and urban areas.  People in the urban parts of the local electoral area are paying rents higher than the national average, have had the required number of percentage increases over the past number of quarters but they are not covered under the rent pressure zone legislation.  I urge the Minister to amend the legislation in that regard when he is dealing with the three-year period coming to an end at the end of 2019.</p> <p> I also suggest that the enabling provision that would allow for a charge for mediation be reconsidered.  Mediation is a way of avoiding conflict in other ways that can be quite costly.  Charging for it is also counter-productive.</p> <p> I understand from the legislative programme that the Minister will bring forward another Bill on the role of receivers as landlords.  Will he clarify whether that is the case?  It could have been included in this legislation.</p> <p> I also would have liked to have seen a limit on deposits.  One month&rsquo;s rent was always the standard for a deposit but we have seen evidence of up to three months&rsquo; rent being required.  That puts certain people out of the running in terms of having the opportunity to apply for certain properties.  Last night, Deputy Darragh O'Brien raised the need for a deposit protection scheme.  There is enabling legislation in place from 2014 but it has not been implemented yet.  I know the Minister has a different view to mine as to how this should be done.  However, I support Deputy Darragh O'Brien on the need for a deposit protection scheme.  There are many cases where tenants do not get their deposits back, even though they have not done anything to allow a landlord keep the deposit.</p> <p> We really need to take the opportunity to make this legislation as strong as we possibly can.  Whenever Committee Stage will be scheduled &ndash; Deputy &Oacute; Broin said the committee is available to take Committee Stage soon &ndash; we should see considerable amendment of this legislation.  I want the rent register to be introduced, as well as protection for students.  I want the Minister to give us an indication with regard to rent pressure zones and to the protection of tenants from significant increases, which people in Limerick city have had to deal with since the original legislation came in at the end of 2016.</p> <p> We are talking about vulnerable people in the private rented sector.  They are desperate to hold on to the home they have, even if the rent is a far higher percentage of their income than it should be.  They are terrified that if they have to move, they will not find anywhere to live near their own community or job because of the current housing situation.  We need to protect our tenants and, insofar as we can, give security of tenure.  I hope the Minister will look at strengthening this as much as possible.  On the other hand, I recognise some of the measures need to be introduced as quickly as possible.  I hope the Minister will work with the Opposition to make this legislation as strong as we can and that we provide the kind of protection tenants urgently need.  Many people now are squashed into the private rented sector either because they cannot afford to purchase a home, get a deposit or a loan, or because they are on local authority waiting lists but there is not a property for them.  We will not be opposing this on Second Stage but we will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage.  I look forward to debating these issues as we bring the Bill through the Houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300047#AAA00200"><p>January is traditionally the month with the highest number of evictions.  If anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, that is likely to be the case again this year.  For hundreds of renting households across the State, January 2019 will be black January.  It is the month in which they will be evicted or will have received a notice to quit.</p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s homelessness numbers for December are due to be released next week.  They are likely to go over, or, indeed, surge past, the 10,000 mark.  It is a shocking failure on the part of the Minister and the Government.  This Bill represents an attempt to place a sticking plaster on that wound.  Under pressure from massive public criticism and an emerging housing protest movement, the Minister and the Government are taking some hesitant steps to improve renters&rsquo; rights.  Solidarity&ndash;People Before Profit will support any improvements in this regard.  Accordingly, we will not be blocking the Bill on Second Stage.  However, we will point to its many shortcomings and seek to improve it.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for an increase in fines for non-compliant landlords.  For example, a landlord in a rent pressure zone who illegally breaches the 4% increase cap is liable to a fine of up to &euro;15,000, as well as having costs of up to &euro;15,000 awarded against him or her.  That is a step forward.  However, does it go far enough?  One must look at the consequences of the landlord&rsquo;s action.  By hiking rents over and above the legal limit, that landlord may well - in many cases already has - illegally evicted a household into homelessness.  Such an act can adversely affect the lives of men, women and children.  I noted the comments of the Ombudsman for Children who talked about the effect that homelessness can have on children, including young people especially.  Is a fine a sufficient penalty for a landlord who knowingly effectively evicts a family into homelessness as a result of an illegal rent hike?  Why is there no provision, for example, for a jail sentence?  Maybe it is time we saw a few sleek landlords put behind bars for illegally evicting men, women and children into homelessness.  I believe it is and that the Bill is not sufficiently tough in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the issue of &ldquo;renovictions&rdquo;, for some time we have been making the point from these benches in housing debates that the provision in the rent pressure zone legislation that allowed rent increases above the 4% in examples of substantial renovations to the property, was a massive loophole which would be used and abused by landlords.</p><p>We were told from the Government benches that it would keep an eye on this, and see what happened.  We were asked not to jump the gun but it was clear to anybody who knows what goes on in the country what would happen.  That is precisely what has happened.</p> <p> The Bill represents an attempt to tighten the loophole but it does not close it.  A tenant should have the right to veto the idea of renovations and the rent hike that would come on foot of a renovation.  If a tenant wants the renovation and is prepared to pay the rent increase and perhaps leave the property for a period before returning when the work is done, it would be fair enough.  In all other cases the tenant should have the right to say "No".  The loophole has been tightened but we raise a question about one aspect of the process that may not represent an improvement at all.  It may even present a new loophole.  It relates to a point raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, specifically upgrades implemented to improve the building energy rating, BER.  The 4% rent cap can be circumvented, allowing a bigger rent hike, where there is a BER upgrade.  I am no engineer and I stand to be corrected but I can foresee many circumstances where a building energy rating upgrade might not require massive change, investment or renovation of a property.  Does such a clause not provide landlords with a new loophole whereby rent could be hiked above the 4%, and on foot of such action, a resident could be forced into homelessness because of what is far from a major change within a property?  We would like to see that loophole closed.</p> <p> I agree with the points raised by Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin about certain court confirmations.  It will be an important part of the debate on Committee Stage.  The increased notice that landlords must give under the terms of this Bill when issuing a notice to quit represent a step forward.  It is a sign of the pressure being exerted by the emerging housing protest movement.  However, these notices are not anything to write home about.  Somebody who has lived in a property for more than three years and less than four years must be given notice of 120 days instead of 84 days.  It is slightly less than four months when the person may have lived in the property for nearly four years and is about to have his or her life turned upside down.  I am in favour of a ban on economic evictions but if evictions are to be allowed in certain circumstances, a tenant should be at least entitled to at least a doubling of the notice, if not more.</p> <p> I ask about the remedial notices that are to be served within 28 days of a determination order.  These apply to remedy what are described as minor defects in notices to quit.  As I understand the current position, a landlord might issue a notice to quit with incorrect information, rather than a minor slip, such as an error in the numbers of days of notice, the name of the tenant etc.  In such a case, a tenant can go to the Residential Tenancies Board, argue that it is not a valid notice to quit and, if the board rules in the tenant's favour, the landlord would have to start the process again.  Effectively, this buys the tenant more time in which to find alternative accommodation.  I am seeking clarification as it seems that allowing a remedial notice within 28 days to fix minor defects in notices to quit will lead in such cases to a landlord being able to amend the notice without having to go back to the start.  This is provided that an extra 28 days is granted to the tenant.  In other words, this means a tenant would have less time under this legislation than he or she might have with the current law.  I am not certain of my argument as the wording of the legislation is a little unclear, so I will pose this as a question.  If that is the position and my interpretation is correct, the change will serve to speed up evictions and afford less time and opportunity to tenants.  It is potentially a step backwards.</p> <p> Stronger measures are needed.  The anti-eviction Bill proposed by Solidarity before Christmas contains some of those stronger measures.  It would ban so-called renovictions and the sale of property as grounds for eviction, as is currently the case in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.  That Bill will now come before a committee for Committee Stage on either 5 February or 20 February.  It is an important debate and all housing activists in the country will have their eye on how that Bill progresses.  It should be fast-tracked.</p> <p> Last but not least, my party and I are of the opinion that whereas legislative change in this place can make some difference - we are not indifferent to it - massive people power pressure is required from below to force the real changes that are needed.  That is why we invest and place hope in the emerging housing protest movement in this country.  We welcome the fact that Raise the Roof is now discussing the idea of organising protests at councils nationwide over the next couple of months and the concept of a national demonstration in April.  We will support that, and it is something every student union and trade union in the country should work towards.  Everybody who cares about or is affected by the housing crisis in the country should participate to make the demonstration planned for the end of spring the biggest and most effective housing protest we have seen in the State so far.</p></speech>

She applied to go on the housing list a number of years ago but she earned too much and was above the cap for the Dublin City Council list.  She was in rented accommodation for 14 years and in October she and her partner, a 64 year old man, found themselves homeless because their landlord served a notice to quit on the basis of selling the property.  They ended up living with her brother and his family, which has caused much tension in the family home.  The woman and her partner move out every so often, telling her brother they are going to a friend's house, but they end up sleeping for perhaps two nights in a car to get out of the house and give her brother's family some relief.</p>  <p>  This woman has reduced her hours of work at the support centre.  I made it clear to the Taoiseach that this woman gets up early in the morning to go to work but she had to reduce her hours from 39 to 28 per week to get on a housing list.  Workers are finding themselves in dire circumstances and must act to get themselves on a housing list.  These people now have no hope of getting private rented accommodation because their income is so low and they are at the end of a housing list.  She told me she was No. 384 on the list.</p><p>That is one situation.</p> <p> Another situation in Crumlin involves a block of apartments bought by a vulture fund that then issued an eviction notice to all the tenants because major renovations were to take place that would take three to four months.  They were down in the office last week and we saw that one of the termination notices was worded wrongly so we will take it to the RTB.  As the previous speaker noted, this is just buying time so that these tenants can possibly get other private accommodation, which is very hard to do.  It will be practically impossible for those families to get somewhere, but at least we will try to buy them a bit of time and see what happens.  If push comes to shove, those families have to decide whether to accept being evicted or stay in these apartments because they have nowhere else to go.</p> <p> A young woman came to my office this morning having been made homeless yesterday and put into bed and breakfast accommodation last night.  She had to leave that bed and breakfast at 9  this morning with three children, one of whom is only three weeks old.  She was wandering the streets and ended up in our office wondering what to do.  Imagine putting a family with three children, one of whom is a three week old baby, out into the cold today.  One would not put a dog out into it but she was out wandering the streets trying to find accommodation.  When we speak about things like this, we must talk about what is happening to many people on the ground and take it out of the bubble here in the D&aacute;il.  This is happening all over the country.  It is not just happening in my constituency.  We eventually got that woman more permanent accommodation in a hotel in Parnell Street in Dublin at 4 p.m., so at least temporarily she will not have to leave early in the morning with her three children, roam the streets for a day and go back to a bed and breakfast at 9 p.m.</p> <p> That is the reality of the housing crisis and it is an outrage.  This did not just happen today or yesterday.  It was happening when people like Deputies Boyd Barrett and Durkan and I raised the crisis that was unfolding in front of our eyes in 2012, so there has been plenty of time to try to address the issues.  Yet again, we have a Government that is content to tinker around the edges of this crisis when what is needed is urgent emergency and radical action.  This Bill comes nowhere near that.  It is typical of the Government's approach - too little, too late.  It is playing catch up.  The Government changes something, we then see the complexities and loopholes and we have to come back with more legislation.  It is a case of too little, too late, and we cannot upset the landlords and developers.  This Bill will not lead to fair rents or security of tenure in rented accommodation.</p> <p> Three things are required to fix this.  We need a properly enforceable rent cap.  Rent caps should be tied to the average rent in a particular area or some equitable way of dealing with those rents.  No evictions should be permitted except for non-payment of rent or the use of premises for criminal or serious antisocial behaviour, and there should be an end to spurious claim of wanting the premises back for a family member, renovation or because the property is being sold.  We need serious measures to combat illegal evictions.  My office has dealt with numerous cases of illegal evictions over the past two years.  I said last week that we are at the RTB every week with a different case representing tenants facing eviction.</p> <p> The measures in the Bill are welcome but they are not enough.  We need a significant increase in the supply of rental units, which will not be achieved by developers, who are sitting on zoned land waiting for the new height regulations to come in.  The Government must move to a policy of public housing on public land using the cost recovery model to provide fair rent homes with security of tenure in addition to local authority housing under the differential rent scheme.  A total of 70,000 cost rental units and 30,000 council houses could be built on existing zoned State-owned land.  This would provide real competition in the market so beloved by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  The private sector would be forced to provide fairer rents and greater security of tenure if it wanted to compete with the State sector.  I will not be opposing this Bill but I think it needs serious amendment on Committee and Report Stages to give it teeth.</p> <p> I reiterate what Deputy Barry said.  I understand that ICTU is holding a press conference tomorrow at 11 a.m. in the Oak Room in the Mansion House to announce a plan of action over the coming year as part of its Raise the Roof campaign for public housing.  One of the actions will be to call a conference on 30 January in the Communications Workers Union Hall on the North Circular Road to discuss how to launch a campaign and not a campaign that just involves demonstrations.  This must be a campaign on the ground involving how we highlight lands that are available on which to build cost rental units and public housing on public land and how we take action to make sure the lands that are there are used in a way that will make a difference to our communities.  Those who want real solutions to the horror of homelessness and the shortage of housing should look to that campaign and not to a Government that has failed miserably on this issue.</p></speech>

I wish to place the Bill in context.  There are positive things in it but there are other items that need to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The context is, of course, the fact more than one in three of the 10,000 people who are homeless are children.  A doctor said recently in the media that when children attend doctors' surgeries, their families come with them because they are homeless.  I will have been three years in the D&aacute;il in February.  I do not think there is a single month where my colleagues and I have not spoken about housing.  We have done this not to be negative.  There have been many allegations from the Government side that we are ideologically stuck on something.  I am not ideologically stuck on anything.  I am a very pragmatic and practical Independent Deputy.</p>  <p>  From the minute I entered the House, I, along with my colleagues, pointed out the existence of a housing crisis.  Galway is on the same level as Dublin.  It is impossible for people to get rental accommodation in Galway.  The local authority housing list goes back to 2002.  We have a plan for an outer bypass that may or may not go ahead in 2024 or 2025.  I have my own view on that.  I think public transport would be a far more efficient way to progress things in Galway.  I make the point that quite a substantial amount of residential zoned land in Galway has been frozen for a proposed road.  I have also mentioned repeatedly that not one single local authority house has been built since 2009 in Galway until very recently.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who has left the Chamber, referred to a crisis, and she is right, but that crisis has been created because this Government and the previous one failed to enter the market as a landlord.  There is a very important role for this Government to play.  It can act as a landlord through the local authorities and send a message to the market that it is serious about this and that it has a duty to provide homes, be they public homes or affordable housing, although I have doubts about the word "affordable" because when that scheme was introduced in Galway, the houses were certainly not affordable and people were caught.  I am more attached to the words "public housing", that there is a duty on the Government to provide housing to balance the market.  If we do not balance the market, it will not matter how many pieces of legislation the Government brings before us.  We will have a housing crisis and only the landlord class will win.</p>  <p>  It is ironic that this debate comes two days after we celebrated 100 years of the first D&aacute;il, which was only 20 or 30 years after the period involving Michael Davitt who lived to 1906.  We are nearly back in the same position, looking for security of tenure and the basic rights the Land League was seeking in not the last century but the 19th century.  We look at this Bill in that context.</p>  <p>  This Bill is part of a jigsaw as a result of pressure from the various Deputies outside the Government who told it from day one that there is a crisis.  We have a piece of a jigsaw without an overall picture.  If the Minister could come back to the overall picture and tell us how these pieces of the jigsaw fit into it, it would be helpful because I can see no overall picture.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the documents he produced and Rebuilding Ireland.  What I see is an Ireland being rebuilt in the developers' name.</p><p>That is what I see in Rebuilding Ireland.  I want Ireland rebuilt, but in the name of its citizens with public housing on public land.  Every initiative the Minister brings before us is to bolster the market.  This Bill relates primarily to the rent pressure zones which the Minister brought in under pressure and which really are not working.  They are certainly not working in Galway.  We have one year of this limited measure left.  It is not clear what is going to happen.  Other Deputies have asked for clarification on that.</p> <p> Student accommodation does not come into this Bill.  I note that the Minister is going to come back with amendments.  I look forward to his clarifications on that area.  Again, it is a major problem in Galway.  We have seen students coming forward to us over the past two years highlighting astronomical increases without any justification.  I believe that the universities are partly responsible for this because, certainly in Galway, they have gone down the road of more and more buildings while utterly failing to provide sufficient affordable accommodation on campus.  </p> <p> Over the past two years I have participated in many debates on mortgages, mortgage arrears and people losing their homes because of their inability to pay mortgages.  All of this time the other problem was people being evicted for failure to pay rent because they simply were not able to do so.  We are refusing altogether to look at that.</p> <p> I welcome that the period for notices to quit is going to be increased.  I welcome the yearly registration, although I do not welcome the involvement of money, however small, in that regard.  I do not think it is necessary.  I do not welcome it being left open to introduce a fee in respect of mediation.  I welcome the publication of determination orders, but I do not think the names should be included.  I welcome the increased powers given to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, in respect of enforcement, although I have concerns relating to the criminal aspect.  I look forward to that being teased out on Committee Stage.</p> <p> We are now in a position to go back to my original point about the Government supporting the market.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, was brought in under the previous Government.  It is a major part of the problem.  We had rent supplement and the rental accommodation scheme, which were temporary measures to be replaced by the housing assistance payment brought in by the previous Government.  In Galway we were repeatedly told that it was the only game in town.  It is a payment directly into the landlord's pocket and was considered to be adequate social housing.  What happened was a rewriting of housing rights to say that a person is adequately housed in a private house.  That is a fundamental part of the problem.  The Minister should look at HAP and say that he is going to get rid of it.  Obviously it cannot be got rid of overnight as people are utterly reliant on it, but as a policy it is unacceptable and it is bolstering the market.  Spending on the payment has gone from &euro;151 million up to &euro;300 million last year and is expect to rise to &euro;451 million for this year alone.  This is spending on one scheme without looking at any of the other schemes.  If we put them all together it comes to approximately &euro;1 billion going directly into a private market and yet we wonder why rents are increasing all of the time.  We then bring in these little pieces of a jigsaw to try to deal with the matter under pressure rather than asking what the real picture here is.  The real picture is the duty on us to house our citizens and to provide a variety of housing right in each town and city and throughout the country so that there will be no crisis.</p> <p> Galway city is twinned with Lorient.  Councillors have gone over to Lorient on many occasions and have noted that in an area the same size as Galway, there is no housing crisis and no traffic crisis.  I understand that in Vienna somewhere between 21% and 23% of housing is public housing.  Why is the Minister not looking at these cities and learning from them rather than wasting time in the D&aacute;il telling us that we are stuck on some ideological trip or are being deliberately negative, as opposed to saying that we are sensible people who have come here with a purpose and who have been elected to do a job?  Our job is to say that there is a housing crisis.  It is not inevitable.  It has been created and it can be uncreated, so to speak, and changed to provide homes for our citizens.  In the meantime, we are left supporting legislation like this and left reliant on Threshold, the Simon Community and the other bodies on the ground that are telling us there is a severe problem.</p> <p> According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, there were 497,111 occupations in the private rental sector in 2016.  This is a significant increase on the figures from the 2011 census and yet we are not learning and are putting more and more people into rented accommodation.  We end up demonising landlords, which is not appropriate.  We need landlords and a competitive market, but we need the Government to be the primary landlord to balance the market.</p></speech>

I am happy to speak on this important Bill.  It provides for powers to carry out investigations of landlords and to impose administrative sanctions.  It also provides for offences in respect of non-compliance with restrictions on rent increases in rent pressure zones.  It also seeks to increase the notice periods to be provided in the case of termination of tenancies by landlords, to provide for annual registration of tenancies by landlords, and to amend the registration process.</p>  <p>  Many of these provisions are worthwhile, particularly the increased notice periods.  This is of vital importance.  Such rights must be protected in a proportionate and balanced matter.  I am aware of one particular case involving a family of a husband, a wife and five children, whom I know very well.  This family was renting a property for 14 years while trying to save for a mortgage and while also being on the housing list.  The family never missed a month's rent and never once asked for a contribution from the landlord towards the upkeep of the property.  They kept the house in exemplary condition.  Despite this, the landlady sought legal advice about a lane adjacent to the property and somehow managed to undercut the lease agreement, saying that the family did not have full possession of the property as she used the lane to access her own property next door.  That family ended up in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and went through awful trauma.  They are now housed thanks to Wicklow County Council, but their story goes to show how weak the rights of tenants can become.</p>  <p>  I do note, however, that the Bill provides for the empowerment of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to investigate a landlord without the need for a complaint from the public.  I have very serious concerns around this aspect of the Bill.  From additional reading, it seems to grant considerable, and possibly disproportionate, powers to the board.  I have very intimate knowledge of the case I spoke about earlier.  Deputies Michael Collins and Michael Healy-Rae will understand where I am coming from.  However, I have concerns about the RTB getting this kind of power.  Some people who get on such boards get overzealous about their powers.  We need balance at all times.  I am not here to demonise landlords.  As the Minister knows, if we did not have landlords we would not have any houses.  We need the man who is prepared to spend a few bob, to make an investment, and to put his property up for rent.  Once such people are reasonable, that is fine.  As far as I am concerned, it is all fair once it is a two-way process.</p>  <p>  As I have said, I have very serious concerns about the aspects of the Bill that give too much power to the board.  Once safeguards around the compilation of evidence justifying investigation without a public complaint are in place, however,  it may be worth supporting.  Why would somebody start an investigation without there being a complaint?  Are we asking for trouble in asking for things like that?  We need balance at all times.  We cannot demonise all landlords because we now see that they are fleeing the market and that there are fewer and fewer houses available.  The Minister and the local authorities are not providing them.  Those are my concerns.</p></speech>

While I welcome the protection of tenants and I believe the Bill will give tenants more rights, I am afraid that the Bill is anti-landlord.  I imagine that it is very hard for the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to find a balance because I acknowledge that sometimes I would be on the other side of the fence giving out the other way.  I know it is hard to find a balance but there are some issues of concern.</p>  <p>  There is a big difference between a landlord who owns a number of apartment blocks and the normal Joe Soap who owns a second property and is renting it out.  I am aware that many of my constituents are in this boat where they may have built, bought or acquired a second property during the boom years but now this second property may be putting a lot of financial pressure and strain on them.  Now these people will have to keep abreast of these new changes and there are serious implications for breaches of these new rules.  With regard to registration with the Residential Tenancies Board, am I correct that people will now have to register once a year at a cost of &euro;90?  If so, then it is an extra cost on those who are renting the property.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</p>  <p>  I welcome that tenants are being protected with the minimum termination notice, which will increase to 90 days for all tenancies less than one year, and to 120 days for all tenancies between one and five year duration.  This will place Ireland in line with EU countries such as France, Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany.  I do not want Members to forget, however, the other side of the coin when it comes to the landlord&rsquo;s side.  When they have a bad tenant who may not be paying the rent and who may be physically damaging the property where are the landlord rights in the Bill?</p>  <p>  I saw a very sad case in my constituency area of west Cork.  A lady had rented out her house to tenants who have destroyed the house and refused to pay rent for months on end.  It cost this woman a substantial amount of money to evict these rogue tenants.  Not only was she down money from the rent she had not received, she also had solicitors' fees afterwards and the costs to repair all the damage to the house.  This lady was in bits when I was talking to her.  She told me that she never wanted to rent a property again.  It was heartbreaking to hear her story and to see how upset she was.  I would like to stand here and say that this story is one in a million, but sadly it is not.  Where are rights for landlords in these cases?</p>  <p>  Under this Bill the proposed maximum fines for breaches of the Act by landlords will increase from &euro;3,000 to &euro;15,000.  Furthermore, the Minister has indicated that he is considering extending criminal liability to landlords who disregard the maximum 4% rent increase provisions within rent pressure zones.  I do not argue that there have to be repercussions for landlords who breach the law, but I am concerned about whether all landlords will be aware of the changes in the legislation when these new laws come into effect.  If the Minister is imposing such strict and severe penalties, it is only fair that each landlord would be written to individually to make them aware of the changes and of the landlord&rsquo;s new responsibilities.</p>  <p>  I am also concerned that with these new changes and extreme penalties for landlords we will see more landlords deciding to sell their properties.  If this happens it will only add to our current housing crisis.  In my constituency and in towns like Bandon, Kinsale, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Schull and Bantry people who are in receipt of housing assistance payment, HAP, are struggling to find accommodation.  A major problem with HAP from a landlord&rsquo;s perspective is that it is paid to the landlord in arrears.  This means the landlord only gets the money after the rent is due.  This has to be a major factor influencing landlords to choose a private tenant who pays in advance over a HAP tenancy where the landlord is paid in arrears.  If the Government is serious about tackling the housing crisis the Minister will look again at the HAP scheme and at the possibility of paying the landlord in advance, which is the norm in the rental market.  This would go a long way towards helping people who are receiving HAP to get accommodation.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is not that balance.</p>  <p>  Every one of us as politicians is, rightfully, concerned about the rights of tenants and about housing for people who are not able to provide housing for themselves, be it through local authority housing, through HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or other housing schemes.  We must, however, have balance.  We have to realise that people who own property are not to be demonised and are not to be criminalised in this Bill.  I do not believe it is necessary to register a property every year.  It is absolutely unnecessary.  The Minister is putting an additional cost onto people who have survived a massive recession, who bought properties, perhaps at the very high end of the market, and are left paying off exorbitant loans.  They were trying to bring in rent and balance their books when rents were very low.  Every week I hear of people who have different jobs and who use money from these wages to pay for their property, for which they borrowed money, in order to provide accommodation and rent it out in the rental market.</p>  <p>  I was asked to tell the Minister a specific story and I want him to listen to it so he will hear a different side of the argument.  Picture this; a young couple who perhaps are younger than the Minister, left Ireland and went to Australia.  They worked very hard.  They are two, young, hard, tough people - a nice boy and a nice girl.  They made a bit of money in Australia and they saved it up.  The couple said that I could use their names in the D&aacute;il if I wanted to but I will not, because I do not believe it would be polite to do so.</p>  <p>  They are a real couple from Ireland.  They worked away and were saving their money.  They wanted to think of doing something progressive with the money.  They thought that in the future, when they might have a family, they would want to come back to Ireland and settle here with their family and because they thought their work would help them finish up in Dublin they decided to buy a property in Dublin.  They bought the property, which was more than &euro;600,000.  They had some savings and they borrowed the rest.  As we can imagine, if one borrows &euro;400,000 or &euro;450,000 there is a big loan to pay.</p>  <p>  The rent on the property was fixed at what I would consider to be exorbitant because the rents are a lot lower where I come from - while they are still high they are relatively low if one is paying a mortgage.  The rent the couple were getting was &euro;2,200.  Another couple rented the house and paid one month's rent and a deposit but they have never paid another penny since.  These tenants are taking a case against the boy and the girl in Australia and are saying that they are being harassed by the property owners.  The harassment consists of the letting agent in Dublin trying to make contact with the tenants who are living in the house to demand that they pay the rent.</p>  <p>  These tenants constituted this as harassment and they made a complaint.  They know how to work the system and they will probably stay in that house in Dublin for two years before they will eventually have to leave.  The couple in Australia are paying 100% of the mortgage on the property while those people are living rent free in the house.  It is not the first time those tenants have done this.  They have done it before and they are using the system in place to wrong the owners of properties by going from one to the other.  They make up references.  I do not know how they manage that side of it, perhaps it was not processed correctly or properly.  The young man and woman in Australia are paying for a property in Ireland and not receiving one bit of rent.</p>  <p>  Why have I told the Minister this story?  This young couple rang me and were so upset when they heard what was happening with the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018.  They asked whether anyone was going to stand up in the D&aacute;il to tell the likes of their story and what is happening to them with regard to property.</p>  <p>  When I hear other Members speak on this Bill I know that they are well intentioned.  However, I hear the Members speak about landlords as if they were something the Deputies had stood on outside in the street.  These landlords are people who borrow money, buy a property and renovate it, rent it out and pay their tax.  When people talk about rents do they realise that half of that rent goes on tax?  The person who owns and rents a property is also a tax collector.  In the context of County Kerry rents may be &euro;700 or &euro;800. </p><p>The maximum is &euro;1,000 and half of that goes on tax.  That is the first thing that must happen.  The mortgage must then be paid and repairs have to be done.  There can also be cases where there is difficulty in collecting rent.  Can the Minister rationalise that and take it into account when he is dealing with this whole debate?  Of course there are rogue property owners who do not fulfil their obligations and who try to avoid paying tax and everything else.  However, there are also respectable landlords who do their jobs in the right way and who have been doing the job for a long time.  They are filling a gap in the market.  If they were not there where would the houses and properties to rent come from?</p> <p> Can the Minister imagine any young person today or in the future deciding that it would be a good idea to go out and build a house or borrow money in order that he or she can provide a house for the rental market?  He or she would be a tax collector effectively, collecting tax at 50% for the State.  On top of that he or she would have to pay a loan and try to provide a house for tenants.  Nobody is going to do that in the future.  I cannot deny that the first time I did it I was 19.  Can the Minister imagine a 19 year old today trying to do that, or thinking it was a good idea?  I have worked damn hard in this area over the years, and I do not deny that either.  However, people today are almost criminalised for trying to make money as a landlord.  It is totally maddening.  All landlords are painted with the same brush.  In the future there will be no such thing as a private landlord.  Deputy Michael Collins mentioned the people who might have one or two properties, but they will not exist in the future.  It will not happen.  Big groups such as vulture funds and pension companies will have hundreds of properties and they will be the types of entities renting property in the future.  Individuals will decide that the process is insane and that they will not work in the area.  It will not be a viable, profitable or sensible business for any individual to get involved in.</p> <p> I studied this Bill closely last night and I have heard the arguments made by everyone else in the House.  The only argument that is being made is that property owners should be demonised.  That is so wrong.  Of course there are people who have done bad things.  I have seen the reports of landlords allowing 20 people to rent a small property, as has everyone else.  Of course that is wrong.  That is the reason for regulations.  That is why we have inspections from the local authorities.  The people I am speaking up for today are those who register their properties, who pay their tax at 50% or 52% and who do everything right.  They keep their properties to fire safety standards and every other standard required, yet they have to listen to politicians constantly demonising them.  They are told that they are a type of criminal if they are renting out property.</p> <p> Why does the Minister want people to register a tenancy every 12 months and put that expense onto landlords who are already struggling to pay mortgages?  Why does the Minister want to do that?  Why in the name of God does he not look at the other side, and try to encourage people to become landlords?  He has spoken regularly about finding housing solutions to fix the problems we have.  I have said it many times that the most obvious solution is in front of our eyes.  In every town and village there are shops which have closed.  There are properties over those shops and there are disused buildings that would be absolutely perfect with a bit of investment.  If the roofs are good they do not need to be touched; the rest of the building can be fixed up.  If the roof is bad a new roof can be put on and the rest of the property can be brought up to standard before being rented out.  Why will people not do that?  We only have to listen to the debate in this House over the last two days to figure out the answer to that question.  Why would a sane person go into a village or a town and buy a property, pay all that has to be paid, borrow money if he or she does not have it, do that property up and rent it out, only to pay half of it in tax?  He or she is collecting tax for the Minister and for the Revenue Commissioners.  He or she then has to listen to politicians as he or she is demonised.  Why would anyone want to do that?  Why would anyone do it in the future?  People will not do it.  We are then going to have a massive gap: there will no longer be private rented accommodation available which always filled a gap.</p> <p> I do not want people to be renting a property forever.  I have always said to young couples that renting is a way of getting their legs on the ladder.  They have to start out somewhere.  Perhaps they will go to local authority housing or are able to save up a deposit and get on the market themselves.  However, we hear constant criticism in this House.  There are businessmen in Ireland who only ever hear their names mentioned in this D&aacute;il when someone is criticising them.  They are people who are household names, who are demonised here despite the fact that they are creating thousands of jobs.  Certain people are very critical of them in this House because of the fact that they are successful.  What is wrong with a person wanting to provide accommodation?  Why are we going after them with this?  That is what we are doing.  I ask them please to consider what they are doing and to consider the long term effect of their words.  Who is going to be affected here?  Thinking about this intelligently, the people this Bill will hurt are the very people they hope to try to help, i.e. those who want to rent accommodation.  They will be hurt because people will be discouraged from getting involved in the business of buying or building to rent.  No sane person in Ireland will do it in the future.  Vulture funds will come in and buy up the properties from people who have them.  Big companies will own hundreds of thousands of properties, but the individual landlords, be they garda&iacute; or shopkeepers who might have a second or third property, will not exist in the future thanks to Bills such as this.</p> <p> The Minister knows that I am not a critical person and that I support legislation that needs to be supported.  I am the first person to defend the Minister in those circumstances and the first person to say that the Government is doing a good job.  However, we must stop demonising people in the way we have been to date.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an Bille seo ag teacht go m&oacute;r leis an gceathr&uacute; col&uacute;in, an earn&aacute;il c&iacute;osa a fheabhs&uacute;, a d'fhoilsigh an Rialtas sa strait&eacute;is c&iacute;osa.</p>  <p>  In recent years there has been a perception that the number of households in the rental accommodation sector has reached a new high, at almost 19%.  We have been told in news stories that Ireland now has a higher number of households renting than ever before.  If we go back 70 years ago, some 40% of households were in the rental sector, which means that in the 1940s and 1950s at least two in every five households in Ireland were accommodated through this sector.  It was only in the following decades, in the 1970s and 1980s in particular, that rental accommodation gave way to owner occupancy.  We all hope that trend will continue and the home ownership continues to grow.  For a while Ireland was more in line with European models of housing whereby rental options are far more prevalent.  The prevalence and practice of renting accommodation in other countries has ensured the development of more comprehensive and robust rental sectors with clearly stated rules and regulations covering issues such as rental amounts and tenancy durations.  Due to our recent history and our preference for owner-occupancy accommodation, such a system has not developed here, which is why the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 is so important.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 was a good start, but the intervening years have shown the great need for improvement.  There is particular urgency with this legislation because of the re-balancing that is occurring.  More and more households are now part of the rental sector.  It is important to say that the vast majority of tenants or householders who are renting and the vast majority of people letting accommodation, or landlords, are fair and take their responsibilities seriously.</p><p>In fact, if every landlord was law-abiding and did not break any rules and if every tenant was of good behaviour and did not cause any issues, then there would be no need for legislation at all.  Unfortunately, however, we only ever hear of the extreme cases, whether the unscrupulous landlord or the reckless tenant.  They are out there and serious issues arise.  This legislation is needed to address some of these issues.</p> <p> The 25 sections of the Bill seek to achieve a wide range of objectives to help tenants and landlords.  Several sections are vital.  Section 7 will provide greater certainty to tenants and households in the rental sector.  The amendment to section 66 of the 2004 Act will extend the notice periods required from a landlord who has decided to terminate a tenancy.  The provision will ensure that a tenant of more than six months will have three months' notice and anyone of more than five years will have four months' notice.  The notice required climbs up to seven months for a household in a tenancy agreement for eight years or more.  These provisions will provide households with certainty and with significant time to plan ahead should circumstances change.  That is important because one problem is the pressure people fall under when they do not have the time to find alternative accommodation.  I welcome that feature.</p> <p> Another important feature of the Bill is the introduction of new powers for the RTB.  Unfortunately, although the vast majority of landlords are fair and honest, there have been cases where the behaviour of property owners has been illegal.  A little over two years ago the Government introduced RPZs to control, insofar as constitutionally possible, rental amounts.  The serious constraint on housing supply brought about by the recession meant that in several areas rental amounts were increasing at unsustainable rates to unaffordable levels.  The zones have helped to stem that increase.  A small minority saw this as an opportunity.  Many in the House will know of examples of tenants falling victim to the dubious actions of some landlords.  The Bill will help to tackle these problems and ensure that the RPZ regulations are observed.  The Bill will introduce a fine of up to &euro;30,000 for breaching RPZ rules.  It will introduce a new criminal offence for landlords who implement illegal rent increases or who abuse the substantial improvements rule to end a tenancy.  It will also introduce sanctions for the failure to register or update tenancies with the RTB.  The introduction of new rules and regulations must be joined by the greater empowerment of this State body  This is achieved through the amendment of the 2004 Act under section 18.  One of the new powers that will be effective in operation and in regulating behaviour is the power of the RTB to initiate investigations without the need for a specific complaint to be made.  That is welcome.</p> <p> Go h&eacute;ifeachtach, leagann an Bille seo amach an bealach chun cinn chun n&iacute;os m&oacute; strucht&uacute;ir a thabhairt don earn&aacute;il ch&iacute;osa.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag iarraidh caighde&aacute;in a fheabhs&uacute; san earn&aacute;il agus cothrom na F&eacute;inne agus tr&eacute;dhearcacht a chinnti&uacute;.  I ndeireadh na d&aacute;la t&aacute; an Bille seo ag iarraidh daoine, idir tiarna&iacute; tal&uacute;n agus tion&oacute;nta&iacute; araon, a chosaint.  D&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; &eacute; seo tr&iacute; tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; f&oacute;gartha n&iacute;os faide nuair at&aacute; deireadh &aacute; chur le l&eacute;as a thabhairt isteach, i measc gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  This important area can cause problems in cases of unscrupulous landlords or unruly tenants.  Unfortunately, both types of cases cross our desks at times.  I welcome the powers of the RTB to inspect without prior notice.  That is important because it is not right or proper that people would have substandard accommodation.  These initiatives are important.</p> <p> One point that has been brought to my attention is that the attractiveness of being a landlord can be diminished with over-regulation, over-taxation and the costs of repairs in some cases.  That is a real threat.  I wish to put on record that my spouse has a house that is rented out at what is, I have to say, a fair rent.  I say as much in case anyone accuses me of being biased in that regard.  She is an accidental landlord because she happens to be an only child with both parents deceased.  At times, the role of landlord is not attractive.  This concern has been expressed by Deputy Healy-Rae.  We need to ensure that the importance of landlords is understood.  The importance of landlords in providing homes to rent is appreciated.  Many landlords believe their role is not appreciated and that it is a matter of constant attacks on them.</p> <p> At the same time, we need to ensure that landlords provide the best accommodation for tenants because in recent years it has been a landlord's market.  Demand exceeds supply and, therefore, it is more difficult to acquire properties to rent.  It is important that standards are adhered to and that landlords act fairly to those tenants who need to put a home over their heads.  It is a matter of balance and we should also appreciate the important role that landlords and the private market play in ensuring that homes are available for rent.  At the same time, it is vital that those same homes are up to standard and that proper notice is given when a tenancy is to be ended.  People need to be given an opportunity to source another home in what can be a difficult market, especially in many urban areas such as in Dublin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300053#GGG00200"><p>First and foremost, there are elements of this Bill that I welcome and that are entirely necessary.  There is a great deal of difficulty with the 2004 Act in terms of its implementation from the RTB perspective and from the perspectives of landlord and tenant.  Some of the provisions are cumbersome and difficult in terms of administration.  I disagree to a certain extent with Deputy Healy-Rae but I also agree with some of what he said as well.</p>  <p>  In the first instance the rental market is a critical component in the housing market.  Without it, the numbers of people in unsuitable accommodation or homeless would be in the tens of thousands rather than at or about 10,000.  Our taxation system is punitive for landlords.  I am not a landlord, which I am keen to put that on the record.  However, having worked in the industry for 12 years, I have come across far more difficulties arising from tenants than from landlords.  It was not a matter of 50:50 but more like 90:10, to be honest.  Many good people, tenants and landlords, do what they are supposed to do and make a telephone call if there is a problem or call in.  I have even known landlords to drop in with Christmas presents and so on.  That actually happens, believe it or not.  They are not all ogres or faceless corporations.  The reality, however, is that this Bill oversteps.  Criminalising a landlord and providing for the potential of a jail sentence is overstepping the mark.  I am keen to highlight one particular section with which I have a difficulty.  Outside of the provision of information to the Revenue Commissioners or acquiring a driving licence or passport, I am unaware of a civil matter in respect of which a criminal offence is created.  In this case, the offence is created for forgetting to update the RTB register when a rent increase takes place.  That is exactly what is set out in section 17.  That is much worse than a bad landlord being prosecuted, which is a good thing.  It is a little much for an offence to be created for non-compliance with the requirement to update rental information on the RTB register.  That is too much.  I have no difficulty with a fine or a series of warnings but creating a criminal offence is too much.</p>  <p>  I have no difficulty with the registration of tenancies and I appreciate that there is an administrative cost associated with it.  However, like every new cost and administrative charge that is introduced in this country, it will only ever go up.  The cost has gone up since it was introduced in 2004.  Given the increasing number of rental properties in the market, the registration process should be more simplistic and the costs should be covered more easily.</p><p> Perhaps the registration fee should be prescribed in the Bill because the Government needs to recognise the position in which accidental landlords find themselves.  I was a landlord for just under a year while I was between properties, which meant that I was a tenant at the same time.  Taxation stands at 50% and there are other registration fees.  The registration fee was &euro;90 and no doubt in five years it will be more than that, probably over &euro;100.  For accidental landlords like me and for individuals caught in negative equity, finding this additional money is a difficulty, particularly if incomes are limited or family circumstances have changed.  Many Deputies will know that people who took out mortgages between 2006 and 2008 most likely overpaid for their homes in comparison with those who bought homes up to recently.  Such individuals would, therefore, have very large mortgages.  If they lost their jobs in the interim, the pressure on them to pay their mortgages and tax has been difficult.  People, including some in my constituency, are still caught in this trap.</p> <p> I refer to sections 15 and 16 and the approved housing bodies, AHBs, that are accommodating tenants on our housing lists.  We should abolish the registration fees for AHBs.  It is true they are receiving money for this, but they are providing a public service and they, as quasi-State service providers, should not also have to pay the State.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, came to the Chamber in the middle of my contribution.  Earlier I described the creation of a criminal offence of non-compliance in the context of updating the rental register, dealt with in section 17, as overstepping the mark.</p> <p> I understand the rationale regarding notice periods and I accept that such periods can be different in other jurisdictions.  As a result, I do not have a difficulty with these changes.  However, I wish to draw attention to the converse aspect, namely, the notice periods provided by tenants.  More often than not, tenants leave properties because their life circumstances change, they want a different property, they might have moved jobs or lost jobs and so do not have a choice in the matter.  However, some people question why, when a landlord must give 60, 90, or 120 days notice depending on the length of the tenancy, a tenant is not obliged to do so.  Under the Bill, a landlord who is delinquent can be prosecuted by the RTB.  The latter will be able to act autonomously and will no longer have to do so on the basis of complaints.  That is a welcome step in the right direction.  However, if a tenant does not give notice and if the landlord is owed two or three months rent, under the law, the RTB cannot prosecute that tenant.  Therein lies an inherent inequality.  I do not support prosecuting tenants who may have lost their jobs, been obliged to emigrate or whatever.  However, any law these Houses pass must be equitable.  It must be a two-way street.  If someone is a good tenant or a good landlord and he or she pays his or her taxes, then the law is on his or her side.  If, however, he or she is a bad tenant or landlord, then the law is not on his or her side.  This Bill is 100% on the side of the tenant because the landlord, particularly in the case I highlighted, is being criminalised for an administrative error.  What if he or she did not click "complete" on the online registration form?  What if he or she simply forgot to register because of circumstances that occurred during the lengthy notice period when the rent review takes place?  There are always circumstances in which other events can dominate people's thinking for a period.</p> <p> I accept we have a huge amount of work to do regarding our housing market.  We must ensure that we can provide affordable properties to people who are fortunate enough to be able to take out mortgages.  Then there is everyone else who cannot.  We should consider the position of landlords who pay tax at 50%, particularly those who may not be institutional landlords.  These people are not involved in the sector for commercial reasons but, rather, because they may have inherited property or they thought it a good idea to invest in property for pension purposes in later life.  Many individuals followed the latter course and were encouraged to do so under the previous taxation system.  We must look in a fair way at those individuals.  The Minister will have to have a discussion with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on this matter.  Creating a criminal charge in respect of an administrative error is a bit much.  I have no difficulty with the State prosecuting an individual who breaks the law.  We are debating what will become an Act of the Oireachtas.  At that point, it will be the law and people will be obliged to comply with its provisions.</p> <p> Others have stated that it is unfair to criminalise landlords for being bad.  Perhaps, however, it is time that we clamped down on these individuals who rent out substandard properties, properties that do not comply with building safety or fire regulations and properties with access and egress issues.  All over this city there are older properties that have been modified but not to the appropriate level to make them safe.  Dublin City Council has shut down several large-scale rental properties recently, which is a welcome development.  I have no difficulty with clamping down on the landlords in question but there does not have to be a criminal offence.  If local authorities and the agencies responsible for ensuring that building standards and fire and safety regulations are adhered to in the context of rental properties, we must ensure that they have sufficient funds to do facilitate this.  The latter would mean that a delinquent landlord who does not maintain properties properly would be caught immediately or within a reasonable period and told that the property has fallen down on whatever points of fire safety or health and safety and that improvements must be made.  If we properly fund the administration of the rental market and the social housing market, we will not have delinquent landlords at all because we will be able to monitor them more closely.  As already stated, however, criminalising the failure to complete an administrative function is too much.</p> <p> I commend the Minister on the other aspects of the Bill.  The administrative changes in section 7 on notice periods and errors in notice documents are welcome.  It was the case that if this happened, there was a need to go back to the start.  In a lengthy tenancy where there is a six-month notice period, if it was only caught after three months, it would have to start again and that could be problematic, not only for landlords but also tenants.</p></speech>

It is important that we put the Bill in its context of dealing with the private rented sector where there are currently great demands.  For several years, there have been significant rental increases.  This comes back to the basic issue of supply and demand.  There is simply too much demand.  It is important to acknowledge that the pressures have occurred on the demand side in the private rental sector rather than on the supply side.</p>  <p>  There are people living in private rented accommodation who do not want to be there.  They are obliged to do so because there is no alternative.  There are individuals who are eligible for social housing and who are in private rented accommodation temporarily while they wait for their social housing to be provided.  There are others who do not qualify for social housing, who are earning significant money, who are in private rented accommodation and who have no capacity to save the deposits required to allow them to purchase their own homes.  I accept that I am digressing slightly but, in the longer term, two of the elements necessary to alleviate pressure in the private rental sector are continuing growth and the supply of social and affordable housing.  While we might disagree on aspects of this, we do not have a rational programme in respect of providing affordable housing.  In my area, there are a couple of strategic development zone, SDZ, planning schemes under construction but we do not have an affordable housing programme for people who earn salaries in excess of the social housing eligibility thresholds and who are excluded from the market.  Many of those individuals are in private rented accommodation.  The latter is an aspect with which we must deal.</p>  <p>  Another issue to which repeated reference has been made is the lack of a cost rental model.</p><p>We have discussed it for a number of years.  It should have been developed by this stage and it should be accessing money that would be available from pension funds or the Irish League of Credit Unions.<br/><br/>Until we address some of the key issues, the private rental sector will remain under pressure.  It is important that we put this debate in that context.  This legislation will address some of the issues we are facing daily.  I acknowledge that the Government introduced rent pressure zones, RPZs.  People have mixed views on how they operate, but colleagues around the country argue that they need to be extended to other areas that are seeing significant rent increases.<br/><br/>RPZs are designed to restrict the level of rental income, but and various exemptions apply if there are significant renovations.  The existing regulations, including the one under which landlords can ask tenants to move on if they want to sell the apartment or house or give it to a family member, have been around for a long time and there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence suggesting that they are not being policed.  This Bill provides an opportunity for that policing to happen, which is important.  All public representatives regularly see people in our offices who have been told that they must move from their private rented accommodation because their landlords want to sell, need it for family members or want to renovate it.  Sometimes, it is difficult to see whether that transaction happens.  That issue must be addressed in this legislation.  The activities of landlords in that regard must be overseen, which is a matter that the Bill will help.<br/><br/>For the majority of landlords, being compliant is not an issue.  They acknowledge and respect compliance and want transparency.  They believe that landlords need to be held responsible.  For many, their reputation is important to them.<br/><br/>Deputies have mentioned the annual registration of tenancies, which is a departure from the current system.  I understand that the charge for registering will be reduced, but the legislation does not specify what it will be.  There should not be an additional burden on the landlord, yet registering annually will be an additional administrative burden.  There must be a responsibility on the RTB that, when a landlord registers, reminders are sent so that he or she is not caught out inadvertently.  It is important that not everything should rely on the landlord having to remember.  Why is annual registration necessary if a landlord-tenant relationship endures for longer than a year?<br/><br/>Many of the actions being taken in the Bill are meant to influence and manage the behaviour of landlords, but one of the issues that they have brought to our attention since the Government introduced RPZs relates to situations where landlords had previously been allowing tenants to stay at rents that were significantly below market value.  There does not seem to be a mechanism to correct that, particularly if the tenant moves on.  It is important that this issue be examined.  I am not suggesting that there should be a free for all, but I have seen cases in my area where the rents being charged are significantly - not marginally - below market value.  How might landlords be in a position to address that situation?<br/><br/>From the point of view of transparency, it is important that we have a register of the actual rents charged.  We frequently listen to debates on <i>daft.ie</i>reports claiming that rents have increased.  Those are the asking rents rather than the charged rents, and sometimes there is a difference.  There is no transparency in this regard.  Knowing what rents are actually being paid would empower those who are going to the market.<br/><br/>I want to conclude, as two of my colleagues wish to speak, but I will first raise two issues that do not relate directly to the Bill but that I would like the Minister to consider.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien also raised them.  First, student accommodation is not covered in RPZs, but it should be.  This legislation is an opportunity to consider that matter.  The second issue is that of a national deposit scheme.<br/><br/>I will make two final points that might be slightly outside the Bill's remit but are directly related to the RTB.  Current legislation regarding disputes about anti-social behaviour states that only a person who is directly and adversely affected by such behaviour can make a complaint.  In case after case, I have dealt with constituents who have been afraid to make that complaint.  In the absence of a complaint, nothing can be done.  Will the Minister consider expanding this section so that someone other than the person who is adversely affected - an advocate, public representative or third party - can make it on his or her behalf?  I will not put them on the record of the D&aacute;il, but some of the cases are serious.  The people involved are genuinely afraid to make a complaint.  The legislation needs to be amended to allow a complaint to be made on their behalf.<br/><br/>We have discussed how this Bill will impact on landlords.  It is important that it have a positive impact and a positive benefit, not just in terms of price, but also the tenant's quality of life.  In that regard, I urge the Minister to re-examine the system of property inspections.  The Government has increased funding year on year, but it will take several more years before local authorities are inspecting one in four properties.  Interestingly, in 2017, the last year for which I saw figures, more than 12,000 properties of the approximately 16,000 inspected did not meet the standard.  That shows the scale of work that needs to be done.  Those tenants, who were paying significant amounts of money, deserved to live in better conditions.  I suggest that the Government's target of 2021 or 2022 for reaching the point of one in four properties being inspected needs to be fast-tracked.  It is relatively small money.  The Government is increasing the sum for local authority property inspections by &euro;2.5 million per year.  I ask that that increase be fast-tracked so that we can have a more realistic property inspection regime and the standard of property in the private rental sector improves significantly.</p></speech>

He declared himself a major landlord.  I am sure he is an excellent one, does his work very well and looks after his tenants.  I would expect nothing else from him.  To my mind, however, part of his presentation created an impression that we did not have any bad landlords.  In reality, we have some.  In my part of the country, they do not amount to a large percentage, but when one is called to a residence and sees leaking pipes, radiators that do not work and draughts here, there and everywhere.  It amounts to unsuitable accommodation and is not something I would tolerate.</p>  <p>  In fairness, many smaller landlords have one or two houses for a number of reasons, for example, family.  The house might have once been the family home but now has no one in it.  They do it up and rent it out.  Some do not like to sell their old family homes and prefer to keep them.  Most of these people do an excellent job and always look after their tenants.</p>  <p>  While most tenants in my part of the country are good, I have come across cases of houses that have been wrecked and left in a deplorable state.  They may have been good houses with proper heating and no shortcomings, yet people have left them in a terrible state.  However, that is a minority situation.</p><p>There is no doubt that we need landlords in the system.  We cannot function without them.  My party was criticised regarding the introduction of a landlord's budget in October 2018.  However, as I said, we need landlords in the system.  Budget 2019 was not a landlord's budget.  A rental market needs landlords if it is to work.  It incentivises landlords to stay in the system.  We should be reminded that 40,000 landlords left the system between 2012 and 2018, including 4,000 in the past 12 months.  We need to keep landlords in the system or else there will be fewer units available, in which case we will have a further difficulty with rising rents.</p> <p> In my constituency, there is a major problem involving tenants who are given notice to leave a house by their landlords and subsequently find when they are looking for a place to stay that they do not qualify for social housing under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  People sometimes find their income is slightly above the threshold to qualify for a local authority house and they do not qualify for the HAP.  The Minister will be aware of this problem, which needs to be addressed.  It is the biggest problem I have in my constituency.</p></speech>

Much of what I would like to have said has already been said and I do not want to be repetitive.  I will, therefore, concentrate my contribution on two specific areas.  </p>  <p>  There seems to be an anomaly in the HAP scheme.  A property will qualify for the scheme provided it is registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  The RTB registration form does not require evidence of ownership, however.  As a result, people involved in criminality can have a property management company register a property with the RTB and the housing assistance payment will then benefit the criminal.  We must get rid of that anomaly.  The application form for HAP includes a number of ways by which a landlord can provide proof of ownership of the property that is the subject of HAP.  One of these is by providing evidence of registration with the Residential Tenancies Board.  This needs to be removed.  The only acceptable evidence should be evidence of payment of the local property tax, which must include the name of the owner of the property.  The Minister should look into that matter.  I have a fundamental problem with any element of criminality benefitting from HAP and other State payments.  This practice also creates problems for local authorities when they try to deal with unscrupulous landlords because when they telephone property management companies, they get nowhere.  We can do a little work on that.</p>  <p>  The other side of the coin in respect of HAP is anti-social behaviour by tenants.  For example, a property rented to two people may have ten people living in it.  The current legislation does not allow local authorities to act in such circumstances.  The HAP makes reference to the issue but there is nothing in legislation to support agencies that are trying to do something about it.  The RTB will investigate and will probably find anti-social behaviour is taking place and the tenants should either be removed or some form of action should be taken against them, but there is nothing in legislation to help.</p>  <p>  Practical steps on the issues I have raised regarding landlords and unscrupulous tenants would help.  Not every landlord is a bad landlord and not every tenant is a bad tenant.  In fact, the opposite is the case - the vast majority of landlords are good landlords and the vast majority of tenants are good tenants.  We seem to find ourselves legislating for the minority on both sides, although I suppose that is our job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300056#KKK00600"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as an deis seo labhairt ar an mBille.</p>  <p>  It is as good as fact that the rental crisis is worse than ever.  The rise in rents continues unabated.  People are losing their homes and unable to find a new home.  We see the practical outworkings of that daily in our constituency offices.  People are in desperate circumstances, having exhausted all options as they try to stay in their homes.  They have sought time and again to find other suitable accommodation that falls within their HAP allowance but it is impossible to do so.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures show that rents in Cork city have increased by 13.7% year on year.  This is well above the national figure of 11.3% and significantly higher than the 4% increase allowed for in the rent pressure zone.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, outlined yesterday, this Bill is a recognition that the rent pressure zones are not working properly.  These types of rent increases would not be possible if they were working correctly.  We would not have the current level of evictions or number of people facing homelessness and unable to find alternative accommodation if they were working.</p>  <p>  A modest two-bedroom home in Cork currently rents for &euro;1,114 a month.  Three-bedroom homes generally rent for between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400, but many perfectly ordinary homes cost &euro;1,500, &euro;1,600 or even more to rent. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is not working and will not work.  Its targets are inadequate and it does not take a sufficiently strong line on the rental crisis.  In 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in argued that the solution was rent certainty.  The crisis in now such that we need a rent freeze as an emergency measure, accompanied by relief for tenants, as opposed to the landlords, many of whom have done well financially out of the current crisis.</p>  <p>  There are also inadequate targets for the building of social housing and affordable housing.  Scarcely an affordable house has been built under any scheme so far in the Government's term.  This has created a major gap because many people in work and on modest incomes do not qualify for social housing and have no real options.  The lack of action on affordable housing is a cause of considerable frustration.  I am not terribly optimistic for the future either.  I ask the Minister to prioritise this issue because large numbers of people are locked out of the housing market.  It is difficult, particularly from my generation, to plan for the future when one cannot afford a mortgage, does not qualify for any State schemes and affordable housing is not within reach.  One's money is eaten up by extortionate rents, month on month.  The Minister will be familiar with this issue as I am sure many of his peers and colleagues are in a similar position.  Rent is so expensive that it is difficult to see more than two or three years down the line.  This creates a high level of insecurity and not enough is being done to address the issue.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges that the Bill includes some generally useful provisions, although we have quibbles with elements of them.  Some of these issues were identified by ourselves and others during previous debates on residential tenancies legislation and it is welcome that they are now being addressed.  The provision of additional powers to investigate landlords and impose sanctions is right and proper but needs resourcing.  Resources are an issue in a number of areas.  As Deputy Curran outlined, the rate of inspections is not high enough.  I will address two aspects of this.</p><p>First, many landlords are not registered, perhaps because they believe it gives them more flexibility.  Of course, it is illegal not to be registered and disqualifies the landlord from receiving HAP.  Members regularly deal with people who say that a prospective landlord will not accept HAP.  One often discovers that refusal is due to the landlord not being registered.  We must make it practically impossible for a landlord not to be registered.  Second, the issue of good and bad landlords was mentioned.  Of course, there are good landlords.  I am a tenant and am very satisfied with my landlord, about whom I have no complaints.  However, landlords hold the balance of power.  It is not the same as saying there are good and bad tenants.  The structural reality built into the current housing market is that it favours landlords.  That makes it easy for landlords who wish to exploit tenants to so do.  It is very difficult for tenants who are being exploited to escape those circumstances.  A tenant living in dire circumstances such as damp, overcrowded or badly damaged housing which may be barely fit for human habitation and who complains to the landlord very often finds that the landlord will do nothing about the complaint in the knowledge that the tenant is not in a realistic position to find a tenancy with another landlord who will accept HAP within their limits.  If additional powers are to be granted to investigate landlords and impose sanctions, that must be backed up by significant resources.</p> <p> There is a need for further legislative change.  Those on HAP should be on the main housing waiting list.  A minority of local authorities have managed to provide flexibility in that regard.  The transfer list is inadequate.  Many people are not aware of it or may not fill out the form correctly and be taken off the list.  Those people need to be reintegrated onto the main list and that should be done through nationalisation.</p> <p> I support and welcome the proposed extended notice periods.  However, extended notice periods will not fully address the issue of people being evicted into homelessness.  If the Government is serious about preventing evictions into homelessness, it must adopt the Focus Ireland amendment.</p></speech>

The current average rent for a two-bedroom house in east Cork is &euro;1,000 per month.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, the rent for some properties is above average.  The monthly rent for a three-bedroom house in the area is &euro;1,200 while that for a one-bedroom is &euro;750 per month, which is ironic.  There are currently 20 properties for rent in east Cork.  Obviously, when goods or a service is scarce and demand for it is high, it becomes more expensive.  However, the knock-on social effect is that struggling young families are under immense mental and financial pressure to get a sustainable job and meet the demands of paying the rent.</p>  <p>  Cobh is the only rent pressure zone in my area of east Cork.  Last year, I raised the issue of rent pressure zones with the Minister and mentioned the stipulations that apply to them.  One such stipulation is that the average rent in east Cork would have to equal or exceed the national average rent in order to negotiate or discuss the possibility of having more rent pressure zones in the area.  The problem is that the current national average is &euro;1,122 per month.  The national average rent is going up, as are rents in east Cork.  However, the average rent in east Cork is not catching up with the national average.  It is a case of a dog chasing its tail.  The rent pressure zone legislation must be considered and urgently reviewed.  I welcome that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill.  However, I am surprised that it did not demand that this be addressed in the confidence and supply agreement.  The rent pressure zones are due to expire at the end of 2019.  Is there a plan for what will happen thereafter?  What can Members tell tenants in their constituencies who are affected by this issue?  Many tenants are in a very precarious situation.  Many live day to day because they do not know whether they will get a letter in the door stating that a family member of the landlord is returning to Ireland, so the tenant must move out and tough luck.  That has happened on many occasions.</p>  <p>  Affordable housing seems to be non-existent.  That must be addressed because there are people and families who do not qualify for a mortgage but are just over the threshold for qualifying for social housing.</p>  <p>  HAP was mentioned.  It is very difficult to persuade some landlords to participate in HAP.  A landlord who registers a one-bedroom apartment may receive a HAP of, for example, &euro;750.  However, the demand for property is so high that the landlord could obtain &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200 per month in cash for the property.  Further regulation is needed in that regard.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to bash landlords.  As many Deputies stated, there are some fabulous landlords as well as fabulous tenants.  However, no matter where one goes, there are always a few bad apples.  The Bill strengthens the rights of both landlords and tenants.  It offers security to tenants such that they know that a property will meet a certain quality level and be safe and dry.  Many constituents have come to my office regarding substandard properties, some of which are in a deplorable condition and may be covered in mould.  It took almost two and a half years to resolve one such case.  Some properties in such condition were held by certain agencies which work in conjunction with local authorities.  I will not name them but the Minister knows the agencies to which I refer.  Some of their properties are in deplorable condition and totally substandard.  That is also sometimes the case in the voluntary housing sector.  I have no problem giving the Minister the information I have in that regard.  Some of the properties were medically unfit for habitation but were being sublet to management agencies and had been forgotten about by the big boys who had probably been misinformed or not informed about the situation.  However, it is the tenant who lives and suffers in such properties.  Many tenants remain out of fear.  They do not want to complain because, like the gravy train, if one falls out the door there might be 40 people waiting to fill the spot.  It is a dog eat dog scenario.</p>  <p>  The social and mental impact of what is happening in the property sector must be recognised.  Unfortunately, some people who were in mortgage arrears and genuinely tried to pay their bills and mortgages and so on are no longer with us.  That is the reality.  Because of the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and other jobs without security, there is a generation which cannot get a loan but for whom the social housing thresholds are too low.  That generation cannot access funding to get onto the property ladder.  Couples with very young children who are working pillar to post are forced to stay in his parents' house one night and her parents' house the next night.  It starts to become a battle between the children, who must choose whether they sleep in the same house as their mother or their father each night.  That is happening because people cannot get suitable accommodation.  The Minister remembers how bad the weather was last winter, particularly during the snow.  I know of a family which was living in a mobile home without heating because they had nowhere else to go.  They had been squatting but had to leave the property.  These are the realities of what is happening in the housing market today.</p><p>It is very welcome that the RTB is getting more powers but local authorities should also have more.  There should be more investment in inspectors and so on.  Local authorities do a fabulous job.  The staff in them are under unbelievable pressure.  It is very difficult to shovel snow when it is still snowing, however.  We work very well with the local authority, including staff on a one-to-one basis.  The staff are really genuine but they are so stressed and under strain because they do not have the capacity or the properties to hand to constituents.</p> <p> Let me refer to the silent homeless, who are not talked about.  They are another product of the downturn or crash.  Before the crash, many families had good jobs, did their best, had mortgages, reared their children and sent them to college.  The children have now emigrated and are working, which is fine.  Between the stresses and strains of the crash, failing mortgages, marriages breaking up and the banks taking back properties, those who are left, the parents, are now couch surfing in their own parents' homes.  They are too embarrassed even to admit this.</p> <p> I encountered a case number of years ago the circumstances of which were absolutely disgusting.  Events very similar to what I have described affected the family in question but they could not even go back into their old estate to visit former next-door neighbours because there was a barring order meaning they could not go within 200 m of their old home.  The mother told me that when she went to visit from afar, a young former neighbour, who was probably six at the time, was inside kicking the for-sale sign down.  These are realities.</p> <p> It is great to be talking about ideas but, realistically, we are looking for solutions.  Sinn F&eacute;in has mentioned this.  A three-year rent freeze is not a bad idea as it gives us all time to come up with plans.  It is not anti-landlord or pro-tenant but it is about giving us time to get things right.</p> <p> A couple of other points were mentioned.  Refundable rent relief for renters was mentioned.  It is good idea.  We must assist everybody.  The rolling out of cost rental models across the whole State is not rocket science.  We must also consider ways of speeding up the planning permission process.  This has also been mentioned to me.  We must consider how to assist councils in every way we can.  This includes municipal district councils.  Even before the town councils were disbanded, there was local knowledge, a local touch and local support, and there was a check on the properties of the town council every day of the week.  If there was an issue, it was addressed.  We have to go back to the old days.  Let us go back to what was done in the 1970s when there was nothing here but when we still built houses people could afford.</p> <p> When we talk about houses and properties, we must remember people want to cherish them as homes.  A home is very different from a house.  A home is where memories are formed and where there is a sense of security and warmth.  There is a genuine, knock-on effect involving harmony and social respect.  A home makes one proud of who one is and one respects one's neighbours.  There is a knock-on effect that makes society much more sociable.  When this occurs, everybody works together.  We have lost that in Ireland.  It is all about what we have and can get rather than worrying about others.  That has to stop.</p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  There will be amendments.  Anything we can do to assist both tenants and landlords and to assist local authorities in trying to produce more social and affordable homes has to be welcomed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="19:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300058#MMM00200"><p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to speak about this important Bill.  It is long overdue.  It is probably about 30 or 35 years overdue and it certainly does not go remotely far enough to vindicate tenants' rights and create a fair rental market in this country but even the small steps in this Bill are welcome as an attempt to begin to remedy the worst deficiencies in tenancy law and to face up to the horrendous circumstances of many tenants.</p>  <p>  Over the past couple of years, I have liaised with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor trying to frame a Bill with a similar thrust but in many respects it was very difficult to introduce one because of the necessity some felt to include a regime of administrative sanctions, which the Minister has included in section 7.  There was a fear that landlords engaged in criminal activity and treating tenants very badly could not be prosecuted if they had been fined previously under an administrative regime.</p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to give effect to the strategy for the rental market pillar of the unfortunately failing Rebuilding Ireland strategy.  It will amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 and bestow greater powers on the RTB for investigations and sanctions.  It will increase notice periods, strengthen Part 4 tenancies and provide for the registration of tenancies annually, among other things.  On the latter point, there has been much criticism by agencies such as Threshold and others in that the Government had the opportunity to introduce a real-time register but has not been willing to do so thus far.</p>  <p>  Back in mid-December, I spoke in strong support of the Solidarity-People Before Profit Anti-Evictions Bill 2018 and was very happy to see it proceed from the House to committee.  That Bill's provisions would have given much greater security of tenure and extended notice periods.  The Bill would have forced landlords to pay compensation to tenants being evicted due to family members moving back into the accommodation unit and it would have introduced other improvements.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I, like many Deputies, was keeping a close eye on the housing and homelessness trends.  I sent out a brief statement on the approximately 8,000 homeless children.  This figure is based on the official figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the figures of the Department of Justice and Equality on direct provision, and the figures of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on domestic violence refuges.  Earlier this week, we heard from respected medics in Temple Street that the increase of 29% in children with "no fixed abode" attending the emergency department is linked to the inappropriate living conditions in which they are being accommodated.  Behind each of these figures is a real child.  Many are very young and many are infants.  They are experiencing deep trauma on foot of the lack of security and stability they would experience in something as fundamental as a safe, permanent home.  Like the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, I meet many of those affected at my weekly information clinics.  As with the whole House, I am ashamed of how the Government is treating them - a lost generation with lost childhoods.  I am sure we will hear from them in 20 or 30 years, when some of them will be in this House looking back over this period.</p>  <p>  On Monday, I was struck when the Taoiseach spoke of his own failings in this regard.  He tried to embrace the famous Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il and indicated we must do better.  The reality is that neither he nor the Minister is doing well enough.  The rental market and the unaffordable rents are directly linked to the increase in homelessness, particularly family homelessness, in Dublin, yet the Government has been moving at a snail's pace to begin to address this matter as part of addressing the overall housing crisis.  To get this far, it has taken three years of continuous debate and questions to the Minister, the Taoiseach and his predecessor in this House.</p>  <p>  The number of households in the private rental sector increased dramatically, by 64%, between 2006 and 2011.  In 2017, we learned that almost 19% of the total population were living in rented accommodation.  Some 30% of all occupied households were tenancy households.</p><p>I also noticed in one of Threshold's reports that 45% of those tenancies were paying 30% of their income in rent and an astonishing 14% were paying 50% of their total income in rent.  These are dismal figures in the record of the Government and the previous austerity Government.  Single people and lone parents are over-represented in the private rental sector and this has always been the case.  As rents continued to increase for 25 or 26 consecutive quarters, they reached a peak 30% higher than during the Celtic tiger boom in 2008.  Much is made of the <i>daft.ie</i>rent index reports in comparison to the RTB rent index, with the Government, of course, preferring the one that shows the lower increases.  The important aspect to note, however, is that both indices report relentless increases.<br/><br/>Average rents in Dublin are now more than &euro;1,600 per month and other cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick and even Waterford are also experiencing significant increases.  Of course, RPZs were deliberately introduced without any way of monitoring or regulating them.  They were a PR stunt by the then Government.  With so many exemptions, landlords have been able to flout the 4% increase rule when they wish.<br/><br/>Constitutional rights to property and the protection of that property are often quoted when we are trying to come up with solutions to the ever-worsening housing crisis but in reality Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann allows for the use of property for the public good to trump private property rights.  Many speakers, including the Taoiseach, made this very point on Monday afternoon at our 100th anniversary sitting.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which are so much in debt to landlords and in which so many landlords are represented, have always preferred to create situations to increase the profits of landlords rather than protect the well-being of tenants.<br/><br/>Over the past 100 years of our Republic we have experienced lengthy periods of rent controls.  Prior to 1981, under the 1960 Act there was a rent control regime.  We know that type of regime could have been introduced.  The Minister could introduce this.  As my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague said, the Minister could state that for three years we will have no increases until housing supply is increased to 25,000 per year.<br/><br/>I tabled a question to the Minister last week that was not reached and I am still not clear on how many houses are being built.  The most recent dismal figure I saw for 2018 was 12,000.  In 2016, when Deputy Fitzgerald was T&aacute;naiste, she told me 25,000 houses were to be built in 2018.  That is still dismal.  We have so many plans, particularly for social housing and affordable housing.<br/><br/>We know there are excellent rental regimes around Europe, where tenants have greater security of tenure and, in many cases, indefinite leases.  There is a housing crisis in many countries, apart from Finland because it introduced a regime whereby it does not have the appalling homelessness that exists in so many other EU countries.  This crisis is because the commodification of the fundamental human right to shelter.  Nevertheless, there are improved rental markets in our neighbouring European countries.  For example, the rental sectors in Scandinavia, France, Spain and Germany are much better regulated.  People might say the Bill is a small step along the same road.  In Germany, 40% of people live in the private rental sector.  I know that Government policy in Ireland is trying to steer people away from home ownership and towards longer rentals but, to do this, a properly functioning rental sector is needed.<br/><br/>I recently read a book, which is in the Oireachtas Library, by Professor Barrie Needham, who teaches planning the Netherlands.  The book is <i>Dutch Land-use Planning: the Principles and the Practice</i>, which was published in 2014.  It clearly shows the Dutch go in for a lot of project planning and the major planning that is necessary for a country the size of Leinster and Munster with a population of 17 million that continues to grow.  It is slowly trying to increase its land mass.  It has evolved many systems to manage planning and a sustainable supply of housing.  Professor Needham states that even there, the developers of market homes seek a profit margin of 30% or 40% and do not care whatsoever about social housing.  This is the experience we have had with many of our developers over the past number of decades.<br/><br/>During the week, we had the welcome announcement by Facebook that it is to increase its workforce by 1,000 but where will these additional workers live?  If Brexit-related jobs come to this country - and let us hope that over the next eight or nine weeks the fairly frightening prospect of a no-deal Brexit does not happen - it will be another difficulty to produce the additional homes.  The Government will have to deal with this in its final days in office.<br/><br/>Section 3 in Part 2 amends section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and sets out the conditions for a substantial change in the accommodation that can render it exempt from the RPZ increases of 4% per year.  This is a welcome amendment and means that at least half of the dwelling must undergo renovation.  There have been reports of landlords just throwing up a coat of paint or putting in a new suite of furniture to qualify but this will now not entitle them to the exemption.  The Minister probably read Threshold's critique of the Bill.  It rightly outlines concerns regarding this in the analysis it shared with us this week.  The definition of increasing the number of rooms needs to be clarified to ensure existing rooms cannot merely be partitioned.  The exemption from the RPZ increase limits when the BER rating is improved has also been highlighted by Threshold as a concern because it seems as if a landlord could introduce a small change and, thereby, be exempt.  I agree with Threshold's suggestion that the definition should be that a property must be brought up to at least a C1 energy rating in order to improve the home and benefit the tenant with home energy costs.  Section (3)6 makes it an offence to not comply with the section.  If a landlord provides false or misleading information it will also be an offence.<br/><br/>Section 5, also in Part 2, amends section 41 of the 2004 Act and relates to Part 4 tenancies.  A Part 4 tenancy is where a tenant has been in a property for more than six months and then becomes entitled to remain in the property for up to six years with termination of lease only on certain grounds.  Section 5 provides for the extension of a Part 4 tenancy after six years have expired and this is welcome.  It will remain a Part 4 tenancy and will not be restarted after six years with another six-month period; it will continue as a Part 4 tenancy with those protections.<br/><br/>Section 7 amends section 66 of the 2004 Act and relates to notice periods.  The new subsection (2A)(<i>b</i>) provides for the landlord to remedy an incorrect notice and re-serve it as a remedial notice within 28 days of a determination order.  Threshold has also outlined some concerns about the section and says that the phrase &quot;notice period to be given&quot; instead of &quot;lawful notice period&quot; could lead to abuse of the section.  This is something the Minister can address on Committee Stage.  It seems that tenants may be left with only 28 days to vacate a property, which is not at all sufficient in the current climate.<br/><br/>Subection (2A)(<i>c</i>) substitutes the notice period table for a new table, whereby some notice periods have been extended.  Tenancies under six months will still be entitled to 28 days&rsquo; notice.  For tenancies of between six months and one year the entitlement will increase from 35 days to 90 days.  Tenancies of between one and four years will have a notice period of 120 days whereas prior to this legislative change each year was entitled to a different notice period, of 42 days, 56 days, 84 days and 112 days, respectively.  Notice periods for tenancies of five years and over remain the same as what was set out in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, whereby five to six-year tenancies will be entitled to 140 days, six to seven-year tenancies will be entitled to 168 days, seven to eight-year tenancies will be entitled to 196 days and tenancies of eight or more years will be entitled to 224 days.  Section 7(3) provides for the Minister with responsibility for housing to review these changes, complete a report and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. <br/><br/>Section 12 amends section 134 of the 2004 Act, and provides for the registration of tenancies at the start of the tenancy and annually.  This will mean that a landlord does not just register a tenancy once but every year, and tenancies in place prior to the commencement of the section must also be registered.  There will be an annual fee of &euro;40.</p><p>I notice there has again been some significant criticism of the provisions for the rent register.  Many of us had been hoping that the Minister would introduce legislation analogous or close to similar legislation in the UK.  I note that Threshold has again expressed disappointment that a dwelling-specific rent register was not created.  That was supposed to have been under consideration in the early stages of this Bill.  It is regrettable that it is not present now and that we do not have a dwelling-specific rent register.  Section 17 provides for the enforcement of the requirement to keep the information updated.  It will be an offence not to comply with a notice served by the RTB.</p> <p> Section 18 of the Bill inserts a new Part 7A, relating to complaints, investigations and sanctions, into the 2004 Act.  It sets out the interpretations and definitions for this part, the powers of an authorised officer, such as the ability to enter and inspect a premises etc.  The new section 148AA, which deals with an appeal to the Circuit Court against the decision to impose a sanction and other similar sections are all important in creating some kind of administrative system of invigilation.  That will ensure that the fundamental points of this legislation, and the better points in the earlier legislation going back to 2004, are actually implemented.</p> <p> Section 19 of the Bill amends section 151 of the 2004 Act to insert a paragraph referring to the new Part 7A and section 20 of the Bill inserts a new section 164A after section 164 of the 2004 Act regarding the authorised officers and decision makers who will be appointed for the purposes outlined in Part 7A.  The senior Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has left the Chamber.  I welcome the Bill and I will be supporting.  I still believe, however, that it is far too little and very late given the current situation of our desperate homelessness crisis.  Hopefully, the provisions in this Bill will make a certain amount of difference to the lives of tenants.</p> <p> It will need to be accompanied by a strong public awareness programme and campaign to ensure tenants are aware of their improved rights.  It will, of course, also need to provide the necessary resources to the RTB to ensure implementation and enforcement.  I note in a reply to our colleague, Deputy Shortall, in March, that the Minister said there were then 55 staff in the RTB and eight vacancies.  With the new responsibilities now being given to the RTB and the strengthening of its remit there will clearly be a need for it to have more resources so the organisation will be able to fulfil its stronger role in addressing the rights of tenants.  The RTB's strategic plan for 2018 to 2022 lists organisational supports as a priority.  I urge the Minister to commence all sections of the Bill at the earliest juncture to avoid further fall-out from our malfunctioning rental market.  I also ask him to listen to the criticisms made by Members of the key parts of the Bill and to the issues that have been raised by stakeholders.  I refer in particular to organisations such as Threshold which have long campaigned for a number of the improvements contained in this Bill.</p></speech>

There are many positives in the Bill.  We know the situation in Dublin and in the larger cities, but also in all counties and in smaller towns.  I refer to the problems of housing and homelessness in this country.  We have seen some of the major landlords coming from foreign lands and dictating the pace of what they do and getting away with many different things.  We still have to tackle many of those issues.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the senior Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, there are many positives in this Bill.</p><p>It is actually helping the tenant more and putting more responsibility on the landlord.  There is a fear out there, and always has been, that if a tenant opened his or her mouth he or she could soon have his or her notice and then nowhere to stay.  The RTB has a greater responsibility on it to do things to help tenants and anyone in trouble in different parts of the country.  The other side of this that the Government did not address was raised at a launch I was at recently for iCare by Fr. Peter McVerry.  He said there are 12,000 families in buy to let homes.  There is a real danger there because there is a prediction that 12,000 of those houses are in arrears and may be in trouble in respect of being repossessed by the banks.  That would see many more families added to the situation that pertains currently.</p><p>We have to look at seeing how solutions can be found to keeping tenants <i>in situ</i>to make sure we do not end up dealing with a massive number of people and putting more pressure on the different bodies that look after people in homelessness and try to get them a bed.  We have to keep a sharp eye on that this year.  We know the banks are moving a bit faster.  As I said, though, I will not hold this Bill up.  There are many positives in it that have to be welcomed.  It will be of some help.  It is not going to solve the problem by any means but anything positive that is being done has to be acknowledged by all sides of the House.</p></speech>

I am not going to go back over everything that was addressed last night by the Minister when he outlined the Bill and his hopes for it.  I thank all the Members on behalf of the Minister and the Department for their contributions.  We appreciate the support offered for the Bill.  Most speakers supported the Bill or certainly most of it.  We understand it is quite technical in nature and it has much detail.  It is also very important that we get this Bill right legally.  It will take some time to work through that.</p>  <p>  The Minister did stress last night that he hoped to bring this Bill through as fast as possible but recognising as well that it has to be given proper scrutiny.  That is guaranteed.  As some of the speakers referred to last night, we all agree this has to be done but we still have to make sure that we get it right.  Every effort will be made to do that.  We will work through ways of teasing through the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage and in other informal ways.  We will also work on amendments that Deputies might have, in addition to our own that the Minister will want to bring through on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  We will work with Members on that and try to explore different way to do our business faster because we all want to get this done as fast as possible.  The main provisions in the Bill focus on the main priorities.  People will, naturally, have a long list of other stuff that they will want to add in and we will be able to judge that better on Committee Stage as to how fast we can do that or what aspects we might have to come back to.  There is certainly a list of different issues in respect of the behaviour of landlords that can be added at a later stage if needs be.  We can work on that too.</p>  <p>  I again thank all the Members for their contributions, both last night and today, and for their time.  It is a Bill that many of us have been anticipating for a while and it is great that we finally have it in the House and that we are getting though Second Stage.  I look forward to working with all of the Members on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
