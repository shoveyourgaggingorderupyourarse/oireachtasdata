For those who do not understand that challenge, I encourage them to listen back to the recent  "Drivetime" reports by John Cooke who gave views from the ground.  I want to discuss with the Minister how the town and village scheme and the scheme to encourage people to move back to towns and villages are progressing.  Will he also outline his key priorities in this area in 2019?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300003#A00600"><p>The town and village renewal scheme forms an important part of the Action Plan for Rural Development and has the potential to stimulate economic recovery and job creation in towns and villages across rural Ireland.  The scheme is specifically focused on rural towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000.</p>  <p>  The town and village renewal scheme was introduced in the second half of 2016.  To date, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country.  The projects cover a range of activities, from improving the public realm to make towns and villages more attractive for locals and visitors alike to job creation initiatives such as the development of enterprise and digital hubs.  Details of the 2019 town and village renewal scheme are being finalised by my officials.  I anticipate that the scheme will be announced during the first quarter of the year, with approvals being announced in the second half of the year, as was the case in previous years.</p>  <p>  The scheme to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages is under way.  I launched the initiative last October and announced the six rural towns which had been invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme.  The scheme is being led locally by the local authorities, in close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and my Department.  Up to &euro;100,000 is being made available for each participating town.  The funding will be used by the local authorities to engage with communities and local businesses and identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in rural towns.  I expect to receive a report from each of the local authorities in the first half of the year on the progress they have made.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified in the six pilot scheme towns will lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the rural regeneration and development fund in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300003#A00700"><p>The Minister has said funding of &euro;53 million has been approved for the town and village renewal scheme.  Will he confirm for the House how much of that sum has been drawn down?  The replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister indicated that there had been a &euro;2.5 million underspend under the programme in 2018.  Will he confirm whether the money has been spent since and if all of the money allocated in 2018 was spent?</p>  <p>  The Minister and I see the effects of both schemes daily.  There is significant potential in towns and villages, but there is no sense in the Minister ploughing away with this initiative in his Department if other Departments are ignorant of what is going on or not co-operating with his Department.  For instance, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should provide for rates remissions for those who invest in their properties.  Instead, if someone invests in a business property in a small town or village, he or she receives a bigger rates bill.  There is significant space overhead in many properties in towns and villages that would be ideal for use as assisted accommodation or accommodation for older people who want to live near services.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should engage with the Minister to devise a scheme for existing properties to get people back into services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is dragging its feet on the GP contract.  A GP service is essential in any local community.  It, too, would help to keep people in rural areas and encourage others to move back.  The schemes should be bigger.  What else is going on at the Government table to provide services in local communities?</p></speech>

To be fair to the local authorities, the schemes were always intended to be run over a 15-month period.  We allocated the funding in October and expect it to be spent this year.  It is a rolling scheme and that is the way it will operate, regardless of who will have this job in the future.  That is the way it has to be because local authorities are not able to deliver schemes within the year.</p><p>They need a bit of time to get their Part 8 projects in place and there is other work they need to do.  Local authorities have not had themselves in glory around the country on this programme or any other.  I will ask my officials, over the next number of days, to write to the local authorities about all of the funding I have allocated under the CL&Aacute;R programme, outdoor recreation, rural recreation and I will seek four-monthly reports from the local authorities to see what they are delivering.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, the town and village scheme has been very good.  We allocated &euro;200,000, for example, for the community centre and Ballinglen Arts Foundation in Ballycastle.  That was with the local developer who developed the street.  The C&eacute;ide Fields Visitor Centre gets &euro;1.5 million.  The signature point in Ballycastle and the GAA there are also getting funding.  It is not all about funding but Ballycastle is a town we should use as an example because it has been given a lift.  That has happened all over the country.  The same thing has happened with the funding we have given for the walk scheme in Drumshanbo.</p> <p> The town and village scheme has been very good, as the Deputy knows.  We allocated &euro;200,000 to Ballycastle, for example, for the community centre and the Ballinglen Arts Foundation.  That was with the local developer who developed the street.  The C&eacute;ide ields there are getting &euro;1.5 million.  Signature Point in Ballycastle is also getting funding, as is the GAA.  It is not all about funding, but what it has done for that town, which we should use as an example, it has given it a lift.  That has happened all over the country.

Out of &euro;53 million drawn down, &euro;13 million has been spent.  The Minister needs to start kicking heads.  Local authorities are great at showing up for openings but there is no sense in the Minister allocating money that is not being drawn down and spent in the communities where it is needed, and it is badly needed.  I encourage the Minister to get that information and publish it.  It is time for the Minister to start publicly calling out local authorities that are letting their communities down by not spending this money.</p>  <p>  There are substantial under-allocations and funds that are not being drawn down across many of the Minister's programmes.  Members and officials of local authorities need to be told they are letting their communities down by not drawing down this money.  The Minister needs to do more that write to them.  He needs to name and shame those poor performers.</p></speech>

Of course, civil servants do not like to give out to other civil servants and they will protect one another whenever they have to, but local authorities have not had themselves in glory.  Every week, I read cuttings from local papers all over the country and it annoys me to see Fine Gael councillors, Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and Independent councillors criticising the Government for not providing funding.  There has never been as much funding put into rural Ireland.  There has been &euro;22 million given through the LEADER programme.  The town and village scheme has provided &euro;53 million.  There has been &euro;41 million for outdoor recreation.  The CL&Aacute;R programme has provided &euro;25 million.  The local improvement scheme has provided &euro;38 million.  The SICAP programme has provided &euro;190 million.  It is not that the funding is not going in.  Sometimes the local authorities are not doing what they should do and I will tell them, in the next rounds of these schemes, that they are not to make application for schemes if they are not ready to deliver them.  That is a message that will go out loud and clear.</p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary is right that it may be the time to put out figures that show what local authorities have got from my Department.  I have a list here showing how much money each county got from my Department last year but I do not have the corresponding list of how much they have then spent and that is something I need to start working on.</p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary was talking about a pilot scheme earlier and he is quite correct.  I want to sit down with all Departments when the report comes back from the six towns.  Deputy Calleary touched on something I do not want to see happening.  I do not want every other Department throwing schemes over to the rural regeneration scheme or over to my Department.  It happens regularly that letters come in from Deputies or community programmes and the Departments wish to state they do not wish to touch them but that it is a matter for my Department.  It is not.  We need to sit down and start working that out and we will do that when we get the results from this pilot scheme.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00600"><p>My question regards the impact of Brexit, even if there is a deal but particularly if there is no deal, on the entire country and particularly rural Ireland, which will be most badly affected.  That is particularly true of the Border corridor.  The INTERREG programme recognises border corridors throughout Europe as areas of economic disadvantage by the very fact that they have a border running through them.  The Border in Ireland is a most unnatural border because it breaks townlands and parishes and cuts through the whole of rural Ireland.  It runs through a very rural area.  I seek an assurance from the Minister and his Department that plans are in place to invest in those areas in the context of Brexit.  Those areas will need an absolute commitment that we can pour money into them to try and ensure the negative impacts of Brexit will be curtailed.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00700"><p>My Department has been undertaking appropriate planning for various Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit.  As is the case for all Departments, this planning has fed into the cross-Government preparations being led by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.  Planning by Government and at the EU level, for all possible outcomes, has been ramped up and will continue.  The Government published a contingency action plan, which my Department inputted into, on 19 December.  This plan sets out the Government's approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit.  We are determined that Ireland will be as ready as it can be in mitigating any impacts from Brexit and of a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  In the case of my Department the preparations in advance of Brexit have been focused on engagement and awareness in relation to our stakeholders in the rural and community development sectors.  My focus is on anticipating and preparing for all such outcomes which may lead to impacts on rural Ireland and communities generally.  I am very conscious that the potential effects of a disorderly Brexit on communities and on certain economic sectors, such as the agrifood sector, will have a major regional impact.  Therefore, a key element of my Department&rsquo;s contingency planning is to ensure maximum flexibility in our programme of funding initiatives, to allow for needed responses to emerging needs and to continue to build resilience in all communities.  The funding provided by my Department to communities throughout this country will become even more important in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00800"><p>What I take from that answer is that the preparations the Minister has made is that he will allow greater flexibility to exist in respect of funds.  While I understand we need flexibility, and we will be looking for flexibility in funding arrangements in any case, we really need a plan to seek additional funds particularly from Europe because this is a European problem, not just an Irish problem, although Ireland will meet the biggest impact of it.  We need to see from where we can get additional resources to support the small businesses that will be under threat in the Border corridor and, indeed, across the entire country as a consequence of Brexit.  These are businesses in transport, agrifood and a whole range of sectors.  I spoke to a man last week who is importing products.  He feels he will face serious problems, particularly with VAT, because, if Britain is out of the European Union, he will have to pay the VAT when he imports goods, rather than when he sells them.  That will have a huge impact on him and his business and he is not even prepared as to how to do the paperwork around that, let alone how he will pay for it.  He spoke to the bank about it.  Will he get the resources he needs?  Will he get an extension of the credit he needs to do that?  There is no answer there.  It is issues like that on which the Government needs to come in and show that it has the resources in place to protect these small businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B00900"><p>I can only speak for my Department, but as a member of the Government and Cabinet, I can say that preparations are taking place on a daily basis.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that there is flexibility in my Department and there will be more flexibility.  When the time comes and if there is a no-deal Brexit, which puts certain communities and areas in bigger difficulties than others, that is where I will have to target funding.  I will do that and that is my plan.  There is flexibility within all the schemes in my Department and that is a good thing.  I will continue to leave that flexibility there.  We will deal with the areas where there is the most need.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Government.  We have played our part with regard to the plan that has been announced and we have to wait and see the outcome of Brexit.  My job, as Minister for Community and Rural Development, is to make sure that I am there to support rural communities.  At Government level, I am there on a daily basis and I policy-proof whatever decisions are made to ensure that rural Ireland is protected.  We have to wait and see what will actually happen but I stress the word "flexibility".  My Department is flexible and we will target the areas that need it most.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300004#B01000"><p>I acknowledge that the Minister's Department is prepared to be flexible but the issue here is about more than that.  It is about the additional funds that will be needed.  I would like to hear from the Minister that the Government is working, through all its Departments, to put together a package of anticipated needs and then go to Brussels and put it on the table and say that, as a consequence of Brexit, we have many small businesses, particularly in the Border region but across the whole country, that will need additional resources.</p><p>We also need additional infrastructure to be put in place. The Minister's Department is key to that.  I welcome the funding that came, for instance, to places like the Food Hub in Drumshanbo as small businesses in places like that will need additional resources.  </p> <p> The reason why we are in this position, is because of a conflict between a member of the European Union and the European Union itself.  For that reason, it is important that Government seeks the initial funding that it requires.</p> <p> If Europe is saying it is prepared to stand behind us when it comes to the backstop and all of these matters, funds must be put in place to do this.  There is no good in saying that they stand behind us in poverty.  That is the way it is going to end up in a lot of areas in rural Ireland where we be do not have the resources or the capacity to build into the future.</p> <p> The Minister's Department is key to this and he has a role in rural Ireland.  As most of the Border corridor is very rural, he needs to come up with the goods in this respect.</p></speech>

We published a plan on 19 December.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have a fund to help small businesses prepare for Brexit.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has such plans, as does every other Department, including my own, for when the time comes.</p>  <p>  We are not in a position to talk about funding yet, until we know the nature of the problem. </p></speech>

At the start of this year, the Minister made a substantial announcement regarding the groups that were successful in securing funding and the amounts of funding.  My question specifically asks the Minister to indicate the level of supports that have now been targeted at the most disadvantaged urban communities, as had been represented by RAPID communities in the past.</p></reply>

The new programme does not ring-fence funding for specific locations.  Instead funding is allocated to each local authority area, taking into account the relative deprivation levels.  Local community development committees, LCDCs, administer the programme locally to ensure that funding is provided to groups and areas that need it most in order to address disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The LCDCs monitor the problem closely using local knowledge to ensure that funding is benefitting communities in the fairest way possible.  Over 3,000 projects have been approved to date and a list of all approved projects is available on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  RAPID areas were identified a significant number of years ago.  Over time, demographic changes meant that it is no longer appropriate to ring-fence funding to these areas.  Instead my Department takes into account the relative disadvantage of each local authority area when allocating funding and LCDCs then administer these funds at local level.</p>  <p>  The 2019 programme has not yet been finalised, as it currently being considered by my Department.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I disagree with the comment of the Minister that there is no longer need to have RAPID areas.  Such areas are the most disadvantaged urban areas.  The problems that existed ten and 20 years ago in many of those communities exist to this very day.  They do not need a level playing field; they need positive discrimination to support them and to give them an opportunity they have never had before.  The merging of these two programmes means the clarity that existed previously, where there was identified targeted funding to the most disadvantaged communities, has been taken away.</p>  <p>  The report on why these programmes should be merged has no basis.  It is a convenience rather than a practicality.  The Minister has walked away from those most disadvantaged communities.  I am not opposed to the community enhancement programme.  I am not opposed to any of the groups getting funding.  What I am opposed to is that urban disadvantaged areas, which have been disadvantaged for many years and which came through the last recession having seen their funding cut, now see that when funding is reintroduced, it is not prioritised and targeted towards those with greatest need.</p></speech>

This funding is targeted to the greatest disadvantage.</p>  <p>  On the RAPID programme referred to by the Deputy, the value-for-money report that was produced on it specifically stated it was not to be run in the way it had been run in the past.  I was obliged to change it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy must agree with me that the LCDC groups are drawn from the community.  They include elected representatives and representatives of community groups in the disadvantaged areas.  If these groups do not know where the disadvantage is, then who does?  I have tried this scheme and I am prepared to give it a chance.  I will evaluate it, however.  I, like the Deputy, want to ensure that this funding is given to those who need it most and I do not want it used for anything else.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's points on board.  I am reviewing but I do want to see that funding targeted.  I believe the people on the LCDCs are those who should know best, as they are the people on the ground and they should know their own local communities.</p></speech>

The additional funds will be made available to it where there are particular problems.  There are particular problems in a range of urban areas around the country.  These areas are not getting that targeted level of support, which the Minister clearly believes and understands makes a difference.  There are communities right across Dublin that are not receiving anything like the level of support that the inner city is receiving.  In previous parliamentary questions, the Minister referred to rural issues but what I do not wish to see is a raid on an urban fund for disadvantaged communities.  That is what RAPID funding was all about, namely, for the most disadvantaged communities with the least capacity to provide for themselves and with the greatest challenges.  Those challenges were clearly identified in the past.  They have not gone away.  The Minister has clearly articulated that in relation to the inner city.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to hear the Minister will keep this under the review. I acknowledge the great work many of these projects do.  They cannot be funded, however, at the expense of our most disadvantaged communities.  I urge the Minister to look through those programmes and identify how much of the funding he is allocating is going to those with the greatest level of need.</p></speech>

The Dublin inner city received was allocated &euro;6.5 million this year.  Last year's funding for South Dublin County Council was &euro;737,700, which provided for 120 projects that have been approved to date. These projects were ring-fenced.  I also gave funding to the Men's Shed programme and ring-fenced &euro;500,000 for this programme.  The Men's Shed is working particularly well in disadvantaged areas.  I wish I had more money to give to that group, which does a lot of work on the ground.</p>  <p>  Staying with the question the Deputy has asked, I am glad the scheme is open and that I was in the position to open it.  I put a substantial amount of money into the scheme last year from savings in other Departments.  That scheme was worthy of more support.  I could have allocated this funding to roads or other areas but I wanted to put it into disadvantaged areas.  I, like the Deputy, want to see the areas that need to be targeted receive this funding. The Deputy is quite correct in saying that these areas are to be found in both urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  I visited Dublin inner city with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I would love to bring some of the rural people up to see the level of disadvantage.  There is disadvantage in both urban and rural areas.  It would do one's heart good to see the respect these people have regarding the small level of funding that was available to them and what they do with it.  There is a great community spirit there and I would like to target more areas like that and give them the support and finances they need.</p></speech>

In the Minister's last reply he referred to the fact that the Department provided funding for men's sheds.  The Department has great capacity to provide a relatively small amount money which has an impact on a wide range of people.  Will the Minister consider putting a funding scheme in place for Tidy Towns projects, as he did for men's sheds?</p></reply>

The programme is aimed at improving community facilities to address disadvantage.  In 2018 I allocated a total of &euro;13 million for the programme, which included &euro;500,000 that was ring-fenced for a men&rsquo;s sheds fund.  The issue of whether I will be in a position to allocate funding in 2019 to Tidy Towns committees will be considered by me at later date.  However, Tidy Towns committees are free to apply, with any other community group, for funding under the general programme.  Under the 2018 programme, 158 applications from Tidy Towns groups were approved for funding under the community enhancement programme to a total amount of &euro;536,816.  They also received funding in 2018 and previous years under other grant schemes operated by my Department.  Under these other schemes, funding of &euro;2.8 million was allocated for provision for Tidy Towns committees between 2017 and 2018.  </p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the great work carried out by Tidy Towns groups across the country.  They are all independent voluntary groups and can apply for funding under this scheme.  I will look again this year to see what I can do for Tidy Towns groups which do a tremendous job in many areas.  They are cleaning up rubbish dumped by people on a regular basis.  They have to be complimented on doing so.  The time has come to start looking at ways and means to give them some support and recognise the great work they do as volunteers.</p></speech>

Tidy Towns is a national organisation which impacts positively in every community throughout the country.  It would be worthwhile if there was an annual grants scheme which, for very small money, would have a huge impact.  I encourage the Minister to look at such a scheme.  Before I came into the Chamber, I looked at the results in my area for the Tidy Towns committees that had entered the national competition this year in Clondalkin, Lucan, Newcastle and Palmerston.  Each one of them has improved its score every year and people living in the area can see the value of it.  With it comes pride of place.  While I acknowledge committees can apply under the general scheme, I encourage the Minister to consider a designated scheme similar to the one for men's sheds specifically to develop Tidy Towns on a national basis.</p></speech>

It is something at which I could and might look as no other group is more worthy of it, but it is all about the finances.  I was able to allocate the money from savings in the Department.  Perhaps I might look at having something on a more permanent basis.  In the rules and regulations I used for this and the community enhancement scheme which probably did not suit everybody, I did not stop them from applying under both schemes because whatever funding they receive they spend very wisely.  The criterion I used for Tidy Towns groups was they had to participate in the Tidy Towns competition.  Last year marked its 60th anniversary, which is why I gave a further one-off grant.  The groups do a superb job.  They have great volunteers who do not receive the recognition they deserve for doing a tremendous job which is always done by the same three or four people in every community.  As Deputy Calleary will tell us, there are voluntary groups in Castlebar, Westport and Ballina.  Those involved are out working at 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. cleaning up.  Perhaps we might support them more.  The local authorities are receiving funding from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to catch people who are dumping, a problem which is getting bigger.  It is very serious and one we need to tackle.</p></speech>

Tidy Towns committees have a positive impact on all of our communities.  I mentioned the four towns in my area in which the results have all improved year on year.  In areas which have not traditionally been part of Tidy Towns competitions Tidy Towns committees are also being established and beginning to take part in the process.  It is important that they be seen to be supported at Government level.  This year we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the competition.  Most Tidy Towns committees work in collaboration with the local authorities.  They do not operate in isolation.  They link with other community and environmental groups and the overall benefit is enormous.  They fundraise locally.  It is small money from the Department, but the difference &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 makes to a Tidy Towns committee in terms of its annual budget is significant.  The indications the Minister has given are positive.  Those of us on this side of the House will give him every support and encouragement in developing a national grant scheme for Tidy Towns committees.</p></speech>

Like the Deputy, I have a lot time for Tidy Towns groups.  Perhaps I might look at the community enhancement programme and ring-fence money for them.  It is something at which I will look because they are worthy of support.  As I move across the country to visit every town and village, I see certain projects which people tell me were carried out with the assistance of funding made available to them by the Department.  It is money well spent.  The local authorities work with the Tidy Town groups.  They need to work with them because they are doing a tremendous job and should be supported.</p></speech>

Many of the initiatives form part of the Government&rsquo;s published Action Plan for Rural Development and framework policy for local and community development which include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in communities.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I will continue to advocate for a cross-government approach to ensuring the rural and community voice is heard in matters of policy.  My Department is committed to the successful delivery of a number of programmes which provide financial and other supports for organisations throughout the country to assist in combating rural and urban isolation.  They include the seniors alert scheme, the social inclusion and community activation programme, the LEADER programme and the community services programme.  In addition, groups can input into the policy-making process through the local structures established by my Department, the public participation networks and local community development committees.  </p>  <p>  On volunteering, the call for an input paper is a first step in developing a new national volunteering strategy.  We want to hear from stakeholders as we draft the new strategy and there will be further opportunities to have an input via public consultation later in the process.</p></speech>

Since I became my party's spokesperson on mental health and engaged on various issues, there has been one issue that has consistently exacerbated any mental health issue and that is loneliness which results largely from isolation and affects both physical and mental health.  Whether in the urban centres of Gorey, Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross and the surrounding rural areas or Dublin city or Cork where I meet various groups, isolation is consistently raised as an issue when discussing loneliness and its effect on mental health.  There is much we could do.  Many of the traditional structures that helped to prevent isolation and loneliness are no more.  The State could do a lot to develop new structures where people could meet, interact and engage to combat this epidemic.</p></speech>

It is why some of the schemes in my Department such as the seniors alert scheme have worked very well.  In 2018 we spent &euro;6.984 million in supporting 19,000 new participants.  There is a new initiative which I will introduce and for which I would like to receive the Deputy's support and that of everybody else in the House.</p><p>It is the national community weekend event we intend to run in May.  We have announced some details, but we will have a national launch shortly.  We will try to get communities to host events to allow people to get to know their neighbours to reduce isolation which is one of the issues at which we are looking.  There are many people who would be prepared to visit on a voluntary basis neighbours, friends and others who need visitors.  The scheme commenced in September and will shortly be the subject of a national launch during the weekend event in May.  I hope it will encourage people to get to know their neighbours.</p> <p> I note our other schemes.  We have provided for investment of &euro;190 million under SICAP between 2018 and 2022.  To date, over 25,000 individuals have received assistance.  The men's shed movement is working in that regard also.  Another scheme people do not consider in the context of rural isolation is the local improvement scheme, under which funding is available to help people to get into and out of their homes.</p></speech>

Some villages are strong in that regard, but they tend to be the ones with schools and shops.  There are many small villages in rural Ireland that do not have that centre and we must find ways to encourage greater interconnectivity in them.  Obviously, people with disabilities and older people are vulnerable, but there are many young and healthy people, in particular, farmers, who are being isolated also.  The creamery man collects milk without talking to the farmer, while the postman leaves post in a little green box at the bottom of a lane.  Farmers can go days without speaking to anyone, which is a serious issue.  Equally, there is an issue in urban settings, including large cities.  Sometimes the loneliest place someone can be is where he or she is surrounded by people, especially if he or she is elderly.  I ask the Minister to do whatever he can to combat this epidemic.</p></speech>

In 2019, &euro;46 million has been allocated for that programme to support more than 400 organisations to deal with many of the issues raised by the Deputy.  We also have social enterprises and voluntary groups targeting disadvantage, albeit sometimes they do not fit in with the schemes I have set out.  I am carrying out a review of the community services programme and want to protect its community aspect, in particular.  At &euro;46 million, the programme receives very significant funding and the 400 organisations and groups it supports do a tremendous job for their communities.  I hope some of them might look at the issue of loneliness raised by the Deputy to determine what they could do to support elderly persons.</p></speech>

Under the programme funding is provided for small-scale projects in rural areas which have experienced significant levels of depopulation.  While the amounts available to fund projects under CL&Aacute;R are relatively modest, the impact of that funding is significant.  I have visited many projects and seen at first-hand the difference they make to local communities.  Funding of &euro;25 million has been approved under CL&Aacute;R to provide for 1,200 projects since 2016.  They have included the provision of safety measures around schools and community facilities, the construction of play areas, support for emergency first responders and a measure to provide vehicles to transport people to cancer care and respite centres.  I intend to launch a further call for proposals under CL&Aacute;R this year and will make decisions shortly on the specific measures to be supported in 2019.  I anticipate that the programme will be opened to new applications in the first quarter of the year.</p></speech>

I have seen the brilliant and positive influence it has had in the provision of playgrounds, first responders and many community events.  I have received a great deal of feedback on the impact on local primary schools of traffic calming measures, in particular.  I have raised with the Minister the application of Killinkere national school for CL&Aacute;R funding for traffic calming measures.  It is a rural school in a thriving community, in which well over 100 pupils are being taught by a significant number of teachers.  The principal and parents' association are very anxious that traffic calming measures be introduced.  There are few sources of funding available to small primary schools, but the CL&Aacute;R programme has been used to make provision for measures such as this.  Will the Minister outline whether traffic calming measures will be included in his next announcement and when might it be made?</p></speech>

Deputy Calleary was, however, correct in the issue he raised earlier.  I do not want to start to take on matters which it is the role of other Departments to address.  I had to do that in respect of the local improvement scheme when other Departments would not take on the role, with the result that no scheme was in place for many years.  Deputy Smyth will know how important that scheme is to County Cavan and rural areas in general.  She is correct that if there is one good scheme, it is CL&Aacute;R.  While it is small money, a great job is done.  I will look at the issue raised by the Deputy in that context.  I am looking at new schemes to support rural communities that cannot draw down funding from other Departments which are not coming forward to support them.  In particular, I have no difficulty in supporting the provision of child safety measures at schools.  To be fair to the Deputy, she has acknowledged that the CL&Aacute;R programme has worked well.  We have done a great deal of very good work on school safety, including providing warning signs that there is a school ahead.  I am sure we have saved many lives nationally as a result.  I will be opening the scheme again shortly and considering ways to improve CL&Aacute;R.  However, I do not want to find myself taking on the work of other Departments as the minute one starts to do so, the funding will be drawn away.  I need to sit down and work with other Departments also.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that LIS funding should come from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If it did, there would be more money for the Minister to give to rural communities which is what he is all about.  Killinkere national school is very curtailed in what it can do and there are many schools in the same position across the country.  For instance, the car park is actually located across the road from it and there is no safe drop-off point.  The principal and school management do their best to ensure the school is as safe as possible, but the car park is still located across the road and tremendous worry, angst and frustration have been experienced in the community for many years.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to be mindful of the need for flexibility in that regard in any further announcement he will make on CL&Aacute;R funding.  Funding for projects such as this is not easy to attain for small primary schools in the countryside.  The Minister's role is making countryside communities and rural areas thrive.  CL&Aacute;R funding has had a great influence in that regard.  However, I make the case again for Killinkere national school.  It has applied unsuccessfully for CL&Aacute;R funding before, but the parents' association, board of management, staff and management are anxious to access it now to make their school a safer place.</p></speech>

Under the scheme support is provided for schools in the provision of community safety measures.  When it comes to safety measures, there is some flexibility.  As such, I ask the Deputy to send on the details and I will have a look at them.  The other area at which I looked last year was the provision of support for mobility and cancer care transport services.  I found that it was a major problem in rural Ireland and that the resulting scheme worked very well.  Many patients had not been able to get to their cancer care appointments and the HSE had reneged in the provision of funding to support them.  Voluntary groups had taken up the call, but they were finding it very difficult to source funding for their buses to bring patients to and from cancer treatment appointments.  It was one of the schemes I introduced last year and I continue to look at ways and means to introduce schemes to help to provide a benefit for communities in rural Ireland.  That is what it is all about.  As such, the Deputy might send on the details of the individual case and I will have a look at them.</p></speech>

To date, 1,644 projects with a grant value of more than &euro;55.8 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.

Of this total, more than &euro;12.5 million of project expenditure was incurred in 2018 compared with just under &euro;700,000 in 2017.

The Minister said 1,644 projects are worth &euro;55.8 million.  When is that money anticipated to be drawn down?  Will it be during 2019 or 2020?  With only two years remaining, does he envisage an extension to the LEADER programme?  What is the final date on which he expects LAGs to be able to draw down money in the context of the programme?

As I said in my reply, there has been a major improvement, given that two years ago there was only &euro;700,000 in expenditure whereas last year there was &euro;12.5 million, and I expect that to be further ramped up this year.  It is expected that 80% of the project budget will be approved by the local action groups by the end of 2019, and further funding can be allocated to projects up to the end of 2020.  Project promoters have a further three years to complete the proposed works and submit claims for payments.</p></speech>

As Minister, I have made all the possible changes that were sought.</p>  <p>  Approvals have been made and now it is a matter for promoters and the people who received the grant aid to do the work and draw down the funding.  It is similar to what the Deputy rightly said earlier in that I can deal only with the issues that are in my remit.  I addressed the issue of the logjam that existed and I made it easier for the LEADER programme to be implemented.  The funding has been allocated and the groups must spend the money.  To be fair to the Department and everybody involved, we pay groups as the receipts are received.  As the Deputy will know, I must be careful.

Since its inception, the competition has grown from 52 entrants in 1958 to 883 entrants in 2018.  The continued success of the competition is due to the countless hours of effort from Tidy Towns committees the length and breadth of the country.  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring was delighted to be in a position to announce grant funding to Tidy Towns committees of &euro;1.4 million for each of the years 2017 and 2018 to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition.  This funding has allowed the committees to prepare better for the annual competition through the purchase or upgrade of small equipment and other materials.</p>  <p>  Under the 2017 allocation, 906 Tidy Towns committees received grant funding of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;4,000, depending on the size of their town or village, while under the 2018 allocation, 722 Tidy Towns committees have received similar levels of funding to date, with a number of applications still to be processed.  Later this year, the Minister will consider whether he will be in a position to allocate funding to the Tidy Towns committees through this funding stream in 2019.  It should be noted, however, that Tidy Towns committees can apply, as community groups, for funding to other schemes within his Department, such as the community enhancement programme, which is administered through the local community development committees, LCDCs.  In 2018, 158 applications were approved for funding of &euro;536,816 to Tidy Towns committees under the community enhancement programme.</p></speech>

I come from a village, Rathvilly in Carlow, which has the honour of winning the Tidy Towns competition on three occasions in the early years - 1961, 1963 and 1968.  Considerable effort has been made in recent years in my community, as in every other community, to try to return to former glory.  It is important that communities are made aware of any potential funding early in the year in order that they can plan and develop whatever projects they may have.  While funding is always welcome, if it is received mid-summer, it is too late because much work will have been done to get ready for the visit of the judges in June, July or August.</p>  <p>  It has been indicated that funding may be made available.  When exactly does the Minister of State expect that to happen, given that plans need to be put in place at this stage of the year in order that communities can have a fair idea of what to expect later in the year?</p></speech>

The Minister is discussing the matter with his officials and he will make his decision as soon as possible in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While on the subject, it is important to acknowledge that SuperValu has been involved in the competition for many years and it provides much support and cohesion to communities throughout the country.</p><p>I want to congratulate Listowel, even though I do not believe there are any Kerry Deputies here but perhaps there are, on winning the national award, which is a great honour for any town.  I was in Abbeyshrule in December presenting the certificates.  The pride in the members of every community who arrived on the night for the regional awards was palpable.  The local authorities play a great role in that respect also.  To answer the question, the Minister will make his decisions as early as possible in the coming months.</p></speech>

I come from a village that won the award on three occasions.  Carlow has quite a good history in that regard.  Only two years ago the village of Clonegal won the tidiest village national award, which was a great achievement for it.  Previously, Leighlinbridge, in County Carlow, also won a substantial award.  The clarification is welcome but it is important that the plans are put in place early in the year.  Some communities are looking at different ideas including developing community gardens, which is a different initiative.  It is important that that can be put in place.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the sponsorship, on which I compliment the Minister, and ensure that sponsorship is continuously available.  SuperValu plays a major part not only in sponsorship but in its promotion on national television and media.  I compliment everybody in that regard.</p>  <p>  I reaffirm the importance of having an early date for the announcement of any potential funding that might be available to ensure that communities can put their plans in place in terms of the extra expenditure that may be available to them.</p></speech>

He has had discussions already with the Department.  The important point is the valuable work being done by the Tidy Towns committees, which is so relevant when we talk about our environment, climate change and keeping communities tidy.  The committees do a great deal of work on a voluntary basis picking up rubbish on a Saturday or whenever that has been dumped by people who are selfish.  It is important that we recognise the work they do but also that we cite those who do not have any regard for the environment or pride in the areas in which they live.  I hope we will see Kilkenny coming back up again-----</p></speech>

There was a huge level of interest in the programme right across the country following its launch so I was delighted to be in a position to allocate additional once-off funding to the programme later in the year, and the final amount allocated was &euro;13 million.  This included &euro;0.5 million that was ring-fenced for Men's Sheds.  More than 3,000 projects across the country were funded, all of them targeted at enhancing facilities in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  The details of the 2019 programme are currently being considered and will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

In the areas RAPID used to deal with, we do not see the impact of it as clearly as one would see it in a rural village or area.  I stay in the north inner city when I am in Dublin and I notice there are major problems of deprivation and decline in the area.  Entire streetscapes need a major amount of enhancement and other work to be done.  The people in those communities want a chance and any effort that can be made to invest in those areas, as well as in rural areas, is absolutely necessary.</p>  <p>  The amount of funding provided seems to be very small compared to that made available last year.  While I acknowledge the Minister said that the &euro;8 million allocation was a once-off, we hope it will be a once-off allocation every year, and perhaps a bit more, because it is a scheme that has made a huge difference.  We should recognise and acknowledge when something is done well.  That particular scheme has made a big difference to many small communities throughout the country.  The level of funding available needs to be increased at least to the level available last year but hopefully a little more, if that was possible.</p></speech>

As I said, in 2017 we allocated &euro;2.5 million for inner city Dublin, &euro;3.5 million for 2018 and &euro;6.5 million for 2019, in addition to the funding we allocated for South Dublin County Council.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about his own constituency.  In the Sligo-Leitrim area more than &euro;433,000 was allocated.  When I amalgamated the community enhancement programme and the RAPID scheme, there was &euro;2 million in each of them, making a total of &euro;4 million.  The Deputy is correct.  From savings in my Department last year I made a political decision.  I felt this scheme was a good one.  It was targeting the areas it should target.  As I said to Deputy Curran earlier, I have to monitor the scheme to make sure this funding is going to the most needy and disadvantaged areas.  So far, I am happy that is the case but I will be monitoring it to identify the areas that got the actual funding.  It is important that if this fund is allocated for a specific purpose it is spent on a specific purpose.  I am giving the local community development committees, LCDCs, the opportunity to do that.  I know they have done a good job this year but I will have to monitor that.  For this year, however, we have &euro;4 million in a programme.  If I can get some savings later in the year, I will look at that again.</p></speech>

Nobody is living in them and nothing is happening with them.  That is another aspect of this.  While this funding is for public and community works, there are many people who own buildings that are a liability rather than an asset.  If some element of a scheme could be brought in to provide funds to help people turn those liabilities into assets in which people could live in towns and villages throughout the country, it would make a huge difference.  I have spoken about that to the Minister previously but at this point we know there are major problems in many areas of the country.  One of the big problems we have is housing, which is an issue all of us and every Department has a responsibility to try to do something about in a proactive way.  I am aware some local authorities put the squeeze on people through threats of compulsory purchase orders and so on.  In most cases they cost a lot of money and they do not work.  If some incentive could be put in place to encourage people to generate these buildings into housing accommodation for people they would become an asset they can use: the Government would get tax on it as well.  It makes common sense and I implore the Minister to do something around that issue.</p></speech>

This is a very good programme and I believe the funding was allocated fairly.  I gave &euro;125,000 to every local authority.  I then looked at disadvantaged areas and gave 60% for those.  I refer to 40% of the population.  It was distributed fairly throughout the country.  The funding can be used for CCTV equipment, energy efficiency projects or community amenities.  It is a scheme that can be used at local level.  The LCDCs will look at it.  They will make the decisions.  They are the ones on the ground who should be able to identify the areas with the most need.  That is why I am hopeful this scheme will work and that we give the funding to the people who need it most.</p></speech>

Since then, more than 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R.  The type of projects which have been supported include safety measures around schools and community facilities, the provision of play areas, supports for first responders in emergency situations, and a measure to provide vehicles to transport people to cancer care and respite centres.  Total payments under the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2018 amounted to &euro;6.9 million.  This figure includes some payments in respect of 2017 CL&Aacute;R project approvals where projects continued into 2018.

CL&Aacute;R is an important scheme.  We did quite well in County Clare in last year's allocations.  We scored in Kilmaley, Quilty and O'Callaghans Mills under measure 1.  That funding allocation means a lot to those communities.  The school communities of Coore, Doolin, Drumandoora, Labasheeda and Rineen also benefited from funding.  I compliment the Minister on allowing an appeal for the first time under the CL&Aacute;R grants last year with regard to measure 2 projects.  Two schools in County Clare, Lisdoonvarna national school and Tubber national school were successful on appeal.  They were able to draw down in the region of &euro;50,000 each.

He is right that the CL&Aacute;R programme is great.  I can target it and look at ways to deal with rural and urban disadvantage to see what can be done.  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme in light of the 2016 census figures.  Many areas may not need to be in CL&Aacute;R now, but there are many which should be in it.  I find that myself in my area, where I see areas that have moved on.  I need to look at ways to get areas in that are not in the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The Deputy is quite correct that the measures we have introduced have worked well.  I have seen the benefits of it from schemes that I went around the country to look at and that I have opened.  The community itself contributes to it.  It is a great scheme and I am delighted that I reopened it.  It works well.  I want the money we have allocated to be spent.

Some &euro;220 million of this has been allocated to the local action groups, LAGs, which deliver the programme throughout the country.  The allocation is used by the LAGs to administer the programme and to fund individual LEADER projects in their areas.  The remaining &euro;30 million in funding is available for schemes which will be administered at a national level.  This includes funding under the LEADER food initiative and funding to support local action groups that come together to deliver projects on a collaborative basis.</p>  <p>  Total expenditure to date under the LEADER programme is in excess of &euro;38 million.  Project payments, in particular, have increased significantly in the past year, as approved works are completed and project promoters submit claims for payment.  Approximately &euro;13.6 million was spent on projects since the commencement of the programme up to 14 January this year.  Over &euro;12.5 million of this amount was spent on projects in 2018 compared with just over &euro;700,000 in 2017.  This is a substantial increase in the past 12 months.  More than 1,600 projects with a grant value of almost &euro;56 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.  A further 355 projects, requesting funding in excess of &euro;22 million, are at various stages in the approval process.  The progress being made by the LAGs, together with the administrative improvements introduced by my Department, will result in a continued increase in project approvals and payments.  As a result, I am confident that all of the funding allocated to LEADER will be fully drawn down during the course of the programme.</p></speech>

We sincerely hope that every cent of the allocated money will be spent by the end of the programme.  I note from figures the Minister gave me recently that in my counties, Cavan and Monaghan, local action groups have a substantial programme and a good level of commitment.  I realise that between the end of November and the end of December there was a substantial increase in the number of applications and funding committed.  I sincerely hope that will be replicated throughout the country.  As we are in 2019 now and the programme is to end in 2020, does the Minister envisage a reallocation of some funding towards programmes and local action groups that have moved the projects forward and have been to the fore in approving projects and drawing down funding to date?  Early consideration should be given to reallocation of funding if there is a possibility that some of the overall funding programme would not be drawn down.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Calleary, the level of funding in 2018 is double the amount that was approved in 2017.  That is important.  We made many changes in the programme.  I will give a straight answer to the Deputy's specific question.  I and the Department wrote to the LAGs in October or November allowing them, in their programmes in their counties, to move 25% of the funding into another programme if one set of funding was being used very well and there was not spending on another programme.  I have allowed that to happen.  I will monitor the situation with regard to funding and spending over the next months.  Some of the companies have done very well, for example, in Carlow.  It might be asked what is going on with other counties on the list.  The same rules and regulations apply to Carlow, Kerry and Mayo.  They are all doing well, as is Deputy Smith's county.  It has to be asked why it is working in some counties and not in others.  I will monitor the situation.  For now, I have allowed LAGs to transfer money that is not being used in certain programmes to other programmes without funding and I will monitor the situation.</p><p>I want to be honest with the Deputy.  I do not want to take money from any county, but if they are not spending it, I have to do something.</p></speech>

I know that the two groups with which I am particularly familiar, Cavan and Monaghan, will ensure that the taxpayers&rsquo; funding is put to good use.  That discretion is welcome.  I am sure many colleagues in the Oireachtas would have made representations to the Minister to have the application processes streamlined.  There was some movement in that respect which helped to speed up the application process.  The Minister should have an ongoing review of the way the system is working.  There should be a dividend for the groups that have been to the fore in ensuring projects are progressed if there is money unspent elsewhere.</p></speech>

We have made approximately 32 changes regarding the programme, especially to the administration of it.  I changed many actions to make it easier with respect to applications, groups and the administration of the LEADER programme.  I want to see it working.  I want to see the money spent.  I want to see these local action groups, LAGs, delivering on the programmes.  Some counties are doing very well in that regard but others are not doing as well.  I need to monitor that.</p>  <p>  I have been told that 80% of the funding for project approvals will be approved by 2018.  Allocations can be made up to the end of 2020 and project promoters have a further three years to get the work done to draw down the funding.  I cannot do any more as the Minister responsible, and neither can the Department, to simplify this scheme.  The Deputy will be aware, as he has been very much involved in the programme down the years, that there have been difficulties in some LEADER programmes throughout the country.  There have been difficulties in the way some of them were run.  I have a responsibility to the taxpayers of this country and also to Europe which is co-funding this scheme.</p></speech>

To date, 24 projects with a combined value of &euro;966,042 have been approved by the local action group.  This amounts to approximately 19% of its project budget.  In addition, a further five projects seeking total funding of &euro;247,846 are at various stages of the approvals process.

In a previous response the Minister said that 80% of the budget will be dealt with this year nationally, but only 50% of budget for County Meath will be dealt with by May 2019.  Therefore, we are significantly behind.  The Minister said projects to the value of approximately &euro;966,000 have been approved and funding of &euro;6.9 million has been allocated.  That is very weak.  County Meath, which has very few of the official urban areas and almost the entire county qualifying under rural development, badly needs this money.  We cannot stand by while there are major delays with this funding because our expanding communities, which effectively were former villages and rural areas, badly need the types of projects that LEADER funds.  It is shocking to see the amount of money that has been spent under the LEADER programme in County Meath in recent years.  It is appalling.  Much more needs to be done to ensure that money is allocated, drawn down, spent and the facilities and community development provided for.</p></speech>

No better man than the Minister to thump the table when it is required.  This needs to happen in respect of County Meath because we need this funding more than anyone.  The drawdown of a little more than &euro;37,000 is outrageous, disgraceful and needs an explanation.  The county has a population of 196,000 people in what is a rural LEADER area and we badly need these projects.  We need much more than &euro;37,000.  The Minister would allocate &euro;37,000 for breakfast for the CL&Aacute;R programme etc.  This is not what we need.  We need substantially more.  We are entitled to more and also to greater efficiency.  Clubs seeking this money have asked me what the story is with the LEADER funding.  The story is that vast improvement is needed in respect of this funding for County Meath.  It needs vast improvement.  I urge all those responsible, including the Minister and the local companies, to get their act together as quickly as possible to ensure we can benefit from this funding to which we are entitled.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, women have died of cervical cancer.  Over the weekend, I was sad to hear of the passing of Orla Church, a campaigner and cervical cancer victim.</p><p>The CervicalCheck programme has been in place for a long time and has saved many lives, however I understand that it is now in crisis mode.  To work effectively it must work within certain parameters and timelines.  The capacity must match the volume of tests per annum.  When the scandal was exposed last year by Vickie Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and others, the Minister immediately announced that he had decided to provide free smears to every woman in the country who had concerns.  On 9 January we learned from <i>TheJournal.ie, </i>through freedom of information, that the Minister took this decision against official and expert advice, that the decision would damage the efficacy of the programme, would delay and cause backlogs and was not clinically warranted.  On average, CervicalCheck tests about 230,000 smears annually.  The Minister's decision last April added an extra 90,000 to 100,000 to that volume.  The Minister was warned repeatedly over a long period that this was wrong yet he proceeded without any additional resources being provided.  The additional volume of tests as a result of the decision has created an unacceptable and enormous backlogs and women have been waiting for up to six months for the results of their tests.</p><p>There is a further problem.  I understand that the delay has impacted on the quality and efficacy of the tests and has rendered a significant number invalid.  There are two elements to the test.  Cells are put on the slide and there is also viral loading which, in the detection of low-grade cell abnormalities, indicate whether colposcopy or further referral is required.  Because of the backlog and time delays this part of the test in many cases, I understand, has been rendered invalid, null and void.  Normally they would be done within ten days but because of the Minister's decision the resulting backlog has compromised the quality and efficacy of the tests.</p><p>This has serious and obvious consequences.  I asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, a specific question on this issue on 15 January.  I asked for the rationale of announcing the repeat cervical smears against expert advice and why he did not make that public at the time.  He avoided answering that part of the question and I have officially complained about this under Standing Orders.  The Minister has withheld information from the D&aacute;il and the public on developments in the CervicalCheck programme that are clearly in the public interest.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this development and the serious implications that arise from it?  Was he informed by the Minister?  Why did the Minister ignore expert advice and why did it take until December to discontinue the free smear tests?  Why again the secrecy and the withholding of information?</p></speech>

I was filled with sorrow over the weekend when I heard of her untimely passing.  I also pay tribute to her and thank her for her contribution to helping the health service to update its guidelines for GPs and others in relation to cervical screening.  I recognise that it was a very important contribution which will help women in future.</p>  <p>  I have always said, as have others, that we want some good to come from this terrible tragedy and the controversy around CervicalCheck.  Some good has come from it.  The Scally report was undertaken and is being implemented.  We put in a package of supports for the women affected by the audit including medical cards, experimental medicines and other supports.  We have taken the decision to extend the HPV vaccine to boys this year and to introduce a new, more modern smear test - one of the first countries to do so - which is more accurate.  That will be done this year.  Important progress is being made.</p>  <p>  We all know that cervical screening works.  It has helped reduce the instance of cervical cancer in Ireland in recent years and has reduced the number of deaths.  I am pleased that, notwithstanding the controversy around CervicalCheck, that women are still attending for smears and the programme is still working well.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Martin said, in May the Minister for Health decided to offer free out-of-cycle smear tests to any woman who was concerned about her health and about the accuracy of previous smear tests in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme.  The Minister made the decision in good faith to answer the considerable fears and anxieties of many women in Ireland who were worried that their recent smear tests may have been misread or inaccurate.  In the months after that, there was a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests.  This not only included the women attending for the out-of-cycle tests but an increased uptake in testing in general by women.  That increased demand put immense pressure on laboratory capacity.  The HSE has worked actively with the laboratories to manage this and to improve turnaround times for smear tests.  The HSE tells us that the laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, to provide overtime and to manage annual leave in an effort to minimise and reduce the backlog.  In addition, the HSE is trying to source additional screening and laboratory capacity which would improve turnaround times for results.  The HSE advises us that sourcing capacity and resources is a serious challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening to the new test, there is a shortage of capacity, not only in Ireland but also internationally.  However, they are undertaking to provide that additional capacity and get on top of the backlog.  Now that the out-of-cycle free smear tests have stopped, we expect that it will be possible to reduce the backlog over the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Normally, the virus would be tested for within ten days, yet people are facing six-month delays.  This was discovered last year but not revealed by the Minister or anyone.  In essence, that information has been withheld.  That is why the service was discontinued.  The Minister's decision went against expert advice that warned him repeatedly that this would damage the entire programme.  It is my understanding and information that the programme is in jeopardy because of this and that further significant decisions and communications will have to occur.</p> <p> I asked the Taoiseach whether he had been made aware of this by the Minister.

Those free tests ceased to be available at the end of December last year.</p>  <p>  I was made aware of a backlog a few weeks ago.  The Minister informed me a few weeks ago-----</p></speech>

What is most worrying is that, despite the fact that this overrun is set to blow a hole in the capital budget for years to come, no one seems willing to take responsibility for it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, whose function is to supervise Government procurement and public expenditure, has gone into hiding.  Its Secretary General has refused to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to account for the Department's role in this process.</p>  <p>  On "The Week in Politics" at the weekend, the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Teachta Kyne, said that the position of the Secretary General was not sustainable.  He was right.  He offered up the view that the Comptroller and Auditor General could review the spiralling cost of the children's hospital.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed that suggestion and were hopeful that such an investigation would be forthcoming, but lo and behold, a few hours after the suggestion was made, it was rebuffed by a Government spokesperson.  It would seem that the Minister of State either misspoke or was slapped down.  Which was it?</p>  <p>  There are serious issues to be examined.  The original tender from BAM was &euro;131 million lower than the next bid.  Did anyone in government raise questions as to how the accepted tender could be delivered when others were indicating clearly that it would cost over &euro;100 million more to deliver?  Surely the Taoiseach will agree when I suggest that someone or a group of people have messed up seriously.  Will he now act without hesitation and agree to a full public investigation into what has happened and who is responsible?  This is serious stuff.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to capital spending of &euro;3 billion over the next four years.  An overrun of more than &euro;450 million will reduce that amount by up to 15% and will stop projects that have been provided for going ahead.  That is the reality.  There is significant concern in communities across the State about how the overspend will impact on them and on commitments made to fund badly needed projects.  For example, what of the commitment for a new MRI scanner at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar?  What about the second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford?  What about the Drimnagh primary care centre?  I could go on.</p>  <p>  What projects will be cut because of this scandalous cost overrun?  People want an answer to that question.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether he agrees with the Minister of State that the position of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not sustainable and that he should make himself available to answer questions?</p></speech>

It requires a reprofiling of the budget of somewhere between 1% and 2%, half of that coming from the Department of Health and the other half coming from other Departments.  Where there are overruns in expenditure, there are consequences, but it is not true to say that any project will be stopped or cut or cancelled.  Some may well be deferred.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the children's hospital, I really think we need to understand the value of this project as well as the cost.

God knows, people have waited long enough for it, but that is not the source of my questions.  I am questioning the efficacy and effectiveness of the procurement procedures of the State.  The Taoiseach should bear in mind that in the term of office of the previous Government his party made a virtue of the fact that it had overhauled procurement procedures to avoid precisely this type of scenario of cost inflation and potential wastage of expenditure by the State.  It is for that reason that Mr. Watt needs to present himself to the Joint Committee on Health.  I am well aware that Mr. Breslin is the Accounting Officer for the Department of Health, but I am with Deputy Kyne, the Government Chief Whip.  I do not believe Mr. Watt's position is sustainable and see no good reason he should not present himself to the Joint Committee on Health.  A review by PwC is all well and good, but it is not in government and running Departments.  Where we need accountability for this cock up is among people in government and the senior civil servants who advise, guide and implement Government decisions.  The Taoiseach is dancing on the head of a pin in saying matters are simply being deferred in respect of other spending.  Neither people living in Waterford who are waiting for a second catheterisation laboratory, nor people living in the midlands or Drimnagh will welcome or feel in any way reassured by the Taoiseach's distinction between a cut and a deferral.  Will he confirm for the House that he will make available a full and comprehensive list of deferred and re-profiled projects in order that people can make a decision for themselves?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, in the procurement process for any project there are a number of steps along the way.  A project must have planning permission; it must then to go to tender and be built.  We may find other projects have been delayed for reasons beyond our control.  For example, sometimes a project will not receive planning permission, which in itself creates a saving.  When we have the list, we will provide it.  However, I can assure the Deputy that none of these projects has been cancelled and stopped.  The report on the inquiry being carried out by PwC will be made available.  The Deputy correctly states PwC is not in government.  It is also not in opposition, which means that it will be objective and not political in coming to the facts.  When we come to the facts, the report will be furnished to the Government and then published.  People can take it from there.</p></speech>

On the surface, that sounds reasonable enough.  The problem is the commission does not deal with the issue of the time it has already had.  It was set up to do a job in three years, but what we have after its four years of work is four interim reports, in the first of which it looked for a time extension.  In the second it told us why it had asked for a time extension in the first report.  Incidentally, its publication was delayed for eight months by the Minister because it also stated Bethany Home survivors should never have been excluded from the redress scheme, which issue has still not been addressed.  In the third interim report which devastated the survivor community, the commission looked for an extra year just before it should have concluded.  Now, at the eleventh hour, in another report it is looking for another year.  Is this a joke?  Do Members honestly think it is acceptable that we should wring our hands for a little while, offer a bit of sympathy to the survivors and then move on to the next issue?  I am not blaming the Taoiseach for this, but he is the one in power who could sort it out.  We need to know why the commission has not completed its work and who will be held to account?</p>  <p>  The report talks about there being a considerable workload to cross-reference documents.  It also talks about delays in obtaining evidence from the authorities which ran the institutions which could not be examined until the commission had finished the examination of the documents.  Why has this not been done?  Is it a question of resources?  If so, why did it not flag it before now?  If it is a question of non-co-operation, why did it not highlight it before now?  Why did it only receive the first tranche of documents over two years after it had been set up?  Did it not ask for them?  Was it obstructed in getting them?  Why did a commission set up by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and reliant on information from that Department and the Department of Health, in its words, to produce a "comprehensive" and "accurate" report only receive information recently, a year after its business should have been concluded?</p>  <p>  The commission talks about being dismayed that so little information had been kept by the HSE.  It finds it difficult to understand how relatively recent documents are not available.  It does not understand why the HSE does not have any system for archiving material.  Does the Taoiseach understand it?  What has he done about it?  Let us remember this is the same HSE which two years before in 2012 had produced a report on the 500 baby deaths at Bessborough.  It beggars belief.  These are fundamental issues, but there are so many more.  How come the commission can come in within budget?  How come it is not costing any more money in continuing for two extra years?  Will it not pay for remaining an extra two years in its Baggot Street offices?  Will it not pay salaries?  Did we get it wrong the first time?  These are fundamental questions, but there are so many more.  The only conclusion one can draw is either the commission is grossly incompetent or it is being deliberately misled.  My question to the Taoiseach is which is it.  Is allowing the commission to continue without scrutinising these matter in the interests of the people whom on Monday the Taoiseach so accurately and articulately stated had been betrayed by the State?</p></speech>

None of us believed at the time that it would take as long as it has for the commission to do its work and issue its report.  The commission is independent.  The whole point in having a commission of investigation is that it is independent of government.  It is not a creature of government.  Therefore, I cannot answer questions on its behalf.  If I was able to interfere in the work of a commission and answer questions on its behalf, it would not be independent and would defeat the purpose in having such a commission of investigation.</p>  <p>  The commission has informed us that it has more work to do.  So far it has interviewed 519 former residents.  It wants to interview more and everyone to have his or her opportunity to be interviewed and his or her story heard.  It has received new material which needs to be considered and a mass of documents - I am informed over 100,000 documents - all of which need to be considered properly.  It tells us that it has adequate resources and that, notwithstanding the delay, will come in on budget.  It has not requested additional resources, but should a such request be brought forward, it will be considered.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that we must wait another year before anything happens.  We will receive a comprehensive report on the burials.  It is scheduled to be presented in March.  It will give us more information on the burial grounds.</p>  <p>  We have already taken a decision as a Government, a few months ago, that investigations will be carried out at Tuam, with a view to identifying, if possible, the remains of some of the children buried there to give them the appropriate burial they should have had when they died.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, working through the consultative forum, is drawing up proposals for how we might do something to assist and support the health and well-being of former residents while we await the final report.</p></speech>

How does he know that the commission will carry out its work now?  He has referred to other interviews that need to take place and extra documentation received.  Does he not know that the report published yesterday referred to the interviews being concluded this month?  Can he tell me if they have been concluded?  The commission stated it had been expecting 277 files to be delivered in December.  Were they delivered?  Does the Taoiseach know?  If he does not, why does he not?  I do not expect him to be on top of every detail, but there is a considerable problem in this House where we set up commissions of investigation in response to appalling scandals and horrific abuses perpetuated on people in that we let them carry on and ask for extra time.  The Taoiseach does not pose or answer any of the valid questions I have raised about the reasons for the delay.  It is not acceptable.  It is a feature of Irish political life, for the Opposition and the media, that nobody follows them through.</p><p>Last May, the Taoiseach told me that in response to the CervicalCheck scandal and the lack of action on mandatory disclosure the Government would progress and implement a patient safety Bill.  That was not seen through and has been forgotten.  In response to the Grace scandal, the Government set up the Farrelly commission.  Everybody forgot about it and the time to finalise its report has been extended.  The Government must see these issues through.  I ask the Taoiseach to answer the questions he was asked about why this commission has not done the job it was supposed to do.  Is it being obstructed or is it just incompetent?  There is no other explanation, although the Taoiseach may invent one.</p></speech>

According to census figures, there are 195,263 carers, of whom 118,000 are women and 3,800 are under the age of 15.  They provide 6,608,515 care hours each week.  Women provide more than two thirds of the care and young carers under the age of 15 provide 2.2 million care hours each year.  They provide 24-hour care for some of our most vulnerable people and save the State billions of euro each year.  The most recent figure of which I am aware indicates an annual saving of approximately &euro;4 billion.  They provide care for thousands of people in their own homes, keeping them out of nursing homes and freeing up thousands of hospital beds.  I dread to think what our health and hospital services would be like without these carers.  The current health crisis would become absolute mayhem without them.</p>  <p>  However, carers receive very little financial or other support in return.  If they successfully overcome the massive 17-week delay in processing carer's allowance applications, they will receive the princely sum of &euro;1.20 per hour on the full rate or &euro;0.60 per hour on the half rate.  There is little or no respite care available to give carers a break.  Many have health problems arising from their caring duties.  Carers may be housebound due to lack of support, suffer from exhaustion or experience emotional and mental health difficulties.  The 17-week wait for decisions on carer's allowance applications is unacceptable.  Some 40% of applications are refused but, following a wait of up to 12 months for the review and appeal of applications, more than 60% of the appeals and reviews are granted.  </p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach agree to resource and staff the carer's allowance section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to enable it to issue a decision on these applications within a reasonable time limit such as six weeks?  Will the Government increase the carer's allowance payment in line with the minimum wage and ensure that respite care is available to support the health and welfare needs of carers?</p></speech>

As a Government, we are determined to support them.  Those are not just words, as we have demonstrated in the past couple of years.</p>  <p>  We fully restored the carer support grant which was cut by another Government some years ago.  The carer's allowance and carer's benefit will increase in late March to a level higher than that in place before the financial crisis.  Last year, we extended free GP care to those in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit because carers also need to be cared for.  When I was Minister for Social Protection, I brought in a 12-week rule whereby carers continue to receive carer's allowance or carer's benefit for three months after ceasing to be a carer, such as when their loved one passes away or goes into a nursing home, for example, in order to give them time to get back on their feet, readjust and find a new life for themselves.  I am very proud to have been part of making some of those changes.  Carers are allowed to work part time because some carers who we support financially are not full-time carers and are able to undertake part-time work.  The means test is among the most generous internationally and carers are allowed to earn additional income on top of the carer's payments, which are among the highest in the world.</p>  <p>  Crucially, last year and this year respite services were and are being extended because carers need time off.  The best way we can support them in that regard is to ensure that more respite is available for those for whom they care.  That is why an additional respite house is being established in every community care area in the country, a process that is very much driven by the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has apologised already for the delays in processing applications.  Work is being done to improve the situation and allocate more staff to the section to ensure that applications are processed far more quickly than is currently the case.  The applications are not always straightforward.  The process differs from other applications because in addition to a means test, a medical report to verify that the person being cared for needs full-time or close to full-time care is required.  That is one of the reasons why they take somewhat longer to process than other applications.  However, we accept that the processing times are too long and are resourcing the section and changing procedures to speed them up.  Of course, as is the case with many social welfare allowances and benefits, arrears are paid once eligibility has been determined.</p></speech>

If he were to telephone the carer's allowance section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, he would be told that the current waiting period is 17 weeks.  That is worse than was the case six months ago.  In June of last year we were told that the waiting period was 15 weeks, which was also unacceptable.  However, the situation has worsened.  I and many other Deputies are aware of cases in which those being cared for passed away during the application process.</p>  <p>  An urgent and comprehensive review of how we deal with the caring situation, including the role of and support for carers, is needed.  One thing the Taoiseach could do today would be to fully resource and staff the carer's allowance section of the Department to ensure a reasonable turnaround time of no more than six weeks for applications.  Carers are waiting for that to be done.  This is a very significant issue which the Taoiseach and the Government should address immediately.</p></speech>

However, the vast majority of applicants do not wait that long.  Some 70% of carer's allowance applications and 90% of carer's benefit applications are decided in less than 12 weeks.  However, I fully appreciate that the delay can be very distressing for the 30% and 10% of applicants who must wait more than 12 weeks.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, is working on the issue and I have discussed it with her.  I will ask her to furnish the Deputy with more detail on the actions being taken by the Department to reduce the waiting times.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach indicate how many women will have to have tests repeated?  Could he indicate when the women concerned will be contacted by the Department and CervicalCheck?  One should bear in mind that the programme covers 230,000 annually and that there are to be 90,000 to 100,000 extra because of the Minister's decision.  There is no extra capacity and there are no extra resources.  I understand quite a significant number of tests are null and void because of the delay.  The backlog is resulting in a delay of six months.  The programme is in crisis mode.  I asked the Taoiseach a number of questions.  They call for an up-front, comprehensive statement from the Minister for Health.  In the public interest, he owes it to this House to appear before it to make a comprehensive statement on this issue.  I ask the Taoiseach to allow for this.</p></speech>

The Government sits on its hands.  Last April, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a motion to the D&aacute;il that was agreed unanimously but the Government has refused to implement its recommendations.  It called on the Government to work with unions to draw up a roadmap for full pay equality, with an implementation plan to deliver pay equality within a short timeframe, not the eight years the Government had in mind.  Despite this, at the eleventh hour letters are being sent informing patients of cancelled surgeries.  It is clear that the Government has failed comprehensively to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis.  It refuses to accept pay is an issue and that this needs to be resolved.  I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health to appear before the D&aacute;il to explain to its Members, who voted last April and set out a series of reasonable, thoughtful steps that the Government might take, why he has ignored the motion agreed by the D&aacute;il and allowed this situation to escalate to the point of industrial action, which we are facing.</p></speech>

I will deal with each of the Deputy's contentions in turn.  Her first was that the Government has sat on its hands regarding this issue.  She will be aware that we had a commitment under the current pay agreement to put in place the Public Service Pay Commission.  We honoured that commitment.  There was a commitment that this issue would be the first that the commission would examine.  That is what happened.  The commission then issued a recommendation, which the Government accepted immediately, in the next few days.  We made a specific commitment in our budget to honour those commitments.  Since then, extensive engagement has taken place between the HSE and the representatives of the nurses.  The matter is now very likely to be referred for further engagement in our industrial relations machinery and the Government will play its full role in this process.  We have to be conscious, however, of all the other public servants, the tens of thousands of others, to whom we have also made commitments.  We have a duty to them just as we have a duty to seek to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's final point was on the effort we made to deal with new entrant pay and determine how the matter could be dealt with.  We put in place a comprehensive plan in this regard that was accepted by the leadership of many of the key unions.  We are now engaging actively with them to determine whether there are ways in which this issue can now be resolved.</p></speech>

It is just as well because the Taoiseach has obviously had to leave.  In the context of budget 2019, one of the tax measures that was not provided for in legislation but that seems to have been sneaked in was a 23% rise in the price of food supplements, which is to come into effect on 1 March.  This was not done by way of legislative change, whereby Deputies of this House would have been able to deal with it in the Finance Bill.  It was done by way of reinterpretation by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The practice of zero-rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil supplements has applied since 1972.  This is a very significant issue.  There are hundreds of thousands of people across the country dependent on taking vitamins as part of their health regime.  Such a fundamental change deserves much better consideration than has occurred.  Will the Minister for Finance agree to halt the increase and engage with the stakeholders to determine whether some compromise can be arrived at?</p></speech>

It is one that I am now aware of.  As the Deputy fairly acknowledged, this is not an issue that was dealt with in the Finance Bill, nor was it legislated for in the House.  It concerns an interpretation of our tax code by the Revenue Commissioners which, as everyone knows, are independent of direction from me.  I had been aiming to deal with the matter through the tax advisory group, which publishes papers on topics such as this each summer that allow the Government and stakeholders to explore options to determine how issues can be dealt with.  In the case in question, the Revenue Commissioners have now made a decision on the interpretation of the law.  I have to accept its right to do so and the consequences of that.  In answer to the Deputy's question on whether we will engage with stakeholders on the matter to determine how it can be dealt with, we will do so but I am bound, as Minister for Finance, to abide by the interpretation of the Revenue Commissioners, which I will do.</p></speech>

It is an important and modest Bill.  I want to ask about an issue related to it but that is not covered by it, namely the arms trade between Ireland and Israel in the context of human rights commitments given by the Government in the programme for Government.

In particular, we have an interest in the huge overruns in building the national children's hospital.  Mr. Watt's Department is responsible for public procurement.

The climate forum held last Friday at Croke Park was very welcome, until the moment everyone present realised that while the Government was stating it wanted to be a champion of dealing with climate change, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment had just issued another frontier oil exploration licence in distant Atlantic waters.  The Government cannot do this while in the same breath stating it is a champion of dealing with climate change.  Yesterday, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we had yet another debate on Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's climate emergency Bill.  The Government is using amazing Kafkaesque techniques to put the Bill in limbo.  There is the amazingly weird technocratic issue of whether there is a report of the committee.  Because of the inability to decide, the the Bill is going nowhere, which is a disgraceful abuse of the power of the Parliament to manage legislation.  One of the ways to unlock the issue, apart from getting into an incredibly legally dense row about the powers of Parliament, is for the Minister to allow a debate on the fundamental issue of climate change.  Are we with the global environmental community in stating we must keep fossil fuels in the ground or will we keep playing on both sides and be hypocritical in what we are doing?</p></speech>

On the wider issue of Deputy Smith's Bill, it is not one I support.  The reality is that in any transition to a carbon neutral environment Ireland will have a high dependence on gas.  Until the discovery of the Corrib gasfield, we were 90% to 95% dependent on imported gas to support our needs.  As a result of the discovery of the Corrib gasfield, this figure has dropped to one third.  I must be mindful of the need for energy security in the path to decarbonising the energy environment.  I recognise why Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has brought forward the Bill, but I do not believe it is consistent in following the path we need to follow.  I am wholly committed to achieving the decarbonisation of the economy along the lines we have committed to following.</p></speech>

I am sorry the Minister for Health is not present as there are five Ministers in his Department.  If the number who die by suicide were killed on the roads, the roads would be ploughed up and grass seeds spread all over them such that people would have to travel through fields.  What I am asking for is proper one to one personal treatment for those who go to doctors or emergency departments and proper facilities.</p></speech>

They were schoolgoing and the number excludes 17 and 18 year olds who should have been in school.  If, tomorrow, 70 children were to die when a school bus overturned on the M8, it would be mentioned in every newspaper.  When I see nodding heads here, I become angrier and angrier and I am sure it can be heard in my voice.   The days for talking are over.  We have to start to take people's lives seriously.  The people who have been left behind have been torn asunder.  There are no excuses for it.  It affects people in schools and sports clubs.  It is across the board.  I appeal to the Government, for Christ's sake, let us get real and listen to the people affected.  We speak about the health service and overspends.  Who will staff the services?

Over Christmas and new year period hundreds of people vented their fury to me at how the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, had been allowed by the Government, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, to freely inflict almost complete lack of movement in rural Ireland without any rural-proofing of the effects it could have, or an examination of how a proper transport service could be put in place to counter such a mess that could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs in the pub and tourism industries and to allow hard-working people to come and go on a night out, something now they cannot do.</p><p>Thousands of young drivers are now not allowed to drive unless accompanied by the holder of a full licence.  That is another piece of work by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, without any measures set in place.  Young people in west Cork are waiting six months for driving tests.

The ministerial management board met yesterday in the Department.  Rural transport issues were again to the fore.  Many issues were discussed, such as the extension of the Nitelink bus service.  That is a recent decision.  The Department is also exploring how we can best serve rural communities further with alternative and newer types of rural transport.  These matters are under consideration in the Department.</p>  <p>  It is important that information is available for people awaiting driving tests and who need a driving licence for work or for college.  I advise Deputy Collins, or any other Deputy approached by members of the public seeking a test, to contact the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  There are numerous cancellations every week and there are vacancies.  If somebody needs a test at short notice, that avenue exists.  The rationale behind the legislation on unaccompanied drivers was that, statistically, such drivers were far more likely to be involved in a fatal accident and the cause of that accident.</p></speech>

I raise the situation in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9 covering Dublin north city and county.  I refer to the early intervention team, early intervention services and access to multidisciplinary teams provided by Beechpark Services and St. Michael's House.  There is a waiting time of 27 months for these services, which involve children seeing psychologists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, paediatricians, social workers, educationalists etc.</p>  <p>  There are complex problems in that part of the city.  There is also an increase in the number of children and a resultant increase in the numbers presenting, as well as those presenting with complex needs.  Parents are at their wits' end.  In some cases, children are receiving no services at all.  I refer to children with autism and other forms of intellectual disability.

The examinations are a stepping stone to college placements for many students.  One young student, Ms Rhona Butler, who is no relation although I know the family, was in the middle of her examinations during the summer when, unfortunately, her 50 year old mother, Margaret, died of cancer.  Ms Butler had to sit her leaving certificate business exam 12 hours after her mother passed away.  I am sure this is not an isolated incident and it happens throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am calling for a reasonable accommodation scheme for students who find themselves in this position.  If Ms Butler had not sat her examination that morning, she would have had to wait for another 12 months.  Examinations are stressful enough, but losing a parent during the examination makes it even more difficult.  Some form of bereavement process must be put in place.  A student who loses a parent during the examination process should have the opportunity to resit the examination two to four weeks later at some examination centre in the country.</p></speech>

It is also stated that to remedy this situation for the next 25 years is to guarantee the delivery of next generation broadband in every household and business.  We all know that is not happening.  That is a major issue in my own county and in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway.  We have heard announcement after announcement and yet nothing has happened.  When can we expect an announcement on the roll-out of the national broadband scheme?  I ask that because it is so important for many towns in my constituency.  Very progressive work is being done by community groups but they are being held back because we cannot deliver broadband.  It is essential that we do that.

However, 23% of our community can only get access through a national broadband initiative, which is a non-commercial initiative supported by the State.</p> <p> A submission of a final tender was made in September.  However, because of the nature of the development of that tender, there is considerable due process to be undertaken to make sure that I can bring this forward to the Government.

Families and communities throughout the country have been visited by heartbreak and tragedy because of mental health issues and County Meath is no different in that respect.  Before Christmas we witnessed tragedy when seven men died by suicide within ten days, leaving communities in Kildalkey, Athboy, Trim, Kells and Duleek in shock and grief over the period.  As a society we need to start asking ourselves really serious questions about what is happening.</p><p>In many cases mental health issues are very difficult to resolve and it is not necessarily in our gift within the Chamber to do so.  Nevertheless, some issues can be tackled by us.  As a state, we need to ensure we tackle the socio-economic reasons which lead to some people suffering from mental health issues and believing suicide is the only answer.  We can affect the way the health service treats and supports people suffering from mental health problems.  Every county has a reason to complain, but County Meath is at the bottom of the ladder when it comes to the provision of resources.</p><p>I discovered recently that before Christmas there were 32 staff vacancies in the mental health service in counties Louth and Meath.  The chief officer of the community healthcare organisation, CHO, for counties Louth and Meath confirmed to me that the 32 vacancies were in a range of grades, including that of psychiatric nurse.  It is an inordinately high number and extremely worrying that there is such a gap in the provision of key medical professionals in such an area of crisis.  Last summer we found out that the child and adolescent mental health teams in counties Louth and Meath had just over half the staff they needed to fulfil their duties.  In the midlands and counties Louth and Meath there are over 50 children waiting for over a year for their first appointment.  The Minister of State must understand mental health matters are urgent and that those involved require support and treatment fast to ensure things will not deteriorate.  This figure is the second highest in the State and has grown significantly in the past three years.  This is not something the Government has inherited but rather a problem that has been created by its lack of ability, inaction and funding.</p><p>This is unacceptable and County Meath is an outlier of how bad things are in the country.  Ireland is an outlier when it comes to how bad things are with respect to teenage suicides in the European Union.  Ireland has the fourth highest rate.  In September the HSE confirmed to me that the spend on mental health services in counties Louth and Meath was the second lowest <i>per capita</i>in the State, at &euro;121.67.  It is not hard to join the dots - when we invest so little and employ so few staff in an area, there will be high rates of suicide because of mental health problems.  Every community has been affected by teenage suicide, but it is clear that the Government is either not equipped, unable or not sufficiently motivated to tackle the problem.  Again, County Meath is at the bottom of the resources list.  We need to ensure radical investment of resources and energy by the Government in order that it can start to tackle this problem in counties such as Meath.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important and serious matter.</p>  <p>  In the recent budget an additional &euro;55 million was provided to progress new developments in mental health services this year.  It brings overall Health Service Executive, HSE, mental health service funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019.  This, in turn, will allow for continued improvements in all aspects of mental health care across the nine HSE community healthcare organisations, including CHO 8 which incorporates County Meath.  Louth and Meath mental health services continue to strive to improve the level and quality of service being delivered and the environs in which it is delivered.  The service supports clients in their recovery and rehabilitation as close to their home and community as possible.  All of this is being done within the resources available.  Referral to community psychiatric services is through general practitioners.</p>  <p>  There is a range of care options provided by the mental health service for the population of County Meath.  Acute inpatient beds for counties Louth and Meath are located in the department of psychiatry at Crosslanes in Drogheda.  Referral for assessment is either through a GP or an emergency department.  With regard tp community adult outpatient services, three teams are based in An T&aacute;in and cover Navan, Kells and Trim, and one is in Ashbourne.  The psychiatric day hospital service covers Navan hospital and Ashbourne primary care centre.  Examples of services provided from the day hospital include stress management, cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy, alcohol counselling and a Clozaril clinic.  Therapeutic interventions in line with national clinical care programmes are also being delivered, including, for example, for first episode psychosis and eating disorders.  A first episode psychosis team is being established.</p>  <p>  The day hospital provides an enhanced package of care for clients in the community, all of which is in line with A Vision for Change.  A community high support residence is based at R&aacute;th na Riogh, Leighsbrook Lane, Navan.  There is an assertive outreach team for County Meath which provides continuing support for clients in their own community.  The team is moving to a seven-day service.  In addition, a home-based treatment team provides support for acutely unwell patients in their own home.  Other services available to the population of County Meath include the psychiatry of old age team based on Kennedy Road, Navan, while there is an advanced technology room for persons with dementia.  The child and adolescent mental health service is located in Hazel House, Navan and Trim primary care centre.</p>  <p>  The recently agreed HSE service plan for 2019 outlines the priorities and actions to enhance mental health care nationally this year.  This relates also to CHO 8 and County Meath and encompasses a range of services covering acute or community-based child and adolescent mental health services, general adult services and psychiatry of late life.  The service plan also acknowledges widely accepted challenges in developing services, including increasing demands and difficulties in staff recruitment and retention, but the objective for the Minister and the HSE is to deliver overall service improvements this year.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change is really important, but if we do not have the funds we meed for change, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.  In County Meath we have three Ministers or Ministers of State in various guises, as well as two Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, but we are not getting the funding we need.  County Meath remains an outlier because of the number of vacancies in critical health care service grades.  It is also an outlier because of the lack of funding.</p><p>Does the Minister of State not agree that it is really hard for these healthcare professionals to function and carry out their job regarding the level of need they face if they do not have the adequate resources to do so?  Given the current state of the economy, the State has an opportunity to intervene in so many individuals' lives, to bring people back to good mental health and to ensure they do not end up thinking that suicide is some kind of solution to their situation.  However, we can only do this if we have feet on the ground and the funds available for them to do their job.  Despite the rhetoric we hear year after year, the figures are getting worse.  I looked at the figures recently.  The rate of self-harm in 2016 was 10% higher than it was in 2007, the year before the economic recession.  The rate was highest among the young.  One third of children's mental health beds in the country are closed at present due to staff shortages in child and adolescent mental health units.  There are vacancies for psychiatric nurses while 52 children have been waiting more than a year for an assessment for child and adolescent mental health services.  If we must tell a child not to come near us for 12 months before we will even talk to him or her regarding mental health services, we are failing those children radically.  </p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State has met him in the past regarding this issue.  In addition, within the past few days, the Minister of State's office has been in touch about arranging another meeting with the Deputy in the near future.  If the Deputy needs to bring all relevant local representatives to that meeting, that would be fine.  This meeting would review mental health services in Meath.  As the Minister of State asked me to tell the Deputy that this meeting will take place as quickly as possible, perhaps the Deputy could contact the Minister of State's office.  The Minister of State continually liaises with the HSE to monitor all aspects of mental healthcare, including implementing new initiatives agreed under the executive's service plan.  The recent budget provided an extra &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health, which adds up to exceptional funding in 2019 at just over &euro;1 billion.  The construction of the national forensic mental health complex in Portrane is progressing with the facility due to open in 2020.  All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE to reduce waiting lists, although I know there are difficulties.  The Deputy's points are well made and well taken.  I met the Minister of State yesterday to discuss them and he told me that he would be glad to meet the Deputy and representatives, that is, whoever represents the mental health community in that area.  That meeting will take place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This opportunity has presented itself to Waterford through the hard work and efforts of Waterford City and County Council under the leadership of its CEO, Michael Walsh.  The proposed investment in Waterford city by the Alhokair Group from Saudi Arabia has provided a much-needed confidence boost for the city and indeed the whole south east.  The proposed development at a cost of &euro;350 million will be a game changer for Waterford.  The south east needs a regional city of consequence and that city must be Waterford.  Waterford must be enabled for propulsive growth.  For regions to be strong, they need a strong city.</p>  <p>  However, this project is so much more.  It has the additional potential to place an emphasis on additional permanent services such as healthcare, education, and transport.  The economic benefits will be significant.  The proposed development will happen on approximately 17 acres of substantial and spectacular river frontage.  The proposal includes development of a total of 60,000 sq. m to include retail units, leisure and office space, 200 apartments and a relocated train station, which will result in an integrated transport hub.  This will have the effect of providing a sustainable transport corridor and improving access from north to south by creating a pedestrian bridge linking the north quays to the south quays and the remainder of the city centre.  This development will act as a catalyst for other developments like the Ard R&iacute; Hotel and the Michael Street shopping centre.  The north quays development will provide an increase of 50% in Waterford's retail offering.  It is envisaged that 2,300 direct jobs will be created on completion of the project.  </p>  <p>  Under the national planning framework, Waterford metropolitan area has been designated for population growth of up to 30,000.  If Waterford is to realise this aspiration, there is no doubt that the development of the north quays is crucial.  In 2017, Waterford City and County Council applied for funding of &euro;20.1 million from the urban regeneration and development fund for the first phase of this development.  It received &euro;6 million, which is well short of what is required.  This is incredibly disappointing.  The Government hyped up its support for this project consistently and now the city community has once again been left short-changed by this Government.  The Government must accept that life exists outside of the M50.  Waterford can and must act as a release valve for the pressure that is building in the capital.  The city and county council has done an amazing job in getting the project to the current stage with the support of politicians, Waterford Chamber of Commerce, the Alhokair Group and other stakeholders.  We now need to see how seriously the Government views promoting regional economic development.  What we need to see now is certainty and indeed commitment by the Government to progress this invaluable project.  The key words here are certainty, commitment and a timeframe to progress this project.  Certainty to enter into contracts is required relatively soon.  The investors are committed, as are the local authority and the people of Waterford city and county.  Now we need the absolute commitment from Government.  At a time of economic growth and balanced budgets, commitment is needed from Government.  </p></speech>

It gives me an opportunity to discuss the north quays project in Waterford and, in particular, Waterford City and County Council's successful bid for funding for the north quays under the urban regeneration and development fund.  It is a project with which I am very familiar having met many of the stakeholders involved in it on a few occasions over the past couple of years.  It is a very worthy project that has been outlined quite well by the Deputy.  It is an essential part of the region, not just Waterford city and county.  In Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, we recognise the importance of having regional bases like Waterford to serve regions and help them grow.  In Project Ireland 2040, we are taking a long-term view about how we plan the shifting of population growth in the future away from the east coast and Dublin and build up other cities in order that they can compete nationally and over time, have an international footing.  The chief executive officer of Waterford City and County Council, Michael Walsh, has done a great job in working with everybody to make this happen and put it on the map.  We all know it will take time for it to roll out but great work is being done that is being led by the local authority, which is the way development should happen.  Again, it had the co-operation of various Departments over the years.</p>  <p>  The north quays in Waterford were the subject of a strategic development zone, SDZ, order made by Government in 2016 recognising the social and economic importance of this flagship "brownfield" site to the State and designating the Waterford north quays for mixed-use development subject to preparation of an SDZ planning scheme, which has been done.  I met Senator Coffey a couple of times.  It was a very important issue when he was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment.  It was important that this designation was made thus enabling all the plans for the future.  </p>  <p>  The national planning framework, NPF, launched early in 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040 includes objectives to achieve both more compact urban growth within Ireland's cities and the significant further development of Waterford city.  Further to the NPF, a ten-year urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, worth &euro;2 billion to 2027 was established with &euro;550 million of committed Exchequer grant funding available to 2022.  </p><p>Bids were invited from public bodies throughout Ireland for funding under the URDF.  Waterford City and County Council submitted a bid for &euro;104.5 million of grant funding in September 2018, seeking a sum of &euro;20 million for 2019.  The Waterford north quays bid was made as a category A proposal, on the basis of development being ready to go in 2019 and to continue in the years immediately thereafter.  It was well recognised that Waterford, as a city, was well prepared for funds like this but I also want to point out that it was moving these plans on before any fund was established.  That is key.  It was not the case that it needed a fund to make this happen; it was getting on with the plans and making this happen.  It had big visions.  I give my thanks to all involved including the investors who also put great work into making this happen.</p> <p> In November 2018 my Department announced an initial tranche of &euro;100 million which was awarded to a total of 88 projects throughout Ireland for 2019.  The Waterford north quays project was awarded &euro;6 million for 2019, which is the single largest award made to any bid under the URDF.  In comparison, awards made in respect of multiple bid proposals from each of the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway resulted in awards of &euro;6 million to &euro;7 million to each city for a combined total of 24 projects in 2019.  Later in the first quarter of this year, there will be a further call for URDF bids for funding in 2020.  This URDF grant to Waterford, as with all other successful bid proposals, is approved in principle subject to agreement with my Department and may be regarded as the starting point of ongoing support for a significant city centre urban renewal project.  As a successful category A project, the award signals commitment to further funding in future years.  The overall URDF will increase for 2020 and it is expected that large integrated multi-annual urban projects will comprise a greater element of future overall allocations, as these more complex proposals require sufficient time for design, planning, procurement and construction to be advanced properly.</p> <p> I have more to say but I am conscious that I am eating into the Deputy's time.</p></speech>

I welcome what the Minister of State has said, which is that the overall URDF will increase for 2020 and that it is expected that large integrated multi-annual urban projects will comprise a greater element of future overall allocations.  However, we have to look at where we came from.  As the Minister of State said, we were ahead of the pack on this.  Mr. Michael Walsh and Waterford City and County Council had plans in place.  When considering the amount of money that was allocated, one has to look at the overall picture and at the catalyst the north quays will be for the whole south-east region.  We look at the likes of Cork, Limerick and Galway, which are already doing very well.  This absolute game changer of a project has to be recognised.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;13 million is required in 2019 to start the process and a commitment of &euro;30 million is required for each of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Much of the infrastructure development that will be involved in this project would have had to come in the future anyway.  What this project is doing is accelerating that hugely important infrastructure and increasing the connectivity between the north and the south of the city.  Sustainable transport infrastructure is the essence of this project and development of this site can and will act as a catalyst for the city and county of Waterford.  The employment opportunities, housing opportunities, and health opportunities cannot be underestimated.  We are constantly talking about cardiac care in Waterford and about a university for the south east.  This north quays development will act as a catalyst for all these things because it will lead to population growth and to Waterford and the south east acting as a release valve for the overcrowding in Dublin.  To reiterate, in order to sign contracts and move forward, we need a timeframe, certainty, and commitment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300022#AA00400"><p>Without a doubt, the north quays project will provide many opportunities for the city and region.  It is a project of major significance.  I compliment all involved in getting it this far.  Together with the total amount of lifetime URDF grant funding sought, the proposal that came forward this time included four very significant elements of enabling infrastructure which are: relocation of the city&rsquo;s railway station to the east to form a new public transport interchange, expected to cost approximately &euro;35 million; a new bridge over the River Suir for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport and an associated urban greenway, expected to cost more than &euro;33 million; site access roads and road realignment, expected to cost &euro;26.8 million; and off-site roads in the wider north bank of the Suir area in Kilkenny, which will cost approximately &euro;10.3 million.  I am constantly telling people in this room that there is also mention of Kilkenny in this plan.  This project will serve the area very well.  All of these infrastructural works will open up and make more accessible the north quays site, and will enable the special development zone planning scheme to be realised.</p>  <p>  Further discussion with the local authority and other relevant agencies, such as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, is ongoing to conclude the grant agreement for 2019 in the context of a project lifetime commitment for future years, which has yet to be agreed, subject to necessary public spending code and state aid considerations.  I can confirm that for approved category A projects, such as the Waterford north quays, subject to a grant agreement being entered into that will result in ongoing multi-annual contracts starting in 2019, there will be a commitment to the agreed Exchequer share of such contracts for future years.  I also wish to confirm at this stage that there is priority commitment to funding in excess of &euro;6 million for infrastructure to enable the mixed-use development of the Waterford north quays project.</p>  <p>  Again I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of this project and I reiterate the Government's ongoing commitment to the future development of Waterford as one of Ireland's principal cities and as the regional growth driver for the south east.  I cannot be any clearer on that.  Today we are discussing one fund under Project Ireland 2040 but there are many other funds and many other ways of accessing money.  It is important that the quays project looks at them all.  I have no doubt that it will and that it will apply for funding in different areas.  I am glad that we are able to kick-start the project with funding through this scheme, but there are many other ways to fund it including bringing private capital and money into the system.  It is a great project and the Government is looking forward to working with the local authority on it.  We are constantly engaging with Waterford City and County Council on this project.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that it will not happen with a big crash-out.  I believe that is the hope of everybody in this House and of the people at large.  My question relates to energy supplies in the event of Brexit happening.  I first raised this issue as far back as three years ago and I have raised it a number of times since including during an exchange with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Naughten, on 9 May 2017 to which I will refer in a minute.  The issues relate to the supply of gas, electricity and oil.  For better or worse, at the present time we depend on these supplies for our energy.  Large amounts of them come through Britain.  I will deal with them one by one.</p>  <p>  Some 55% of our gas supply comes through the island of Britain - England, Scotland and Wales.  We have an all-Ireland single electricity market, which is very important.  Important work has been done on that.  Some 40% of the State's oil reserves are also held outside the State - 20% in England, 11% in Scotland, and 9% in the Six Counties which are still occupied by England, Scotland and Wales.  This 9% is held close to Derry.  Some 55% of our natural gas comes from Britain.  If that is interrupted or stopped, perhaps in an emergency scenario, we would be in a serious situation in respect of the supply of domestic home heating gas but also in respect of power generating plants.  If it was cut off or if there were interruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit is there a possibility of World Trade Organization tariffs applying to this gas?  Will we have higher gas bills in nine weeks' time?  This would also affect electricity bills because the gas is used to generate electricity.  We must bear in mind that we already have the fourth highest electricity prices in the European Union.  What provisions are being made for those two scenarios?</p>  <p>  With regard to electricity, we have a 32-county electricity market which has been functioning very well since 2007, although there is other infrastructural work to be done in that area.  Can we guarantee that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there will be no tariffs applied to cross-Border electricity?  The new all-Ireland integrated single electricity market, ISEM, design which started in October was meant to save householders and businesses up to &euro;200 million.  What will happen in that regard?  We also have an electricity interconnector with Britain which goes directly across the Irish Sea.  Will tariffs be applied to electricity coming through that interconnector in nine weeks' time?</p>  <p>  With regard to oil reserves, earlier I referred to the fact that 40% of the State's oil reserves are held between the North of Ireland and Britain.  Under EU rules, this will not be counted towards our EU obligations after Brexit.  What discussions has the Minister and his Government had regarding what will happen to those oil reserves in nine weeks' time?  Under EU rules we are required to have a nine weeks' supply as a minimum.  As a member of the European Union we must continue to have that reserve, but not only for that reason.</p><p>We need those nine weeks of supply to be sure that we will have enough energy to keep the wheels turning on this island, for industry and transport and all of the other areas where it is used.</p> <p> In reply to a question in May 2017 the Minister said that the State was refurbishing facilities at Poolbeg in Dublin and Great Island in County Wexford.  Are they finished and ready?  Can the State now cater for the level of oil reserves that are required to get us over the minimum nine-week period?</p></speech>

As the Deputy has outlined, there has been great co-operation between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK in the energy market.  It is certainly our desire that this will continue.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the security of the supply of gas, Ireland has two main sources.  One is from the Corrib facility, which is a very important supplier, as Deputy Stanley has indicated.  The Corrib field delivers nearly half of our gas needs.  The balance of our supply comes from two wholly Irish-owned interconnector pipelines between Ireland and Scotland.  These pipelines are governed by intergovernmental agreements with the UK from 1993 and 2004.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, have indicated that gas trade across the two interconnectors will not fundamentally change in the short to medium term as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  Gas trading contingencies are being further examined as part of ongoing engagement with the Directorate General for Energy and the European Commission, as similar issues arise for member states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.  They are secure but an interruption to gas supply from an unpredictable event is always possible.  Brexit, however, of itself does not make that more likely.  Ireland has a considerable advantage in having the Corrib provision.</p>  <p>  The practicalities of gas trading on the interconnectors are governed by a series of mutually reinforcing agreements, contracts and trading rules, variously between the Irish and UK Governments and between the transmission system operators in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, with the latter overseen by their respective regulators.  With regard to the World Trade Organization, WTO, I have been informed by the Department that electricity would continue to trade and a tariff would not apply.  There may be a very small tariff on gas in the order of 1%.  Even in a WTO context the impact on this sector would be relatively small.</p>  <p>  The position on oil products, is that Ireland is dependent on imports that are predominantly supplied by UK refineries.  There are no indications, however, that we should be concerned about the continued availability of these products, post UK withdrawal.  In the event of any unexpected supply disruption occurring in the UK, the industry has indicated that alternative supplies can be sourced elsewhere, such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands.  On the issue of emergency oil reserves, Ireland is required under EU legislation and International Energy Agency, lEA, rules to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports for use in an emergency.  Currently 57% are held in Ireland, 22% within the other EU member states - all of which are readily accessible - and 21% of our emergency stocks are held in the UK, including Northern Ireland.  Post UK withdrawal, these stocks will still be accessible.</p>  <p>  I will get information for Deputy Stanley on the works that have been done but I know that NORA has stepped up its own capacity and has been onshoring the reserves that are being held.  That has made-----</p></speech>

Legislation underpinning this was amended in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The legislation is contained in sections 7 and 8 of the Energy Act 2016.  The position of Northern Ireland, including with regard to the single electricity market, remains a priority for the EU, Ireland and the UK.  We are working to maintain the beneficial structures of the all-island single electricity market whatever the outcome of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As one of the elements in the whole-of-Government initiative, I will be introducing some powers to ensure that the CRU has sufficient powers to ensure Ireland's compliance with the EU energy market requirements in the event of a UK withdrawal.</p></speech>

Some information has been provided there but it comes across that there is still some work to be done.</p>  <p>  On the gas situation, the Minister indicated there may be a small tariff.  It is a concern that there may be a tariff on gas coming into Ireland from England, Scotland or Wales.  This will be a concern to industry, to householders and to citizens up and down the country.</p>  <p>  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions over the last years, including at a conference organised by the Government two years ago in Roscommon.  The conference was organised by the current Minister's predecessor and it was very useful.  I ask that further information be shared on the issue as it becomes available.  We are aware that any type of tariff or charge can start off as a penny but can wind up as &euro;1 million because it is the thin end of the wedge.  A charge can increase over time.  Does the Minister have any information as to whether that tariff could be increased and if Britain holds all the cards?  Is it within Britain's gift - the mother of parliaments - to decide whether there is a tariff on gas coming into Ireland?  Some clarity on this issue would be useful.</p>  <p>  With regard to the oil reserves, and in answer to previous questions on the matter to the Minister's Department, he said that 20% is in England, 11% is in Scotland and 9% is held in the North of Ireland.  Could we have some clarity on that?  Obviously it would be better if it was on the island of Ireland from a logistical perspective.  Perhaps the Minister could illuminate where we are at in developing the capacity for storage in this State.  Will he also explain what is happening in Wexford and in the other facilities that were supposed to be developed and which are leased from the ESB?</p></speech>

I am aware that work has been ongoing in increasing capacity in order to have the oil storage onshore.  We have good contracts to ensure the stores are accessible wherever they are held.</p>  <p>  On the potential crash-out and the WTO rules becoming the rules, this is a market where there are very low tariffs and these are within the WTO rules.  These tariffs would not be decided at random.  They would be the fallback and, as I have said, they are 0% in electricity and very small tariffs in gas.  It is not like the agricultural sector, which would face very big obstacles to trade under WTO rules.</p>  <p>  The main area in which we need to take action, which is included in the omnibus legislation that the T&aacute;naiste will bring through, is in ensuring that Ireland continues to comply with all European Union regulations around the electricity market.  This is where we need to take certain reserve capabilities for the CRU to ensure we can be compliant.  That will be included in the legislation that is due to be published in the near future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300023#BB00800"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p><b></b>I am pleased to present to the House the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I commend Senator Frances Black on initiating the Bill and bringing it through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>If passed, Ireland and her Parliament will be sending a strong message, that it condemns the occupation of territories which are deemed illegal under international law.  This Bill, at its most basic, is about upholding international law.  It applies to illegal occupations anywhere in the world and not just to Israel and Palestine.  However, I am conscious that it is this occupation that has been the main focus of discussions on the Bill.  I want to state clearly from the outset that, if passed, this Bill will not ban trade in Israeli goods.  It will only ban those goods produced in settlements built illegally beyond Israel's borders.</p> <p> The Bill does not propose a boycott of Israel, and Fianna F&aacute;il does not support such a boycott.  We recognise and fully support Israel's right to self-determination and to self-defence.  We denounce violence against the state of Israel and its citizens, and we wholly and unreservedly condemn the persecution of the Jewish people and the evil that was the Holocaust.  Furthermore, my party very much values the strong links forged between our countries.  While in Israel I had the opportunity to meet Isaac Herzog, who chairs the Jewish Agency.  Ireland recently commemorated the centenary of the birth of his late father, Chaim Herzog, who was born in Belfast, raised in Dublin, and later became the sixth President of the state of Israel.  We want the strong ties between our two countries to endure, and we want to continue to work to find a way forward that will help bring about lasting peace in the region.  To those opposing this Bill, I state very clearly that our door will always be open to dialogue and constructive engagement.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has a long-held interest in the peace process in the Middle East.  It was under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led government in 1980 that Ireland became the first European member state to propose the two-state solution, based on a fully sovereign state of Palestine, independent of and co-existing with Israel.  The objectives we had then remain largely the same today.  We continue to advocate for a two-state solution, an end to this protracted conflict, and the full realisation of human rights for both Israelis and Palestinians.  The decision by Fianna F&aacute;il to support this Bill was not taken lightly or without due consideration.  I recognise that it is a difficult and multifaceted conflict.  Grievous wrongs have been committed by both sides, and it is fair to say that both Israeli and Palestinian authorities have acted at times in a manner that is clearly and deliberately counterproductive to peace.  However, as a party we are growing increasingly concerned about the actions of Israel and its continued and blatant disregard for international law.  We are deeply frustrated about the imbalance in power, the lack of progress in achieving the two-state solution, the non-existent peace process, the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank, home demolitions and land confiscation, unjustified restrictions on movement, and the sustained systematic expansion of settlements on Palestinian territories which are deemed illegal under international law and which represent physical obstacles to peace.</p> <p> More recently, the passing of the nation state law in the Knesset, which states that only Jews have the right of self-determination in Israel and downgrades the status of the Arabic language, has only served to make the prospect of peace more remote.  Coupled with this, Israel has been emboldened by the US Administration, which has ceased funding to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, UNRRA, closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington and moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  These moves have only served to alienate Palestinians and to discredit any peace initiative that is supposed to be forthcoming from the US Administration.</p> <p> I visited the region with my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, and saw at first hand the reality of the settlement project and the conditions the Palestinians have to endure.  We were struck by the fact that the two-state solution will very soon be unachievable because of the manner in which the settlements are interwoven throughout what is internationally recognised as Palestinian land.  Land is divided by walls and fences.  Certain roads are restricted for use of Israelis only.  There is a clear disparity in living standards.  Conditions in the West Bank and Gaza are now well below an acceptable standard of living, and reports indicate that Gaza will very soon be considered uninhabitable.  We met the NGOs, Al-Haq and Breaking the Silence.  We listened, learned, and came to the conclusion that criticism of the settlements alone has proved a futile exercise.  Repeated condemnation of Israeli actions by the EU and many in the international community has failed to deter Israel from continuing its settlements project.  Even UN resolution No. 2334 in December of 2014, which states, "[Israel's establishment] of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, ha[d] no legal validity and constitute[d] a flagrant violation under international law", has had little or no impact.  The situation has in fact worsened since then.</p> <p> No condemnation has been strong enough to change Israel's approach, and it would appear that the Israeli authorities have become accustomed to tuning out criticism.  It has no impact on the actions of the Israeli authorities.  It is clear to me that we have to change tack and take time to take a different course of action.  If change is to come, we must make the settlement project a less desirable policy for Israel.  This Bill is an example of a different but moderate approach and one that I hope can be a vehicle for some change in some small way.  To those who have tried to dissuade us from supporting the Bill and say that it is not the time for such a Bill, I say if this is not the time to act, when will that time come?  It is evident, given the expansion of the settlements, that unless action is taken, the two-state solution and the sovereign state of Palestine, independent of and co-existing with Israel, will very soon not be feasible.  This Bill should not be seen as a radical departure.  It is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I want to address an issue that is relevant to this issue as well as many other Private Members' Bills.  If this Bill passes Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it is not the case that it becomes law.  It necessarily requires that the Bill goes on to Committee Stage, Report Stage and Final Stage, before being promulgated by the President.  My concern, shared by colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, is that if this matter proceeds to Committee Stage, the Government may seek to invoke Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  As Members are aware, that provision provides that: "D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not pass any law ... for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by a message from the Government, signed by the Taoiseach."  That provision has become known as a money message.  It was an innovative proposal, inserted into the Constitution by Eamon de Valera, and intended to ensure that the Government would retain control of the purse strings.  However, it would be fanciful and inappropriate for the Government to seek to rely upon Article 17.2 for the purpose of preventing this legislation proceeding to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The concern Fianna F&aacute;il has in respect of this matter arises because of what was said in the Seanad by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade when this Bill was going through the Seanad.  It was suggested that this legislation could impose significant and recurring damages on the State because it might involve fines from the European Union or the European Commission, or it may cost money because it creates new offences.  The suggestion that a money message is required because fines may be imposed by the European Commission is inappropriate.  Anyone who knows the workings of the European Commission will know that Ireland will be given a warning if it brings the matter before a court, and that after a court decision has been made, we will be given the necessary time to ensure that the law is compatible with European Union law.  This is provided for under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  We could bring in this change readily without any fine being imposed upon us.</p>  <p>  Another concern is that an individual or corporation could take a case against the State.  However, that would only give rise to damages in circumstances where the State manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion.  I also believe that the suggestion that new offences are being created by this Bill which would create a charge on the Exchequer is inappropriate.</p><p>Simply because new offences are created does not mean the Garda will require more money for the purposes of investigating any new offences.  The Government is perfectly entitled to oppose this legislation on substance, but it would be inappropriate for the Government to seek to misrepresent and misuse the Constitution for the purposes of blocking this legislation or stopping it from getting through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Frances Black and our colleagues in the Seanad who passed this Bill.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, previously when I had the role of Opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs, we engaged specifically on this legislation.  I was happy to be involved at the time in the preparation and the first presentation of the Bill.  Back then, we afforded time to Government.  We afforded over six months for Government to respond to a very simple request.  The request was that the T&aacute;naiste would raise the issue of settlement goods with his EU counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council.  I asked him to do this in a letter dated 15 February 2018.  In his response the T&aacute;naiste said that a discussion on the Middle East was expected to be on the agenda of the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February 2018.  He said, however, that it was likely that discussion would focus mostly on the preparation for a lunch with the foreign ministers of key Arab states.</p>  <p>  Deputy Niall Collins has outlined the matter perfectly.  The time for waiting is over now.  We have tried to engage and gain agreement on this question.  Over 46 separate resolutions from the UN Human Rights Council have been ignored by Israel.  This Bill would send a message not only to Israel but to other states that illegally annex territory and seek to benefit from the use and exploitation of such territory.  The message is that Ireland will stand and be first to say that is not appropriate, like back in 1980, when the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first to propose the two-state solution.  There is no reason why Ireland should not lead.  I am proud of the track record of my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in that regard.  I am proud to be working with colleagues across the House to pass legislation that will make a difference and that will send a message.  We would be the first EU state to do so and others may follow.  The time for waiting for a pan-European approach is over at this stage.  We have tried that.  We tried it with the T&aacute;naiste when we asked him to raise this issue on numerous occasions and when we asked him to work with us on the Bill.  That has failed.  I am happy to support the Bill and I hope the House passes it.  As my colleague has said, I hope it is not blocked at subsequent stages by the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300025#DD00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, the Second Stage debate of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  The enactment of legislation to prohibit the purchase of goods or services produced in settlements deemed illegal is a proportionate response to breaches of international law.  It sends a strong message from Ireland on the need to respect such laws.  Ireland and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have a long history of standing up for international law and the Bill is in keeping with that history.  Our Bill will not end illegal settlements but it will demonstrate Ireland's significant opposition to them and will send a message to countries flouting international law.</p>  <p>  The Bill is not to be interpreted as an encouragement to boycott the state of Israel, the Israeli people or those of the Jewish faith.  Israel's right to exist and its right to self-determination are things that I will always support.  Like any country, Israel has a right to defend itself with proportionate action.  However, Israel also has a moral obligation as a member of the international community to adhere to international law.  International law is clear in holding that the occupation of lands in the West Bank and Gaza as well as the establishment of illegal settlements on those lands are illegal.  Internationally accepted standards of human rights, proportionality and responsibility must be adhered to by all sides.</p>  <p>  I travelled to the West Bank and Jerusalem with my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy.  There is little of the state of Palestine left to recognise.  Palestinians have fewer rights and less land and freedom than ever before.  The restrictions placed on them that I witnessed mean their homeland is little more than an open prison.  The despair and hopelessness that I saw among Palestinians was horrifying.  They live under a crushing and suffocating administration that denies them dignity.  They have been destroyed economically.  The situation is desperate and deteriorating.  Nevertheless, I met people who refused to surrender.  These people demonstrate the courage to endure on a daily basis.  We met families whose homes have been knocked down or who have been thrown out of their homes.  We met farmers who are not allowed to take stones from their land so that they can grow crops for their families or be productive.  It was disturbing to stand in a field where the farmer could barely grow enough food for his family and, yet, when I looked over the brow of the hill I could see a neighbouring field that was as lush as any field in Ireland.  That can be attributed to human rights abuses.</p>  <p>  A two-state solution whereby Israel and Palestine co-exist side-by-side peacefully is the only solution.  Unless a political solution is found the extremists will prevail on both sides.  Conciliation and dialogue represent the only path to a political solution.  However, the actions of Israel defence forces have made that more difficult and have strengthened the hand of those on both sides who oppose peace.  The international community must provide leadership.  It must provide a resolution to the conflict.  I believe this Bill is a step in that direction.</p></speech>

However, in the context of illegal occupied territories the case is obviously one of the most high-profile and significant on our globe.</p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand the impact that the occupation is having on Palestine as a state and on the quality of life of Palestinians.  It is difficult for us to continue to pretend that we are sending out condemnation through the UN and the international community since nothing is being done to advance the cause in terms of promoting the two-state solution.  There is no use in making that point if we continue to prevaricate as an international community or if we continue to deny the fact that the Palestinians are living in an open prison.  If we continue to deny that, then by the time good minds come together the Palestinian state will no longer exist.  Time is of the essence.  There is extraordinary pressure on the Palestinian people, including those in the West Bank, which I visited, as well as those in Gaza.  Other Members visited Gaza and relayed their testimony.  It is incumbent on us to try to keep this very much to the fore.  UN resolutions are all very fine, but if we continually allow a state to ignore and flout international law by illegal occupation then the international community does not stand for much in terms of condemnation alone.</p>  <p>  I urge people to consider this Bill and look at it.  It sends out a message.  Although it is from a small nation, it is a powerful message.  It is from a country that has a history of major difficulties and political turmoil.  We know full well that eventually dialogue and discussion will have to take place.  Talking to people on an equal footing is the only way to bring about a lasting peace in the Middle East.  I am not naive enough to believe that it is easy to do.  This is probably one of the most protracted difficulties and has been with us over many centuries.  It has been problematic not only in the context of Israeli versus Arab but Christian versus Arab as well.  For many years this has been a fault line between religion, civilisations, ways of life and how we view the world.  At this stage as a small nation I believe we owe it to the people of Palestine and other occupied areas to declare that international law must be supported and upheld.  Otherwise, we stand for nothing as a parliament, a people or as an international community.</p>  <p>  We are aware of proposals on the table from the United States on the Middle East peace process.  There have been many initiatives but the initiative most supported - it was put forward by this State initially - is the two-state solution.  I am firmly of the belief that if we delay and prevaricate then the two-state solution will cease to be a means to an end.  This is because the second state, Palestine, will no longer exist.  It is now at a crisis point.  Humanitarian issues relating to water, refuse and the breakdown of social order are to the fore.  Spitefulness is something that I have seen in terms of the cutting of funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and others.  The agency was providing educational facilities for Palestinian children.  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to use his good offices.  I know he is a champion of the Palestinian people.  I urge him to support this Bill and send out a strong message from a small nation expressing solidarity with a people who are oppressed.  The T&aacute;naiste should support this Bill and allow it to frame the discussions across the European Union and elsewhere in the context of the occupied territories.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300026#EE00100"><p>I am glad to be able to speak to this Bill.  The Bill merits very careful consideration in all its aspects.  I have addressed this Bill already in the Seanad.  I will not therefore repeat what I have said about my activities on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  I trust Deputies will recognise the priority I have attached to this issue, the time I have devoted to it and, indeed, the public funds that I have committed to it in the context of support for the Palestinian Authority and to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, in recent times.  This has included three visits to the region in my 12 months as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, work on the political process and on Gaza, and keeping up consistent pressure at EU and international level against the expansion of settlements.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been to the fore in shaping EU policies on settlements, including the exclusion of settlement products from normal tariff levels, preventing EU research funding being spent in settlements, preventing misleading labelling of settlement goods, and providing for the specific exclusion of settlements from future EU agreements with Israel.  Ireland also supports Israeli, Palestinian and international NGOs which defend Palestinian communities under threat from settlements.  No Member of this House attaches greater importance than I do to bringing Ireland&rsquo;s influence to bear to help end the occupation of the Palestinian territories, to promote a two-state solution that works for Israel and for Palestinians, and to deliver a sustainable peace after decades of conflict.</p>  <p>  However, speaking on behalf of the Government, I do not agree that the Bill is the right way forward now.  I wish to set out carefully for the D&aacute;il why this is so.  There are three broad reasons: legal, political and practical effects.  The overriding point that frames the Government&rsquo;s view is that the Bill asks the State to do something that is not within its power.  Ireland is part of a single unified EU market.  Trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union.  Everyone who is informed in this House should know that.  We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that it is prohibited to bring to Ireland, for sale or personal use, goods which enter the EU legally and are freely circulating elsewhere in the Single Market.  This is the meaning of the Single Market, the defence of which is something which the EU takes very seriously, as we have seen in the context of Brexit.  The integrity of the Single Market is in Ireland&rsquo;s overall interest.</p>  <p>  The formal advice to the Government of the Attorney General on this matter has confirmed clearly that passage of the Bill would put Ireland in breach of EU law and would expose Ireland to legal action by the European Commission as guardian of the treaties.  Some supporters of the Bill have put forward legal opinions which highlight a so-called public policy exemption, which states that provisions on free circulation of goods do not preclude &ldquo;prohibitions, quantitative restrictions or surveillance measures on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security&rdquo;.  However, I am strongly advised that the European Court of Justice has shown in previous cases that it will not allow this term to be interpreted broadly.  A broad interpretation of the public policy exemption would so obviously have implications for the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence on trade that it is entirely foreseeable that a challenge by the European Commission would follow.  Our informal soundings lead us to consider that very likely.</p>  <p>  Should Ireland be found to have breached EU law, as we would expect, the State would be exposed to potentially very significant fines as well as legal costs.  Fines recommended by the Commission in such cases can include lump sums of more than &euro;1.5 million plus daily fines.  Cumulative annual costs of these fines can range from hundreds of thousands of euros per year at the lower end of the scale, up to tens of millions of euros per year at the highest end.  No Government, nor any responsible Opposition, could support intentionally breaking EU law and exposing the State to such significant penalties.</p>  <p>  The Bill could also be challenged by companies or individuals claiming to be adversely affected by it.  In addition to legal costs arising in these circumstances, a finding against Ireland in favour of a private party could give rise to damages being awarded against the State.  In addition, costs would also arise for the relevant authorities in the implementation of the law, which would create new offences, the investigation, enforcement and potential prosecution of which would have resource implications for the customs authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system more broadly, including, perhaps, the Prison Service.  Our view is that additional costs will also arise from voted funds for certain Irish diplomatic missions abroad should this Bill be enacted.  I should state clearly at this point that because of these costs across a wide range of areas, there can be no doubt that the Bill will require a money message to proceed to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The political effects of the Bill are also an important consideration for this House.  Ireland has a stronger voice and greater influence on Middle East issues generally at UN and EU level than our size alone would justify.  That is where we are able to be of most help to the Palestinian people, which is my priority - indeed, both the Israeli and Palestinian people - in achieving a just and lasting peace.</p>  <p>  My fear is that if Ireland adopts this Bill, we would be choosing to be a principled voice in the wilderness, satisfied in the righteousness of our course, but largely unable to influence the real action.  I am in no doubt, from my experience of discussions on this issue at EU level, that a unilateral move by Ireland on this matter would weaken our ability to influence overall EU policy, not strengthen it.  If we allow ourselves to be discounted in the calculations that other states make, about where the centre of gravity on Middle East policy lies, then we cease to shape that political centre of gravity.</p>  <p>  The third basis on which the Government must oppose the Bill is the assessment of its practical effects, including practical challenges and costs of compliance for Irish companies which trade internationally.  For example, US companies in Ireland and Irish companies in the US could be placed in an impossible conflict of jurisdictions.  Legislation was under discussion in the United States Congress in 2018 to forbid companies based in the US from co-operating with trade bans on Israel and Israeli settlements.  Such proposals have enjoyed strong cross-party support in the US, so such legislation may well be passed into law.  Similar legislation exists at state level in many US states.  Irish missions and State agencies in the US have received queries from companies concerned about this impact of the Bill and the lack of clarity on their legal obligations.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a sincere attempt to address a real issue.  I recognise that and recognise Senator Frances Black who began this Bill&rsquo;s journey.  If enacted, it would provide a moment of solace for Palestinians at a difficult time.  However the solace would only be momentary.  Legislation must be designed by the head as well as the heart and it is the job of any Government to assess the balance of positives and negatives of any policy option.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us will not significantly impact on Israeli settlements.  Conversely, it will place Ireland in breach of EU law.  That alone should be enough to make it impossible to vote for it.  It will also lead to Ireland facing legal challenge and the strong likelihood of very significant penalties, as well as being obliged to repeal the law and possibly pay damages to those with economic interests in settlements.  It will diminish Ireland&rsquo;s influence on behalf of the Palestinians at EU level, which is my main concern.  It will also create difficulties for Ireland and for companies in Ireland with compliance, including with US legislation.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, despite being well and sincerely intentioned by its original authors, this Bill will do serious damage to Ireland and bring only momentary consolation to Palestinians, and we owe them more than that.  For these reasons, no responsible party of Government could support this Bill and this Government must and will oppose it.</p></speech>

It is my privilege to support the Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in and I commend Senator Black on advancing it.</p>  <p>  I listened with a sinking heart to the T&aacute;naiste's speech.  He spoke about the centre of gravity as it pertained to Palestine.  Let us assess the centre of gravity and the progress that has been made.  The Palestinian people are victims of a process of colonisation and an onslaught of building of illegal settlements.  Land is taken and rights are denied.  People are imprisoned using a form of internment known as administrative detention, a British law that still stands.  Their numbers include more than 400 children.  Children have been maimed, with their eyes gone, thanks to Israeli defence forces aggression.  Young men were jailed - actually, they were children - at the age of 12 years and released at the age of 15.  A young woman aged 16 years, Ahed Tamimi, spent six months in jail for standing up to Israeli soldiers.  Last year 312 Palestinians, including 53 children, died at the hands of the Israeli army.  That is the centre of gravity.</p></speech>

The Irish people are prepared to take on the argument at EU level.  Public opinion understands this is necessary.  People are prepared to take on the commercial complications set out by the T&aacute;naiste.  What they are not prepared to do and what no Government worthy of the name should do is stand over trade with illegal settlements or stand by as the state of Israel comprehensively and brazenly flouts international law day in and day out.  Above all else, the Government and the State should stand for the rule of international law.  In the final analysis, that is what the legislation is about.  The T&aacute;naiste can give his political, legal and diplomatic rationale and come up with every excuse under the sun not to support the Bill, but we only need one good reason to support it.</p>  <p>  I was in Palestine before Christmas.  The Palestinian people look to Ireland to lead and stand in solidarity with them.  They want this legislation.  I did not meet one person who was opposed to it.  As the Palestinian people believe this is the right move, let us make it and lead from the front.  That is the honourable and Irish thing to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-01-23a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012300027#FF00500"><p>The Bill seeks to prohibit the importation and sale of goods, services and natural resources originating from illegal settlements in occupied territories.  It is not extreme.  It seeks to establish a legal framework to ban these imports from settlements that are already illegal under international humanitarian law and, most importantly, domestic Irish law.  Goods and services only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be on sale in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A clear example of how the Bill would work is the stopping of goods and services from illegal Israeli colonial settlements from entering Ireland.  Israel has occupied the West Bank region of Palestine since 1967 and in that time transferred more than 600,000 of its citizens to that territory.  This has been facilitated by the diversion of water supplies and the widespread confiscation of Palestinian land, particularly fertile farmland.  It has also created a system of apartheid between illegal Israeli settlers and Palestinian citizens.  For decades Israel has attempted to destroy the two-state solution by increasing the building of these illegal colonial settlements in Palestine which violates international law and is a war crime, yet Ireland continues to allow and facilitate trade with the illegal colonial settlements.  As long as we continue to allow the Israeli Government to impose apartheid, maintain its illegal occupation and violate international law with impunity, it will never make the transition and necessary compromises to create a just and lasting peace settlement.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government must make a strong and unambiguous statement that Israel cannot continue its illegal occupation of Palestine with impunity.  Nothing is going to change in Gaza or on the West Bank until the international community moves on from empty rhetoric and actually applies pressure on Israel.  Ireland must stop sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right moment.  When real, concrete and tangible steps are proposed, it must give leadership.  The Government has refused to abide by the Sinn F&eacute;in motion to recognise the state of Palestine that was passed unanimously by the House in December 2014 and is refusing to support the Bill.  In the face of war crimes and human rights abuses, the time for empty words is over.  It is time for action.  That is the call coming from the House.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not focus on one occupation or country; rather, its focus is solely on the primacy of international law.  It could apply to occupations and breaches of international law anywhere in the world.  A "relevant occupied territory" is defined as one that has been confirmed as such by the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court or an international tribunal and designated as occupied for the purposes of this legislation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a strong case for Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara to come with the remit of the Bill.</p></speech>

Like many of us, I would love to see that advice.  Senator Black has released her legal advice received on the Bill.  The legal basis of the Bill and its compatibility with EU law are detailed in the legal opinions of Mr. Michael Lynn, senior counsel; Professor James Crawford and, most recently, Professor Takis Tridimas.  Last year the Government published a summary of the Attorney General's advice on why it should opt for repeal of the eighth amendment.  The T&aacute;naiste should now publish a summary of the Attorney General's advice on this Bill in order that all parties would see the legal perspectives and make up their own minds.  I am in no doubt that the Bill is fully compliant with EU trade rules and that we should pass it urgently.  Let us not forget that South African goods, produced under a system of apartheid, were banned from Ireland in 1987 after a long campaign by Irish workers and anti-apartheid activists.  That was done despite the advice of the Attorney General that it was not possible under then EEC trade rules.  The Government should drop its opposition to the Bill and join all members of the Opposition in supporting this important legislation.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or-bhu&iacute;och go bhfuil seans agam caint ar an &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I commend the Seanad on passing the Bill.  In particular, I thank Senator Black for her work on this crucial humanitarian issue.  By contrast, the Government's policy is reprehensible, but that is not new.  Fine Gael's refusal to honour its programme for Government commitment and implement the democratic votes of both Houses to give formal recognition to the state of Palestine is wilfully shameful.  Today and yesterday, there were Israeli attacks in Gaza.  Ten years ago this month, Israeli forces invaded the Gaza Strip.  It resulted in 13 deaths on the Israeli side, while 1,417 Palestinians were killed, including 313.  I visited Israel, the Gaza Strip and Gaza city not long after the first assault and was horrified by the scale of the human tragedy.</p><p>The UN report into that invasion concluded that it was a deliberate, disproportionate act by Israeli forces designed to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population.  The Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, the separation law, and the theft of water rights and of land for illegal settlements have all been well documented and all are in breach of international law.</p> <p> The State of Israel is a First World, nuclear-armed and economic power oppressing a largely powerless, impoverished Palestinian people.  Despite the fine work being done by many Israeli citizens and NGOs, despite support in Israel for a peace process, the Israeli state snubs diplomacy, rejects international criticism, has no interest in peaceful alternatives and does not see armed force as a measure of last resort - on the contrary, it sees brutal military force as its measure of first resort.</p> <p> We recognise the State of Israel, despite its flagrant breaches of international law and human rights.  I have no issue with that.  Fair enough, but why is one state recognised and not the other?  Why are no sanctions being brought forward?</p> <p> On Monday, we celebrated an Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il.  That was an illegal act.  If we follow the rationale of this Minister, those who assembled would not have done anything.  They would have sat and decided to do nothing.  Women still would not have a vote and slavery would still be legal if we followed his rationale and no one anywhere in the world would have won a single right if we followed his rationale.  If we, as a former colony still partitioned, still occupied in part by a Government we do not want, with our proud history of freedom struggle and resistance and our peace process, do not support the people of Palestine, then who will?</p> <p> There is no wrong time to do the right thing.  The Government should support this Bill and I would urge all Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to do likewise.</p></speech>

The oppressive Israeli Government cannot be allowed to continue to act with total disregard for human life, and with complete disdain for international law.  As a nation of people who lived under a brutal occupier for hundreds of years, we should be acutely aware of the need for other states to show their solidarity with nations living under occupation and assist them in any way possible with their aspirations for statehood.</p>  <p>  This Bill would prohibit the import and sale of goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements, restrict Irish involvement in the provision of services in such settlements and ban the extraction of resources from occupied territories without the consent of the recognised authority of that territory.</p>  <p>  The Bill would not impose a ban on Israeli goods in general.  It would only affect goods produced in occupied territories built beyond Israel's borders, deemed illegal under international law.  This is entirely appropriate and justifiable.</p>  <p>  It is completely unacceptable that Fine Gael has steadfastly refused to implement the will of the D&aacute;il by recognising the state of Palestine, in line with a Sinn F&eacute;in motion that was passed here in 2014.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to address this issue and tell us when Ireland will officially recognise the state of Palestine or why the Government will not do so.  I also call on the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and Halligan, and the Minister, Deputy Ross, to use their influence within the Government to ensure this is progressed immediately.</p>  <p>  I commend Senator Black on her tireless work for the Palestinian people.  I hope the passing of this Bill will be followed by the official State recognition of Palestine and will set an example for other countries across the world to follow and, in turn, force the Israeli Government to change its deplorable behaviour.</p></speech>

That is it.</p><p>If I can, I will say the following.  This Bill lays down a marker.  The Irish people stand with the people of Palestine against the Israeli apartheid regime.  The Irish people stand for the international rule of law.  The Irish people, who have suffered in their own history from the theft of land, will not allow Israel to normalise its illegal occupation and settlement of the West Bank.</p></speech>

I also recognise the contribution of civil society organisations, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and Sadaka, to the development of the Bill and, indeed, of Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing it into this House today.</p><p>This Bill has been given detailed discussion and deliberation in the Seanad where I think it is fair to say that all sides - all speakers in the Seanad - recognised that this Bill is designed on sound moral principles and seeks only to do what is right.</p><p>Labour supports this Bill, as Labour has a long history of support for the people of Palestine.  Although it has been said and repeated already, it is important to restate that this is not a boycott-of-Israel Bill or a Bill to place a ban on Israeli goods.  This Bill is not anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli in any respect.  Without equivocation, I utterly condemn anti-Semitism and deplore its rise in the world today.  The State of Israel is internationally recognised and is a legitimate member of the international community, and I reject any assertions to the contrary.  We want Ireland to continue to be a friend and partner to the people of Israel.  Equally, Ireland is and will continue to be a friend and supporter of the people of Palestine.  Labour wants to see a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and we support international efforts to restart and re-energise the process of finding a durable two-state solution.</p><p>I will focus on the Bill itself.  It is a simple Bill, but one that addresses a complex topic.  The Bill seek to make it an offence in Ireland for a person &quot;to import or sell goods or services originating in an occupied territory&quot;, <i>simpliciter</i>.  The Bill seeks to make it an offence for a person &quot;to extract resources from an occupied territory in certain circumstances&quot;.  The Bill carefully defines an &quot;occupied territory&quot; as a territory which is confirmed as &quot;occupied&quot; by a decision or advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, by a decision of the International Criminal Court or by a decision of an international tribunal, or else designated as such for the purposes of this Act in a regulation made by the Minister.  This definition obviously includes the occupied Palestinian territories but it also includes the territories belonging to Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia that are recognised internationally as illegally occupied by Russia, and there are other territories, some already mentioned by other Members, around the world that have been occupied by armed forces operating under the control of a foreign power.</p><p>While this law has obviously had its origins in concern for the Palestinian people, it may prove to be significant legislation in respect of the recent aggression by Russia and Russian-backed armed groups all too close to the European Union's own borders.  The Bill is addressing one of the most basic aspects of national sovereignty, which is the territorial integrity of a state.  It is a blind spot in our law that we do not already make it illegal to trade in goods originating in occupied territories.</p><p>As well as being an affront to international law, occupation by armed forces is a costly undertaking.  The cost of occupation and warfare, including the costs of reparations, is one of the ways in which Europe has sought to eliminate warfare as a policy choice by aggressive governments.</p><p>In that context, it is clear that we should have a law to prevent occupying forces making economic gain from illegal occupation.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste stated that the Attorney General told him that it would be unlawful under European law to implement the Bill but other legal opinions disagree.  There is no doubt in my mind that we should proceed with this legislation.  Let us test it in the European Commission or European Court of Justice and see what they decide.</p></speech>

However, he is aware that the Attorney General regularly provides a written list of potential challenges against the State for breaches of European law.  It is a regular part and feature of government and should not prevent us pursuing what is right in this case.</p>  <p>  Most Deputies belong to parties that are represented in Brussels and Strasbourg.  I will undertake to share a copy of the Bill with my colleagues in the Party of European Socialists and ask them to support this initiative at European level and, indeed, in their home parliaments across Europe.  If the law is incomplete or has unintended consequences, those can be addressed.  If nothing else, this Parliament is taking an important stand on the issue of the economic exploitation of any unlawfully occupied territory.</p>  <p>  Such economic exploitation of occupied territory is an issue that resonates with Ireland&rsquo;s history.  Last Monday, we remembered the Democratic Programme written by the then leader of the Labour Party, Tom Johnson, and which is recorded as one of the first documents to be placed before the First D&aacute;il.  Two excerpts from it are directly relevant to this matter.  One hundred years ago this week, Johnson wrote &ldquo;we declare that the Nation&rsquo;s sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation&rsquo;s soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation&rdquo;.  Our declaration of independence from the British Empire required the nascent Irish State to wrest control of the economy, including the soil and natural resources of the territory of Ireland.  There could not be meaningful independence if the economy was excessively under foreign control.  That is true for any territory, nation or nascent country if its resources are bled or removed from it before it has a chance to come to full existence.  The Democratic Programme further states &ldquo;while undertaking the organisation of the Nation&rsquo;s trade, import and export, it shall be the duty of the Republic to prevent the shipment from Ireland of food and other necessaries until the wants of the Irish people are fully satisfied and the future provided for.&rdquo;  All Members know that shipments of corn farmed for absentee landlords continued to leave Ireland during the Great Famine of 1845-49, which left a million dead and caused two million to leave Ireland in the space of ten years.  Economist Cormac &Oacute; Gr&aacute;da calculated that in 1845 alone, more than 26 million bushels of grain were exported from a starving Ireland to England.  Research by Christine Kinealy of the University of Liverpool shows that nearly 4,000 vessels carrying food left Ireland for England in 1847, at the height of the Famine.</p>  <p>  We know from World Bank studies and other analyses that the occupation of the territories of Palestine has had a great cost for the people of Palestine and to their economy.  The UN Conference on Trade and Development went so far as to state that &ldquo;fifty years of occupation have driven the Palestinian economy into de-development and poverty&rdquo;.  Political leaders in Palestine obviously need to do far more to improve their governance.  However, Ireland and this Parliament has a long history of standing with them.  The least we can do now is to ensure that economic gains from illegal occupation are not paid for with Irish money.  We must support the Bill and its aims and encourage our sister parties throughout Europe to do the same.</p></speech>

If passed, far from being a principled voice in the wilderness as the T&aacute;naiste contended, it would represent a very important signal internationally as part of a global movement of solidarity against the oppression of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  The arguments that have been marshalled against the Bill and the Government response to it are shameless and utterly cynical.  The T&aacute;naiste put forward various spurious legal arguments against the Bill.  However, several newspapers today reported him as stating that the Israeli ambassador may leave Ireland if Ministers vote for the Bill, which belies the real story, namely, the pressure being put on the Government by the Israeli state.  If the words of solidarity that Deputies Finian McGrath and Halligan previously uttered mean anything, they will be tripping over themselves to run to the Chamber and vote for the Bill tomorrow precisely to force the Israeli ambassador to leave Ireland.   We should kick out representatives of the Israeli Government because of its crimes and oppression of the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  When discussing the settlements, we should be clear that they are a weapon of war against the Palestinian people and a perpetuation of what began with the Nakba and continued in the 1967 war.  They involve the annexation and occupation of Palestinian land, creating facts on the ground and cutting across a contiguous Palestinian state through ethnic cleansing.  They are being expanded at a rate of knots in east Jerusalem in order to undermine the possibility of a Palestinian capital.  The project of expansion and settlements, encouraged by Donald Trump, is carried out with brutal violence and involves settlers and the Israeli army working hand in hand against the Palestinian people who live there.  It is about creating a system of apartheid within the occupied territories with blatant discrimination: there are different roads, buses, rights and laws for Israelis and Palestinians.  There are civilian laws for the Israeli settlers and military laws and rule for the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  Reference is often made to the international community when there is discussion of Palestine.  In my opinion, there are two international communities.  There is the international community of capitalist states and imperialist powers such as the United States and the European Union which, in spite of occasional crocodile tears, back up and fund the Israeli state and provide it with military assistance.  There is also an international community of ordinary working-class people who are part of a global solidarity movement.  It is they who have the capacity to assist the Palestinians as part of that movement.  They can do so through a targeted boycott of any company or goods which benefit or result from the oppression of Palestinian people, including companies such as Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, as well as the growing arms trade between Ireland and Israel.  Workers should have nothing to do with any such trade.</p>  <p>  I wish to conclude by making some general points from the point of view of the socialist party, Solidarity, and our sister party in Israel and Palestine, the Socialist Struggle Movement, about what can defeat the Israeli state's occupation and oppression when combined with this movement of global solidarity.  We point to the mass uprising from below of the first intifada and to strikes, demonstrations and marches on border checkpoints, which show the power of mass movements.  There was an important echo of those in recent months with the protest in Gaza against the siege, for example.  A new upsurge of struggle from below, democratically controlled by committees of struggle, is needed to end the siege of Gaza, the occupation of the West Bank, and the discrimination against Palestinians in Israel and to achieve the dismantling of the settlements.</p>  <p>  The working class in the region has enormous power and is a vital ally.  This week, there was a general strike in Tunisia and important strike movements in Iran, echoing the movements of the Arab revolution which began in 2011.  There are other key potential allies within Israeli society.  The Israeli Government represents the interests of the rich, rather than those of ordinary Israeli Jewish working-class people.  Recent social movements such as the strikes against violence in December and the demonstrations against LGBTQ discrimination have seen unity between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews.</p></speech>
