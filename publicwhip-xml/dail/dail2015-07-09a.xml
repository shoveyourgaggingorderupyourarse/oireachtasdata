I would appreciate it if a bit of honesty could be brought to the debate on this issue.  We now have conflicting views and reports from various Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and there seems to be continual change of emphasis in the language from the Minister around universal health care as opposed to universal health insurance.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900003#A00800"><p>The Government is committed to a major programme of reform for the health service, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health service where access is based on need and not income.  The White Paper on universal health insurance was published on 2 April 2014.  Following its publication, a major costing exercise involving the Department of Health, the ESRI and others was initiated to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance, UHI, model, as proposed in the White Paper.  Draft results from the initial phase of the costing exercise were presented to me at the end of May.  These draft results are now informing deliberations on next steps, including the necessity for further research and cost modelling.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the UHI costing exercise is a major research project with a number of phases.  The next phases in the costing exercise are likely to include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models.</p><p>This will inform Government discussions on the best long-term approach to achieving universal health care.  It is important that universal access does not result in shared but longer waiting lists for all, but instead results in more health care needs being met in a timely manner.  For this reason additional analysis of unmet need and capacity is important as we implement changes on a phased basis.</p> <p> Finally, I have already indicated that it will not be possible to introduce a full universal health insurance system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I emphasise my commitment to universal health care and to implementing key health reforms, as set out in the programme for Government and the White Paper.  In particular, I have pushed ahead with critical building blocks for universal health care, including the phased extension of universal general practitioner care without fees, improved management of chronic disease in the community, implementation of financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and the establishment of the hospital groups.  We have recently seen significant progress in the extension of GP care without fees to children under six years of age and we are also seeing the phased expansion of free GP care to all those aged 70 years and above from August.  The introduction of universal GP access for the youngest and oldest in our society is an important step on the path to universal health care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900004#B00200"><p>That is an extraordinary reply.  We are back to the same old view that has been expressed by the Minister in recent times in respect of universal health care.  I remind the Minister that the programme for Government states:<blockquote>This Government will introduce Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all...A system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI) will be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system complete with this Government's term of office.</blockquote>The idea that the Government is now saying that no due diligence was done on how it would implement universal health insurance in advance of the last election and in advance of putting it into the programme for Government is extraordinary.  It is the case that the Government is making this up as it goes along.  It is evident that the Minister is fundamentally opposed to universal health insurance.  The Taoiseach is attaching himself to it with pretence.  He comes into the House and effectively says he is committed to it, although the Minister has abandoned the idea of bringing in universal health insurance.</p><p>Many Members subscribe to the idea of universal health care, but the question of how we fund our health services is the critical issue.  We are not talking about opposing some concept of universal health care, but universal health insurance is the Government's stated way of funding universal health care and the Government seems to have abandoned it.  We need honesty and straight, upfront views on what the Government is going to do with regard to universal health insurance.</p></speech>

Universal health care is a group term meaning access to health care on an equal basis, based on need rather than ability to pay.  There are many ways of bringing that about.  Universal health insurance is one of those.  We can have a multi-payer or a single payer system, a social insurance-based system, a tax-based system or an out-of-pocket system.  These are all different ways of funding it.</p>  <p>  Another element in the programme for Government is the extension of GP care without fees.  That is not being done through insurance and it was never envisaged that it would be done through insurance.  We spent a considerable period in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on that contract on the basis that it would be based on a tax-funded system.  There is a separate part in the programme for Government on that aspect.</p>  <p>  Obviously, a considerable amount of work has had to be done in the meantime.  The costings indicate that universal health insurance would be very expensive and that the premiums would be very high.  Maybe they need to be high, because any universal health care system worth having is one that delivers timely health care.  We could have universal health care tomorrow and simply put everyone on a waiting list, but I am unsure whether that would be very attractive.</p></speech>

There is no doubt those in government are forgetting what they have said with regard to the health policy and how it is to be funded.  When announcing the White Paper on 2 April 2014, the Taoiseach stated that "Those with existing health insurance will now for the first time have primary care services included."  It would have been fine if he announced that on 1 April because it is a fool's document and the Government is trying to make a fool of everyone in this House and those on the street as well.</p>  <p>  The Minister has a fundamental opposition to universal health insurance.  The Taoiseach comes to the House on a regular basis and pretends that it is a central plank of Government policy while his Minister is undermining it.</p></speech>

We all subscribe to the principle of universal health care.  The key issue is how we fund it.

Many people have a policy already that covers GP care, but most people do not and chose not to take that out.  Where we differ is that I do not believe the most fundamental question is how the money is collected and funded.</p></speech>

No matter what the system, if the funding and staffing levels are inadequate, then it will not be a good health service.  The second thing is to ensure that money is spent well.  This comes from activity-based funding.  We are very much pushing ahead with activity-based funding to ensure that money follows the patient and that hospitals are paid for what they do.  Research has been done by the ESRI and I look forward to publishing it as soon as possible.  The research indicates different sets of costings.  We could apply universal health insurance only to hospitals, to hospitals plus primary care or to hospitals plus primary care plus drugs and social care.</p></speech>

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the scheme, but in fact 577 applications have been accepted.  The applications are being assessed by former High Court judge Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark.</p>  <p>  Contrary to the Deputy's assertion, the scheme has brought about an end to years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy.  The scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial and it aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.  The scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was set up to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy, whether negligence is proven.</p>  <p>  The scheme is voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition of participation in the scheme.  Women may opt out of the scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that they must agree to discontinue legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.</p>  <p>  Ms Justice Clark has informed my officials that as of 3 July 2015, 235 offers have been made to women.  In some cases, however, the applicants or their legal advisers have not yet provided the necessary documentation and information in support of their applications.  Ms Justice Clark has indicated that she will write to each of these applicants to request that all outstanding documentation and information that the applicant may wish to rely on in the assessment of their application is furnished to the scheme.  The judge will specify a time limit in which information must be furnished and after this time has expired, the applications will proceed to assessment on the basis of the documentation and information furnished.  Given the legal and other costs involved and the frailty of some of the women, the judge wishes to ensure that the scheme does not continue for longer than is necessary.</p>  <p>  Ms Justice Clark has commissioned medical experts in the areas of obstetrics and gynaecology, radiology and orthopaedic surgery to assist her in assessing applications where there is an absence of available evidence either that the procedure was undertaken or of its consequences on the health of the woman.  The three consultants concerned are eminently qualified in their respective fields to do this work.</p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the provision of the scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive response to this issue that should help bring resolution for the women - many of whom are elderly - and their families.</p></speech>

It appears to lack compassion or understanding and for some it has been demeaning.  The former judge, Ms Clarke, who is the sole overseer of the process, has described women subjected to symphysiotomy as making a full recovery over a relatively short period of time and with no continuing ill effects.  Neither of these claims stands up to Irish or international scrutiny.  In some cases she has looked for a pathological gap in the pelvis in a belief this would represent objective evidence of injury even though the High Court accepted in a recent case there is not necessarily a link between such a gap and the pelvic pain that is a reality for many of these women.</p> <p> I ask the Minister what steps he will take to address the inappropriate disposition of Ms Clarke in the carrying out of her role and to ensure that all women victims presenting before her are treated to true compassion and respect rather than made to face a process that is nakedly operated to keep payments to the lowest possible level, which in some cases is nothing.</p></speech>

One alternative was to require people to go through the courts and make their case on the witness stand, with the possibility of being subjected to cross-examination and significant financial losses if the case is unsuccessful.  The Deputy will be aware that judgments in a number of recent cases have found against the women concerned.  The other alternative was a form of tribunal which would adopt a similarly adversarial approach.  The chosen scheme is the least adversarial system that could be established.  It is not unreasonable to require the 577 people who have made applications to produce evidence that they underwent surgical symphysiotomy.  Of the 235 offers made, 222 have been accepted.</p></speech>

I do not know anyone else who would dismiss victims' claims of depression, anguish and social withdrawal.  Let us not forget that the UN Human Rights Committee has condemned this so-called surgery as torture.</p>  <p>  I do not doubt that the Minister believes the response he has given but I ask him to heed the voices not of this Deputy, but of the women who have spoken to me in this institution and elsewhere.  If he has a difficulty in doing that, a number of them are currently in the Gallery and they can inform him personally about the reality of their experiences.  It is not good enough for the Minister to simply accept that everything is well and is going as he intends.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I invite him to make an intervention to ensure that the process is indeed non-adversarial and has the compassion required.</p></speech>

It remains voluntary until the point at which somebody accepts an award.  Judge Clarke receives advice from medical experts but she was appointed to act as an independent assessor.  That is why I will not attempt to go over her head or overrule her.  Her medical advisers include an eminent consultant, an obstetrician, a gynaecologist, an eminent consultant radiologist and an eminent consultant orthopaedic surgeon.

There are also specific services for addiction.  Health Service Executive funding of &euro;109 million is provided for alcohol and drug addiction services in 2015.</p>  <p>  People who present for alcohol addiction treatment are offered a range of interventions based on the four tier model of treatment intervention.  The quality of client care remains a central focus of the addiction service.  The HSE is aware of the growing need for interventions to address those addicted to drugs and alcohol.  The issue of support for those with alcohol addiction will also be considered as part of national strategy development, most particularly in developing the new drugs strategy and in the forthcoming review of A Vision for Change.  The resources available to address substance misuse will be kept under review in the context of the overall resources available to the health services.</p>  <p>  It is essential to have a public health policy response which seeks to reduce the number of people engaged in the harmful use of alcohol.  The Government approved the general scheme of a public health (alcohol) Bill in February.  The scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  Work is ongoing on the preparation of the legislation and it is expected that the Bill will be published in the autumn.  The other measures set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy were endorsed by the Government.  The first annual report on the national substance misuse strategy is due later this year.  A range of services is provided for those with drug and alcohol addictions. Work is under way to review these services to ensure that they are developed in line with evolving needs and best practice.</p></reply>

Some 97% of public order offences recorded on the PULSE system are due to alcohol.  These figures do not include the human cost to the individual and his or her family.  I recently met a group of people in recovery who outlined the cost of their alcoholism.  These costs include &euro;100 every time they presented to an emergency department, &euro;1,000 per night when they were hospitalised and additional sums for GP visits and medication, as well as the costs associated with accidents and being out of work.  These expenses create further stress for themselves and their families.  Now that they are in recovery, they are back at work and paying taxes.  Some of them run businesses and employ people.  Furthermore, they are also supporting others in recovery.  There are also knock-on effects for their families and communities.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to give specific details on the range of interventions available.  If individuals present to an emergency department with an alcohol-related illness, to where are they referred and what information are they given?</p></speech>

Two thirds of patients who attend emergency departments are discharged and the remaining third are admitted.  If they are admitted, I imagine they would receive some sort of referral to the addiction services while they are in hospital but they are probably not referred if they are discharged because that is how an emergency department appropriately works.  It would be a matter for the patient's GP or regular doctor to make the necessary referral.  The purpose of an emergency department is to deal with the presenting complaint or emergency, while the underlying conditions should be dealt with by the community or admitting doctor.</p>  <p>  The budget for the HSE's addiction services has increased slightly this year from &euro;86.122 million to &euro;86.279 million.  Funding for the HSE's drugs and alcohol task force projects has also increased slightly this year.</p></speech>

There are very few projects and facilities on the northside of Dublin.  One of the few services that exists on the northside manages to cover the cost of qualified therapists and counsellors, its premises, its information technology equipment and its other overheads on a budget of &euro;150,000 per year.  Despite working actively with 74 clients, it has no funding from the HSE.  This service is working and similar services should be established in every town in this country.</p>  <p>  I have tabled a later question on the &euro;2.2 billion raised in taxes on alcohol products.  Can some of this money be allocated specifically for treatment services?  Proposals are being considered for the minimum pricing of alcohol but could we set a maximum price for soft drinks?  When people go out for drinks sometimes the cost of alcohol is the same if not cheaper than that of a soft drink.</p></speech>

I do not know the people involved and I do not dispute what they say but I have never met a group that did not tell me that its service was great.  That is the nature of these things.  It is important that any project is objectively assessed, and that is where the HSE's addiction services come in to allocate its budget as efficiently and effectively as possible, and to assess how it can be best spent and best delivered.</p></speech>

I refer to reports on the St. John of God service in Drumcar and Cregg House in Sligo.  Is the Minister concerned about the reports?  Is it not evidence of the lack of political will at Cabinet with respect to providing the best quality of services for people with disability in this country?</p></reply>

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  People with a disability should be able to maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.</p>  <p>  Compliance with HIQA standards for disability residential centres is a requirement under the service level arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers.  A total of 66% of designated centres for people with a disability were inspected by HIQA by the end of quarter 1 in 2015, including inspections triggered by complaints or allegations of mistreatment.  The lessons learned from them are continuing to improve the quality of services.  Clients and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  HIQA has reported evidence of very good practice in the delivery of many residential services to people with disabilities where the support and care needs of residents have been prioritised and there is a strong focus on the needs of service users.  While HIQA&rsquo;s findings, in some cases may make for difficult reading, they serve as evidence that the regulatory process works effectively and in the interests of protecting vulnerable people in the care of the State.  In that respect, for example, it is noted that HIQA&rsquo;s most recent report on &Aacute;ras Attracta has found significant improvements in the lives of many residents.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has requested the HSE to develop action plans to address cases where HIQA has raised serious concerns regarding the level of care people with a disability are receiving in a number of disability centres, including safeguarding the human rights of residents.</p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  Much work remains to be carried out on an ongoing basis to ensure all facilities comply with disability residential standards.  While this programme will be challenging for the HSE, it is crucial in safeguarding vulnerable people in the care of the State.</p></speech>

The parliamentary question was not about the regulatory standards, it was about providing resources for people with disability.  Is the Minister not appalled at the Cregg House report, which found that the chronic staffing levels due to cuts to staff resources had "a direct impact on the quality of life for residents"?</p>  <p>  In the week the Government granted significant increases in the pensions of retired politicians, does the Minister not find it appalling that he could say in the House today that he is committed to the disability sector when it has been affected by massive cuts, which have resulted in the slippage of standards?  The damning reports demonstrate the failure of the Government and highlight the lack of political will to protect vulnerable people.  As we approach the next budget, does the Minister intend to reverse the cuts?</p></speech>

Often, there are a number of issues as to why care is substandard.  Resources are often only part of the picture.  Deputy Keaveney will be aware that &Aacute;ras Attracta was very well staffed but, none the less, there were major failings in care.</p>  <p>  First, more than 500 reports on residential centres were published in 2014.  We probably only heard about six or seven of those, or perhaps ten, because they were the bad ones but let us not forget about the 490 or so that are very good, and the very good people who provide an excellent standard of care in residential centres.  We should point out as well that before November 2013, there were no inspections.  The sector was totally unregulated.  I do not believe for a second that the problems did not exist during the 14 years in which Deputy Keaveney's party was in office but it did not regulate the sector.  It was left unregulated and people were totally vulnerable and unprotected.  He did not give a damn about them whatsoever.  It is only since November 2013 that the sector is now regulated and properly inspected.  Things are changing now, whereas for 14 years under a Government of which the Deputy's party was involved, which had massive funding available to it, the Government did not even want to look inside those centres to know what was going on.</p></speech>

If he was less focused on providing for the pensions of retired politicians and more enthusiastic about providing resources for people with disability, I would not be asking this question today.

As Deputy O'Sullivan is aware, people in recovery have complex needs and may require multiple interventions from a range of agencies to assist them in their recovery.  The aim of the framework is to provide a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and person-centred approach to rehabilitation based on shared care planning.  The roll-out of the framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's addiction services and the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of the framework, which was piloted in ten sites during 2013, found that both service users and the agencies involved in service provision, expressed a high level of enthusiasm for the framework.  Those participating generally agreed that the objectives of the framework could be achieved if all agencies were committed to inter-agency working.  The committee has developed national protocols under the framework to facilitate inter-agency co-operation.  In addition, competency based training is currently being designed which focuses on key working and care planning.  The intention is to provide training to treatment providers and relevant agencies in 12 task force areas by the end of the year, with the remainder to receive training next year.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am leading the development of a new national drugs strategy after 2016.  The process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  This will provide an opportunity to ensure that our strategic approach into the future continues to be firmly focused on recovery.  I have also asked my Department to examine the feasibility of utilising social impact bonds as a funding model to improve both treatment and rehabilitation service outcomes.  The outcome of this work will inform decisions as to the viability of this approach to maximising the social benefits which the national drugs strategy seeks to achieve.</p></reply>

He heard about the massive profits involved.  It is possible to make &euro;1,000 a week, which beats a summer job packing shelves in one of the local supermarkets.  The Garda is powerless to deal with the Z drugs.  There is a need for a personal detox from benzodiazepines before people can access the official programme.  We know about the street crime, drug paraphernalia and intimidation and the length of time people are on methadone.  In 2010 a Department of Health recommendation suggested suboxone would be used as an alternative to methadone because fewer overdoses occur on it.  We are also aware of the housing and homelessness problems and the dual diagnosis of people presenting with mental health issues, not to mention those in prison who are addicted but sometimes manage to mask that addiction when they are in prison but one must ask what they come out to.</p><p>I have to ask where is the role of the national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee in all of this.

I have visited various drugs task forces around the country, particularly in the Dublin area, since my appointment to this post.  I share the Deputy's concern about how this situation is changing, in that it is worsening and becoming more acute in certain parts of the country and among certain age cohorts.</p>  <p>  Today I will take part in a discussion at a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the issue of decriminalisation of drugs, on which the justice committee wants to initiate a public consultation.  In that, I have a lengthy contribution to make in regard to many of the issues the Deputy has raised.  I am also proposing to have a conference at the end of this month in the Mansion House, with the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, in order to bring together the drugs task forces and people who are working in this sector, because I do not consider that I can wait for the review of the national drugs strategy in order to get a proper snapshot in time as to the nature of the problem we have in Ireland at the moment.  That is on 29 July, and I would appreciate the Deputy's attendance and input into that conference.</p></speech>

The Irish Medicines Board reacted very quickly when fake Viagra appeared on the streets.  We need the same urgency with these drugs.  As the Minister of State knows, the hands of garda&iacute; are tied because these are controlled drugs, and we know that as soon as they are controlled another one will appear.  Therefore, there is a need for urgency each time one of these drugs appears.  We must ensure the legislation is in place so garda&iacute; can tackle this immediately.</p>  <p>  The rehabilitation posts that had been promised through the HSE, which would ensure consistency and quality of service provision, have not appeared.  Prevention and education is a particular baby of mine.  Again, we do not see enough urgency when it comes to that and to listening to the voices of young people.  There is a suggestion that recovery should become the sixth pillar of the national drugs strategy and, again, I hope that will emerge.  While we know that harm reduction measures, including medically supervised injecting rooms, on which we had a presentation recently, are a possibility - we hope it will go forward - recovery is still the optimum.  I would hope to see that as the sixth pillar.</p></speech>

In regard to controlled substances, I found quite disturbing what Inspector Des McTiernan of the inner city drugs task force had to say about the mother who told him it would be almost impossible for him to convince her child to get a minimum wage job in Dunnes when there is &euro;1,000 a week to be made selling certain substances on the street corners of the inner city.  We have a misuse of drugs Bill in front of the House this year and we can use that vehicle to address many of the issues the Deputy has raised.  Certainly, the prevention and education element is crucial.  We have to get away from the idea of victim blaming of young people who have inherited this problem that we have passed on to them.  We have to have a more expansive idea of how we can engage and connect with young people.  The schools system is part of that, but it is not the whole answer because children and young people do not live in schools and are influenced by many of the things that happen around them.</p></speech>

Of the total on outpatient waiting lists in the north east, 43% are referred through Cavan General Hospital and they are awaiting appointments and assessments by orthopaedic surgeons.  There is an urgent need to increase the orthopaedic capacity in the north east.</p></reply>

In January, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatments and outpatient appointments of 18 months by mid-year and 15 months by the end of the year.  As of 30 June, the HSE is reporting a 99.6% achievement against the maximum permissible waiting time for inpatient and day-case treatment and a 96% achievement against the maximum permissible waiting time for outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  In respect of orthopaedic services in the north east, a national initiative was introduced in 2013 which provides physiotherapy triage of patients on orthopaedic OPD waiting lists.  As a result, approximately 40% of patients are getting earlier intervention.  The national trauma programme is also looking at orthopaedic services nationally to determine recommendations for managing both trauma and elective workloads.</p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan and Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital provide the majority of inpatient and day-case elective care for the north east.  Navan Hospital is close to maintaining a six-month inpatient and day-case access time, which is relatively good. Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital has received an additional allocation of &euro;3.8 million this year.  Consequently, activity in 2015 has exceeded 2014 levels and will continue to improve month-on-month to the end of the year.  This has resulted in a gradual reduction in access times.  Both hospitals have met the current maximum permissible waiting time of 18 months at the end of June 2015 and anticipate that they will be compliant with the 15-month maximum permissible waiting time by the end of this year.</p></speech>

In many instances, when people are suffering a particular ailment and are awaiting orthopaedic treatment, this drags down their general health, as the Minister will appreciate better than most in this Chamber.  GPs in the Cavan-Monaghan area tell me that when they refer a patient to, say, Navan, they typically wait up to two years for their first assessment, although that is through no fault of the surgeons in Navan.  In the meantime, their health can deteriorate.</p>  <p>  The patients referred through Cavan General Hospital catchment area make up 90% of the patient waiting list in the north east, and 90% of those are waiting longer than 12 months.  It is a very acute problem in Cavan-Monaghan and I would like some particular initiative to try to deal with this backlog.</p></speech>

On the outpatient waiting list figures, there are about 50,000 people waiting for orthopaedic treatment, but the largest single category within that are waiting less than three months, some 16,000 people.  Approximately 9,800 are waiting three to six months and 14,000 are waiting between six and 12 months.  The number waiting over two years is much lower, but any of those should have been picked up in the last few weeks and should have appointments by now, if they do not already.  If the Deputy knows of cases of people waiting over 18 months, I would be interested to see them.  If the Deputy wants to pass them on to my office, we will certainly check them out, because that should not be the case at this stage.</p></speech>

Cappagh Hospital is an important hospital for the north east, as well as the hospitals in Navan and Drogheda.  My understanding is that two years ago or less there was a reduction in bed capacity at Cappagh.  Did the Minister say the capacity had been increased in Cappagh?</p>  <p>  A comment was made to me by one GP that if GPs were in a position to carry out injections into joints, in many instances that could ease people's pain and suffering.  As the cost of this injection is quite high, the typical GP in a small practice with a patient on a medical card would not be in a position to provide that service without some additional remuneration.  The point made to me was that it could ease the immediate suffering for the patient concerned and perhaps also ease pressure in terms of referrals to hospitals.  It might be considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900007#E01100"><p>As the Deputy knows, GPs can inject joints, provided they are sufficiently trained to do so.  They often do not do it for medical card patients because it is not economical to do so.  One of the items that will be under discussion in the new contract talks with the IMO, which are due to start shortly, is that of changes to what are called special-type consultations - the additional fees that GPs get for suturing a wound, injecting a joint and the like.  That is certainly one of the things that can be negotiated as part of the new contract.</p>  <p>  Because of the budget cuts, Cappagh was very restricted last year and, at one point, only two of the seven theatres were open.  Now, because of the additional finance we got this year, of which Cappagh got an extra &euro;3.8 million, four or five of the seven theatres are functioning.</p><p>That has allowed it to increase capacity.  I would like to get them all open but the issue we are not running into in Cappagh is a shortage of theatre nurses.  That is a further barrier but there is an increase in activity.</p></speech>

Why is it that in 2015 mental health spending <i>per capita</i>in the Wexford-Waterford region is &euro;148 compared to &euro;223 in Carlow-Kilkenny-south Tipperary, &euro;198 in Mayo and &euro;206 in Galway-Roscommon?  Will the Minister explain the regional variation?  Given that Wexford has one of the highest suicide rates in the country, I find it difficult to understand why there is such a discrepancy.</p></reply>

This was influenced by the location of major mental health institutions and different priorities on the part of health boards over the years.  </p><p>The establishment of the HSE mental health division in mid-2013 created a national management structure for all mental health services.  In 2014, the division commenced a process of developing financial information specific to mental health services.  This exercise included the validation and costing of approximately 9,000 staff working in HSE mental health services nationwide, representing about 80% of total spending on mental health services.  This work is continuing.  As there is no single financial ICT system available to the HSE, such validation is labour intensive and difficult to achieve with full accuracy.</p><p>This financial analysis has been combined with population figures adjusted for deprivation to inform decisions regarding the allocation of new funding in 2014 and 2015.  In this way, the HSE mental health division is moving towards population-based funding through reassigning discretionary funding in favour of comparatively under-funded services.  The information and methodology will continue to be refined in order to support funding allocations and arrive at a situation where mental health spending <i>per capita</i>is more consistent.  It is recognised that such allocation processes have to be phased in to allow time for costs to be adjusted in line with national norms.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 22548/15, the HSE in its reply of 30 June 2015 gave detailed financial information for mental health, broken down by geographic area for the years 2013-15, inclusive.  I will arrange to have a copy of this information sent to the Deputy.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Government has made significant efforts to prioritise and modernise mental health care nationally.  While the concept of geographic equity is to the fore in allocation decisions, other practical realities have to be taken into consideration such as the need to address delays in accessing services and the need to introduce alternative community based models of care.</p></reply>

I am aware there is more positive thinking about how this issue should be dealt with.  In 2006, A Vision for Change was launched on the basis of 8% of the health budget being spent on mental health when in fact it only reached 7.2%.  It has since been cut back to 5.2%.  According to the World Health Organization, mental health illness accounts for more than 15% of the disease burden in developed countries.  It is reckoned that 11% of Irish people have personally experienced mental health problems.  I agree that putting resources into the community is the way forward.  In Wexford, there are four units that work well and are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  After 5 p.m., people have to go to an accident and emergency unit in Wexford and if they are referred to Waterford, they have to go through the accident and emergency unit there before eventually being admitted to an acute unit.  Until we sort out the services in the community, will the Minister agree that in the meantime there is a need for acute units in Wexford?</p></speech>

The reality is that some health care is more expensive than others.  One of the areas that is enormously expensive is cancer because of the cost of the new medicines that become available every year.  Even though fewer people may have cancer than have mental health problems, the cost of treating each cancer patient is always going to be very much higher than the cost of treating somebody with common mental illnesses, such as depression.  That is an issue that needs to be borne in mind in setting financial targets.</p>  <p>  In terms of actual cash, the mental health budget for 2012 was &euro;711 million; in 2013, it increased to &euro;737 million; in 2014, it was 766 million; and in 2015, it is &euro;792 million.  It is clear there has been a substantial increase in non-capital funding for mental health in recent years.  I am sure it is not enough but it is a significant increase during a period when so many other things have been cut back.</p></speech>

Today, there are just 44 because St. Senan's has closed and the population has increased by 20,000 in the region.  I am aware there are five beds in Newcastle in north Wicklow.  It appears that the service in Wexford has decreased.  Most of the indicators show that Wexford is a more deprived region than most and with almost 24% unemployment, one can understand why that is the case.  On the ground, there is significant concern that the resources available are not matching demand.  Perhaps the Government would look at the issue again and see whether something can be done even in the short term.</p></speech>

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  In 2015, the scheme has an allocation of &euro;993 million.  In budget 2015, additional funding of &euro;25 million was provided to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressures on, acute hospitals.  Of this &euro;25 million, some &euro;10 million was used to provide an additional 300 places under the fair deal scheme.  This reduced the waiting time for approved applicants from 17 weeks to four weeks.  Some &euro;8 million was used to provide access to an additional 115 short-stay beds across the Dublin area, &euro;5 million was used to provide 400 additional home care packages which will benefit 600 people in the course of the year, and &euro;2 million was used to expand the community intervention team services in primary care across Dublin and the surrounding region. </p>  <p>  In April 2015, the Government provided a further &euro;74 million to address issues that impact on delayed discharges.  This amount was in addition to &euro;25 million provided earlier and was allocated as follows.  Some &euro;44 million was allocated to the nursing homes support scheme to provide an additional 1,600 places and to further reduce waiting times for approved applicants from 11 to four weeks.  This funding will allow the HSE to increase the rate of approvals during periods of increased demand, including any surge during the winter months so as to maintain the waiting time for approved applicants at no more than four weeks.  In the coming months, the number of people supported under the scheme will increase on an ongoing basis.  The scheme will be supporting in excess of 23,900 people by the end of 2015.  The remaining &euro;30 million was principally applied to provide additional transitional beds, some of which were on a temporary basis to address the particular pressures then being experienced by acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  When the nursing homes support scheme commenced, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  This review is considering the scheme's long-term viability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want and need.  The review of the scheme is almost completed and is expected to be published shortly.</p></reply>

Are those accurate?  When does he expect to be able to publish the recommendations and what might he expect to be in them?  There are indications that additional finance will be required from clients of the scheme.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Minister spoke a few weeks ago about unmet needs in the health service and indicated that up to &euro;1 billion in additional funding might be required this year.  I asked the Taoiseach about this the other day and he seemed to indicate that there might be a supplementary budget before the end of the year for 2015.  Will that include the Fair Deal scheme?  The Minister is aware of the work of ALONE and the Home First campaign, which indicates very clearly that many more seniors would do well at home if the Minister were able to put more money into home supports and home care packages.  There is a long waiting list for that.</p></speech>

The Fair Deal review is done and I expect it to be published in the next few weeks.  It does not so much make recommendations as suggest different things that could be done to make the scheme more sustainable in the years to come.  It then makes recommendations about alternative ways of funding home care in a better way.  There are lots of other things like that and it is quite an interesting report.  The report also addresses some of the unfairness that may exist, particularly for self-employed people and farmers, in the way people are assessed for the Fair Deal scheme, and makes recommendations in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the ALONE campaign, it is absolutely our preference that people stay at home for as long as possible.  By and large, it is also less expensive to provide a home care package than to provide a Fair Deal place.  The proportion of people aged over 65 going in to nursing homes is actually falling, notwithstanding that the raw numbers are increasing.  That is illustrative of the fact that better home care is now available.</p></speech>

The waiting time for the Fair Deal scheme has decreased significantly, to four or five weeks, but what does the Minister intend to do about the waiting time for home care packages themselves?  Does that form part of the amount the Minister was thinking of in terms of unmet needs?</p></speech>

The waiting time for a package varies from region to region quite significantly, which is a real difficulty.  The HSE has been given flexibility to spend more on home care packages where it is running into trouble in staffing units.  Where the HSE cannot get nursing staff to open a community unit, it can divert funding to additional home care packages.  That is actually being done.</p></speech>

Persons presenting, for example, with intoxication, overdose, confusion or self-harm require assistance with these issues and, while there may be an allied psychiatric condition, other aspects of their care will fall to the emergency department to deal with first.  Acute mental-health units, such as the Ashlin unit, are not designed or staffed to deal with these issues.  Direct admission to a psychiatric bed without a thorough medical assessment would constitute a significant risk for patients.  As there are no plans to include an out-of-hours assessment centre at the unit, persons presenting with complex issues are first assessed in the emergency department.</p>  <p>  North Dublin mental health services work in partnership with Beaumont Hospital liaison psychiatry and the emergency department so that the needs of individuals requiring mental health services are co-ordinated to ensure optimised patient care.  Two nurses assigned to the self-harm programme of the mental health service work in the emergency department.  An additional self-harm nurse at clinical nurse specialist level is also being recruited.  It is acknowledged that north Dublin mental health services have recently experienced some difficulties in terms of bed capacity.  However, the HSE is working proactively to address these issues, with the number of available acute beds being kept under review and the recent approval of funding to facilitate onward discharges to community placement.  The Ashlin Centre currently has 38 psychiatric adult beds, of which 37 are occupied.  Approval is being sought for a further ten beds for 2016 as part of the ongoing development of north Dublin mental health services.</p></speech>

The accident and emergency department is already overstretched, but when one has psychiatric patients as well as ordinary patients attending, there can be problems.  Unfortunately, there have been some negative incidents.  Staff are trying to work and do their jobs, but unfortunately one staff member was stabbed.  It is horrific.  It does not feel like a safe environment if something like that could happen.  There is an absence of 24-7 assessment for mental health patients.  They should be getting the help and care they need.  Can the Minister address that?</p></speech>

It is not just mental health patients who can attack staff or other patients.  It is a very sad feature of our health service that sometimes patients attack staff.  It can be true for ambulance crew and even reception staff.  It is an unfortunate reality that we have to face all the time.  When psychiatric patients present in emergency departments, they generally do so with other problems also.  A patient may have had an overdose, which is a medical toxicological issue that must be dealt with first.  A patient may have injured himself, cut his wrists, tried to hang himself, even tried to shoot himself or done some other form of harm to himself.  A patient can also present with very severe medical problems because he has not been looking after himself due to his psychiatric illness.  For example, he may have a very bad infection.  All of those things must be dealt with first.  It is not the case that someone with a mental illness can be shipped straight to the psych ward.  It should never have been done that way.  When a patient has medical, surgical or other problems, it is important that those are dealt with first and the patient is medically cleared before he goes to the psych ward.</p></speech>

It is a particular feature of psychiatric hospitals and care homes and it can also be a feature in emergency departments.  It is not particular to the health service; it happens to garda&iacute;, prison officers and teachers also.  It is never acceptable for public servants to be assaulted by their clients, but it is a reality of the environment in which dedicated public servants have to work.</p><p>In terms of the 24-7 service, I am advised that the service currently has two nurses assigned to the self-harm programme working in the emergency department.  One is a qualified clinical nurse specialist, CNS, and the other is working in an acting capacity.  One of the nurses works a seven-day fortnight roster, which is a 12-hour shift, and the other staff member works a 5-7 roster, which is 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  A further appointment of a self-harm nurse at clinical nurse specialist level is being progressed via the national recruitment service, NRS, panel and it will be filled in the near future. </p> <p> I do not know if it is the case for Beaumont but it would be the norm for a large hospital like that to have a psychiatry doctor on-call at all times but that doctor may not be called until the patient's medical issues are dealt with first.</p></speech>

The important point here is that work is being undertaken to strengthen services in Portlaoise hospital from a patient safety and quality perspective and also to ensure that services that are viable are safety assured and appropriately resourced and that services that are not viable or cannot be made safe are discontinued.</p>  <p>  Detailed planning is under way for staff to develop the best clinical services for all patients.  Consultation is ongoing this month with the national clinical leads for medicine, surgery, critical care, patient transport, emergency medicine, obstetrics and paediatrics, as well as the national ambulance service.  Further consultation with local general practitioners, GPs, is expected to begin this month and other stakeholders will also be engaged.</p>  <p>  Decisions will be made on the basis of ensuring patient safety and getting best outcomes for patients, not financial or political considerations.  Any change to services at Portlaoise, including emergency department services, will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation within the hospital group.</p></speech>

A number of public representatives met him in his office a few weeks ago and I thank him for meeting a bigger group that he may have thought would arrive on that occasion.  He indicated then that he expected to have a report from the HSE within three or four weeks.  Can he advise when he expects to receive it?  He referred to planning, negotiations and consultations in his reply and that sounds as if it is a long way off yet and will not happen in the immediate future.  He might indicate the timescale he envisages for this.</p>  <p>  As the Minister said, consultation is taking place with the GPs.  He will know that they issued a letter publicly on this issue in recent days and it is important that it be taken into account.  We all agree that patient safety is the first and foremost issue and that quality of service and outcome for patients is the most important issue.  The Minister spoke about the demands in other hospitals in the context of his consideration of the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise hospital.  He must know that the accident and emergency departments in Naas and Tallaght hospitals are totally overcrowded, all the more reason to maintain the 24-hour service in Portlaoise hospital.  We need adequate cover for that.</p></speech>

That is down to the fact that so much consultation has to take place with everyone who is affected, not only the staff in the hospital but GPs in the area and, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, the impacts that this may have on other hospitals such as those in Naas, Tallaght and Tullamore.  I am told it could be September before a plan of action will be ready.  I have seen the letter from the Laois GPs.  I was pleased to note they called for the HIQA report to be implemented but of course reports have to be implemented in full, not only the parts of them that one likes while leaving out the parts that one does not like.</p>  <p>  Part of the under-six contract was that we made it a stipulation that anyone getting such a contract would have to be a member of a specialist register for general practitioners because we do not think it is acceptable that somebody who is not on the specialist register should work as a GP and treat children for their ailments.  Yet we do see it as acceptable in Ireland that we can staff emergency departments with people who are not on the specialist register for emergency medicine.  It is an issue up and down the country that we allow so many of our centres not to be staffed with specialists.  The reality is that there may not be sufficient specialists available to staff them all with specialists.  Therefore, are we willing to accept an inferior level of care?</p></speech>

I believe the Minister accepts that people locally welcome the improvements in the maternity services that have flown from the HIQA report.  Essentially, we want the same level of determination to be shown to make the accident and emergency service safe.  If the HSE and HIQA cannot stand over it being safe, the issue is to make it safe; the issue is not to close it, or close it for half of the day or half of the 24 hour period.  The Minister will be aware that between 25% and one third of admissions to the accident and emergency department are paediatric cases as a result of the large paediatric unit, and the maternity services, in the hospital.  To ensure that the hospital works fully, it is essential that it has permanent consultant cover.  I do not believe there is a permanent consultant covering the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise and that is a central issue that must be addressed.</p></speech>

The key issue is consultant cover.  Having met the Minister and discussed that issue with him, and I thank him for the meeting with the public representatives from the County Laois area, he will be aware of that.  Portlaoise hospital has only 24 hours per week temporary, part-time consultant cover.  That is not satisfactory, and the GPs have gone to great lengths to explain that.  In terms of throughput over the years, Portlaoise hospital had 38,000 attendances through its emergency department while Tullamore hospital had, on average, about two thirds of that figure.  The general practitioners have outlined clearly the interdependency of the other important parts of the hospital, including the maternity and paediatric services, on the emergency department.  Its paediatric unit is very busy and is one of the top eight in the country.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration in his deliberations.</p></speech>

We have very large emergency departments in this country with four and five emergency department consultants who are not in the departments after 6 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night.  They are on-call from home or, in some cases, they will not cover weekends.  Even with four or five consultants, either because of unwillingness or too onerous a rota, we do not have 24-7 consultant cover.  I am not sure we have that in any emergency department in Ireland; they are probably on-call from home.</p>  <p>  We have only a limited number of specialists, and we have to consider the level of patient safety risks we are willing to accept.  If it is not possible to recruit people to cover a special service 24-7, or if there are not enough patients for them to keep up their skills in which case they cease to become specialists, we have to decide if we are unwilling to accept an inferior and non-specialist service just because it is local, and that is not particular to Portlaoise as it also applies elsewhere.  One of the big struggles that will happen in Portlaoise is hiring the additional consultants for obstetrics and paediatrics.  We need those additional consultants in obstetrics and paediatrics to ensure there is senior cover in that unit, but what if we cannot recruit them?  We have serious difficulties recruiting people.  The Rotunda hospital advertised two jobs not that long ago and did not get any applicants.  We need to have a very serious conversation with the public as to what we do if it is not possible to staff units with specialists.  Are we willing to accept an inferior service on that basis?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900018#Q00200"><p>I am not sure whether the T&aacute;naiste is aware of the many devastating cases that we are hearing about in e-mails and from constituents that are demonstrating the impact on so many families across the country of the cut to the one-parent family allowance that was brought in on 1 July.  I received a heart-rending e-mail last week from a woman who has been working since she was 14 years of age.  In recent times she has had to move back to her parents' home because of the cuts to rent allowance and her inability to afford rent.  Her lowest point was going to the post office recently and realising that her payment had been cut from &euro;150 to &euro;81.  She describes the impact of this cut.  Of course, there is no increase in her wages.  She will require close to &euro;50 to pay for petrol to go to work.  She wrote that what the Government has done is to make her feel ashamed and humiliated because she is a lone parent.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste has heard similar sentiments, because the woman's view was "What does the T&aacute;naiste care?  Her aim is to liberate lone parents."  The woman wrote that the Government had just set her back years and she was ashamed of it.</p>  <p>  Equally, the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, finds the T&aacute;naiste's cuts indefensible.  In an e-mail to his constituents who have contacted him about this matter, he stated that he voted for this in 2012 because he was told that the promised child care system would be in place before the last and most severe of the changes.  Then he wrote that there had been angry debate at parliamentary party meetings on the issue and that he simply failed to see how cutting the income of the very people who are making a real effort to improve the lot of their families and themselves helps them in any way to get out of the poverty trap, when it clearly has the opposite effect.  He stated that he would continue to press for a reversal of this bad decision.  He finally stated that he did not blame the constituents for withdrawing support for the party, but he would continue to try to convince those who are making decisions.  Clearly, Deputy Stagg has not convinced the T&aacute;naiste, the person who has made the decision that has caused genuine suffering to many.</p>  <p>  I have come across other cases.  A 53 year old man earning &euro;200 is now getting no lone parent payment and, because he is self-employed, he gets no family income supplement, FIS.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government refused to reform benefits for lone parents.  John Downing was on radio in recent times recalling a discussion with one of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for social protection.  Notwithstanding the advice in those days of the OECD and others that lone parents were the people most at risk of poverty in Irish society, and the fact that this was a time when there was a lot of money to spend on social welfare, Fianna F&aacute;il chose not to undertake any kind of reform.</p><p>Through a combination of approximately 19 hours per week of work and the family income supplement, FIS, the purpose of this reform, which is in its third year, is to lift the situation for lone parents and bring their income up above &euro;400 per week, depending on the number of children they have and the hourly rate at which they are employed.  For a lone parent, for instance, who would only be on one-parent family allowance for himself or herself and one child, that would work out at the moment at an average of about &euro;220 per week.  I think most people in the House would agree that is a very low income.  However, if a lone parent raises his or her hours to 19 per week at the minimum wage and receives FIS as well, his or her income would rise to over &euro;400 per week.  Now, if this House and this society and country are serious-----</p></speech>

Almost a month has passed since the staff and concession holders of Clerys were turfed out onto the street by liquidators.  All they have received from the Labour Party so far is a two-faced response.  The T&aacute;naiste and her Government colleagues have described the actions of the new employers as absolutely despicable, insensitive and appalling.  The T&aacute;naiste borrowed a phrase from the failed Labour Party leader in England, Ed Miliband, when she said that these actions represented predatory capitalism.  Her comments stand in contrast with what the other face of the Labour Party, the Minister of State for inertia, Deputy Nash, said when he published his report on the liquidation of Clerys earlier this week.  Even though the report in question provides a textbook analysis of a tactical insolvency delivered with merciless precision, astoundingly the Minister of State has said there is nothing to see here.  Shockingly, he has also said there are no deficiencies at all in the legislative framework.  If the State is on the hook for millions of euro with regard to the redundancies of workers who have been treated in a despicable manner, how in God's name can anybody accept that there are no deficiencies in the legislative framework in this State?  The truth is that the legislation in this State, under the stewardship of this Government, incentivises ruthless employers to go down the route of separating out companies so that they can use tactical insolvency to insulate themselves from their responsibilities to this State and to their workers.  The T&aacute;naiste's approach of talking tough while doing nothing is tactical deception on her part.  The strong words she used yesterday contrast sharply with the inertia of the Minister of State.  There is a disagreement here.  Who is right?  Is everything fine and dandy with regard to legislation, or will the Government legislate to resolve this case?</p></speech>

I want to say formally on the record of the D&aacute;il that I thank SIPTU for making its premises available to facilitate the Department of Social Protection going in and giving very extensive help and assistance to workers in relation to their entitlements.  The people who come first at the moment are the workers.  They should get those redundancy and insolvency entitlements which are their right in law as soon as possible.

Some very broad and deep legal issues are arising from the manner in which this insolvency was structured.  I refer to the group structure of companies.  The Deputy needs to be very careful with what he is suggesting.  The use of group structures by companies in Ireland goes back practically forever - certainly back to the 1940s - in company law.  There is nothing improper in having a group structure, but there is everything wrong - just as there is with tax avoidance, particularly aggressive tax avoidance - in manufacturing a situation which results in a company in the group apparently achieving a very significant price for the property part of the group, while leaving the operational side of the group, which employs the workers and the concessionaires, bereft and insolvent of funds.  It is a very clever and aggressive scheme of company law planning.  We have ways of addressing those issues in tax law.  A number of issues are being addressed by the Revenue Commissioners at the moment.  I want to make it clear that this process will have at least two parts.  The message I want to send to people who have been working and giving great service in Clerys over many decades is that their redundancy payments, which are funded through the social insurance that has been willingly paid by them and by everyone else in this country, are secure.  Unfortunately, these payments will be made at a minimum rate and not at the rate they might have got if the company had reached an agreement with the workers, which would have been right and proper in this case.  I do not want the Deputy to sow doubts in people's minds that their payments are not secure.</p></speech>

The important and significant report that has been put together by the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, sets out in clinical detail the sequence of the history of the events that happened.  It also sets out how and where company law operates in Ireland at the moment.  We will have a very detailed examination of company law and of what actions may be taken to ensure we address this situation.  First of all, we have to look after the workers.

The fact is that both the State and the workers are getting stuffed over and over again.  We have complete inertia from the Labour Party with regard to its response.  If I have to paint it out clearly and simply for the T&aacute;naiste again, I will do so.  A number of purchases in 2012 and 2015 have been about maximising property profits and minimising responsibility to employees.  Gordon Brothers walked away from the sale of  Clerys with approximately &euro;15 million.  Natrium has bought a prime development opportunity worth multiples of what it has invested.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, has said he is satisfied that Gordon Brothers and Natrium are not required under company law to cough up with regard to employees' entitlements.  Is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that they are not forced to do so?  If we do not resolve this through legislation, we will be back here in six months talking about another firm.  It is clear that there is a flaw in the existing framework.  The question is whether the Labour Party will challenge that flaw.</p><p>Will the Labour Party fix that flaw?  For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in has already tabled legislation on this issue, but it has not received the support of the Labour Party.</p> <p> We are told that this matter has been referred to the Company Law Review Group.  This group last met in February and the items it has been asked to consider do not include a review of section 224 of the Companies Act 2014 or tactical insolvencies.  The fact that it has not been asked to do this yet is alarming.  Such situations are happening repeatedly, and in large numbers, but this practice is not being challenged.  The Minister of State says in his report that section 224 imposes a duty on directors in respect of company employees.  What is the specific provision in that section and where is the precedent?  When will the Company Law Review Group meet to discuss the legal issues arising from the Clerys situation?  When will it be charged with reviewing the existing company law framework, or are we to have another example of duplicity with strong robust rhetoric from the Government but nothing being done?</p></speech>

They are not before the court because they committed a heinous crime, but because they are homeless.  They are homeless due to the decisions of this Government.  The Government has shown the same disregard to people on rent supplement, who are facing massive hikes in rent, as it has shown to lone parents.</p>  <p>  Alan suffers from serious epilepsy.  He was in a coma in Tallaght hospital and had to quit his job.  Kelly is now his full-time carer.  They are two of the nicest people one could meet.  Their previous landlord sold their house so they were forced to move out.  Like many others, they did everything they could to find somewhere else to live.  However, they simply could not find a landlord who would accept rent supplement or a rent they could afford.  As no suitable accommodation was offered by South Dublin County Council, like others they were forced to sleep in a tent.  They decided to bring the problem to the council's door by sleeping in its offices overnight a couple of weeks ago.  The council went to the High Court to seek an injunction to force them out of the offices.  Is this what we have come to?  Does the T&aacute;naiste stand over a situation where councils are going to the High Court to seek injunctions against homeless people because they do not have sufficient emergency accommodation for them?</p>  <p>  Since a court case a week and a half ago, the couple have been sleeping in a tent in Sean Walsh Memorial Park.  They have also stayed in emergency accommodation.  The conditions in the emergency accommodation are horrific.  In the first place they stayed, the entrance was blocked with rubbish, the mattresses were covered in urine and mould was growing on the windows.  In the next place, there was vomit and food on the floor and unwashed mattresses.  Alan and Kelly are not criminals.  They are simply homeless as a result of decisions made not by them but by others.  However, they are treated like criminals.  Their situation, as Alan described it to me yesterday, is like an open prison, with curfews, no cooking facilities and no individual freedom.  They are not alone.  There are 3,000 people in a similar situation, 1,000 of whom are children.  The T&aacute;naiste is responsible for a significant part of this problem by refusing to increase the rent supplement caps while also refusing to introduce rent controls.  Will she now review this decision?</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, there is a hole of &euro;18.5 million in Dublin city's budget for homelessness services.  Will the Government give a commitment to fill that hole?  Will it investigate the conditions in emergency accommodation and commit itself to improving them?  Finally, will the T&aacute;naiste take note of the housing activists who have taken matters in their own hands?  They have taken over a hostel owned by Dublin City Council on Bolton Street, which was just left there.  They have refurbished it and are opening it to house homeless people.  If they can do that with no resources and as volunteers, given the hundreds of empty NAMA properties throughout the State and in south Dublin why cannot the State take the same action to provide emergency accommodation and social and affordable housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900022#T02800"><p>First, with regard to Alan and Kelly, if the Deputy has been advising them as constituents, I strongly suggest that he ask them to get in touch with the community welfare service in the area.  That has been the consistent advice to people in housing difficulties.  They should go and talk to the community welfare service, which has complete discretion with regard to the amount of rent that may be paid.  At this point, there have been well over 1,000 cases dealt with by the community welfare service.  A total of 1,200 cases are in the Dublin local authority areas and 700 to 800 are throughout the rest of the country.  I am surprised if the Deputy has been dealing with the case, as I would hope he would advise the couple to contact the community welfare service.  In addition, in the six months of this year so far, there have been 6,000 renegotiated or new rent supplement tenancies.</p><p>The bulk of these are in Dublin.  It is not the best option to go homeless.  It is much better to deal with the community welfare service to see if a property can be accessed that suits the needs of the individuals in question.  As I stated, we have done this in approximately 6,000 cases so far this year, specifically for people under threat of homelessness for the reasons the Deputy outlined.  We have done it specifically in approximately 1,200 cases in the Dublin local authorities.</p> <p> I met recently with representatives of the Simon Community, Threshold and other housing bodies, all of which agree that the protocol is working well.  Therefore, I strongly recommend the protocol to Deputy Murphy and Alan and Kelly as a way of perhaps assisting them.  I do not know what Alan and Kelly's precise requirements are but given that Alan has been ill, the couple probably needs specific provision. </p> <p> On the overall provision for homelessness, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has provided &euro;55.5 million in Exchequer funding for homeless services managed by housing authorities and overseen by the Department.</p></speech>

This is a significant number and a further 2,000 protocol arrangements have been reached to prevent homelessness by renegotiating tenancy arrangements for families at risk of losing their homes.  This is also significant.  The community welfare service is available to assist with cases, as is Threshold and a number of the housing organisations.</p><p>The Deputy referred to the local authority, Dublin City Council, closing a premises that could be used for homeless people.<b></b>The practice by local authorities of closing up and voiding premises that become vacant is wrong, as the Minister has indicated on many occasions. </p></speech>

However, according to the records available from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the number of local authority social houses built under this Government is the lowest in the history of the State.  Every single year in this Government's term has seen fewer social houses built than in any other year on record.  That is the truth.  The Government can make all the housing announcements it wants but building local authority houses to get people off the housing waiting list, including the 8,500 people, Alan and Kelly included, on South Dublin County Council's waiting list, is the only way to fundamentally address the housing crisis.  The Government is doing nothing to solve the problem apart from making announcements.</p>  <p>  In terms of the case of Alan and Kelly and 3,000 other cases, the T&aacute;naiste's advice is to recommend that people avoid going homeless.  We, too, recommend to people that they should not go homeless and people recommend to themselves that they should not go homeless.  People do not want to be homeless and they do not end up in homelessness lightly or without having made contact with a community welfare officer and doing everything else they possibly can.  However, when a landlord is selling a property, the tenants must move out and many are unable to find somewhere else to go.  Alan and Kelly are in contact with South Dublin County Council on a daily basis.  They currently have emergency accommodation because other people were cleared off the homeless list, which will now fill up again.  The advice they are receiving is not that they will be allocated a house but that they should find a landlord who will take the housing assistance payment.  They cannot find any landlords who will take the HAP and they are not the only people in that position. </p></speech>

More and more people will take matters into their own hands.  How many more will be injuncted to prevent them from staying in council premises if they bring the issue to their local council's doorsteps, which is where people first interact when they have a housing problem?  Other housing activists will take over, open up and bring people into National Asset Management Agency buildings.  The crime in this case is that the State is not doing this with empty properties.  Despite NAMA having control of 12% of hotels in the State, the Government has not opened these properties to deal with the crisis.  It should then build homes to deal with the long-term housing and homelessness crises.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900024#V00900"><p>The National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 is an important Bill which both the T&aacute;naiste and I want to see delivered upon.  Ireland has suffered massively in the last number of years with regard to low pay, which has become entrenched.  There is a precariat in society consisting of those who cannot get proper employment or, at least, the hours they need to support their families.  I have proposed a large number of amendments to the Bill, as have other Members.  We are coming towards the end of the term and there is a shovelling through of legislation.  Not enough space is available to give to the debate, with the result that we will have deficient legislation.  I ask that more time be provided to discuss the Bill and, as such, I cannot agree with the proposal to deal with No. 38.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900024#V01000"><p>I am glad the Deputy is supportive of the Bill, which is incredibly important to people on low pay.  As T&aacute;naiste, I am delighted that I have focused particularly in the House on the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and getting the work on precarious hours up and running.  We expect the Low Pay Commission report and the report of the University of Limerick on precarious pay and zero-hour contracts to be available to us fairly shortly.  We need to get the Bill through, notwithstanding the Deputy's interest and contribution to the debate.  The contributions of Members have been very valuable.  We have had a great deal of debate on the Bill.  There was repeated discussion and debate on some of the amendments, which used up a lot of time that might properly have been devoted to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment.  That is how the House addressed how the amendments were dealt with.  As we expect that the Low Pay Commission will release its report shortly, I want to see the legislation being passed.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's support for the Bill and his contribution to the debate, as well as the valuable contributions of others, we need to get the legislation into law so that we can proceed to implement improvements in the statutory minimum wage in Ireland and move to a living wage.  That is the big picture.  While I appreciate the Deputy's problems with regard to his own amendments, we should look at the big picture and how the Bill will help people on low pay if we get it dealt with today.</p></speech>

The position was that for anybody wishing to transition from one gender to another there was an objectionable obstacle, namely, a medical assessment.  Following various representations, and I recognise the distance the Government has come in this regard, that was removed for people from the age of 18 upwards.  </p><p>Representations had been made to the Government regarding the position of people aged between 16 and 18 for whom originally no provision was made.  Ultimately, they were included in the legislation but subject to some severe restrictions.  They have to overcome a number of obstacles in order to apply for gender transfer, including proof of identity, proof of birth, statutory declaration, parental consent, order of the Circuit Court, another certificate as well as the medical report from both a medical practitioner and an endocrinologist or, alternatively, a psychiatrist.</p><p>I am seeking to remove the medical assessment in so far as those aged 16 to 18 are concerned.  That it is required flies in the face of all the evidence and studies.  I quoted one study on Committee Stage from the United Kingdom which found that only 4% of people come to the realisation they are the wrong gender by the time they reach the age of 18, and 76% of them become aware of this before they leave primary school.</p><p>In my opinion, people of any age should be entitled to transition.  For people under the age of 18, the practice would be that they would be doing so at the behest of a parent or guardian.  There can be no serious suggestion that a parent or guardian would undertake such a process lightly.  In some countries, for example, Argentina, it is possible to transition under the age of 16, again at the behest of a parent or guardian.  That has not caused any great problems in practice.  </p> <p> On the amendments, while I recognise I will not get any concessions today for people under the age of 16 years, I am asking that the obstacle of a medical statement in respect of people aged between 16 and 18 years be removed.  I do not think that is an onerous ask of the Government, recognising that it has already come a fair distance.  This Bill has been in gestation for a lengthy period.  It follows on from the decision of the European Court of Justice, many reports and various drafts of legislation and so on.  This has been a lengthy process.  It is unlikely we will return to this issue again in the short term.  In light of all of the effort that has gone into this legislation and the number of changes that the Government has already, wisely, made, I believe it should go this one step further in relation to 16 to 18 year olds.  This would not require significant alteration of the legislation.  There are many obstacles in the path of a person aged between 16 and 18 years.  Given that usually people realise at a much younger age than 16 years that they are in the wrong gender, it is desirable that the Government would accept these amendments.</p> <p> The Minister of State will, no doubt, respond that there is a clause in the Bill which provides for a review after two years.  Perhaps he will elaborate on what exactly that review will entail.  Will it automatically entail amending legislation if that is deemed to be necessary?  I think it will be necessary.  We were late legislating in this area.  However, being late gives us the advantage of having an opportunity to review what other jurisdictions have done.  Jurisdictions that have recently legislated in this area have gone a good bit beyond what we are now proposing.  I anticipate that we will have to revisit this legislation to make some of the changes that we could make today and that people will suffer as a result of us not having made them today.  </p> <p> In my view, there should be no need for a medical statement in respect of persons aged between 16 and 18 years of age.  This provision should be removed and transition should be possible at any age at the behest of a parent or guardian.  As I said earlier, this is not a process that would be undertaken lightly.  I am seeking removal of the requirement for a medical statement in respect of 16 to 18 year olds.  In my opinion, this is a very minor demand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900026#Y00200"><p>Deputy O'Dea's proposal in respect of people over 16 years of age but under the age set down in this particular Bill is very reasonable.  During the debate on the heads of this Bill and on Committee Stage, we debated the various onuses this Bill accords at different ages.  I acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in the past number of years in terms of the approach of the State to this issue, as reflected in the Bill.  However, I do not believe the legislation goes far enough.  We now have an opportunity to be a world trendsetter in this area, such that other countries would look to us as an example of best practice in this area, just as in the past we have looked to other countries such as Argentina.  Denmark was the first European country to allow a legal change of gender without medical statement.  We have learned from that change made by Denmark two years ago.  We are close to being one of the first countries to address this issue, although much has changed since this process first commenced.  It would be a pity if we did not recognise that people usually know from a very young age, in many cases without medical practitioners or their parents knowing, what gender they are.  People are often assigned a gender by society which does not really take account of who they are.</p>  <p>  In refusing to accept these amendments proposed by Deputy O'Dea, the Government is forcing 16 and 17 year olds, at a time that can be very traumatic in the life of any teenager, to wait a further two years to transition.  While having to wait another two years might not be a burden for those of us who are into the second half of a century, for young people it is a burden.  This could lead to further problems for them in school, in society or even at home.  The amendments do not go as far I would go but they are a half-way measure.  It would be appropriate for the Minister of State to make some changes at this stage rather than wait a number of years until this legislation is reviewed to do so.  In my opinion, given the major changes being introduced in this Bill, and the fact that we cannot anticipate how it will work in practice, we will have to revisit it in the future.  We had all hoped we would have the opportunity to celebrate the victory of the marriage equality referendum in the context of its implications for this Bill but we have not been able to do so.  It is hoped we will have an opportunity to do so when the marriage equality legislation has been published.  It is possible that various provisions of that Bill will impact on this legislation, thus requiring us to revisit this Bill sooner than originally intended.  Perhaps, during debate on the marriage equality legislation and the outcome of the referendum, the opportunity will be taken to review whether some of the proposals we have put forward in the amendments before the House today can be taken on board.  </p>  <p>  Many groups have worked tirelessly on this issue, in particular Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, which advocates on behalf of people who have been wrongly assigned a gender by the State or were wrongly diagnosed at a young age by medical professionals to be of a certain gender.  As far as I am aware, TENI is happy with the progress we have made but, like me, it believes we could have gone a lot further.  I recently reviewed the observations of the Equality Authority on the revised general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.</p><p>Some of the points we are making today were set out in that document, which shows how long the issues are being teased out not only by Members of this House, but also by concerned organisations.  Those organisations are urging us to get the legislation right, just in case we never come back to it or it is years before we do so.</p> <p> I acknowledge the commitment by the Government to review the provision in two years.  That is a saving grace in some ways, but I am mindful that I have heard many such commitments in this House.  We should perhaps note that there is emergency legislation from the Second World War still on our Statute Book, namely, the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  Just because there is an undertaking to review this Bill in two years time, there is no guarantee it will actually happen.  Who can know whether the Minister of State or any other Member will be here then?  The problems identified by Deputies on all sides of the House might not be addressed by the next Government, in which case it will fall to the groups that have lobbied us on the matter to continue lobbying.  There will be a challenge for us all in seeking to address the issues that remain to be addressed when the review finally does happen.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I missed the closing date to submit my own proposals and it was not possible, with only two days to do so, to put forward amendments to the amendments.  I support the appeal from transgender people aged 16 to 18 and under 16 for the Government to take this opportunity to make provision for an interim gender certificate.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs submitted recommendations or amendments to Cabinet in this regard?</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, has had a number of meetings with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, BeLonG To and other groups, where he had a chance to speak to people who will be affected by these provisions.  The failure to make provision for those aged under 18 will impact directly on young people's lives.  They should have had a much stronger say in terms of their communication with the Department.  By failing to make provision in the legislation for that age group, we are saying to a generation of young people that they must wait two years before anything will be done for them.  In Norway, a recent proposal seeks to extend gender recognition provisions to apply to children as young as seven years of age.  In other countries, a lot of research is being done and debate is taking place on how legislation can be changed to accommodate the needs of young people.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows my position on this issue.  There is no reason the legislation cannot be reviewed much sooner than in two years time.  We might consider it in six months, say, and, if necessary, introduce amendments to make provision for 16 to 18 year olds and under 16s.  Is the Minister of State open to an earlier review, before the five-year term of this D&aacute;il is over?  This is good and progressive legislation, which moves us a great deal further along from where we were some months ago.  It comes in the wake of the progressive "Yes" vote in the marriage equality referendum.  The Ombudsman for Children has called for the Bill to be amended to make provision for under 16s, as has TENI, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Children's Rights Alliance.  Those organisations are arguing for the change as something that will have a significant impact on people's lives.  The feedback we are getting shows that young people know who they are in terms of gender recognition from a fairly young age.  They have to deal with that every day of the week in school, at sports activities and everywhere they go.  It will be a terrible shame if we do not use this opportunity to put a more definite process in place for reviewing the need to make provision for 16 to 18 year olds and under 16s.  Will the Minister of State agree to review the matter in six months time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900027#Z00300"><p>Before dealing with this group of amendments, I take the opportunity to compliment Deputies Willie O'Dea, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Joan Collins on their contributions on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I acknowledge that these amendments were put forward in a spirit of co-operation.  Our engagement with groups like TENI and BeLonG To and the opportunity we had to meet with young people and parents and hear their stories have helped to shape this Bill into one of the most progressive legislative measures ever to come before the House.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea expressed concern that we might never return to the legislation.  In fact, there is an absolutely solid commitment that it will be reviewed.  My intention, if I return to the House, is that it be reviewed, at a minimum, within the two years.  It will, moreover, be a comprehensive review.  All of us who have participated in the debate, at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and on Committee Stage, know how quickly its provisions have changed and how much we have learned in the course of our discussions.  I have no doubt there will be changes to the legislation in future as more research is done and a greater understanding is gained of the issues.</p>  <p>  The age issue to which Deputy Joan Collins referred is more appropriate to discuss in the context of amendments Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, and No. 26.  I will deal with it, therefore, when we come to discuss those proposals.  To answer her straightforward question, I am not aware that the Minister for Children and Youth submitted recommendations or amendments to Cabinet in this regard.</p>  <p>  I do not propose to accept this group of amendments.  The Bill provides for a model of self-declaration for persons aged over 18.  Crucially, there will be no requirement to have any medical input in the application process for a gender recognition certificate.  That is a major step forward, as has been recognised outside the House, and makes us one of the most progressive countries in the world on this issue.  However, statements from medical practitioners will need to be provided during a court process where a person aged 16 or 17 is applying for gender recognition.  The amendments that were passed on Committee Stage provided that within the court process, supporting statements from the applicant's primary treating medical practitioner, who will be either an endocrinologist or a psychiatrist, must confirm that the child has transitioned or is transitioning into his or her preferred gender.  It is important to emphasise that the medical element of the process will remain strictly within the boundaries of the court.  Where a child receives a court exemption, he or she will not be required to provide any further medical evidence to the Department in respect of his or her application.  It is for this purpose alone that the definition referred to in amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and No. 5 must remain as part of the Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the proposals, although I acknowledge the intent behind them.</p>  <p>  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 14 and 32, which provide for non-disclosure by an applicant in respect of surgical procedures.  There was never any question of making gender recognition dependent on a person having to provide medical evidence of reassignment surgery or treatment.</p><p>These amendments are entirely unnecessary, and I am concerned that they would have unintended consequences.  There was never any question of making gender recognition contingent on a person providing medical evidence of reassignment or any other treatment.</p></speech>

It is outrageous that the debate will finish at 2.30 p.m.  Many amendments tabled by me, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and others, which were a result of meetings with TENI and other advocates on this issue, will not be heard, which is really unfortunate.  The advances in the Bill are welcome and great credit is due to the social movement that took place in this country around the marriage equality referendum.  I have no doubt that the Government would not have agreed to the changes sought if the "Yes" vote had not been so decisive.</p>  <p>  The issue of those aged under 18 is important, and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the decision not to accept the amendments.  The idea that because one is aged under 18 one will be treated differently from adults is unacceptable.  After everything that has happened in this country regarding the rights of children and women in the past, surely the Government should have taken a much more enlightened approach.  Children have a right to express their opinions, their identities and who they are.  Let us be clear.  Children know from a very early age if they are gay, bisexual or transgender.  We have all been educated in recent times about that, and many children know and express that to their parents.  Whether their parents accept that is another issue, but it is to be hoped many of them will.</p>  <p>  Amnesty International has made the case that young children and those aged under 18 need to be listened to.  The Ombudsman for Children has also asked the Government to take account of those aged under 18.  The Minister of State could have accepted the amendments tabled to allow people to not have to go through medical examinations or certifications.  A person aged 16, for example, is legally allowed to give his or her opinion on what should happen to him or her when he or she is in hospital.  The Minister of State could easily have lowered the age in the Bill to 16 years.</p>  <p>  Children should be able, with the support of their parents, to apply for a certificate without having to go to a doctor.  There are real problems with regard to medical practitioners.  TENI has said there is a lack of trained medical professionals and doctors who are willing and able to deal with this issue.  The waiting lists are very long and it is likely that it would be two to three years before somebody would be able to have his or her identity asserted.</p>  <p>  I wish to make some general points about those aged under 18, because I may not get to make them again.  I refer to the issue of schools.  I ask the Minister of State to follow the Bill with a discussion about what schools will be asked to do to cater for transgender young people.  As we know, 90% of primary schools and 53% of secondary schools are denominational.  Some excellent documentaries have been aired on RTE radio on which young transgender people were interviewed, and a major issue for them was schools.  People are forced to wear very gendered uniforms which they do not want to wear.  They are forced to use certain toilets, which is inhumane and undignified.  Schools have refused to recognise that some young people want to be a different gender, even when they have the support of their parents and families.</p>  <p>  School textbooks and policies on bullying are also issues, and need to reflect the fact that there are more than two genders in society and that a spectrum of genders exists.  I have spoken to young people involved in the Spectrum Group, which deals with the major problem of homophobic and trans-phobic bullying in schools.  There has to be a recognition that society has changed and people want a tolerant, diverse, pluralist and open society.  The Amnesty International findings on abortion, which were published yesterday, bear this out.  People want a separation of church and state in this country.  That is the only way young transgender people in schools will be able to fully express who they are without being pigeonholed and told not to feel a certain way.</p>  <p>  During the marriage equality referendum, a bishop said that if the vote was passed schools would not be expected to reflect same-sex couples in school textbooks, but they are.  What about transgender people?  The Bill is very important and a good step forward, but it must be followed by a realisation by this and future Governments that we need to separate church and state and allow much more diversity of options, particularly for young people who do not accept the shackles and straitjackets that our generation and others were put into.</p></speech>

The intention was to ensure that those aged under 16 or, for that matter, anybody else, would not have to comply with strict medical reports.  The Minister of State has given a commitment that that was never the intention of the Bill, and therefore I am happy to withdraw the amendments.</p>  <p>  The main intention of this group of amendments is to give recognition, at the very least, to the way society has evolved.  There is a discussion within it about the age of responsibility, what age people can get married at and the age at which people can play as full a role in society as possible.  There is a debate among the USI, the National Youth Council and others on reducing the voting age.  Most parties believe the voting age should be reduced to 17, if not 16, thereby putting major responsibility into the hands of 16 or 17 year olds.  If one accepts that those of that age can make decisions that could influence future Governments or the society in which they live, one cannot at the same time be unwilling to give them the full rights and respect necessary to have a full understanding of their gender.  </p>  <p>  We should open up the new provisions contained in the Bill as fully as possible to those aged 16 and 17 years of age.  As I said, I would go further, and I support the amendments tabled by Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>

A person aged between 16 and 18 years of age has to jump both hurdles.  One of the documents one must present to the Circuit Court if one hopes to be successful in one's application is a medical report.  Circuit courts are currently fairly inaccessible.  In my part of the country it can take up to 12 months to bring a case to the circuit court, and it is an expensive process.  A person aged 16 who gathers the necessary documentation and applies to a Circuit Court could be almost 18 years of age before he or she gets a hearing.</p><p>It is a very difficult situation for people aged between 16 and 18.  I firmly believe there should be no age limit whatsoever because this will be done for younger people at the behest of their parent or guardian, who are not likely to go out and apply for a change of gender on a whim.  I am disappointed the amendments do not find favour with the Government.  I will press them, but not to a vote because I and the organisations in question are anxious that the legislation be brought through and put on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues I do not want to put an age on when a person is entitled to gender recognition.  It is a shame.  I received a letter sent from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, stating he has proposed two further amendments to the Bill.  The letter states:<blockquote>Dear Joan<br /><br />Following our recent discussions, I promised to come back to you with proposals regarding the Gender Recognition Bill which you are taking through the Oireachtas at present..  I welcome the recent amendments you have proposed, including making the process much less complex for those aged over 18.  In the note attached, you will see that I propose two further improvements - one to add general practitioners to the list of medical professionals under section 12(4) of the Bill for those in the 16-17 age cohort, and a second to provide that the promised review of the legislation will specifically consider the needs of persons aged under 16 years.</blockquote>I do not know what are the dynamics here.  We should seriously look at this because young people should have a say.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs recently brought out a national strategy on children and young people's participation in decision-making and their voices should be heard much more strongly in the legislation.</p></speech>

There has been some acknowledgement of concerns raised at earlier Stages in the debate.  All of this is to be welcomed, but it quite simply does not go far enough, particularly in the area of young people.  It is a pity that the Government is still lagging behind on this issue, given the absolutely fantastic sentiment for equality expressed in the marriage equality referendum, the fact that our society has grown up and the people have led the way in demanding real equality and have thrown off many of the shackles which have held the country back so badly and have done such damage to young people, women and other groups.  Deputy Collins has indicated to us that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has indicated the Minister of State should have accepted the amendments to change the medical hoops being put in the way of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 and deal in a fair way with people aged under 16, but the Minister of State is still refusing to do so.  I do not really understand why, because everybody, including the UN, the ISPCC, TENI, all of the groups and anybody who knows or cares about this issue is saying the Minister of State needs to go further and accept the amendments, and clearly it is the expressed will of the people in the country.  It is a bit difficult to understand why the Minister of State is failing to do so, even when people in Cabinet are stating privately if not publicly that he should do so.  It is not too late and the Minister of State should take on board these amendments and make the Bill all it should be.</p></speech>

As others have put on record, it is important to acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, made suggestions, perhaps not at Cabinet but certainly to the Minister, that a review be considered.  The Minister of State has given a commitment to review the legislation in two years' time, and at that stage perhaps consideration can be given to persons under 16 who are not eligible for exemption to apply for a gender recognition certificate under section 12 of the Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, holds this view.</p></speech>

She wants us to reflect on the area of education.  We are very anxious and concerned that transgender children in schools are protected and respected.  This is a major concern for parents and is one about which my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is also concerned.  I have met many parents on this matter.  When Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister, he introduced wide-ranging compulsory anti-bullying procedures which cover this area.  The Minister for Education and Skills has already had a meeting on this and I am aware she has written to TENI, BeLongTo and school representatives on having further round table discussions.  Transgender children have their main experiences in the educational system.  We need to engage further with educators to ensure transgender children are respected in the education system.  Before I came to the House, I spoke to a parent about how uneven the experience can be and the difference the attitude of a principal can make.  The Minister and I want to ensure proper policies are in place throughout the education system whereby children will be treated with respect.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, will follow up with interest groups and representatives of principals and others in education in a round table discussion which will lead to a policy to ensure transgender children are treated with the respect any child deserves.  I have no doubt this will happen.</p>  <p>  This has been quite a long process and Deputies O'Dea and &Oacute; Snodaigh have engaged extensively on it.  We had prolonged discussions on Committee Stage on a range of issues.  These changes did not come about because of the marriage equality referendum.  They were well flagged.  We withdrew the Bill and engaged with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on a range of issues.  The original pre-legislative scrutiny which took place was based on the age of 18.  In response to those discussions, this was lowered to 16.  In response to the debate in the Seanad, the two year review was introduced.  The Bill has progressed much slower than I wanted, and I would have much preferred to have seen this legislation at a much earlier stage.  The Bill is all the stronger, but at some stage one must go forward and enact legislation which will be reviewed.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Collins's remarks on the Minister, Deputy Reilly, he is the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I hope he takes on a very strong role with regard to transgender children.  It is very much within his remit.  If he proposes amendments, I hope he brings them to Cabinet.  This is complicated legislation and there must be forethought and a large amount of consultation before any changes made.  A significant amount of consultation has taken place throughout the Bill's progression and every Member of the House has engaged with a wide range of people.  If the Minister, Deputy Reilly, intends to bring forward amendments or further legislation on transgender children he will certainly have my advice and support and I look forward to it.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, hold strong views on this and has concerns about transgender children and I am sure he will continue to work in the area.  When the legislation is passed, I do not want to see it put on the shelf.  Much more work has to be done with regard to adults and children.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>This is to ensure, particularly with children, that they have a very good and positive experience in the educational system.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has suggested two years as being appropriate and he has made some commitments.  Questions have been raised in the last batch of amendments, along with those we are not likely to reach at this stage because of the guillotine at 2.30 p.m.  That means we will not be able to tease out all the questions.  In some ways, we have already had the arguments but they needed to happen.  If we set the period to one year, it will mean that as soon as the Bill passes, we will begin preparing for a review.</p><p>Following the referendum on marriage equality, which must be endorsed by the courts, we will see new legislation before the Houses on marriage equality.  That will have implications for the Bill before us, which will have been passed into law at that stage.  There is a major piece of work to be done in that regard, and we would all love to see it being done.  The Minister of State has indicated that the requirement for married people to divorce needs to go but I will not go into that.  If the amendment is accepted, we know we can start a review in a year.  There will be a new Government this time next year, no matter what I or those opposite do in the mean time.  Since we know there will be an election and a new Government, this would force it to act very quickly rather than in two years, which the Minister of State proposes.</p><p>The second part of the amendment provides for a five-year review.  As the Minister of State indicated in the first contribution, much is happening not only in Ireland but right across the world.  I have mentioned Denmark as an example of how things are moving quickly.  We need to ensure that we will not just have a review in two years.  We hope the next Government will be enlightened and address the shortfalls that will become apparent, and we have already identified some of them.  In five years or ten years, others may become evident.  I am just trying to ensure this will not just be a once-off review, with the legislation put on the shelf forever.  </p><p>We are discussing a small group in society and I am thankful they have been blessed by very good advocates able to explain to those of us who were not fully <i>au fait</i>over the years the difficulties faced by children, in particular, and adults.  They have been able to get across to us, as legislators, the importance of addressing this issue through a human rights approach to law.  I want to ensure we can have a quick review and a follow-up one to capture some of the changes in our society.  I hope it can deal with the positive changes at least.</p></speech>

This is obviously a substantial and progressive change to our laws that we welcome, albeit with certain criticisms and reservations.  It is new legislation so that is the idea for having a review as quickly as possible is to see how it will work and affect different groups of transgender people or to ensure any problems can be quickly ironed out and changed.</p>  <p>  I will highlight a few issues and one relates to what we have just discussed.  In one year, we should be able to examine this in a real way and see if anybody between 16 and 18 years of age managed to get a gender recognition certificate by going through the process of courts and medical examination.  If they have not done so over the course of a year, would it illustrate a problem and mean that we should simply lower the age from 18 to 16?  It is a concrete question and with the benefit of a year's experience, we would be able to review it.  I accept the Government's commitment to resolve the forced divorce requirement but will it be done in a year?  It is a vital issue and at least if there is to be a definite review in a year, it will force the Government of the day to confront that reality.  If it has not been dealt with for some reason, it can be dealt with at that stage.</p>  <p>  Other issues are not considered in the Bill and a review in a year would likely highlight the need to deal with them.  For example, there is a question of an "X" gender, or those people who identify neither as male nor female.  We have amendments on that later but it is likely we will not get to them because of the guillotine.  A review is likely to highlight that as a major issue requiring amendment.  Amendment No. 4 dealt with a residency requirement and after a year, we could see if it affects any groups of workers or students not in the country for a year but who seek, for whatever reason, a gender recognition certificate.  Finally, we could see the impact of the legislation in education and whether further action should be taken.  It is clear that in this case, we need a quicker review period than two years.  The Minister of State has the right under the current wording to do it more quickly but it should be in law that this must happen within a year.</p></speech>

Section 7 introduces the obligation on the Government to review this within two years.  The wording is that it must &quot;commence&quot; the review not later than two years after the Bill passes and a review could take some time.</p><p>It could be three or more years before we get the results of that review.  When we look at how fast this issue is moving and how other jurisdictions are already changing their laws,  despite the fact that this legislation is enlightened and despite the long distance the Government has come, this legislation is already being left quite a bit behind.</p> <p> We are rapidly running out of time, so I will ask about the forced divorce clause.  My understanding is that, assuming the courts do not strike down the results of the same-sex referendum - we hope they do not, and I do not think they will - then marriage equality legislation will be brought to the House, which will be used as a vehicle to get rid of the forced divorce clause in this Bill.  Is that correct?  Is that the Government's intention?</p></speech>

Will the gender component of the marriage equality Bill be confined to the forced divorce clause, or can we look forward to other progressive changes in the area of gender in that Bill?</p></speech>

It is entirely sensible and appropriate.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that elements of this Bill will have to be changed but cannot be changed at the moment for purely legal reasons, as Deputy O'Dea mentioned.  The main explanation given to us on Committee Stage of the debate was that the marriage equality amendment had not yet been passed.  Therefore, now that the referendum is over and the amendment is passed, once any legal problems are cleared out of the way, it logically follows that the Government will immediately amend this Bill, if it is still in government, or that any future Government would do so immediately.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made a point earlier in response to me about the significance of the marriage equality referendum in setting a context in which the Government could go further than it is going in this Bill, particularly in the area of dealing with young people aged between 18 and 16 and people under 16, and the other issues that need to be dealt with.  I am sure this was discussed before, but the requirement for a person to declare a solemn intention of living in the preferred gender for the rest of his or her life also should not be there.  We should be supporting gender self-determination.  I do not see why one has to give a commitment to stay in a particular gender forever in order to get a certificate.  We should have gender self-determination.</p>  <p>  All these things need to be looked at, most importantly the situation for young people.  My point about the referendum was not that it forced the Minister of State to make some of the changes he has made.  That is largely down to the advocacy groups, who have educated us all on these matters during the course of the debate.  I accept his point on that.  It is the advocacy groups, TENI and others, that have helped us to understand the issues.  My point is that the referendum indicates that the people are way ahead of politicians on matters of equality.  Any political hesitation that might stop the Government from going further in this Bill is unwarranted.  The people have stated their belief in equality in these matters.  The statement made was not just about marriage equality; it was about the need for equality more generally, including in matters to do with transgender people.</p>  <p>  There is no political reason to lag behind where the people are - something we have done, sadly and at a terrible cost, in this State for many years.  The political system has lagged behind.  Big, powerful institutions have held us back and lagged behind where people are.  A year is a long time in the life of a young person.  Things are pretty tough for young people, generally speaking, and if a year is a long time, two years is a very long time.  The Minister of State has spoken about the need for more consultation on these matters.  We have had the consultation, we have had the best advice and we have had an extensive discussion.  I do not see why he will not accept the amendments, but given that he is not going to, I do not see why he could not agree to the review in a year and making those changes in a year's time, rather than stringing it out for two years, because that is a long time in the lives of young people.</p></speech>

The numbers we are dealing with, as the Deputy pointed out, are such that we may not even see a case in the 16 to 18 age group in that period.  Two years is an adequate period to have a look at it.  In response to Deputy O'Dea, once the review has commenced, a report needs to be made to both Houses within 12 months, which is an important element.  A review is adequate.</p>  <p>  We will get to the other amendments regarding the requirement to be single and all that, so instead of jumping around the place, I will respond to that then, but Deputy O'Dea knows very well from Committee Stage that I had hoped to be able to bring amendments on Report Stage, and it is the intention of the Government to remove that provision, subject to the outcome of the case that is now in front of the courts.  Depending on how the court case goes, the Government is committed to bringing forward an amendment removing the requirement that a person undergoing gender recognition must be single.  The Deputy can take it that this will be done as speedily as possible.</p></speech>

It means that work will be done on this for the 12 months, whether by the Department itself or by the committee, which did very good work on the original legislation and proved in many ways that parliamentarians could grapple with legislation at an early stage.  This was one of the first pieces of legislation that came under the pre-legislative scrutiny model and it proved that we could do that.  It allowed us to engage, as parliamentarians and on a cross-party basis, with advocates who had heard the horror stories and so on of people who have been struggling with our society and our society's views over years.</p><p>The likes of Dr. Lydia Foy, FLAC, BeLonG To, TENI and Focus: The Identity Trust, came to us individually but have also made submissions to the committee.  That is the type of work I am talking about.  The committee can do it anyway, but at least if it is in legislation that there is to be a statutory review so quickly, we can start the work.  We already know some of the issues.  It will still be fresh, unlike in two years' time.  I hope some of us will be around to help that work, but if we were all to go, there would be at least some committee members who are advocates.  The nature of this type of work is that Members advocate for a while and then move on to the next issue.  We have not dealt fully with this issue and that is why we should come back to it as quickly as possible - so that there is a currency to it.</p></speech>

I cannot see why the Minister of State will not accept it.  It would give a bit of a boost to those in the transgender community.  It would give them a positive feeling that we are serious about moving the situation on, even though the Minister of State is not accepting any changes with regard to the age.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in a letter to the Minister for Social Protection, suggested two amendments to the Bill, one of which was the addition of a new subsection, section 7(c), providing that the Minister "incorporate into the review consideration of the needs of persons under 16 years who are not eligible for an exemption to apply for a gender recognition certificate under Section 12 of the Bill".  Obviously, there are concerns, particularly about those under 16 years, but I would like to see a review of all the different areas generally.</p></speech>

As he knows, the Bill goes well beyond the recommendations of that committee, and it is progressive.</p>  <p>  On many occasions in the House, the legislation of other countries has been mentioned, but there are also quite regressive elements in that legislation.  The Bill surpasses such legislation.  Deputy O'Dea mentioned Norway earlier.  It has a consultative document, not legislation.  We are not too sure what legislation will be enacted there.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned jokingly that we may not be returned.  I have a such a gr&aacute; for this that, whether I am in this House or not, I will be taking a keen interest in the matter.  I hope the Bill will create much more acceptance in society of this issue, which has been somewhat passed over.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh himself has a keen interest in this area, having introduced a Private Members' Bill on the matter on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I acknowledge that Bill, which has obviously influenced this Bill.</p>  <p>  One year is too short.  We need two years for a review.  Taking into consideration what will be happening with regard to legislation, it is the Government's intention.  I hope any subsequent Government will take the same interest in what is an important social issue.  The Department of Education and Skills, under the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will carry out important consultation work from September on the experience of transgender children in the education system to ensure that this is improved and that they are treated with the respect they deserve.  To deal with this small number of matters, because every citizen in this country is extremely important, there is the two-year period.  From the commencement of the review, that report should be given to the House.</p>  <p>  Should there be a need for further reviews after the two-year review, the other element was that there should be a further five-year review.  The review process - it may be much quicker or it may take a little longer - will lay down best practice.</p>  <p>  The wording of the provision follows the model used in the Protected Disclosures Act  2014.  I am happy that the wording is entirely satisfactory.</p>  <p>  It is not intended, whether in the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, that this legislation will be the end of it.  It is evolving.  Deputy Joan Collins read out a letter written by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly.  It shows that he has a keen interest in the matter and I believe he will follow up on it in that Department.</p></speech>

It does not matter whether it is my amendment or the wording in the Minister's Bill.  There are two reviews provided for in my amendment; there is one in the Minister of State's Bill.  With mine, one is guaranteed two bites of the cherry, and there is a quick turnaround.</p>  <p>  As I stated, I will not divide the House.  The problem is that we have virtually run out of time.  At this stage, it is frustrating.  There are five minutes left and we are only starting to get to grips with some of the major problems.  In some ways, that beggars what I am trying to do.  It is the matters that we are not going to get to today that we would have been coming back to within 12 months if my amendment had been passed.</p></speech>

A number of my points have already been made.  At 16 years of age, one can consent to medical procedures.  A 16 year old should also have the right to vote.  It is only a matter of time before that is introduced.  At 16 years of age, one can leave school, go to work and pay taxes.  The Minister of State could have agreed to this change.  There cannot be inequality between young people and those aged over 18 years.  A young person aged between 16 and 18 years who is capable of making the decision should be able to apply for a certificate.</p></speech>

I understand that Deputies have received an information note setting out the purpose of these amendments.</p><p>As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has been implementing a programme of reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations procedures and institutions since 2012.  His aim is to establish a world-class workplace relations service and employment rights framework by streamlining the existing mechanisms and establishing a simpler structure while building upon the recognised strengths of the existing systems.</p><p>The reform programme is at an advanced stage and the legislation that will give statutory effect to these reforms, namely, the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was signed into law by the President on 20 May.  The Minister has announced that the WRC will commence on 1 October 2015.</p><p>The effect of the Workplace Relations Act, when it is commenced, will be to replace the five existing workplace relations bodies with two.  The Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be replaced by the new Workplace Relations Commission.  The appeals functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  The cost of running these bodies will be reduced through the better use of technology and shared services, staff reductions, the elimination of duplication and the centralisation of administration and case management services.  This rationalisation will deliver a much better service to end users, including employers and employees, at a reduced cost to the State.</p> <p> Significant progress was achieved in advance of the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 in the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the workplace relations reform programme.  I will mention the measures that have been already put in place.  The Equality Tribunal has been transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in anticipation of becoming part of the Workplace Relations Commission.  A single contact portal and a post registration unit have been established to deal with all aspects of case management as far as complaints are concerned.  A single workplace relations complaint form and e-complaint facility has been launched.  A single workplace relations website has been designed and launched.  A single adjudication and appeals decisions database has been designed and launched.  An early resolution service has been established.  The selection process for an external panel of adjudicators and an accredited training programme for adjudicators has been completed.  The selection process for two new deputy chairs of the court has been completed.  Enhanced technologies and business processes, including the completion of the procurement and design of a customer relationship management solution, have been implemented.</p> <p> Work will proceed at an accelerated pace over the coming months to make progress with a comprehensive programme of work to ensure our workplace relations services are business-ready for establishment day.  This includes the preparation of regulations relating to critical procedures, the finalisation of arrangements for the introduction of compliance notices and fixed charge notices in support of inspection activities, the transitioning of e-business, the phasing out of information and communications technology systems in line with the rationalisation of services and the implementation of the proposed customer relationship management solution to support complaints and adjudication management.  Key senior management positions will be fully aligned with the new structure and processes.</p> <p> As Deputies are aware, the Workplace Relations Act is complex.  When it is commenced, its effect will be to replace the five existing workplace relations bodies with a new simplified two-tier structure.  The Act will also result in the establishment of new structures for the resolution and adjudication of complaints and disputes across the entire corpus of employment rights and equality legislation.  As a result of the introduction of these new structures, it has been necessary to make consequential amendments to 24 primary Acts, 34 specified parts or sections of Acts and numerous statutory instruments.  As part of the technical and complex drafting process, it became clear following the enactment of the Act as certain technical legal elements were worked through that a number of technical and drafting amendments would be necessary to ensure the smooth running of the new structures.  As a consequence, it is essential that these amendments be effected before the commencement of the legislation and the establishment of the new structures on 1 October 2015.  It is proposed that the aforementioned amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be inserted into the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 as a new Part 3 of that Bill.</p></speech>

I am loth to criticise the work that is under way because I am aware that not enough officials are available.  I do not want to rain on the Minister of State's parade when I point out that work on the reform of workplace relations got under way in 2010.  The Walsh report was commissioned at that time.  Given that this process has been under way for so long, and in light of the amount of work that has been done, it is not good that changes to a Bill that has just been signed into law are being introduced at this stage.  It is the wrong way to treat the House.  This Bill has been already debated on Second and Committee Stages.  I accept that the Minister of State indicated on Second Stage that this approach would have to be taken.  It is not a fair way of doing things.  I appreciate that some of the issues in this regard are outside the control of the Minister of State.  I am saying this for future reference.  The introduction of these motions as a way of making new legislation is becoming a bit of a habit for Governments.  It is a feature of this Government, in particular, which is not what was promised in the so-called democratic revolution of 2011.  Although we will support these important and significant changes, I am keen to put it on the record of the House that this is not a good way of doing parliamentary business.</p></speech>

I am unhappy about the way the amendments have been presented to us here today.  As has been previously said, it is not a proper way to do business in a democracy.  I welcome the Bill, however.  It has been said that low pay is endemic and entrenched in the Irish economy.  Recent data from the OECD showed that the prevalence of low pay in Ireland is among the highest in the OECD.  The relevant figure is 21.8%.  It is interesting that a report on equality in Ireland that was recently published by Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley economists found that the United States has the highest proportion of low pay.  This is very interesting.  The relevant figure for the United States is 25%.  It is shocking that Ireland is in second place with a figure of 21.8%.  The figure for the United Kingdom is 21%.  The figures for Switzerland, Finland and some of the Nordic countries are way below 10%.</p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently told an Oireachtas committee that low-paid workers are more likely to suffer from a range of unfair employment practices that adversely effect their ability to earn a living.  Following the Dunnes Stores strike over zero-hour contracts and the low levels of pay associated with such contracts, many of us are concerned about what kind of jobs and work practices we will be facing in Ireland over the coming years.  It has to be accepted that a new breed of employers is expecting workers to work variable hours with uncertain contracts and on low pay.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions told the Oireachtas committee that any legislation has to include provisions that ensure employers cannot frustrate attempts to improve working conditions, such as efforts to establish employment regulation orders in sectors such as hotels and catering businesses.  It is interesting that the Central Statistics Office has said that approximately 135,000 people are classed as part-time under-employed workers.  These people would like to take up full-time work.  It worries me that this Bill is providing for a couple of little get-out clauses that will allow employers to find a way out of paying what they should be paying in terms of low pay.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that I have mentioned Switzerland because yesterday I attended a meeting attended by the Swiss ambassador.  When I asked him a few questions about the Swiss economy, he made the interesting point that the payment of good wages is the best solution for dealing with poverty.  This is why I mentioned that the figure of 10% in Switzerland is one of the lowest in the world.  The Minister of State and I are aware that there is a cost factor for our economy if we keep people on low pay.  The cost factor is huge if we keep people on unemployment benefit because it restricts what they can spend money on.  People on low pay are exactly the same - they are restricted in how they can spend.  There is a draw on the social welfare system because people have to get family income supplement, etc.  There is also a draw on the health service because people need medical cards, etc.  There is a huge pull out of the economy.  It has been found in some countries that if people are paid reasonable wages, they can pay tax and contribute back into the economy.  This can increase spending in the economy.</p><p>If we have hundreds of thousands of people who are restricted to barely surviving, just buying food and barely able to pay their television licence, electricity and gas bills, we are not contributing to growth in the economy.  Everybody knows we need external investment and internal spending.  However, we are putting a cap on hundreds of thousands of people who wish to, and can, contribute to the economy if they are given a chance to do so.  The best way to do that is to give people a reasonable rate.  It might be a cost in the short term, but employers and Governments should see that it could contribute to the coffers of whatever Government is in power as well as to small and medium sized businesses and enterprises, because people will have spending power.  I realise the Minister of State means well, and I will not vote against the Bill as it is a big step forward.  However, the position in Ireland at present, with 21.8% on low pay, is appalling.  It is shocking that we are just behind America, and we all know how some employers can treat their workers in America.  We are at nothing if we do not ensure in this Bill that employers will pay a decent wage.</p> <p> I would like to have more time to speak on this but I must conclude.  My determination of a decent wage is not a minimum wage.  Again, we must look to the Nordic countries, where people talk about a liveable wage.  This is not rhetoric from the left that people should be paid a liveable wage.  There is good, sound economic reasoning for giving people a liveable wage.  The best way to take people out of poverty is to give them work, but they must be given a decent, liveable wage that they can spend and with which they can have a quality of life.  If the vast majority of people who are on low incomes, unemployed or just above the threshold of being impoverished had the chance of a job with a liveable wage, does anybody think they would not take it?  Of course they would in order to improve their position.  That is how we must go in the medium and long term.  As the Swiss ambassador said yesterday, the best way of dealing with poverty is to give people a decent rate of pay.  It lifts them out of poverty and helps the economy.</p></speech>

The Anti-Austerity Alliance supported the Workplace Relations Bill and the Minister of State claims that these changes are necessary arising from that legislation.  However, there is a point at issue about parliamentary procedure and the right of the D&aacute;il to scrutinise legislation properly.  There is a right and democratic way of doing things and a wrong way of doing them.  This is another example, although a less cynical one, of what we saw last week with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, where unrelated amendments were tabled at the last minute, thus preventing proper scrutiny.  In this case, I do not believe it is done to prevent proper scrutiny, but because it is the quickest way of doing it.  That does not herald some type of democratic revolution, or fulfil the democratic revolution that was heralded.</p>  <p>  There are questions for the Minister of State as to why this was not foreseen when the Workplace Relations Bill was debated.  If there had been proper parliamentary scrutiny at that stage, the fact that these other changes were required could have been recognised.  Why could we not have a Workplace Relations (Amendment) Bill which could go through the proper parliamentary process and the proper Stages of scrutiny?  It is not good practice and is fundamentally undemocratic to cut short the ability of the D&aacute;il to examine legislative changes.</p></speech>

Low pay and under-employment are entrenched within the Irish system.  That means for hundreds of thousands of individuals the simple necessities of life are beyond reach for their families.  As has been said, over 20% of the population is on low pay.  The facts that people who are working are in poverty, that people who are working are getting a subsidy from the Government to subsidise their employers to pay them the low wage and that the State is employing people in the public sector on a low wage and giving them family income support, acknowledging that their wages are not enough for them to survive, mean that when we approach a Bill such as this we must do so with ambition and an understanding of the real lives of mothers, fathers and children throughout the State.  For that reason, we have asked that the Government broaden the terms of the Bill.</p><p>The Bill refers to low pay.  However the national minimum wage applies to 4.7% of the population.  Low pay affects over 20% of the population, so over 15% of people in the State will not experience any positive effects from this Bill.  From the start we have asked the Government to substitute the phrase &quot;matters related to low pay&quot; to broaden the scope.  We have tabled this amendment and a number of other amendments to ensure we provide something useful to those people.  I wholeheartedly urge the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to take the time to consider the families that have been left out of this legislation and to see how they can be helped.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900035#HH01000"><p>I support the amendment.  The problem is that we know that some people, even today, are not even getting the minimum wage.  The Rhatigan workers, for example, were paid &euro;5 per hour.  I agree that this must be broadened to include introducing comprehensive legislation regarding the minimum wage, in the first place, and we must go further than low pay and towards a liveable wage.</p>  <p>  The Bill is too broad.  I will not use the word "slipshod", but it allows a certain number of employers to opt out, as it were.  What worries me is that we could have easily inserted the words "minimum wage" and "liveable wage".  We are talking about low pay, but there is no definition of what amount people should be earning or what employers should pay.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>This omission could be a failing in the Bill.  While I accept the good intentions behind the legislation and I do not wish to be excessively critical of it, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n pointed out, with a little foresight, its scope could have been extended to cover many workers who will not be covered if it is passed in its current form.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.617" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900036#JJ00200"><p>As I did not have an opportunity to respond to remarks made on the motion, I should point out that I find it unfortunate that the amendments had to be presented in this manner.  This has been done for reasons that are beyond my control and I fully accept that it is an imperfect way of doing business that should not become <i>de rigueur</i>.  This is complex legislation.  We are in the business of trying to ensure that it works for employers and employees and that the service assists in transforming the landscape and becomes much easier and more effective for those who need to use it.</p><p>Many criticisms have been made of the way in which we intend to structure the Low Pay Commission since we first announced the concept some time ago.  I do not accept the criticism that the remit of the new organisation is narrow.  The opposite is the case as the commission's role will extend far beyond setting the rate of the national minimum wage on an annual basis.  The body was established on an interim basis at the end of February and, given the short timeframe it has to report to me and Government and make a recommendation for a new rate for the national minimum wage, it has focused on this task in the early months of its existence.  I do not make any apologies for that. </p><p>Section 5 provides that the Low Pay Commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on such matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  This may be a rather an inelegant way of providing that the commission will have a broad remit.  In addition, its remit will be very much based on concerns expressed in the House every week about matters related to low pay.  This Government and subsequent Governments will need to be conscious of this issue and address it in a democratic fashion.</p><p>The Government must provide the Low Pay Commission with its work programme not later than two months after the legislation has been enacted and, subsequently, by the end of February each year.  In doing so, it will reflect on the state of play in respect of low pay, the incidence and prevalence of low pay and various related matters and various sectors that may be of concern to the House and Governments in future.  This is how the Low Pay Commission's work programme will be developed.  It will be adopted by the Government each year and sent to the commission for its examination.  This will allow me and future Ministers to ask the commission each year to do the work all Deputies want it to do and advise the Government in an expert and evidence based manner about the best approaches to take.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the proposed amendments. </p></speech>

The inequalities that have become entrenched in the labour force today are like nothing what we have seen for generations in this country or internationally.  In an effort to rebalance that, we need to make sure that we have the most robust answer possible.  </p><p>The inclusion of a commitment to our international responsibilities, responsibilities to which we have already signed up to as a State, would be logical to buttress the legislation and make it stronger.  For example, Ireland has international commitments to a fair wage, as indicated in the commission's considerations.  It was highlighted by ICTU during the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the &quot;right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring...an existence worthy of human dignity&quot;.  The European Social Charter refers to &quot;a right to fair remuneration, sufficient for a standard of living for themselves and their families&quot;.  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights declares a &quot;right to a fair wages and...' decent living' for...[workers] and their...[families].&quot;  We are part of this process.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that this is something up to which we should be signed - therefore, let us sign up to this in the legislation.</p></speech>

That is a breach of their human rights.  That is acknowledged in the European Court of Human Rights.  It is acknowledged across Europe that people have a right to earn a reasonable wage.  This is an interesting proposal and there is no reason it cannot be included in the legislation.  Its inclusion would commit us to what is provided in the European Court of Human Rights and in the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all of us in this Parliament would subscribe.  I do not know anybody here who would not subscribe to it.  There is no reason the protection afforded by a reasonable wage against the violation of a worker's right could not be copper-fastened into the legislation.  If we are serious about ensuring people have a living wage and addressing the issue of low pay, we definitely would not have a problem with making this a human rights issue.</p>  <p>  I raised an issue in the House, highlighted to me by a girl I spoke to recently who is employed on a zero-hour contract and who, having worked, came home with &euro;124.  It is a breach of her human rights to work and not earn a living wage and that should not be allowed.  This proposal is a good one.  It would not alter the objective of the Bill if we were to guarantee that the right to a decent and living wage is a human right.</p></speech>

We must raise the standards and counter the pressure and drive towards the race to the bottom.</p>  <p>  I would point to another dimension to this issue which we discussed at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday and I was very pleased to get a positive response from economists who were there.  We were debating the issue of quantitative easing, which is a technically dense, complicated, barely understandable process that is being engaged in by the European authorities, the ECB and so on, essentially to counter the impact of austerity.  I, and others, put it to that group of economists, Stephen Kinsella, Dan O'Brien and Constantin Gurdgiev, who are quite a mixed bag from the political and ideological spectrum, that with respect to all the economic crisis, quantitative easing, austerity and the problems the European and global economy are facing, that the big problem is low pay and that all of those measures were symptoms of the fact that the share of income that is going to labour has dropped by about 10% since the Thatcher- Regan era and there has been a corresponding increase in the national economic cake or wider European economic cake going to profits.  There has been a significant and consistent transfer across Europe and the world of wealth from the pockets of workers, in the form of wages, into the pockets of the rich in the form of profits and that transfer lies at the base of the economic crisis we are now witnessing.</p>  <p>  There is an economic imperative, from the point of view of the whole economy, to address the issue of low pay, not only for the low-paid but for the stability of the entire economy.  If workers do not have enough money in their pockets, they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads and they cannot afford to pay for goods.  If they cannot do that, it causes a big problem for the economy and there is only one way that can be resolved and that is by them getting loans - many loans - they cannot afford pay back.  The result of that is credit bubbles and the financialisation of the entire economy.  That is what has happened during the last 25 years.  </p>  <p>  The question of radically redressing the race to the bottom, the issue of low pay and the transfer from wages to capital which has essentially taken place during the past 25 years is really a matter of economic urgency for our economy and the global economy, not to mention for the people who are really struggling.  Some 19% of those working are living in poverty, which is an extraordinary situation.  Stephen Kinsella said yesterday that this is a Marxist argument but Marx was right; he actually said that.  I was amazed by that comment.  Constantin Gurdgiev did not quite agree with him all the way but he nodded to indicate that there was a very significant element of truth in it.</p><p>For various reasons we have to shift the narrative on the question of fair remuneration, a living wage and a decent income for working people.  Otherwise, the crisis our economy has just gone through will recur and on the current trajectory, it is increasingly likely that will happen.  We have to address this and one way to do that is to say that decent remuneration is a human right to counter the relentless narrative about competitiveness, which becomes the justification for attacking pay and conditions for workers.  That sounds good on the face of it but when we examine it closely, it is a disaster for the economy when it is viewed in its entirety.</p></speech>

They are making a strong case for the establishment of an institutional framework like the Low Pay Commission and for the collective bargaining legislation I am introducing, the re-establishment of REAs and sectoral employment orders and the work I intend to carry out on zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  We are all at one on that.  We may differ in terms of how we might approach it, but the best way to tackle incidents of low pay is to do it in a strategic, sustained and structured way and try to change our institutions to ensure they are hard wired to constantly seek to address the issues that concern us all and those who spoke on this particular amendment.</p>  <p>  Section 4 sets out clear objectives for a national minimum wage, which are designed to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable, set at a rate that is both fair and sustainable and, where adjustment is appropriate, is adjusted incrementally and over time is progressively increased without creating any significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  I have stated previously in the House, and I have no hesitation in stating again, that I want to see the national minimum wage progressively increased where the economic circumstances and the demands of job creation, social conditions and other requirements converge.  I want to see better working conditions for people and improved pay, particularly for low paid workers.  It is something that motivates me as a public representative.  One of the reasons I went into public life in the first place and sought a mandate from the people I represent was to do precisely that, and I am doing that.  The Low Pay Commission can present an opportunity to change our institutions to make sure that we have an institutional response in a sustained, strategic and structured way to the issue of low pay.</p>  <p>  Section 5 provides for criteria to be taken into account regarding the areas Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about because, in reality, and it does reflect this, it refers to changes in economic distribution during the period since the last order so on a continuous basis, the Low Pay Commission will be examining the changes in income distribution and will have to respond to those in its annual reports, not just on the national minimum wage but on the various other issues it will address on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  The objective of ensuring that workers are entitled to just and favourable remuneration is clearly built into the criteria that will guide the commission in making a recommendation to me, and to future Ministers, on the appropriate level of the national minimum wage and, therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

The level of public services, etc., has a strong effect on poverty.  I refer to welfare supports, protections, etc.  The Minister of State has stated on a number of occasions that he will be holding the first Government backed forum on the living wage concept in the autumn.  He has said previously that it is crucial to bring employers, employees and representatives together with civil society organisations to discuss whether this concept could successfully be applied to Ireland but what is actually happening, in the dying days of this Government, is that a talking shop is being set up to examine these issues.  Most of the individuals the Minister of State said would be put on that talking shop are members of the commission he has created.  The only people he may need to add to this are individuals with a sociology and social policy background.  That would complete the picture necessary for a commission to have the experiential background and desire to tackle these issues.</p><p>We are arguing strongly that the schedule of work being undertaken by the commission should not be limited to its annual recommendation on the hourly rate of the national minimum wage.  We want it to live up to its name.  It does not take these issues into consideration, and that is why I ask the Minister of State to support the amendment.</p></speech>

I speak in support of all the relevant amendments but in particular amendment No. 7 tabled by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on broadening the remit of this commission and, in particular, inserting in the Bill, which we have also done with one of our amendments, the question of a living wage because this should not be just about establishing a bottom floor in terms of a minimum wage but a wage on which people can live.  People have a right to live and should have wages to reflect the cost of living.  A good deal of research was done by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, and others to emerge with the living wage which, for a single adult, in the best case scenario, was about &euro;11 an hour when it was originally proposed some years ago.  They have done new work in recent months which has increased the living wage to &euro;11.50 an hour.  That does not take into account people who have children.  We have to have an aim of establishing that people achieve the living wage and it should be an aim of the Low Pay Commission to do that as opposed to solely dealing with the question of the minimum wage.</p><p>Our amendment No. 18 is a call on the Government to face up to the reality of bogus self-employment practices.  <i>The Irish Times</i>recently headlined on the issue but, interestingly, did not mention the construction industry.  The very bidding process for State construction contracts feeds into a situation where so-called self-employed people end up earning less than the minimum wage, for example, in Rhatigan's, where the workers were on &euro;5 an hour.  When the big construction companies enter bids they make claims that they can lay X number of blocks for Y amount of euro but when we take into account the physical limitations in terms of the number of blocks that can be laid per hour, it can be seen that not only are the REA rates not being observed but the minimum wage rates are not being observed either.  It is essential that is inserted in this Bill.</p><p>We are also in favour of something the Minister of State has spoken about previously, namely, other legislation to deal with that, but our amendments are before the House and we believe they should be accepted as an indication that we will take this issue seriously.</p><p>Those who are meant to be taking it seriously, namely, Revenue, are not and as such it is losing out on massive amounts of money.  This is a case of worker exploitation on a massive scale and the State being ripped off.  Government can send out a signal in this regard today by accepting this amendment.</p></speech>

There is no acknowledgement of the serious level of wholesale tax fraud that is going on in this area.  The State is not interested in dealing with it.  There is an interesting parallel between current events in Greece and the attitude of our State to the issue of bogus self-employment, which is rampant in the construction sector here.  There has been much talk about the biggest problem for Greece being that the Greek people do not want to pay taxes.  In comparison with Greece, Ireland is a legally compliant State where people play by the rules and the State is very serious about going after people who play fast and loose with the tax system.  Public sector and PAYE workers in Greece pay their taxes in the same way as people in Ireland.  It is taken out of their pockets.</p>  <p>  In so far as there is a problem with regard to tax in Greece, it revolves around the self-employed sector.  It is true that there is a large self-employed sector in Greece and that there has been an expansion of that sector in Ireland.  This is a sector which Fine Gael in particular would like to see expand even further.  Self-employment in the construction sector has expanded significantly from what it was in the good old days.  While previously workers in that sector would have been employed directly as PAYE workers, there has been an exponential expansion of self-employment in the sector and, with that, wholesale abuse and exploitation of that category of self-employed construction workers.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the amount of tax collected from the self-employed in the construction sector, as against that collected from PAYE workers in the sector, the numbers of which in each category are similar, while hundreds of millions are collected from the PAYE sector, a minus is often recorded in respect of those categorised as self-employed.  Even where an amount is collected, it is derisory.  Any cursory examination of the number of people who are supposed to be self-employed in the construction sector would indicate that not all of them could be, in reality, self-employed.  This sector has expanded massively and direct employment has reduced in tandem, the result of which has been a very significant loss to the Exchequer.  We hear constant and entirely credible, confirmed in many cases, examples of tax fraud and abuse and exploitation of the RTC-1 system.</p>  <p>  It is clear to me that the Minister for Finance and, in my view, Fine Gael, because it is ideologically committed to this whole notion, are not interested in dealing with this issue.  They choose to turn a blind eye to this because it enables the State to have public contract work such as school buildings construction done cheaply, even if it means workers are being exploited and the tax system is being abused.  In their view, they are promoting competition.  This abuse is taking place on a widespread basis.  While the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is not willing to address this issue, one would expect a Labour Minister to avail of any opportunity to address it and this legislation presents such an opportunity.   </p>  <p>  I was contacted again this morning by one of the Rhatigan's workers, for whom address of this issue is now a crusade.  Fair play to him because week-in, week-out he provides me with details of where this is going on.  I have not had time yet to have a proper discussion with him but he left a message on my phone this morning about another site where this is going on.  He said that contractors from the North have come up with a new scam, which has something to do with invoicing of the main contractor, to get around Scope or NERA on the issue of compliance in the context of self-employment.  This is rampant and the Minister of State knows it.  We need a specific mandate for the commission to address this issue in a serious way.  </p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made some important points on the wider issue of the minimum hourly rate.  This is of critical importance when it comes to the issue of accommodation.  The ability of people to access affordable accommodation is at crisis point.  While this is obviously a serious problem for the people, it will soon be a major problem for our economy if people cannot afford accommodation because their wages are so low.  The question of wages being sufficient to allow people to put a roof over their heads is critical.  This requires serious consideration.  It is untenable that some people are paying 50%, 60% and sometimes 70% of their income on keeping a roof over their heads.  It is shocking.  Various bodies across Europe recommend that people should not be paying more than a quarter or, at most, a third of their income for accommodation.  Otherwise, they will get into serious financial trouble.  People here are spending virtually all of their income on accommodation.  Sometimes even that is not enough to keep a roof over their heads.  The Low Pay Commission should, as part of its work, examine whether the level of pay here is adequate to ensure that people who are working can afford to pay for accommodation.  People should not have to fork out every penny they have to do that.  </p>  <p>  The proposed amendment is very good in that it points in this direction.  Even if the Minister of State will not accept it, the issue of affordability of accommodation and its relationship to wage levels must be the focus of this or any future Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900040#NN00300"><p>I subscribe to everything that Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy had to say in regard to amendment No. 7.  What we have been speaking for the past half hour in the context of the amendment is the remit of the Low Pay Commission.  This is not all about low pay or the minimum wage, rather it is about a living wage.  Many examples have been given.  It should be within the remit of the commission to ascertain or determine what a living wage should be.</p><p>It is a definition that has been debated by different groups right across Europe.  It is the human right of every person to have a wage which affords him or her a quality of life that makes existence liveable.</p> <p> The difficulty with this Bill in its entirety is that it gives no indication that we are heading in the direction we should be heading, namely, towards the introduction of a liveable wage.  The points Deputy Boyd Barrett made are crucial to this debate.  Unless we begin to move in the direction of a living wage and focus on people's quality of life, we will continue to see exploitation in such areas as housing, where even people on reasonable wages are being crucified in terms of what they have to pay out.  Those on low pay, including people making only the national minimum wage, some of whom are on local authority housing lists, are struggling to meet the cost of lower-rent accommodation.</p> <p> We need to move beyond talking about low pay and minimum pay and instead focus on ensuring that people earn a liveable rate of pay.  I am sure the Minister of State would subscribe to that concept.  It is how one lifts people out of poverty while at the same providing stimulation to the economy.  If we pay people a liveable wage, they will have the means to spend more in the economy and have a better quality of life.  To that end, the remit of the Low Pay Commission should be expanded to allow it to make recommendations as to what a living wage should be.  It is not about whether people should or should not be on low pay - I expect the commission will say they should not be - or about setting a minimum wage.  The minimum wage is not working.  In fact, it is keeping thousands of people on or below the poverty line.  In a context in which the cost of living is beginning to increase again, particularly in respect of housing, it is clear that a national minimum wage is not the solution to poverty in the medium or long term.  I conclude by referring, as I did earlier, to the observation by the ambassador from Switzerland that paying people a reasonable wage is the way to take them out of poverty and stimulate the economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900041#OO00200"><p>I am pleased to point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that wages are increasing across the economy, though not perhaps at a rate that would satisfy him and his colleagues.  After years of extreme difficulty in this country, that development illustrates how far we have come.  We have a way to go before we reach a point where everybody can share in the accelerating economic recovery.  There is no denying, however, that the evidence shows wages are rising across the bulk of our economic sectors.</p><p>Section 5 of the Bill sets out a comprehensive and challenging set of factors that the Low Pay Commission must take into account in any year in coming to a recommendation as to the appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to assign additional factors that the commission must take into account when recommending a minimum hourly rate of pay, including a requirement to reduce the incidence of low pay and support the phased introduction of a living wage.  I would have been happy to address the issues of overtime and Sunday premiums, as dealt with in amendments Nos. 6 and 8, but unfortunately those amendments were ruled out of order.</p><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment No. 9 seeks to have the Low Pay Commission, in addition to its obligation to issue an annual recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, be  required to make an annual recommendation to the Minister on a living wage.  I have spoken in the past, both here and elsewhere, about my support for the concept of a living wage.  However, we need to differentiate between the application of a national statutory minimum wage and the living wage movement, which is a societal movement that would see employers volunteer to pay - indeed, be proud to pay - what is agreed to be a living wage.  I have looked very closely at the operation of the living wage concept in the United Kingdom and how it has evolved in recent years.  That initiative grew out of a very successful grassroots civil society campaign and draws its strength from the fact it has cross-society and cross-economy support.  Some 1,500 employers have signed up to and endorsed that approach.  As I said, it is a concept the T&aacute;naiste and I support.</p><p>There were interesting developments yesterday in the House of Commons when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, made some compelling remarks on the living wage.  Whatever about the flaws in his overall approach, we should at least appreciate that efforts are finally being made in the neighbouring jurisdiction, limited as they might well prove to be, to tackle low pay.  What the Chancellor has done does indeed seem, on the face of it, like the political masterstroke some have described it as.  However, when one chisels away at it and looks under the bonnet, it is, like all tactical masterpieces, found wanting in many respects.  People have not reflected on the impact that cuts such as the withdrawal of tax credits will have on the working poor in the UK.  Those cuts seem to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>for the more positive changes that are being introduced.</p><p>What Mr. Osborne has done, in effect, is set out on a journey towards an annual increase in the national minimum wage, which is what the Low Pay Commission in the UK would have been doing anyway.  In other words, he has really just rebranded the national minimum wage as a living wage and has, in fact, put a ceiling on that payment of &pound;9 up to 2020.  I am not prepared to impose any such restriction on the thinking of the Low Pay Commission in Ireland.  It is a flawed approach to impose any such curtailment on an independent statutory body, but it is what is happening in the UK.  Nobody should be seeking to strangle an important civic society movement or trying to occupy that space.  As I said, Mr. Osborne's initiative amounts simply to a rebranding of the national minimum wage, but that is a discussion for another day and a matter for our colleagues across the water.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n noted, I have indicated my intention to host a forum on the living wage in the autumn, to which we will invite civil society organisations, trade unions and employers to discuss how a living wage might be applied in this country.</p><p>Amendment No. 10, from Deputy Calleary, would require the Low Pay Commission each year to research and recommend to the Minister national minimum rates of pay for youth and apprentice categories, and to research and recommend to the Minister national minimum rates of pay for female workers.  The sub-minimum rates provided for since 2000 under the National Minimum Wage Act were originally recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission, which was appointed to advise on the introduction of a national minimum wage.  The commission recommended that employees under the age of 18 be entitled to 70% of the national minimum wage, with a view to striking a balance between ensuring young employees were not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay applicable to them would not encourage students to leave full-time education.  The National Minimum Wage Commission also recommended that sub-minimum rates apply to employees in the first two years of employment over age 18 and to those undergoing structured training.  The commission was of the view that employers should be encouraged to focus on training and that the structure of the national minimum wage should provide encouragement and inducement for employers to take on unskilled staff and involve them in training.  The rationale underpinning these provisions is that, all else being equal, an experienced employee is of more value and more productive than a new entrant or trainee.  It is equally important that those seeking employment are not prevented from having an opportunity to enter work because of their lack of experience or training.</p><p>Apprentices have been excluded from the scope of the national minimum wage provisions since their introduction in 2000.  The reason for this is that there had been a separate long-standing statutory wage-setting mechanism covering apprentices, namely, registered employment agreements.  While the REA system was struck down in 2013 by the Supreme Court, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015, which has been passed by this House, will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the possibility for sectoral employment orders covering statutory pay and pension provisions for workers in particular sectors, including provisions for apprenticeship rates.  These are important issues which may be appropriate for the Low Pay Commission to examine in the context of a future work programme.  However, I do not propose to include them as part of the commission's ongoing annual recommendations.</p><p>On the question of requiring the commission to recommend national minimum rates of pay for female workers, the Deputy is aware that the commission may be asked to look at a range of related matters in the context of the minimum wage.  The prevalence of female workers on or near the national minimum wage is well known and it is in this context that I see the Deputy's concerns better addressed.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>In any event, setting a minimum wage based on a person's gender would probably be in breach of equality legislation.<br/><br/>On amendment No. 11, I indicated on Committee Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to section 5 on Report Stage to amend the date on which the committee must submit its recommendations and report to the Minister.  As the Bill is currently drafted, the date specified is 15 July of the year to which the examination relates.  I propose to change this to the third Tuesday of July of the year to which the examination relates.  <br/><br/>It had been my intention to bring this Bill back to the Seanad on 9 July following the completion of Report and Final Stages on 6 July, but I have been informed that this will not be possible for logistical printing reasons.  Instead, it is now my intention to return to the Seanad on 13 July, with the intention of having the legislation finalised at that point.  This presents some difficulties in terms of having the Bill on the Statute Book on or before 15 July.  Accordingly, I have decided to move the reporting period back by four working days.  The amendment also has the advantage of removing a specific date from the Bill and providing for a day that will fit the Government's schedule and with the general calendar of Government meetings.  I wish to stress that this change to the reporting period is not associated in any way with the work of the commission, which I understand is making very good progress.  The minor change is purely for logistical reasons.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 12 to 18, inclusive, provide for the addition of a range of factors to the already extensive list the commission is required to take into account when making a recommendation.  I and my Government colleagues have given very serious consideration to the criteria set out in the Bill.  Many of them have stood the test of time and are incorporated into national minimum wage legislation going back to 2000.  They provide a balanced suite of issues and factors for the commissioner to consider.  To add a further wide-ranging list of factors to be taken into account, as set out in these amendments, would make it virtually impossible for the commission to undertake the level of analysis required, and it would be very difficult to produce an agreed recommendation, or any recommendation at all, by a set date on an annual basis.<br/><br/>Some of the additional factors, such as issues surrounding decent work, are part of a wider decent work agenda that I am pursuing, with the introduction of sectoral employment orders and registered employment agreements and the work we are doing on zero- and low-hour contracts, or that already exists in the context of the Bills I mentioned, including the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015.  Previous references to changes in earnings have served us well and I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings changes or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings.  Specific expertise is available to the commission to properly interpret changes in earnings data.<br/><br/>Another amendment refers to Northern Ireland.  Comparisons with it or other jurisdictions that have national minimum wages must involve the absolute values while also having regard to purchasing power parity.  The commission has sufficient expertise available to it to make these distinctions.  It would not be appropriate to specifically require the commission on an annual basis to analyse different welfare supports, health care provision, child care and social housing across different jurisdictions.  I agree that fair wages should never be sacrificed for the creation of jobs that are exploitative or unsustainable.  That is why section 4 of the Bill provides very clear objectives for the national minimum wage.  In this regard, the commission will be obliged to ensure that any recommendations it makes on the minimum wage rate will ensure it is a rate that is fair and sustainable.<br/><br/>On bogus self-employment, as referred to in amendment No. 17, I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Boyd Barrett and others.  This is an enforcement issue, rather than one that the Low Pay Commission should be required to take into account.  Deputies will be aware that NERA inspectors carry out inspections of employers&rsquo; employment records and workplaces to determine compliance with employment law and employees' statutory entitlements.  In 2014, NERA carried out more than 5,500 such inspections.  The policy of NERA is to seek voluntary compliance where breaches of employment law are detected, and it works with employers and allows them every reasonable opportunity to rectify breaches.  Allegations of non-compliance with employment rights legislation should be referred to NERA, which investigates matters that are brought to its attention.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned complaints he has received about alleged bogus self-employment, and I encourage him to report them to the relevant authorities.  If he wishes, he can pass them on to me and I will address them on his behalf.<br/><br/>It is not within the remit of NERA to make determinations regarding the employment status of individuals <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>employment or self-employment; that is the responsibility of the scope section of the Department of Social Protection.  The Revenue Commissioners also have a role to play.  Where either of these bodies makes a determination on these issues, NERA, in accordance with the code of practice for determining the employment or self-employment status of individuals, will generally accept their decisions on the issue.  Finally, the matter can also be determined by the courts.  Whether any given situation is an abuse of the subcontracting or relevant contracts tax, RCT, systems is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.<br/><br/>On the promotion of gender equality, it is important to note that the national minimum wage applies to all workers irrespective of gender.  As such, it is the epitome of a measure that eliminates gender inequality in its application.  However, as minimum wage workers tend to be predominantly female, by its very nature, a national minimum wage is more beneficial to female workers.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 10 and 12 to 18, inclusive.</p></speech>

I will not speak for too long.</p>  <p>  Most of my amendments are to do with the necessity for a living wage.  The Government has a major opportunity to deal with this, an opportunity that it may not have again.  That means we should grasp this opportunity with both hands.  Work is currently being undertaken on an independent basis by the Living Wage Technical Group, which is a group of progressive organisations.  We believe the Low Pay Commission needs to undertake similar work.  To do that, it needs to broaden the remit of issues to take into consideration.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 14 refers to economic inequality.  Nowhere in the Bill is the commission instructed to consider poverty when making recommendations to the Minister.  It is difficult to believe that we could have such a debate without the crisis of poverty being hardwired into the Bill.  The Bill is too heavily weighted towards a limited number of economic measurements and is not helpful in tackling economic inequality or rebuilding the economy.  </p>  <p>  Others have mentioned that the percentage share of the national income comprising wages has crashed.  I understand there has been a fall of 20% in the past 20 years, which is in line with other European countries, but it is still a significant shift in how an economy works.  In other words, an economy is not working for the people who are working in it any longer.  Some 50% of all women in the State earn less than &euro;20,000, which is a shocking figure for this generation.  It seems completely unreasonable that the issue of income inequality between men and women is not hardwired into the Bill.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State said the minimum wage was blind to gender and therefore everybody would be treated the same.  However, we know everybody is not treated the same, and one's gender determines one's income, to a certain extent, under a minimum wage.  Unless the infrastructure of the minimum wage is changed or how we deal with low pay is changed in a way that takes gender inequality into consideration with regard to wages, we will not fix the issue.  </p>  <p>  I refer to amendment No. 18.  The construction industry in this country is in crisis with regard to how it operates.  Decent construction work should involve direct employment, with people receiving a wage, sick pay, holiday pay and the entitlements that citizens should expect.  Recruitment companies in this country are advertising for people on the RCT system to do work that is normally done by those paid a direct wage.  They tell companies they do not owe the workers any entitlements - holidays, pensions or anything else.</p><p>These companies operate in the chasm the Government has left in company and contract law.  They are making fun of the Government with regard to commitments.  I know of people who worked on the Kishoge site who were told by their employer they were now self-employed and gave them their wages.  They thought the money was for one individual, but the employer told them it was for all five people in the room.  This is what is happening under the chaos of the Government's relevant contracts tax legislation.</p></speech>

He stated wages are rising here and that we are trying to deal with low pay.  Is the Government not doing exactly the same thing?  Is that not the whole point of these amendments?  I am very glad to say a motion was passed at the ICTU conference, against some resistance it has to be said by the unions generally associated with the Labour Party, but nonetheless the majority of unions, headed up by the right to water trade unions, stating that ICTU should oppose water charges because they are another regressive tax which reduce the real income of workers and therefore it is an issue for the trade union movement.  They are absolutely right.  I am sure it was for political reasons that certain trade unions with a strong association with the Labour Party opposed the motion.  It speaks exactly to what the Minister of State just rightly accused David Cameron of doing.</p></speech>

With regard to amendment No. 10, the Minister of State mentioned that apprentices are subject to registered employment agreements, but the Low Pay Commission should be in a position to set a consistency about certain conditions for every apprentice.  It should be the overarching body which sets the guidelines for various types of apprentices.  As other Deputies have said, women are particularly affected by low pay issues.  A total of 90% of those affected by the Dunnes Stores situation are women.  This is the case throughout the service and retail sectors.  The amendment does not intend to introduce different rates and the Minister of State acknowledged this.  The Low Pay Commission should be the body which, from its inception and foundation, has enough ambition and manpower to be the overarching body for low pay in all areas.  Rather than having a silo approach whereby various people have various areas of responsibility, we should give this body the teeth and resources from the start to tackle all of the issues, not only pay but, as other Deputies have said, accommodation, child care and all of the expenses which affect the value of pay.  Let us do this now and not come back in a couple of months time with amending legislation, or when we see the various restrictions in the scope of the body, which we are identifying now and which we could fix now rather than have the body chained to its remit in a few years' time.</p>  <p>  With regard to what Chancellor Osborne did yesterday, the view of a Tory, particularly that brand of Tory, of what is a living wage is very different from the view of 99% of the rest of the world.  It is more an attempt to stifle debate on a living wage versus a minimum wage than anything else.</p></speech>

This was the consideration of the time.  I stand to be corrected, and I do not want to mislead the House in any way, but my understanding is that the rate was not necessarily paid to anybody.  As I understand it, the vast majority of people, if not all, on the national minimum wage are paid &euro;8.65 and not the sub-minimum rates.  This was a consideration of the National Minimum Wage Commission in 2000.  It is in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and it is what it considered to be appropriate at the time.  I doubt there is any danger somebody is being paid below &euro;8.65, regardless of age.</p></speech>

I do not know how widespread it is, but certainly I am in favour of no exemption for under 18s whatsoever and everybody being entitled the minimum wage.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that wages are rising rather than reducing.  On 16 June 2015, the CSO produced a report on earnings and labour costs.  According to the most recent and up to date figures we have, average annual earnings declined again in 2014.  They have declined every year since 2009.  In 2013, they were &euro;35,830 and in 2014, they were &euro;35,768.  This indicates a continuing, although slowing, rate of decline which is, broadly speaking, the model of this so-called recovery we have.</p>  <p>  A discussion has emerged around the living wage in Britain.  More extensive research has been done in Britain than here on the impact of the living wage.  Research has shown that if the minimum wage were to become what is assessed to be the living wage, 6 million workers would be lifted out of poverty and Exchequer funds would be increased to the tune of &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>Similarly, if we had a significant increase in the minimum wage to a level in the region of a living wage, it would have a massive impact on people's lives and would bring increased tax revenue, which could in turn be used to offset other costs for small businesses.</p></speech>

We can consider various respected surveys from the likes of IBEC or <i>Industrial Relations News</i>and see that there is considerable wage growth being experienced at the moment.</p></speech>

The Deputy is entitled to the opinion but I am happy to accept the veracity of the research it undertakes as a serious body, regardless of where Deputy Boyd Barrett might stand.  Employers create jobs and IBEC anticipates pay awards of at least 2% in the majority of companies this year, which is to be welcomed.  The Small Firms Association would indicate something similar.  It is fair to say that as employment is growing, so are wages.</p></speech>

Indeed, it has slipped backwards.  Given the facts that low wages are entrenched in the economy and we need a system to ensure that the minimum wage is a decent living wage, it is important that we use the Low Pay Commission in an effort to keep an eye on poverty, low wages and the minimum wage.  Britain, which has more experience with a minimum wage and low pay commission than we do, is coming to the view that its commission needs a watchdog role.  This view was echoed by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI.  In its submission to the jobs committee, it called for our commission's remit to be expanded to include a watchdog role and for powers to be granted to it to set targets for reducing low pay across a number of areas.</p>  <p>  Recently, IMPACT launched a report, entitled "JobBridge - Time to Start Again?", in which it sought for the JobBridge scheme to be scrapped and for the Low Pay Commission to be tasked with examining the prevalence of open market, unpaid internships.  The report, spearheaded by Dr. Mary Murphy of Maynooth University, recommended that the commission report on the key patterns of paid and unpaid open market internships.  Some 80,000 people are in job activation schemes, many of which do not offer those individuals the economic value of their work.  People are being exploited, are not receiving extra training, have no opportunity to progress in their roles and are receiving low pay.</p>  <p>  These two suggestions are innovative uses of the Low Pay Commission.  They would benefit society and empower the commission to eradicate poverty.  It is also noteworthy that the British are considering developing their Low Pay Commission further whereas we are seeking to replicate its original version.  They are designing an iPad while we are designing the calculator.  We need to ensure that we are ahead of the curve in developing mechanisms that eradicate low pay.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should not use this debate to say "No" to every amendment.  Instead, the Government should listen to Opposition parties' positive proposals, not be partisan, focus on those proposals that would be of material benefit to individuals' pay packets and ability to look after their families and take some of these amendments on board.</p></speech>

We need a watchdog in respect of employment, low pay and exploitation.  We have some watchdogs, for example, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, but they are underfunded.</p><p>I wish to speak in support of subsection (6) of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment on the role of internships and the need for more research into same.  Having done an amount of work in this regard, particularly through the campaigning website, <i>ScamBridge.ie</i>, it is my strong belief that internships, facilitated by the State via JobBridge, First Steps and Gateway in terms of councils, T&uacute;s and so on, are consciously used by many employers to take advantage of free labour.  This is widespread and has an impact across employment, in that employers can effectively tell or imply to employees that, if they seek wage increases or so on, the employer can bring in someone for free to do that work and therefore question why they would grant any wage increase.  Rather than dealing with the issue of unemployment, internships can make it worse, because they depress wages generally in the economy and normalise the idea of people working for free.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon, but an international one.  We should stand against it.  Researching the key patterns in paid and unpaid open market internships would assist us in knowing what is happening and outlawing those internship programmes that are exploitative, which ours are.</p><p>Turning to amendments Nos. 20 and 21 from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, we must be sensitive and responsive to changes in the cost of living, particularly as regards the low paid.  The commission making recommendations every three years is not adequate.  A better approach would be yearly.  It would be even more preferable were minimum wage rates indexed to inflation so that, if there was inflation, low paid and minimum wage workers would not automatically lose out.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 21 specifically, three months is too long a lapse between recommendations emanating from the commission and their being acted upon by the Minister in the context of cost-of-living increases and higher inflation rates.  Such a time lapse would be used by employer organisations to apply pressure on the media and build opposition to increases in the minimum wage.  It should be shortened to one month.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to ask for monitoring by the Low Pay Commission.  ICTU stated that any legislation had to include provisions that ensured that employees could not be frustrated in their attempts to improve working conditions, but the commission must go further.  If low pay is so entrenched in our society as to make us only second to the US, we must have some way of monitoring how people are treated after we pass this legislation.  If we do not monitor something, how will we know whether it is working?  Some of us have a difference of opinion about whether this should be about a living wage rather than a low or minimum wage.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The Minister of State has rejected the amendment that would have included a reference to a "living wage".  I do not think he should have rejected it.  Surely it is reasonable to ask that we find some way of monitoring this over the next few years.  Should we leave it once more to the OECD and to other groups to find out how many people are on the minimum wage or on low income rates?  What is the point of the commission if it just finishes after it makes its recommendations without being able to monitor what happens to workers in Ireland over the next five or six years?  How are we going to know how people are being treated?  We have already heard examples today of people not even getting the minimum wage.  The Minister of State and I know there are examples of people not getting it.  I wanted to speak earlier on amendment No. 10, but I did not get an opportunity to do so.  As I said earlier, it is unacceptable that people under the age of 18 are on a 70% rate because it opens the door to exploitation.  I think the recommendation in this amendment that some way should be found to monitor this matter is a reasonable one.  The commission is the group to do that.  We should not be leaving it to organisations in Europe like the human rights committee to talk about the breach of human rights that is the denial to people of the right to earn a minimum or living wage.  We have to find some way for this commission to monitor this.  I suggest we should instruct it to do so.</p></speech>

The expression about lies, damned lies and statistics is certainly a relevant idea when we are talking about low pay.  We can bandy around statistics, as the Minister of State did earlier when he said that pay levels are increasing.  We can debate whether the JobBridge and Gateway schemes are licences for exploitation or, as I suspect the Government would argue when cases of abuse are highlighted, otherwise good programmes that are being abused in a small number of rogue instances.  Similarly, there is an urgent need for rigorous monitoring and enforcement levels to end the abuses associated with bogus self-employment.  We can debate things at theoretical, legislative and statistical levels, but the devil is always in the detail of the individual real cases.  That is how we discover what is really happening and what needs to be addressed, tightened up and changed.  If the Low Pay Commission is to become an active force in addressing the scourge of low pay, the abuse of schemes like JobBridge and the question of bogus self-employment, it must be given a real, tangible and concrete watchdog role.  I have nothing to add to Deputy Paul Murphy's points.  I agree that we need something that is responsive to the changes in the cost of living, etc.  As such changes often happen over relatively short periods of time, we need to be able to review these matters on a more frequent basis.  I believe these amendments are sensible and practical.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.718" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900048#VV00300"><p>Amendment No. 19 proposes that as part of its functions the commission will be required to undertake a number of specific tasks; for example, monitoring the incidence of low pay by examining the prevalence of pay at or below two thirds of median earnings, key patterns in paid and unpaid open market internships and the effectiveness of existing policies to enforce the national minimum wage.  Section 5 of the Bill introduces a new section 10(C)(4), which provides that the commission may be asked by the Minister to examine and report on matters relating generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  The Bill provides that such a request shall be made not later than the first two months of each year, apart from this year, and will be part of the commission&rsquo;s work programme.  I believe the legislative provision covering the work programme to be given to the commission each year should not be prescriptive and inflexible.  Amendment No. 19 would tie the hands of the commission with regard to its annual work programme.  A request can be made to the commission to examine and report on specific issues related to the work of the commission.  While the specific topics raised in the amendment may well be worthy of examination by the commission at some point, I do not believe it is appropriate to set them down in legislation.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 20, section 5(5) of the Bill provides that every three years, the commission will report generally on the operation of this Act and, in particular, on the impact of any orders made under it on low pay, income distribution and employment costs.  Amendment No. 20 would impose a requirement on the commission to produce such a report every year.  I believe that would be quite impractical.  We do not want the commission to spend all its time analysing itself and its own work.  The intention behind the requirement for the commission to submit an analysis every three years of the operation of the Act and, in particular, on the impact of orders made on foot of its recommendations is to allow time for the full impact of the orders to be properly assessed.  Inevitably, it take some time for the full effects of such orders to feed through and for worthwhile and reliable evidence to be analysed.  In my view, to require the commission to carry out such indepth analysis of the impact of its recommendation regarding the national minimum rate on an annual basis would not be a good use of the limited resources available to it.   In addition to the submission of an annual recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, the commission may be asked to examine and report on matters relating generally to its functions under the Act.  We went into that in some detail earlier.  The reports that the commission will make, in addition to the report it submits to the Minister accompanying its annual recommendation on the national minimum wage, will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 21, I agreed on Report Stage in the Seanad to introduce an amendment to provide that the Minister shall cause a copy of any report or recommendation submitted by the commission to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than three months after the receipt of that report or recommendation.  Amendment No. 21 would provide that the reports should be submitted within one month of their receipt.  Section 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister is required to make a decision on a recommendation of the Low Pay Commission within three months of receiving it.  I would not consider it appropriate to require the Minister to lay the report before the Oireachtas while consideration of the issue is still ongoing.  Of course Deputies and Senators will have an opportunity to debate the reports as they are tabled and scheduled for debate in the Houses.  That is correctly the case.  Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The amendments propose to reduce the period within which the Minister must act on a recommendation of the Low Pay Commission from three months to one month, particularly in the context of cost of living increases and the potential for pressure to be exerted on the Minister not to act on the commission's recommendations.</p></speech>

The provision for the Minister to make a decision on the commission&rsquo;s recommendation within three months is consistent with the existing provision in the National Minimum Wage Act since it was originally enacted in 2000.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the Minister would be given a reasonable amount of time to give careful consideration to the matter and, in this context, three months is not excessive.</p>  <p>  The 2000 Act also provides that the Minister may accept, reject or vary a Labour Court recommendation on the national minimum wage.  Accordingly, I do not consider it necessary to specify that a decision by a Minister in future to vary the terms of a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission needs to specify that it would be in "improved" terms.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 23 and 24.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in supports this sensible proposal to ensure people have a decent standard of living and that wages may not be reduced by means of other mechanisms. </p></speech>

Amendment No. 25 provides for a prohibition or restriction on charges or deductions from the national minimum hourly rate of pay.  The Payment of Wages Act already provides a redress mechanism for unlawful deductions from wages.  Section 5(1) of that Act allows an employer to make deductions required or authorised by law, such as PAYE or PRSI, or required or authorised by a term of the employee's contract, such as occupational pensions schemes, or any deduction agreed to in writing in advance by the employee - for example, trade union subscriptions or VHI premiums.  Section 5(2) of the Act places significant restrictions on employers with regard to deductions or the receipt of payments from wages of employees.</p>  <p>  As regards fair hours of employment rules, the Organisation of Working Time Act regulates working hours.  In this context, Deputies will be aware that I have commissioned a study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts by the University of Limerick and I expect the study to be completed in the third quarter of this year.  Where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections in place under employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by the Government.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 25. </p>  <p>  Amendment No. 26 seeks to ensure that businesses will be allowed sufficient time to plan for any adjustment proposed in the national minimum wage.  I am supportive of the view that any increase in the minimum wage must be done in an orderly way in order that companies can plan their business.  I remind Deputies that the ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the most recent Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, with lengthy gaps between increases, as occurred in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than regular, smaller and fairly predictable increases.</p>  <p>  A significant benefit of the establishment of the Low Pay Commission is that the national minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and, therefore, when they occur, any adjustments will be incremental and less disruptive for business than the previous step changes which were criticised by the ESRI in its 2006 analysis.  The deadline of 15 July 2015 for submission of the Low Pay Commission's recommendation was specifically to allow time for consideration of the issue in the context of the year's budgetary considerations and to provide for any adjustment in a planned way.  Consequently, this very structure achieves the objective the Senator seeks in his amendment.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will also ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to the Government is evidence-based by utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the national minimum wage will have a minimum adverse impact on employment and competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The commission will consult workers and employers who are directly affected by the national minimum wage, as it has been doing, to get a handle on the real experience of businesses and employees in sectors associated with low pay.  While I recognise the intent behind the proposal, I cannot accept the amendment, as I do not consider it necessary given the new structures and processes that are being put in place.</p></speech>

It is a very straightforward and decent amendment and it sets out what should be expected for the functionality of the Low Pay Commission.  It was recommended by ICTU.  Workers should be able to give evidence to the commission and need to be protected when they do so.  This protection was offered under the Workplace Relations Service and similar anti-victimisation protections are in place in other areas such as the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill.  We want to make it implicit within the Bill.</p></speech>

The proposal is to introduce in a new section 7 of the Bill anti-victimisation provisions for workers who make statements to the Low Pay Commission or who give evidence to the commission via a representative organisation.  I recognise and respect the Deputy's intention in terms of tabling the amendment, but there is already a number of protections in place for workers who consider that they have been the subject of victimisation in the workplace.  As matters stand, any worker who finds himself or herself the subject of victimisation for making a statement to the Low Pay Commission or giving evidence via his or her trade union already has the possibility to take a case under the Industrial Relations Acts.  In addition, the 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute.  A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  These protections will be further enhanced in the context of provisions in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 which deals with the Government's commitment on collective bargaining and which the House has recently passed.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It should be someone who is actually running a business and who understands the day-to-day implications of the decisions being taken by the commission and its recommendations.  That would bring a very practical view to its work.</p></speech>

In their submission, the National Women's Council of Ireland recognised that it is an area of expertise that should be involved in the decision making process.  We support its recommendation that the expertise on social policy should be included.  Amendment No. 47 is similar to Deputy Calleary's in that we suggest a low-paid worker would bring invaluable and practical knowledge and expertise to the work of the commission.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that we have a very strong balance on the Low Pay Commission.  All of the members applied through the Public Appointments Service which is a system that works very well.  I am satisfied that those who have an understanding of the interests of employers can reflect very well the experience of those operating in the SME sector, in particular the sector associated with the areas the commission will be examining in some detail.  Similarly, those who have been selected through the process on the side of those with a deep interest and understanding of the interests of employees have spent a considerable amount of their working and professional lives representing the interests of low-paid workers in a very successful way.  They are bringing something extremely important to the table in consideration of all of the issues the Low Pay Commission will tease out and examine.  It is important to note that we had an open process to appoint the members of the commission whether from the perspective of the employer side, employee side, civil society and the independent academic representatives.  There is no requirement to extend further the disciplines in terms of academia.  There is sufficient expertise and knowledge there to do the job the Government has asked the commission to do and that the legislation insists it does.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

I would expect that an employer member who commits an offence under the National Minimum Wage Act would fall within these categories.  Moreover, a member could be found to have committed an offence under the full range of employment rights legislation, which could also make their membership of the commission untenable.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p>  <p>  In regard to amendment No. 50, I indicated on Committee Stage that I intended to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage relating to disqualification provisions under company law in respect of membership of the commission contained in the Schedule to the Bill.  Currently, reference is made to certain provisions of the Companies Act 1990.  This requires an amendment to include corresponding provisions under the recent Companies Act 2014.</p></speech>

I am speaking very slowly for the Minister's sake.  The main thrust of the amendment, with its focus on the appointment of a Secretary General and the assignment, rather than the appointment, of Clerk positions, is to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas Service will be, from the top down, a flexible, modern organisation which can adapt to the demands of providing support services to Parliament in the 21st century.</p>  <p>  The amendment proposes to insert two new sections to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, not the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959, which is a good indication of the modernising thrust of these amendments.  The first one provides for the appointment of a Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The second, which deals with assignments, would ensure that the current mandatory link between the Secretary General and Clerk of the D&aacute;il could be broken and put on a more flexible, optional basis depending on need, as decided on by the Ceann Comhairle of the day.  It removes the risk of a twin-track promotion whereby the posts of Clerk of the Seanad and Clerk Assistant are without competition and in the gift of the Chairman of each House.</p>  <p>  My amendment, by focusing on the recruitment of a Secretary General, would ensure that any competition would be open and would be likely to attract a broader field of candidates than if the Clerk of the D&aacute;il functions are portrayed prominently, which could deter talented individuals from applying.</p><p>My amendment, by providing that the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, would place not more than three successful candidates in order of preference, ensures that there is no dual role for the Ceann Comhairle of the day in both the nomination and the appointment process.  On that point, the Minister stated on Committee Stage that the dual role proposed for the Ceann Comhairle is the same as that of the Minister when a Secretary General in the Department is appointed.  The Minister stated that if a Minister goes with three names selected by TLAC to the Cabinet which appoints, this arrangement means &quot;... there is some flexibility for the Minister to make a discernment&quot;.  This is quite a revelation and means that despite a recruitment process by TLAC, whose personnel the Minister assures us is now predominantly private sector, ultimately it is the political officeholder who has significant if not crucial influence in the final call on the appointment.  This risks putting the working relationship of the senior Civil Service and Government Ministers or officeholder in Leinster House on an uneven footing.  Ambitious senior civil servants know who the boss is and if they are good enough to be qualified by TLAC, then all things being equal the Minister could give him or her the nod.<br/><br/>I have campaigned for a long time against the politicisation of the appointments of senior garda&iacute; and judges.  I had two Bills debated here to try to put a more transparent and independent appointment process in place, but I did not realise that TLAC, as we are now told, is subject to a Minister's discernment as well.  Ministers are ultimately in the driving seat and the senior civil servants know that, and undoubtedly adapt accordingly.  It would not be human to do otherwise.  However, what kind of culture is created and does it serve the country's interest, or the agenda of the Government of the day which - let us not be naive - may not always coincide?  Now we can understand former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, when he said at the banking inquiry last week that no official came to him when he was Minister for Finance pointing out the risks of an economic meltdown.  Thus, the Minister should adopt the principle under amendment allowing the professional independent body, TLAC, to place candidates in order of preference and, for the good of the country, do away with the indulgence of having a Minister's discernment in all top appointments.<br/><br/>To afford the Ceann Comhairle of the day the same level of discernment here in such a relatively small pool would be disproportionate, unhealthy and unwise.  The Minister's predecessor, Dr. Ryan, when bringing the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Bill 1959 through this House on 11 November 1959 thought it unwise that a Ceann Comhairle should have the power to appoint when he stated:<blockquote>It may happen that the Ceann Comhairle at some future time may be influenced in his judgment by having worked so long with a certain man [sic] [I am quoting] or something like that.  We are rather fortunate discussing this question now because it is not likely that any of those appointments will be made in our time.  We have young men [there was no room for anything broader in 1959, apparently] in the positions and we can, therefore, discuss the matter disinterestedly.  That is what I am afraid might happen - that some Ceann Comhairle in the future would be unduly prejudiced in favour of a certain person and that, in spite of consultation and so on, he would go back to that appointment.</blockquote>Clearly, allowing the Ceann Comhairle the type of discernment the Minister wants him to have would not have occurred in 1959.  My amendment would ensure that those standards, thought wise then, will be maintained now.<br/><br/>In regard to the third part of my amendment, having assignments rather than appointments to allow for full integration and flexibility, which is a mantra for this Minister for every public body but, strangely, not in Leinster House, speaks for itself and will allow for the mandatory link between the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the chief executive officer to be placed on a more flexible footing based on need, but also ensures there will not be a twin track for promotion for officials here, and the level playing pitch will apply to all as appointment to Clerk and Clerk Assistant positions in the gift of the Chairman of each House will not arise as no promotions would be involved, just assignments.<br/><br/>My amendment also provides for a new competition to take place if there is not agreement on any of the candidates nominated by TLAC.  Even the 1959 Act nomination process provided for disagreement and the fact that it is omitted in this Bill is a sign of just how <i>una voce</i>is the appointment process.  The Ceann Comhairle of the day is in the driving seat and it is not anticipated that he is likely to disagree with himself.<br/><br/>I am worried that the Minister is trying to straddle a 1959 model of management of Clerks with modern requirements for a 21st century parliamentary administration.  My amendment will get him off the hook and, in accepting it, he will be doing the State some service and ensure the Oireachtas service is fit for purpose to provide Members of this House with the services needed in the 21st century.<br/><br/>In the event that the Minister will not accept my amendment No. 1 I have tabled an alternative proposal in Nos. 2, 7, 8 and 9, which I will briefly address because they are grouped.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 2 is the main one which contains two main proposals, first, that the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be appointed by the Ceann Comhairle following a resolution passed by the D&aacute;il.  There is a number of reasons for proposing that the D&aacute;il would approve the appointment.  The first is that the Minister said, when replying to the Second Stage debate, that there was no alternative for having the Ceann Comhairle having a role both in the nomination and appointment of the Clerk given the Taoiseach no longer wanted to have such a role.  Having the D&aacute;il do so provides a solution.  The second is that having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment is more inclusive for a position that must serve all Members of the House and mitigates against any hint or perception that the Government parties had an undue influence in the appointment given their overwhelming majority on the commission.  Third, having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment is justified as there is a number of examples where the D&aacute;il approves a person for appointment to high public office, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman, and where the President appoints, and they are equal in rank in terms of pay etc. as that with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  Moreover, there are many examples of countries where the parliament approves the appointment of the Secretary General.  The amendment is not proposing that the D&aacute;il should appoint the Clerk-Secretary General which happens, for example, in the United States and Sweden, but rather the House approves the nomination from the commission for appointment by the Ceann Comhairle, as happens in Germany and the Netherlands.<br/><br/>Fourth, having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment would be seen to be more transparent and accountable and raises the profile of the D&aacute;il itself in a positive way.  It retains the open competition by TLAC as proposed in the Bill already but reduces the formal statutory role of nomination from the Ceann Comhairle to that of the commission, which would recommend a candidate to the D&aacute;il for nomination for appointment by the Ceann Comhairle.  The first stage of the process would be that TLAC would recommend not more than three candidates to the commission, which would be obliged to consult with parties or groups not represented on the commission to meet that point made during Second Stage.  The amendment also allows for a rematch of the competition in the event of a disagreement.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 provide for a confined competition among serving staff for the positions of Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad to ensure there is transparency in these senior appointments and that there is a level playing pitch across the board for all promotions inside Leinster House.  As it stands, the Bill could allow for a dual system with the Clerk and Clerk Assistant positions being filled by the gift of the Chairman of either House or all others by the standard Civil Service completion process.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 9 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 2 and while retaining the open competition by TLAC for the most senior position under the Bill, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, it defines it as a confined competition for the appointment of other clerks, as in amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.810" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900053#AAA00200"><p>I strongly welcome debate on this sort of legislation.  In truth we do not have enough proper debate in the House in terms of how the House itself should be structured.  I have said from the beginning that I do not believe this is a matter that should be determined by the Executive: it is a matter for the House.  One of the main thrusts of this legislation is for the Executive to withdraw, for example, the role of the Taoiseach in the nomination of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  It is being removed to make it exclusively a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  We had some debate on Second and Committee Stages on these matters and we need to go over some of the ground again.  Looking at Deputy Ross's first long amendment, the first two items of the section proposed by Deputy Ross would refer to the Secretary General of the Oireachtas service being the chief executive of the Oireachtas commission and being the officer accountable for the accounts of the commission for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts.  This is the position as currently exists under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts and will remain the position after the enactment of this Bill.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ross is proposing to make a couple of changes and I will deal with those now.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>First, the Deputy suggests in his amendment that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il would be appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission following consultation by the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with leaders or designated leaders of groups of parties in either House of the Oireachtas who are not represented on the membership of the commission at that time.  Second, the Deputy proposes that the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, would nominate people for appointment in order of merit, to circumscribe the ability of the Chairman of the D&aacute;il - the Ceann Comhairle - to choose whom, among candidates that are deemed suitable for the position, he might nominate to the commission for appointment.  This would make the process beyond TLAC a rubber-stamping exercise.  Although the formal appointment would be made by the commission on the nomination of the Ceann Comhairle, if there was a preferred candidate, the Ceann Comhairle's options in making a proposal, and the commission's options in determining a proposal, would be simply to accept or reject the preferred candidate.  Obviously, that would be a very significant delimiting of the role of the Ceann Comhairle.  I am willing to discuss that but I think it would be the wrong approach, and I will make a number of points in that regard.<br/><br/>In regard to the Deputy's point about a process that involves consultation with others, which we debated at some length on Committee Stage, I believe that all parties should have some involvement in this matter.  My view is that this would be captured by their being represented on the commission, but that is not my business in terms of this legislation.  The vagueness of a consultation process is, as the Deputy will know in his heart, meaningless.  What does &quot;consultation&quot; mean?  If it means calling people into a room and asking for their view, that would not have any legislative impact.  It would simply mean that the matter went through a process.  I would prefer if the commission were more broadly structured, but, as I said, that is not a matter that falls to be determined in this legislation.  It is probably a matter that would properly be addressed at the beginning of the next D&aacute;il, which is not too long away.  I do not want to put into legislation a vagueness or inexactitude in terms of a process that requires a consultation that is fairly meaningless.  The amendment provides that leaders or designated leaders be consulted.  Are their views to have a meaning?  Are they to have an overruling view or is it simply that somebody - in this instance, the Ceann Comhairle - is to have a consultation with them?<br/><br/>This is a fairly simple measure.  As I have repeatedly said, it is a modest improvement, in my judgment, in the appointment system for the most senior administrator in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The objective is to open this up to open competition, with candidates from within and outside the public service invited to apply for the job, the criteria to be laid down in advance and TLAC to receive those applications, interview the candidates in its normal way and make its judgment.  It is not normal procedure for TLAC to prioritise.  As I have said previously, it provides a shortlist of suitable candidates.  There have been occasions when, of all candidates, only one was deemed suitable.  That would be a very short list.  In the main, two or three candidates are presented to a Minister for appointment to, say, the role of Secretary General.  <br/><br/>I know there is a purist view reflected in the Deputy's contributions to this House in terms of the role of any politician in doing anything.  I happen to believe that people are elected to do things.  Being elected gives one a mandate.  It is not the mark of Cain that makes one unsuitable to make judgments or, to use a phrase I used on Committee Stage, discernments.  The Deputy was critical of Ministers having a list of two or three candidates from which to choose, those candidates having been deemed suitable and appropriate by TLAC to serve in the office of Secretary General.  The Deputy thinks Ministers should not have any leeway and that it should be a <i>fait accompli </i>that TLAC would make that judgment.  Having had the privilege of leading three Departments, I do not agree with that.  A Minister comes into a Department with an agenda.  The most important aid in delivering the agenda that the Minister is elected to implement is the chief administrator of his Department, namely, the Secretary General.  There will be times when people are not compatible.  A Minister has to make a judgment in terms of compatibility.  Often Ministers do not have that choice because there is an extant Secretary General, but where there is to be a new Secretary General, I think it is appropriate that some choice, in terms of the person who is to serve in the post, be available to a Minister.  I know Deputy Ross disagrees with that, but I do not think it would be wrong.  In fact, I think it would be the right course of action for the same choices to be available to the Ceann Comhairle.  Currently, the Ceann Comhairle, with the Taoiseach, makes a choice from the pool of talent within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is too narrow a pool.  I believe there should be a much broader pool of talent available.  This should include anybody who is interested in the job.  Judgment in regard to whether a candidate is suitable for appointment to this important job should be made based on the information contained in his or her curriculum vitae, his or her experience and the skill set he or she may bring to the job.  For those reasons, I do not accept the views expressed by Deputy Ross.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's point regarding a vote of the D&aacute;il on the matter, I have examined what happens in other jurisdictions.  In some jurisdictions Parliament votes on such matters.  In my opinion, this politicises the position of chief administrator.  I think it should be a professional appointment.  The D&aacute;il does not vote on the appointment of Secretaries General of Departments.  In the American system, many appointments, including to the position of ambassador, are voted on by the Senate.  That is its tradition.  I do not think it is a particularly good tradition.  I think that the independence of our Civil Service has been one of the great strengths of our Republic over its almost 100 years of existence.  I do not believe that voting in the D&aacute;il on a nomination will enhance that independence or that status.  I think it would diminish it somewhat.  That is my personal view on this matter.  I do not agree with the line taken by the Deputy in that regard.<br/><br/>With regard to the other amendments in the group, I do not have a completely fixed view in relation to the other officerships that are encompassed by this legislation.  I did ponder for a while on whether they should also be part of the TLAC process, but felt, on balance, that there needs to be flexibility within the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of such appointments and that the redeployment of less senior staff than the Clerk of the D&aacute;il should be done from within the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Ceann Comhairle in consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  If appointment to the positions of Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad was by way of the TLAC process, this would tie people into fixed terms, with no flexibility thereafter for them to be redeployed to other areas to get different experience.  It would also lessen the uniqueness of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Although I have argued that there should be an open competition for the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il and chief executive of the commission, with the same person fulfilling both roles, I believe we need to preserve not only the status but the independence of each House.</p><p>That is why I want to give a role to the chairman of each House in determining staff appointments, subject to the formal decision-making role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is a better way of going about it than what we had before.</p> <p> On the question of whether these provisions will be the last dealing with this issue, I hope they are not.  I would like to see the new D&aacute;il look afresh at all these matters, because we need to modernise the administration of the Houses generally.  That is probably best done by an incoming D&aacute;il rather than one in the last months of its term.  It is important that when we have a vacancy for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, as there currently is, that it be filled in a more modern way than was the case in the past.  As a result of the provisions in this Bill, the incoming Clerk of the D&aacute;il will be appointed through an open and transparent process which will involve the endorsement of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</p></speech>

Although this is a short Bill, it was a couple of years in the drafting and, as such, I did not really expect him to accept any amendments.  I am aware of the political dynamics that have been going on behind the scenes and the difficulties that are left unspoken, for some reason, in this House and which are the reason it took so long bring the legislation forward.  I do not intend to go into any of that other than to observe that there appears to have been a struggle between the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle on the issue and the Bill is some sort of a fudged compromise.  It is an outcome that is detrimental to the culture of political life in this country, and I say that with full sincerity.  I accept that the Minister is genuine in what he says in terms of why he is making these appointments, but most party politicians do not see this the same way as do some of the Independent Members.  We see the use of the word "discernment", which is a kind of euphemism for patronage and choice, as once again giving-----</p></speech>

The use of the word "discernment" gives the Minister a power he or she should not have.  One of the great curses of political life in this country is that all parties, when they get into power, look after their own.  I referred in my initial contribution to the Judiciary and the Garda, where we find more obvious examples of this type of thing because those institutions are more prolific than the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Nevertheless, the administration of these Houses is an important issue.  It is indicative of the persistence of the political culture that there is to be no change in this regard.  Indeed, the discernment which Ministers have in the making of appointments, as referred to by the Minister, is now being extended to the Ceann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  I hoped but did not expect there would be a change in the political culture, led by this House, such that this type of ministerial power, the power of patronage and preference, would be taken out of the political arena.  The Ceann Comhairle is, after all, a politician, whether we like it or not.  The Ceann Comhairle is elected and is part of the culture, even though, in theory, he or she is a person of impeccable character and infinite and infallible qualities.  That is not quite the case in practice, but it is the kind of fiction we are supposed to believe in.  I had hoped this House might set an example and be the forerunner in effecting a change in the political culture, but that is not to be.  The Minister knows as well as we do that the use of political power, especially in the allocation of top jobs, has been abused by all parties since the foundation of the State.  It has been abused to the extent that people who are blatantly not qualified are promoted into positions which are beyond their abilities.  They are promoted because they are members of political parties and have served those parties well.  They pop up with qualifications, some of which are fig leafs and others genuine, and are appointed, with extraordinary regularity not just to semi-State bodies, but to the Bench and to the top of the Garda in positions to which they probably would not be promoted if they were not of a certain political colour.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that type of practice is not going to end.  The retirement of the last Clerk gave us an opportunity to reform such practices in this House.  It is very unfortunate that the opportunity is being forfeited.  I regret it but am not surprised by it.</p></speech>

These provisions represent a fundamental step towards exactly the culture he is talking about.  Under the current regime, the Ceann Comhairle selects the Clerk from the staff of the House.  I am proposing that the post be filled by way of a competition that is open to all and administered through the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  I have completely reformed that committee in my time in office and it now consists of a majority of external members.  Every interview panel for the appointment to positions such as the Clerk of the D&aacute;il will be chaired by an external member and comprise an external majority.  The only people that could be given patronage under this system, as the Deputy puts it, are those included on the short list as being deemed suitable for appointment.  In addition, as Deputy Ross knows, we have fundamentally transformed the system of appointment to State boards, which is now done through an independent process.</p><p>This Bill represents a significant move in the right direction.  If we need to go further in future, we can consider how that might be done.  In bringing forward these provisions we are doing something that was not done in 30 years.  It will open up the next appointment in a way it has never been opened up before.</p></speech>

The current practice is that the Chief Whip makes decisions on where all Members of the House are based.  The amendment proposes that we de-politicise the current arrangement, take the decision-making power away from the Chief Whip and give it to the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The current system is most unfair and undemocratic.  The Chief Whip can and does act in a partisan manner at times and decisions are made to remove people forcibly from their offices, on which Deputy Mathews will speak.  He has direct experience of the removal of his papers, which was completely out of order.</p><p>Renua Ireland believes that the Government of the day, in particular the Chief Whip, should have no entitlement to manage and assign office accommodation and should not disrupt Members who have been elected by the people to serve them.  As the Minister knows, everyone in this House works extremely hard.  We want to de-politicise the distribution of office space and ensure that all Members of the Oireachtas, who have an equal constitutional mandate, are treated with full equality regarding all of these matters.  This issue forms part of a wider narrative in terms of the Government's diminishing of political opponents.</p><p>I refer to speaking time and rights.  Those who are not members of the main Opposition parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and the Technical Group, are treated very poorly in terms of speaking slots.  We do not have an equal opportunity to put our points across.  We are all Members and are supposed to be treated equally.  We all have the same mandate and are trying to put across our various points, but the current system is unfair.</p><p>We had a full discussion on Committee Stage about parliamentary allowances and the taking of moneys by political parties when Members are no longer part of them.  Renua Ireland wants the membership of a political party to be reviewed on a yearly basis, and if one is not a member of a party at the end of a calendar year a party would not be able to draw down that money.  Taxpayers' money should no longer go to fund parties to which Members no longer belong.  We want fairness on this.  The Chief Whip should not be able to make such decisions; the power should lie with the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.830" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900056#DDD00500"><p>This amendment is a good safeguard for fairness and equality for Members of a Parliament.  We, rather than parties, have been elected as Members of Parliament.  Parties are the umbrella or playing colours of individuals elected to Parliament.  It is sometimes good to see what has happened in reality in order to diagnose a problem or explore the possibility of fairness and better conduct in the future.  I am not trying to examine scar tissue for the sake of it.  Rather, I want to determine whether there is a better way of doing things.</p>  <p>  On 2 July 2013 there was a vote in the House and the Government Chief Whip directed Members of the Government parties to vote in a certain way.  It was an exceptional piece of legislation and in any other county Members of Parliament would have been given the democratic right as representatives to vote in accordance with their consciences.  That did not apply on that occasion, therefore we were voting in accordance with what was not a personal conscience, but rather a conscience within the ambit of being a representative of the whole people, as the German basic law describes in its constitution.  The principles of the constitutions of Lithuania, Czech Republic, Latvia and the Netherlands also refer to that.  We were prevented from behaving within those democratic principles.</p>  <p>  The outcome of not voting in accordance with the direction of the Chief Whip was immediate expulsion from the parliamentary party.  We were handed a letter immediately, on 2 July.  I am giving the chronology because the House was going to rise within a fortnight, just as we will rise next Thursday on 16 July.  The direction to get out of our offices and obey the Chief Whip in what was almost a reprisal for voting in accordance with conscience was over the top.  This amendment would prevent such over the top behaviour.</p>  <p>  There was a lot of pressure leading up to the decision to vote in accordance with my conscience and my health was not great at the time.  I am not revealing this for prurient reasons, but it is important to say it because it happened.  I visited my doctor who told me my blood pressure was extremely high.  I told him there had been a direction to get out of my offices and he said that was not appropriate.  The summer holidays and recess were coming up and it would have been the reasonable and courteous thing to do to organise things by arrangement in a consensual and cordial fashion.  There was no emergency.  I had a medical certificate that recorded that my blood pressure was elevated and vacating offices was not indicated.</p>  <p>  The certificate was presented to the Office of the Taoiseach, as well as to the Chief Whip.  It had no effect whatsoever and a week later all my communication lines, such as phones, e-mails and computers, were cut.  It was like before the Normandy landings.  They were restored and we limped on in the office for a week.  The following weekend, without my knowledge, everything was removed, including the pictures on the wall and all my papers and files, from the five-storey building to the basement in Leinster House 2000.</p><p>At the time I pointed out it has an inbuilt fire hazard because vertical steel girders going down to the ground support an impenetrable wire mesh.  If the corridors of the building went on fire there would be no escape.  I pointed this out but nothing has been done about it. </p> <p> These are facts, and if they were within the ambit and responsibility of the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as proposed, it would be a much better, safer and safeguarding framework.  As Deputy Flanagan stated it would depoliticise the accommodation of duly elected Members of Parliament who are solemnly doing their best to carry out their responsibilities.  I am not playing around with geography, physics or psychology, I am being dead honest.  It should not matter who belongs to what party or no party.  It is helpful for members of parties to be grouped in buildings in easy access of one another, and I have no problem with this, but in exceptional circumstances, there should be above all courtesy, understanding and respect and there was not.  This happens when there is too much concentration of power and authority, no matter who the office-holder happens to be.  It is the framework which is dangerous.  The framework of giving the allocation of office accommodation in a practicable way with the ultimate responsibility being assigned to a civil servant not exposed to political pressures and temptations is a very good idea.  I humbly entreat that it be taken on board for the future.  This is with an eye to the future, in the same way as one has fire escapes in buildings.</p> <p> If we look at the facts and what happened, we see it could have been prevented.  There was no need for it, but the temptation was there because an act of insubordination in the minds of the Whip and the Government took place and there was going to be a punishment for it.  This is wrong.  It is as plain as the nose on my face that this is wrong in the circumstances.  Anybody from any other jurisdiction speaking any other language would clearly understand this.  In the haste of the blizzard of trying to get stuff through legislatively, behaviours get heated, judgment goes missing and courtesy goes out the door, and this is not a good idea.  We saw it today with regard to pressing a red or green button, when Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in the haste of getting to his seat mistakenly hit the wrong button.  When things are done too hastily errors occur, such as bank guarantees, overnight liquidations of busted banks and the setting up of NAMA on half an hour's reading, when the papers in the hands of the Deputies in the 30th D&aacute;il were still warm from the Xerox machine.  The big thick documents-----</p></speech>

It begins with the allocation of space, resources and money to carry out research to carry out parliamentary functions.  Suddenly it is whipped without thinking.  Taking resources from somebody who has been duly elected, man or woman, young or old, is not right.  Anybody can see it is utterly not right.</p>  <p>  I will do whatever it takes to ask the Minister to do the right thing.  If he wants me to do a cartwheel down the steps I will do it, or I will genuflect to him, because it is the right thing to do.  This is not about egos, power, numbers or voting down people.  Let us do the right thing because it is right.  The 166 of us here obviously know it is the right thing to do.  Why can we not try it just once?  We might get changed behaviour.  If we keep doing the same things again and again any psychiatrist will tell us we will get the same results.  Any psychiatrists worth their salt will tell their patients to stop doing what they are doing if they want a different result.  The results are not good but we can change them by changing our behaviour.  I humbly entreat the Minister from first-hand experience to try it.  It is well worth it.</p></speech>

This particular amendment is somewhat extraneous to the Bill, which is about the appointment of the Clerk and Secretary General of the House.  I will make one general observation and comment on the amendment.  It is not the first time I have listened to a speech like the one I have just heard, as if the Deputy had within his heart the full knowledge of right and anybody with a different view is automatically wrong.  I respect everybody's view but I do not assume that somebody who disagrees with me by virtue of that disagreement is wrong.  It is a very odd position.  I want to explain how accommodation-----</p></speech>

The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission under law has a statutory function in preparing guidelines for Members on the use of all accommodation in the Houses.  The Office of the Superintendent of the Houses supports the commission in carrying out this statutory function.  These guidelines indicate that in the event of difficulty or disagreement about the enforcing of the guidelines, the matter will be decided upon by the Ceann Comhairle in his or her capacity as chairperson of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The guidelines are for the advantage of every Member of the House, and the proposed amendment would, in my judgment, ultimately reduce the powers of the independently elected Chair of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to make decisions in the event of disagreements or disputes.  My honest view of what is right is this is a better way than giving it to any administrator who would be caught in a political controversy, as the Deputy has indicated, and this is not a fair or reasonable place to put any administrator in the House.</p></speech>

If the Minister paid attention to the events that took place, he would see the circumstances of how they took place, what the outcomes were and who had the power and authority to do what was done, and to do it suddenly like a field marshal.  I will not use another phrase for it but it is not good behaviour.  There were only two weeks to go.</p><p>The circumstances indicated there could have been a gradual, courteous, consensual change of address within the Oireachtas.  The fact is that punishment had to be seen to be meted out.  If the Minister believes the chairman of the Oireachtas commission should be somebody who likes to mete out punishment, we would be in an even stranger place than I thought.  A civil servant, given the protection and responsibility in this, can say that there must be order and cordiality here.  I do not care what political parties or groupings have particular power by dint of numbers but that civil servant servant should ensure that there is civility here.  It is like M. Scott Peck's book, <i>A World Waiting to be Born</i>, in search of civility.  We are missing that.  Perhaps it is a worthy book for summer reading in all organisations.  We are an organisation, the democratic cardiovascular system.</p></speech>

I am not saying I have a monopoly on wisdom as I do not.  This is an understanding that I wish to share.  It is humble sharing.  If I give the impression that I see myself as having the one and only correct view, I do not.  However, I am sharing an understanding.  It is like a body floating in water because it is lighter.  It is a discovery.  Please take it on board.</p></speech>

Any neutral person considering the current process might say what happens here is very unfair and undemocratic.  To have the governing parties of the day assigning office space means that Members can be disrupted.  We all have the same mandate, as the Minister has already noted, and everybody should have the same entitlement to speaking rights and office accommodation.  Deputy Mathews experienced major disruption and he was treated appallingly at the time.  We need to ensure such cases are not repeated.  Deputies Creighton, Timmins and I have sought to depoliticise the current process and ensure it is done above politics.  The decisions should be made by an independent person, the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The powers to allocate office accommodation should lie with that official and not a Government Chief Whip.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.847" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1180" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900059#GGG00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being present to discuss this issue.  One of the first Topical Issues I raised here, with my colleague, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, regarded an extension of BreastCheck, the national screening programme to detect breast cancer among women.  At the time, women aged between 50 and 64 could avail of this programme, but there was evidence that women from the ages of 64 to 69 were also at quite a high risk.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The figures show that 87 women's lives would be saved a year if this was introduced.  Thankfully, in last October's budget, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, agreed to this change and to extend it.  No doubt by the end of the year or next year, the figures will show that countless lives will be saved.</p> <p> We also have a screening programme called CervicalCheck for young women.  At the age of 25, they receive a letter - it is something I received - to tell them that they can avail of a free smear test to check for cervical cancer.  Sometimes young women can be shy or nervous about doing this, but when one gets a letter to say that the service is there, that it is free to avail of and that other young women of the same age are availing of it, one is more likely to go.  These two services, combined with raising awareness on a national scale, will continue to save lives.</p> <p> We have begun to talk about cancer a lot more in recent years than we have done in the past.  It is not the secret that people kept a long time ago and the more we talk about it, the more we raise awareness.</p> <p> Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in Ireland, apart from non-melanoma skin cancer which is a non-invasive cancer.  Some 29% of all men diagnosed with cancer have a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  It can be detected by a simple blood test.  As with most cancers, if one diagnoses it early the likelihood of beating the disease and making a full recovery is extremely high.</p> <p> However, sometimes men are reluctant to visit GPs.  I hope men do not mind me saying this, but sometimes they have to be on their death-bed before they go to a GP or before their other half or a family member makes them go.  If it were part of a screening programme and if they were to receive a letter to encourage them to go, it might encourage more men to do so.  For example, a couple of weeks ago a gentleman in my constituency - he is not somebody who I would know - had a two-page article in the local newspaper essentially telling his story.  He was 57 years old when he found out he had prostate cancer and it tore his world apart.  He managed to survive it.  One point he made with which I would agree is that there was no national programme to encourage men.  There is advice but if men were to receive a letter through the door stating the service is there for them to avail of, they would be more likely to take it on board.</p> <p> According to the statistics, over 3,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year.  Sadly, approximately 500 of those will lose their lives.  A startling figure is that 11% of all cancer deaths in Ireland are those of prostate patients.</p> <p> I would ask the Minister to look at this.  Previous studies have shown that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend the introductory programme but if one were to look at further figures, one in 10,000 men under the age of 40, one in 38 aged between 40 to 59, and one in 14 for ages 60 to 69 will be diagnosed.  If one thinks of one's grandfather, father, brothers, uncles, cousins and neighbours and work colleagues, the likelihood is high of one, two or many more of those having prostate cancer in a couple of years' time and I do not see how introducing a screening programme that could detect this early would do any harm.  Somebody stated it would do more harm than good but I do not see how that would be the case.  This is an extremely important issue.  CervicalCheck and BreastCheck have saved lives and I think we need something similar for men.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-07-09a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070900060#HHH00200"><p>I thank Deputy McEntee for raising this important issue.  The importance of early detection of cancer is fully accepted by Government.  Population-based screening programmes are an important element of early detection and have been introduced for cancers in Ireland where international evidence supports this approach.  At present, available evidence has given rise to population-based screening programmes being recommended for bowel, breast and cervical cancer and such programmes have been introduced here.</p>  <p>  However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a prostate cancer screening programme.  Instead, the focus is on the early detection of such cancers through rapid access clinics that have been established in the eight designated cancer centres.  These clinics provide access to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer, with patients who are deemed to be at higher risk being fast-tracked to the clinics.  Men referred to these prostate clinics undergo comprehensive assessment, with appropriate imaging and biopsies.</p>  <p>  Apart from non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Ireland.  In recent years, the rapid access prostate clinics have seen between 2,400 and 2,800 men annually.  Approximately 1,300 of these patients each year have had a diagnosis of a prostate cancer, a diagnosis rate of 40%.  It is vital, therefore, that men are aware of the symptoms of prostate diseases and present early to their GP.  The Deputy's comments about the reluctance of men to do this sometimes are well made.</p>  <p>  Last month my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, launched clinical guidelines on the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with prostate cancer.  These guidelines, which were approved by the national clinical effectiveness committee, represent a significant step forward in dealing with prostate cancer in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Survival from cancer has improved markedly in recent years and is expected to increase further when the long-term effects of the reforms in cancer care under the current cancer strategy, including screening programmes, impact more fully.  However, it is predicted that the total number of cancer cases will rise in the coming years, with better diagnosis combined with an increasing, and aging, population.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently working on the development of a national cancer strategy to provide the focus for cancer control for the next decade.  A steering group has been established to inform this work.  The Department of Health is currently running a public consultation process on the new strategy and I would encourage individuals, organisations and Members of this House to contribute to the process before the closing date of 24 July.</p></speech>

I acknowledge we have the rapid access prostate clinics but, as he stated, it is for men who have been referred on.  One of the biggest problems is that men are less likely to go to their GPs and they are less likely to be referred on if they do not get to that stage.</p>  <p>  I suggest something as simple as a letter encouraging men.  It is difficult to have an open-ended scheme, as with CervicalCheck or BreastCheck, as one must pick a certain age demographic.  Men aged between 60 and 69 have a one in 14 chance of developing prostate cancer and six in ten cases are found in men over the age of 65, and it would be possible to start something like this targeted at those ages where it is most prevalent.</p>  <p>  As I said, 3,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed this year in Ireland.  Ireland has the fourth highest incidence of prostate cancer in 27 EU countries and this is 50% higher than the EU average.  I would urge the Minister of State to take this on board because no Member of this House can say he or she does not know somebody who has had prostate cancer.  The same is so with breast cancer or cervical cancer.  It is extremely important and I thank him for taking this issue.</p></speech>

The final point I would make is that any man who has a concern about possible prostate cancer should seek the advice of his GP, who will, where necessary, refer him to a rapid access clinic.  I take on board the points made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that this portfolio includes the 1916 national monument, 14 to 17 Moore Street, situated in heart of the last extant 1916 battlefield.  Can the Minister confirm if this is the case?</p>  <p>  This site, which spans from 14 to 17 Moore Street has been described as the most important historic site in Irish history by the National Museum.  Any continuing uncertainty regarding the future of this historic area is totally unacceptable to the relatives of the founding fathers of the nation as we approach the centenary of the Rising.</p><p>To sell it to private investors who will doubtless have little regard as to its significance beyond its commercial potential is unacceptable and an affront to Ireland's people and history.  We must protect this battlefield site.  The 1916 freedom quarter must be removed from the NAMA property portfolio.  It cannot be allowed to become a shopping centre, as has been planned by Chartered Land.  It must be respected for its historic and cultural significance, which far outweigh commercial gain.  It is a key part of our history and heritage, yet NAMA has refused to meet the cross-party Oireachtas Moore Street committee members to discuss it.  Has consideration been given to the implications the sale and any future work will have on the national monument?  Is the &euro;5 million set aside by NAMA for the restoration of the monument still available?  Will the Minister of State confirm whether there has been any consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or the National Museum on the sale of this portfolio, known as Project Jewel, by NAMA?</p> <p> Yesterday, the Oireachtas cross-party group, relatives and other stakeholders made a formal request to An Taoiseach for the protection of the 1916 national monument.  As we move into the centenary of one of the most defining moments in Irish history, we are asking the Taoiseach and the Government to act swiftly and decisively to ensure our heritage is honoured appropriately.</p></speech>

For decades, the Moore Street site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction.  This is embarrassing, particularly with the centenary approaching next year.  Nos. 14 to 17 have been designated a national monument.  A figure of &euro;5 million is floating around, but who costed the buildings?  They form part of what the National Museum has called a battlefield site.  It is our Gettysburg, our Alamo.  Apart from the fact that the people from the GPO evacuated to those houses and Nos. 14 to 17 were the scene where they discussed a surrender, the surrounding streets saw the deaths of up to 2,000 people.  There are stories on Henry Street, Henry Place, Moore Lane, Moore Street and the renamed O'Rahilly Parade.  It is all a battlefield site.</p>  <p>  In recent months, more than 10,000 signatures have been collected by volunteers every Saturday on Moore Street to save it.  They belong to ordinary Dubs and others who come to shop on Moore Street.  With its rich culture and history, they do not want to see it extinguished.  It is in danger.  The late Eamonn Mac Thomais used a great phrase: "Me jewel and darlin'".  He did not have it in mind that Project Jewel would become part of selling off the area lock, stock and barrel.</p>  <p>  Even though the area is designated one of special planning control and much of it is included in an architectural conservation area, there is a danger of the site being sold to sovereign funds from the Middle East, the Far East and elsewhere.  There is a great deal of confidence that the sale will be of interest to the Blackstones of this world that have been buying up a range of distressed properties.  Our group handed in a letter to the Taoiseach and copies were sent to every Minister.  What responsibility will the Government take for this national monument and battlefield site?  It is the guardian of our national monuments.</p></speech>

Contrary to the impression being created by some of those reports, the fact is that it is loans and not properties for which NAMA is seeking expressions of interest.  I am concerned that an entirely false picture is being painted about the sale of the national monument itself.  It is being sold.  However, the buyer is the State and not some banker or venture capitalist, the State that will safeguard and restore it to how it was in 1916, and the State that will develop a 1916 commemorative centre on the site as a solemn and fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders who held their final war council meeting there.  This decision by the Government was made to bring the national monument into public ownership, secure its long-term future and complete the development of the proposed 1916 commemorative centre as quickly as possible.  The Government's decision will not in any way be affected, delayed or otherwise impinged upon by any disposal of NAMA's loan books.  The national monument site is being removed from the NAMA portfolio sale.</p></speech>

At the risk of repeating myself, the position is that the acquisition of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on behalf of the State is in progress and will, I expect, be completed shortly.  What is more, the Minister made this clear in the House in the past two weeks in answer to several parliamentary questions from Deputy McLellan.</p>  <p>  This is the clearest possible demonstration of the Government's commitment to acknowledge and mark the historical importance of the site in a positive and substantive way and to guarantee, secure and safeguard the long-term future of this historical landmark.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is actively engaged with the monument owners and other relevant parties to conclude the transfer of the property into State ownership as quickly as possible.  This process is nearing completion.  In common parlance, the sale is agreed.</p>  <p>  The Minister is also considering the best way to restore the buildings in order for the commemorative centre, the plans for which are being developed in consultation with the 1916 Relatives Association, to open at the earliest possible date.  The Minister has informed the House on innumerable occasions that her functions in this case arise from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts with the objective of protecting No. 16 as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  The acquisition and restoration of the monument buildings by the State for the people is the clearest possible statement of how seriously the Government has taken this objective.</p>  <p>  The commemorative centre to be housed in the restored monument buildings will be developed and run as a public facility that will enhance and complement the 1916 visitor facility being developed in the GPO from where the insurgents retreated to the Moore Street buildings.  I look forward to it being completed and to seeing the public going through the doors in the centenary year of the most momentous events in our country's history.</p></speech>

While he made it clear that the national monument was not part of Project Jewel, I still have concerns about the sale and the implication of future works in the surrounding area.  I welcome the Minister of State's confirmation that the purchase of the national monument by the State is nearing completion.  I hope that the completion date will be soon, as 2016 is fast approaching.  Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and the surrounding area have been an issue in this Chamber since I was elected, and probably long before then.  The national monument is a derelict site and a national disgrace.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is its guardian, so it is for her to protect it.</p>  <p>  When and how will the &euro;5 million be spent?  Have the building structures and newly discovered cellars at the national monument been surveyed by suitably qualified experts?  If not, when will that happen?  Has consideration been given to extending the protection of national monument status to other 1916 buildings and structures identified by the Frank Myles-Shaffrey battlefield report as having direct links to the Rising?  Will any restoration work take place prior to 2016 or will we still be looking at a derelict site?</p></speech>

More clarification on the figure of &euro;5 million and how the restoration of Nos. 14 to 17 will be funded is required.  The 10,000 plus signatures that I mentioned were more concerned with saving Moore Street than just Nos. 14 to 17.  The street has been described as a battlefield site.  I mentioned other stories.  The Taoiseach described the area as the lanes of history, so the rest of the Moore Street site is of great importance.  There is significant potential for an historical and cultural quarter linking the GPO, Moore Street, the Rotunda where the surrender occurred and the Parnell monument where the men lined up while waiting to be moved to Richmond Barracks, Kilmainham Gaol and the North Wall Quay to be taken off to the camp in Frongoch.</p>  <p>  We still do not have an independent survey of the site.  Our group in the D&aacute;il asked for a meeting with NAMA.  Deputy Wallace was told to go to NAMA with his issues, yet we could not get a meeting to address these issues.</p></speech>

The Minister's involvement in the Moore Street issue, as she has made clear countless times, arises from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 under the National Monuments Acts.</p><p>Any plans or proposals for the wider area outside the confines of the national monument are the responsibility of Dublin City Council as the planning authority.  Redevelopment plans for the area have received full planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The properties around the national monument are in private ownership.  They are not subject to the Minister's remit under the National Monuments Acts.</p> <p> The historical significance of the fundamentally intact building at No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor when the decision was taken to make the preservation order.  These buildings are the only substantially authentic, original and intact pre-1916 buildings on the street.  They are the only buildings that retain significant original elements that would have been there in 1916, including staircases, partitions, plaster work, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  Above all, Nos. 14 to 17 also contain the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they tunnelled their way up the street.  All of these elements are being retained, secured and permanently safeguarded as a result of the Government's decision to assume ownership of the national monument.</p> <p> The Minister is pressing ahead as speedily as possible to acquire the site, carry out the restoration work and have the 1916 commemorative centre open to the public.  I wish I had a better timeline for the Deputies, but I do not.  I look forward to the day work gets started on the Moore Street project.  All of our citizens can look forward with pride to the day it opens its doors to welcome the public as a fitting testament to the men and women of 1916 and what they fought for.  There are more discussions to be had, not least with the traders who occupy the street and do their daily business there.  Subject to agreement, we hope to have a wrap going around those four buildings in the very near future.  This will be a solid indication of the Government's intention to establish a lasting monument to the sacrifices of those who fought that week and had their final meetings in this historic building.</p></speech>

The decline in Common Agricultural Policy funding means that the issue of price has to take centre stage.  I have been telling the Minister for three years that it is absolutely vital for him to realise that the price issue cannot be left simply to market forces.  The reality is that there has been a significant decline in the price of milk, which is currently 22% lower than it was in July 2014.  The decrease we have had here is slightly bigger than the average decrease of 18% across the EU.  I will put that in monetary terms.  According to the ICMSA, every cent that is cut from the farmgate milk price is costing the average farmer between &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 per annum.  For the average dairy farmer, that means a loss of approximately &euro;30,000, which is a huge amount of money.  Given that the processing cost is 28 cent per litre, it is clear that we are approaching the point at which no profit will emerge from the production of a litre of milk.  People with low gearing ratios who have been in farming for a long time can probably ride it out, but this is a significant challenge for people who have got into very heavy investments.  I will elaborate on the major worry in this regard.  We see the uncertainty in the world.  Russia imposed a sudden ban because of things that could not have been foreseen three or four years ago.  I will explain what the Minister has allowed to happen.  The intervention price in the EU is 20 cent a litre.  We need a safety net at 28 cent a litre.  In other words, the intervention price should be 28 cent a litre.  An intervention price of 20 cent is nonsensical because that is the world market price anyway.  One can always sell one's product at that low level.</p>  <p>  We have seen a massive decline in sheep prices.  I know the Minister of State will probably read the same answer that she was given to read in the Seanad yesterday, when she spoke about technology adoption programmes and everything else.  We could have a big debate about EU schemes, but tonight is not the night for it.  Therefore, the Minister of State can skip that part of her reply.  The issue here is price.  In other words, farmers want to get their price in the market.  I am particularly interested to know what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, intends to do on two issues.  If he does not make sure there are constant live exports to provide for competition in the market, we will be in a bottleneck situation where the market is controlled by a very small number of processors.  This is particularly concerning because we do not have a food ombudsman here like they have in Britain.  I have two questions.  First, can the Government ensure we get the full capacity for live exports?  We need to have markets for live exports, and live exports need to be facilitated in every way.  Second, can the Government confirm my understanding that if one sends a 25 kg lamb into the factories to be killed, one will be paid for just 21.5 kg?</p></speech>

My view is that if one's lamb is killed at 25 kg, one should be paid for 25 kg.  Can the Minister not insist at all the beef and sheep forums he is so keen on that farmers are paid on the basis of the full weight of the animals they send in?  This seems to be another way for the factories in a monopoly situation to depress the price artificially.  I would be really grateful if the Minister of State could address the specific issues I have raised.  I refer to the issue of the intervention price, the question of what is being done about live exports and the need for farmers to be paid on the basis of the full weight.</p></speech>

It is important for me to reiterate what I said on that occasion.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is in Galway today for bilateral meetings with the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Karmenu Vella.  The Deputy has spoken about market developments in the sheep and dairy sectors, which are two of the most important elements of our agri-food industry.  I will deal with the sheep sector first.</p>  <p>  Primary output from the sheep industry is worth approximately &euro;230 million.  This value has grown significantly in recent years.  More than two thirds of our output is exported.  In 2014, exports totalled almost 48,000 tonnes, with a value of &euro;218 million.  The sheep sector in Ireland is heavily dependent on the export market because domestic consumption is approximately 30% of overall production.  France and the UK continue to be our core markets.  The French market is usually represents twice the size of the UK market.  This reflects the strong demand and reputation in France for Irish lamb and the consumer preference in the UK for the British product.  I am aware that the sheep farmers are vulnerable to price fluctuations.  While prices are subject to the normal dynamics of the marketplace, the Government has provided a range of financial and structural supports to the sector that can help to make it more resilient and position it to avail of development opportunities.</p>  <p>  On the issue of sheep prices, my Department monitors average sheep prices and sheep slaughtering figures on a weekly basis because the two are clearly inter-linked.  While the recent movement on prices has been disappointing, it is not out of line with the trend experienced in other countries and there have been some signs of recovery this week.  I am satisfied that recent movements do not point to a structural difficulty within the overall sheepmeat sector, but instead reflect the fluctuations that can happen at this time of year.  The latest available figures show that after a strong first quarter in 2015, when the average Irish price was approximately 11% more than in the same period in 2014, prices have fallen back.  This change in price in recent weeks is probably due to a combination of various factors.  Supplies are in full flow at present due to seasonal factors.  At the same time, there are poor market conditions.  This is believed to be driving down average prices as measured on a weekly basis.</p><p>While this recent dip in prices is disappointing, it remains the case that at the end of June the average year-to-date price was running at approximately 4% ahead of the price for the same period last year.  This week prices have started to rise sharply again, and demand for sheep and lamb from factories is very strong.</p> <p> In recognising the vulnerability of sheep farmers, the Minister has introduced a number of measures to help drive on-farm viability.  These include the sheep technology adoption programme, STAP, which was introduced in 2013 and has played a major role encouraging technology adoption on farms, while also requiring participants to undertake a number of farm tasks.  These farm tasks make use of the best technologies available to sheep farmers in Ireland while also encouraging improved breeding.  STAP is currently in its third and final year.  An average of approximately 4,000 farmers have participated in the scheme each year, and total funding of more than &euro;6.5 million was spent in 2013 and 2014.</p> <p> Various other schemes in the rural development programme, RDP, are also of direct relevance to the sheep sector.  For example, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, will benefit sheep farmers, and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the areas of natural constraint scheme.  A series of capital investment schemes is being introduced under the TAMS II scheme.  It must also be remembered that the sheep grassland scheme, under which more than &euro;65 million was invested in Irish sheep farms during its lifetime, has now been included in the direct payment of each sheep farmer under revised CAP arrangements.  The Food Wise 2025 report launched last week also includes included a number of recommendations relating to the sheep sector, and the Minister will put in place a robust implementation process to monitor progress on implementation.</p></speech>

The Minister says the change in price in recent weeks is likely due to a combination of various factors and the fact that supplies are in full flow at present due to seasonal factors.  However, if there are a large number of sheep coming to the market at a low price and the price is very high in the spring, when there are very few sheep available, the high price is not much good to the farmer because of the number of sheep coming out.  If one looked at the average price paid for sheep, one would find that it has been a very bad year for lowland sheep to date.  What is being done to stimulate live exports to maintain competition for the factories?</p>  <p>  The Minister said the market was subject to the normal dynamics of the marketplace.  Of course farmers will say that because of what they call the hourglass effect of farming - that is, many producers and many consumers but very few processors and multiples in the middle.  There is no normal dynamic in the middle.  The processor and the multiples have overweening power.  It is interesting that the Minister's erstwhile colleague, Commissioner Phil Hogan, shares my concern about the price issue and about what can be done to curb the power of the small number of major multiples.  All of the lamb goes to the Continental market; virtually nothing is exported outside the EU at present.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on this.</p>  <p>  I have a second question.  Will the Minister of State accept that when the Minister amalgamated the sheep grassland scheme, particularly for hill sheep farmers, most of them were under &euro;150 per hectare?  By 2019, all of that money will be eroded because they will be at the &euro;150 figure, but they would have been at that figure anyway.  The way the Minister handled the grassland scheme is of no benefit to most hill farmers in the longer term.  It was a disastrous decision.  What is the Minister of State's view on that?</p>  <p>  With regard to milk, there appears to be great confidence that the market will rise.  However, it might not.  I listened to a report about China yesterday.  It said that China might have a classic stock market bubble of the same type that the US experienced in the 1920s.  It is ordinary citizens who invested in the stocks and shares.  If that is the case, purchasing power will go down.  What contingency is in place if there is a collapse in milk prices?  The best on offer at present is the intervention price of 20 cent, which is 8 cent below the production cost.  What will the Minister do to get the intervention price up to 28 cent per litre?</p></speech>

Using cross-country comparable data from the European Milk Market Observatory, the most recently available complete data shows that the milk price in Ireland is, as the Deputy said, approximately 22% below the price in the same month in 2014 and slightly above the 19% decrease on average across the EU.</p><p>The MInister's focus now is on ensuring that the correct balance of policies and supports are in place so the Irish dairy sector can overcome the effects of volatility over the next period.  The Minister will continue to push for the deployment and extension of EU market supports, such as aids to private storage and intervention, where appropriate.  A number of other measures have been introduced by the Minister and the Government to assist Irish dairy farmers, including the introduction of a number of agri-taxation measures in last year's budget, such as extending the income averaging to five years, which will be of great assistance to dairy farmers wishing to manage volatility; the introduction of a scheme to facilitate the repayment of the</p><p>superlevy bill by farmers over three years, which the Minister expects will be heavily subscribed; engagement with Irish banks to ensure that access to credit for the dairy sector is available, competitive and responsive to market volatility.</p><p>A combination of these measures, allied to the investment and expertise of our dairy farmers and processors, means that the Irish dairy sector remains well placed to realise its potential in years to come and to meet the challenges of market volatility along the way.  Both the dairy and sheep sectors are, and will continue to be, integral elements of our agrifood sector, and I and the Department are fully committed to their development.</p></speech>

Put simply, our local businesses are the heart of our economy.  These businesses create and sustain employment in every community across this country.  While large multinationals boost employment in larger urban areas such as Dublin, it is local businesses that ensure the economic recovery is felt across all communities, including in Carlow and Kilkenny.  We regularly hear that the Government wishes to promote local businesses in expanding their orders, winning contracts and increasing employment.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated that he wants Ireland to be the best country in the world in which to do business.  We support that ambition.  However, despite all the talk, press releases and policy announcements, situations still arise in which State agencies impose unnecessary delays and inefficiencies which are undermining local companies that are ambitious and wish to build up their businesses.</p>  <p>  I will illustrate my point with the example of a small business in Carlow which is losing important business due to significant delays by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, in issuing the company's compliance certificates.  Keltruck Bodies Ltd. is a company that manufactures truck bodies.  It employs 13 full-time staff in its workshop on O'Brien Road in Carlow town.  Every truck body the company manufactures must be certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  It currently takes between four and six weeks for the NSAI to certify a truck body from Keltruck Bodies.  This means that four to six weeks are added to the wait time for customers.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stated in a response to my party leader on this matter on 13 May that the time for review should only be two weeks.  The equivalent process in the UK can be carried out within 24 hours by its standards authority.  Many of the customers of Keltruck Bodies are UK based and the company is losing exports to the UK due to the four- to six-week wait for a compliance certificate from the NSAI.</p><p>This is a perfect example of how the State is undermining local businesses in their quest to compete nationally and internationally.  One cause for the delay is clearly reduced staff levels in the National Standards Authority of Ireland with staff numbers reducing from 168 when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was last in government to the current figure of 140.  These delays are having a dramatic impact on local companies in their desire to expand their business.  I call on the Minister to address the issue immediately.</p> <p> This is another example of red tape gone mad.  The company in question is willing to export but must wait between six and eight weeks for certificate of compliance from the NSAI.  The business employs 19 people and I ask the Minister to address the problem.  The same certification can be obtained in the United Kingdom within 24 hours.  Why do companies trying to survive and maintain employment have to wait between four and six weeks for a certificate of compliance?  I ask the Minister to do something about the problem.</p></speech>

The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, operates as the approval authority for related directives, 2007/46/EC, under the European Communities (Road Vehicles: Entry into Service) Regulations (S.I 157 of 2009) made by the then Minister for Transport, which requires that all member states have national approval schemes implemented through to October 2014.</p>  <p>  The automotive approvals process relies heavily on technically competent assessors to process the applications.  Applications for certification are processed by the NSAI on a first come, first served basis.  Since the beginning of the year, the NSAI has received 3,108 individual vehicle approval, IVA, applications, of which it has completed 2,843.  As of 9 July 2015, 196 files are being processed and these have been in process for an average of 3.5 weeks.</p>  <p>  In response to the increasing workload, the NSAI tendered in 2014 for an alternative service delivery, which commenced from January 2015 with Applus for the provision of technical assessors.  Owing to the regulatory and technical nature of the assessment process, it was not possible to increase processing capacity rapidly as the sourcing, training and induction of engineers takes a period of approximately six months before they become competent in the approvals process.  In addition, staff training reduces the time spent on processing.  While the addition of new resources was necessary to address the backlog, in the initial stages this is disruptive and impacts on the existing resource as training is necessary.</p>  <p>  In addition to resources issues, the processing times also reflect the technical nature of the approvals process itself, the unavoidable requirement on industry to build in an adequate provision for the automotive approvals timescale and the registrations cycle for new vehicles, which are in January and mid-year.  However, with regard to the three companies in the Carlow-Kilkenny area which have applications in process, I am informed by the NSAI that company A currently has no outstanding applications; company B has submitted 35 applications since January this year, of which 24 have been approved and 11 are in the process of approval.  A number of applications are awaiting responses to queries which need to be addressed before the approval can be completed; and company C has submitted 79 applications since January this year, of which 64 applications have been processed and 15 are awaiting processing.  Again, there are queries which need to be addressed before approval is completed.</p>  <p>  Approvals of a number of outstanding applications have not been completed as a result of queries from the NSAI to the applicants about the applications.  This can cause long delays as application forms must be fully completed before being processed.  Another contributing factor is the delay in separate approvals processes for different types of commercial vehicles which is outside the control of the NSAI.  Against this background, I encourage companies to inquire directly with the NSAI about the progress of their applications.  In this context, the NSAI has been working with individual companies experiencing pressure points to prioritise applications, according to the company's needs.</p>  <p>  I will supply the remainder of the reply to the Deputy if he wishes as it deals with some technical issues.</p></speech>

As late as last week, the company in question informed me that it is still waiting between four and six weeks to be granted a certificate of approval.  The Minister of State tells me a different story but I am sure the company knows best.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State and I share the same constituency and she knows the area well.  Everyone knows that small and medium enterprises are the lifeblood of the economy.  Outside Dublin, between 70% and 80% of employees are employed in the SME sector.  Any Government worth its salt would do everything in its power to help these enterprises, as all of us must do. </p>  <p>  As I stated, this company has 19 employees and is willing to do a job but is being held up by bureaucracy.  Is the National Standards Authority of Ireland fit for purpose?  Does it have a sufficient number of employees to do its job?  In the United Kingdom, the authorities can provide certification to similar companies within 24 hours.  Only a few kilometres across the sea on this island, businesses seeking similar certification face a wait of between four and six weeks.  There is something wrong with this and either the Minister or the NSAI should take responsibility for the problem.  The NSAI must become more efficient.  A waiting period of one or two weeks would make some sense but a waiting period of between four and six weeks does not make any sense.  I ask the Minister of State to relay that message to the Minister and tell him that something needs to be done about this issue.</p>  <p>  I asked my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to raise this issue in the D&aacute;il on my behalf in May after receiving a complaint while canvassing in the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election.  I raise the issue again as a newly elected Deputy because no progress has been made for the company in question since Deputy Martin raised it.  I do not want to raise it again in the House in three or four months' time.  This company is willing to export and generate income for the country.  Someone must do something about this issue and I ask the Minister to act immediately.</p></speech>
