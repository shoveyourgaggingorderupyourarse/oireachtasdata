How are people expected to meet this requirement?  Are there plans for recipients to engage with job activation now or in the new year?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  In common with other jobseeker payments, such as jobseeker's benefit and allowance, the fundamental condition for receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is that the person is available to work but cannot do so because suitable work is not available to them.  Persons claiming the PUP will have been in employment immediately before claiming the benefit.  This is seen as initial evidence satisfying the genuinely seeking work requirement.  Once people are in payment, we operate on the basis that the PUP is a payment to support them until they return to work in their pervious occupation or sector.  We do not, at this time, require people to look for alternative employment.</p><p>For example, it is reasonable that workers who remain temporarily laid off in sectors that have not reopened or have only partially reopened, such as hospitality, arts and entertainment, due to Covid-19 restrictions are afforded the time and opportunity for their workplace to reopen.  Having said that, it is also reasonable to expect workers in receipt of the PUP to take up the offer of returning to their work when their workplace reopens.  Where workers do not, without reasonable cause, take up the opportunity to return to their work it is appropriate to ask whether they are genuinely unemployed and seeking work and, if not, to review their payment.  It is for this reason the genuinely seeking work condition is incorporated into the statutory basis for the scheme.  I can advise that no claims have been disallowed to date on the genuinely seeking work condition.</p><p>It is likely that even as the economy reopens, some sectors will not return to the levels of employment seen before the pandemic.  We know that the longer a person is unemployed the harder it becomes for them to find new employment.  Accordingly, it is important that the State provides all the supports and assistance it can to help people who may find that the job they held before the pandemic is not returning.  To this end, in the new year the Department plans to commence engaging with PUP recipients to offer them access to a case worker and to provide them with information on the range of education, training, and employment supports that can help them to find new employment.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As the Deputy is aware, we have already modified the conditions for accessing employment and education schemes to grant access to PUP recipients.  Depending on the numbers who may remain on the PUP in the new year, the process of engagement will be implemented on a phased basis.  All engagement with PUP recipients will be on a voluntary basis.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></speech>

While the Minister has said the rule is there, and a number of us sought to remove it through an amendment in August and July when the legislation was going through, at present the Department does not require PUP recipients to be genuinely seeking work.  What is the purpose of putting in the rule in the first place?  It is a rule but it is not being enforced so I do not really see why the rule is there in the first place.</p>  <p>  We have to remember these are workers who have lost their jobs.  They are not unemployed for no reason.  In fact, some of them are not unemployed at all as they are just waiting for their workplaces to reopen.  As the Minister said, some will do so and, unfortunately, some will not.  With regard to offering access, will the Minister give a bit more detail on what she means with regard to offering access to job activation schemes?  Will people begin to be referred in the new year?  When exactly does the Minister plan to begin this and how does she see it working?</p></speech>

It is important to say we are offering to people who want to take up the offer training and measures to help them get back to work or retrain to go to a new job and they can take it up on a voluntary basis.  Some people may want to look at new careers and it is important that we give them all the support we can to help them to get back to work in due course.  It is fair to say that not a single claim has been stopped for the reason that a person is not genuinely seeking work.  The reason the clause is there is that if people are offered their jobs back, but choose to remain on the pandemic unemployment payment, it would be reasonable for the Department to ask whether they are genuinely seeking work.  If the jobs are available and they choose not to take them up it is a fair question.  For those sectors that are not open, it is fully understandable and they are not expected to go back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300003#A00900"><p>Among the rules to qualify for the PUP is that people are genuinely seeking work but that is only being enforced if people are offered their jobs back and they do not take them up, which I could not imagine anybody doing anyway.  These are workers and some of them have never been on social welfare in their lives.  The rule on genuinely seeking work as part of the initial criteria will only be enforced if people are offered their jobs back and do not take them.  I do not think this has been made clear and I do not see the purpose in the first instance of having it as a requirement to get the payment in the first place.  It is there as a rule.</p>  <p>  Offering people training and courses in the new year is welcome but there are people who cannot get on courses or training now.  I have given the Minister the example of somebody trying to get on the vocational training opportunities scheme.  The person has 147 out of the 156 qualifying period days so is missing only a very small number but cannot get it.  Somebody else on the pandemic unemployment payment cannot get a course with the ETB because the person does not have the required qualifying period.  We are making it difficult for people to take up courses when it should be very flexible.</p></speech>

What we are doing is helping people to get back to work and we are giving them all the supports.  In the July stimulus package, there was considerable investment in back to education and back to training, apprenticeships and measures to help people to get back to work.</p> <p>If there are specific issues, I am happy to look at them.  The purpose is to allow people to reskill and upskill.  We are working with people all of the time and we are going to write out to people in January.  This is all being done on a voluntary basis.  We are going to explain to them that a range of supports are available and it is up to people to engage.  If they do not want to engage, they can stay on the pandemic unemployment payment until such time as it ceases.</p></speech>

Expenditure on the scheme has amounted to over &euro;4.3 billion since its introduction in March.  The scheme will remain in place until the end of March 2021 and, just last week, I announced that I had secured Government approval to keep the scheme open for new applicants until this date, rather than it closing at the end of the year.  This extension provides certainty to people, including those in the retail and hospitality sectors, that they will be able to re-apply for PUP early in the new year if that is required.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to highlight two other recent positive changes to the payment.  First, since the move to level 5 restrictions, the &euro;350 rate of PUP has been reintroduced for individuals who had prior average weekly earnings of &euro;400 or more.  Approximately 158,150, or 45% of the total in receipt of the support, are now receiving this rate of payment.  Second, in budget 2021, we provided with immediate effect that self-employed PUP recipients can earn up to &euro;480 over a rolling four-week period and retain entitlement to PUP.  The &euro;480 limit is based on gross income, before tax and PRSI, minus expenses.</p>  <p>  The Government will keep the position regarding PUP under review and any future decisions will be informed by the trajectory of the pandemic and the evolving public health situation.</p></speech>

The recipients of the payment are victims of the Covid crisis; they are workers who lost their jobs in the Covid crisis.  Many of these workers did not just lose their job, but their incomes fell off a cliff.  There are people who would have had incomes of &euro;600, &euro;700 and &euro;800 a week that were reduced to &euro;350.  That was the money which paid the rent and put the food on the table.  Now, the Minister and the Government are planning to tax it.  This is another real blow to those workers and their families.  We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.  I ask the Minister to give the House a justification for taxing these workers, the victims of the crisis, and dealing them another blow.  Can that be justified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300004#B00600"><p>The issue of tax is a matter for the Department of Finance.  We all know that if we earn over a certain amount of money, we are all liable to pay tax.  As I understand it, that is the rule across the board.</p>  <p>  It is important to say we have paid out a considerable amount of money to support people through the pandemic unemployment payment.  This week, we issued &euro;130 million in arrears to 286,000 people.  The Deputy will be aware that when the payment was brought in last March, some payments were not made because there was missing information and so on.  We worked with those people and we got them into payments and it just took some time to get the arrears sorted.  Those arrears have been paid this week.  Next week, we are going to pay out a record &euro;389 million on the Christmas bonus and over 311,000 people on the PUP will receive that bonus.  Normally, people would have to be 15 months on a social welfare payment, such as a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, to get the Christmas payments.  However, in acknowledgement of the very difficult year people have had, we have agreed that if they are on the pandemic unemployment payment or a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for more than four months in total from last March until October, or perhaps November, but if they are on it for four months since then-----</p></speech>

She is the Minister for Social Protection.  How are these workers being protected with the plans to tax them in the new year?</p>  <p>  In fact, it is a retrospective tax because when it was introduced, on 13 March, it came in as an urgent needs payment.  Urgent needs payments are explicitly exempt from tax under section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.  It is was only on 5 August that the PUP was put on a statutory basis.  Yet, for the period between 13 March and 5 August, the PUP is to be taxed.  This is retrospective taxation.</p>  <p>  It is an extraordinary decision.  As the Minister charged with protecting people in this vulnerable position, how did she allow that to go through at Cabinet level when the proposal came from the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

That has always been the case and it is the case for the pandemic unemployment payment in the same way as for any other payment people receive.</p>  <p>  We have supported people.  We have processed 1.5 million claims since last March and we have issued 13 million payments to 800,000 people.  That is the equivalent of processing seven years&rsquo; worth of jobseeker applications in eight months.  The total spend on PUP to date is &euro;4.3 billion.  I think the Deputy will accept the Government has not been found wanting in supporting people through what has been an extremely difficult time for them.  To go back to the Deputy&rsquo;s initial question, I will be reviewing the pandemic unemployment payment in January.</p></speech>

In October, I announced that my Department agreed an extension with both JobPath contractors, as well as extending the contracts of other contracted employment service providers - the local employment services and job clubs - into 2021.  These extensions are required to ensure that our public employment service has the capacity to respond to the labour market fallout arising from the pandemic and can support those jobseekers who need help, support and advice.  It is also to be borne in mind that referrals to contracted providers were suspended during the pandemic and this lost time and the delayed referrals now need to be made up.</p>  <p>  The extension of the JobPath contracts provides value for money for the taxpayer.</p> <p>The payment by results element of these contracts ensures that aside from a registration fee, the contractors only receive additional fees when an individual secures sustainable full-time employment lasting at least 13 weeks.<br/><br/>I am confident that delivering 12 months of employment service engagement for an average cost per client of &euro;873 provides value for money and compares favourably with costs of other contracted public employment services.  To put this cost into perspective, the JobPath providers must provide an engagement with every client once every 20 working days.  Last year's review provided strong evidence of the benefits arising from JobPath, with individuals benefiting by 37% through increased employment outcomes and higher earnings compared with individuals who had not availed of the JobPath service.<br/><br/>People who are referred to one of my Department's contracted public employment services must complete this engagement with that provider for a period of 12 months or until they transition into employment.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i><br/><br/>I should mention at this point that I have recently instructed my officials that no person should be referred to JobPath on more than two occasions. Practical steps are under way in my Department at present to implement this instruction.<br/><br/>JobPath is not an obstacle to filling community employment.  Since June 2018, persons availing of the JobPath service may also participle on community employment, CE, or T&uacute;s schemes.  This enables people engaging with JobPath to continue to receive the personalised employment counselling and job search support while availing of a T&uacute;s or CE placement, providing valuable occupational activity and work experience.<br/><br/>Jobseekers engaging with JobPath who opt to take up CE or T&uacute;s schemes are fully facilitated in respect of the scheduling of all meetings and activities.  Community employment participants are not referred to JobPath for the duration of their placement on the scheme once the CE placement date precedes the JobPath referral.</p></speech>

The Minister made a few points.  She spoke about value for money.  I will give her a brief example in that regard.  More than 1,000 people have been referred to JobPath for a third time.  Every time someone is referred, the companies get a payment of &euro;311.  The Minister mentioned a cost of &euro;873 and she also said they are paid when they source employment for somebody.  The initial referral fee is &euro;311.  That has been paid three times in respect of just one person.  It is paid over and over again.  That is a total of &euro;1.2 million alone in referral fees for the more than 1,000 people who have been referred three times.  Someone in contact with my constituency office yesterday had been referred for a third time.  I do not see that being value for money.</p></speech>

I confirm that we have changed the rules.  I have instructed my officials that no person should be referred to JobPath on more than two occasions, and practical steps are under way in my Department to implement that instruction.  JobPath provides advice to people.  It helps them to look at how they can apply for jobs.  It prepares them and tries to identify jobs that suit them.  The contractors are obliged to engage and provide this employment assistance with each client at least once every 20 working days.  Therefore, in situations where only a registration fee is paid to a contractor, they receive, on average, a payment of &euro;311 for the provision of approximately 12 engagements with a client over the course of a year.  That equates to a little under &euro;6 per week for the provision of employment services.</p></speech>

If they are getting the referral fee twice for those same people, that is a cost of more than &euro;10 million.  I ask the Minister again if she believes that is value for money?  Does she know how many of the 283,826 people who have been referred to JobPath are engaged with the scheme today?  Also, the success rate so far for those sustaining employment for 12 months or more is approximately 7% of the total referred.  Again, that is not value for money.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister examine the impact JobPath is having on other schemes?  There are community employment schemes that do so much work without which work in communities simply would not be done.  They cannot find people to fill places on community employment schemes because there is a preference in the Minister's Department to refer jobseekers to JobPath only.</p></speech>

The OECD review showed that, overall, those who participate in JobPath have better employment outcomes and earnings than those who are not supported by JobPath.  The total cost of JobPath services to date is &euro;247.7 million.  That is since 2015.  The total number of people engaged to date is more than 280,000, giving a total cost per client of &euro;873, and delivering 12 months of employment services for that cost.</p>  <p>  We are facing record unemployment because of the pandemic.  There are almost 200,000 people on the live register and approximately 350,000 on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We hope that many of those people will be able to return to their jobs when restrictions ease, but the sad reality is that not everybody will be able to go back to the job they were doing previously.  I do not believe that now is the time to cut employment services of any kind.</p></speech>

Despite her genuine efforts in budget 2021, it is not the case that all additional costs associated with the pandemic are covered by current rates of pay.</p></reply>

The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the carer&rsquo;s support grant.  Combined spending on the above payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.</p>  <p>  The carer&rsquo;s support grant is an annual payment of &euro;1,700 for each care recipient paid in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test and it is not taxable.  This is not available for any other group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  The grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or domiciliary care allowance.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full-time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for a stand-alone grant.</p>  <p>  Despite the substantial extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, I announced that the carer&rsquo;s support grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of more than &euro;237 million.  At the end of October, 115,845 carers had received the carer's support grant in respect of 128,610 care recipients.  Applications for the 2020 grant can be submitted up until 31 December.  Furthermore, as part of budget 2021, I announced an increase of &euro;150 to this grant, bringing it from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850.</p>  <p>  Any further improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of other pressures in social protection and other Departments and in the light of available financial resources.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of just transition measures, carer's allowance should be included as a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance.  Family carers incur significantly higher and unavoidable energy bills due to their caring responsibilities and are among those most at risk of fuel poverty.  Carers are also asking for clarification regarding the Government's previous commitment to expanding income limits for carer's allowance to ensure that those on the average industrial income would qualify.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware that disability services are curtailed or completely withdrawn since March and that respite care is virtually non-existent.  Many healthcare staff have been redeployed to contact tracing.  Against that background, carers feel that their future looks bleak.  Family Carers Ireland look to the Minister and is appealing to her to ease the burden of pressure on carers.</p></speech>

We are charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support.  Carer's benefit is a non-means-tested payment for up to two years.  It is available to people who meet the specified social insurance contribution requirements.  In addition, a person can continue to work for up to 18.5 hours per week and still receive a carer's payment.  That was increased in the 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need, with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency, be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.</p> <p>The means test for these schemes ensures that resources are directed to those most in need.  I acknowledge the significant role that family carers play in Irish society.  I am fully committed to supporting them through the range of supports and services in my Department.  It is important to say that the Department of Social Protection provides the income support and the Department of Health also has a role in the matter.</p></speech>

It is also the preference of most people in need of care.  This level of care comes at a cost.  Many carers dedicate their lives to providing love, care and attention to those in need.  This quality care enables people to remain in their own homes.  Carers often provide this service at great personal sacrifice.  They should not have to carry the burden of additional financial costs during this time.  Family carers appreciate the &euro;19 million secured through the increase in the annual carer support grant but unfortunately this vital cohort of workers reports that budget 2021 has not improved their net financial position.  Budget 2021 was not about putting money in people's pockets but rather covering the additional outlay during the Covid pandemic.  Family carers are now financially worse off as a result of the mounting pressures placed on them during the pandemic.  Existing carer schemes are not broad enough to ensure that all family carers experiencing hardship are protected and provided for.</p></speech>

I know that many carers have sought the abolition of the means test.  Removing the means test for carer's allowance would in effect create a new universal social protection scheme for those meeting the scheme's basic caring condition.  Based on the total number of carers identified as part of census 2016, it has been estimated that a universal carer's payment could cost in excess of &euro;1.2 billion per annum more than current spending.  Increased expenditure on this scale would fundamentally change the nature of financial support and clearly reduce the scope to fund other critical schemes and services.  I recognise that some carers carry a substantial responsibility and there is no doubt that it takes over their lives but this is something that has to be discussed with the Department of Health too.</p></speech>

When Covid hit earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of people were temporarily out of work and were provided with the pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 per week.  It was the first time that the Government kind of admitted that people cannot really live on &euro;203 per week.  Shockingly, the maximum rate for disability allowance is &euro;203.  For a number of years, advocacy groups for persons with disabilities have been telling us about the extra cost associated with having a disability.  They have called for a &euro;20 cost of disability payment to be provided.  When might this be introduced?</p></reply>

While the issue has been considered before by Departments, and research has been undertaken in the past on the cost of disability in Ireland, many of the conceptual issues remain unresolved and the empirical analysis is based on data from the 1990s.  It is hoped that this current research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities from a whole-of-government perspective.</p>  <p>  My Department commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out this research and work is currently under way.  The research is looking at three main items.  It examines the conceptual underpinnings of a cost of disability.  It analyses what a reasonable estimate of a cost of disability in varying circumstances would be for people living in Ireland.  It examines the implications for public policy and service delivery.  The research will provide quantitative estimates of the cost of disability using a number of approaches, including consultation with stakeholders, an international review, and data analysis of the household budget survey and the survey on income and living conditions.  Additionally, a survey of 33,000 people with disabilities closed in November and results are now being collated.  This is important work which I understand is progressing well and I look forward to receiving the completed report very shortly.  The total cost of the report is some &euro;300,000.</p></speech>

As one can imagine, there were some heartbreaking and awe-inspiring responses.  One young woman wrote to me about the disability allowance of &euro;203 a week and how insufficient it is.  Another respondent asked how public and private employers are measured on their employment of those with disability issues.  Another person said to please let them get jobs and proper education.  A further respondent said that a person with a chronic illness will lose his or her medical card if he or she chooses to take a full-time job.  This means that it is often too much of a risk for that person to work in case his or her health deteriorates and he or she cannot afford the necessary treatments.  These comments raise important and pertinent points regarding opportunities to work and study, and parallel issues regarding transport and infrastructure.  Will the report address these issues and will that be included in the report?</p></speech>

My Department is doing much to help people with disabilities.  This year alone, we spent more than &euro;4.7 billion across various payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer's allowance, partial capacity benefit and blind pension, and that is to name but a few.  We are supporting more and more people through these schemes.  In 2010, there were 101,000 people on disability allowance.  Today, there are almost 147,000 people.  That is nearly a 50% increase in the number of people receiving disability allowance since 2010.  We expect to spend &euro;1.8 billion on disability allowance this year alone.  That will give the Deputy some idea of the Government's commitment to support people with disabilities.  It is a similar story when one looks at the number of people receiving carer's allowance.  In 2010, 50,000 people were receiving it and now 84,000 people receive it.</p></speech>

In 2018, the at risk of poverty rate for people with disabilities in Ireland was nearly 10% higher than the European average of 36.9%.  Some 46.9%, almost half, of people on disability allowance were at risk of poverty in Ireland.  That is a shocking figure.  This compares with 14% of the general population.  In 2018, the at risk of poverty rate of people not at work due to disability or illness was almost 48% and Covid will no doubt have a devastating impact on that.  Why are the most vulnerable left at the margins?  There is an opportunity to bring in the &euro;20 per week cost of disability payment.  It is a small amount but would make a significant difference to those people and show them that they are actually valued by our State, which is important.  When does the Minister expect the report to be published and when will it be acted on?</p></speech>

We will have to look at the report and we will act on the recommendations in it.  The priority and the focus of the Department of Social Protection is to ensure that there is an income safety net for people so that they do not fall below the income safety net.  As I said to Deputy Lowry on the issue of the grant, the Department of Health and the HSE also have a significant role to play.</p> <p>I know from my engagement with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, that she is fully committed to helping and supporting people and she is doing a great deal of work in her own Department to improve the outcomes and the conditions for people living with disabilities, and she is very passionate about that.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned opportunities for people to get back to work.  We have the employability service that helps people with disabilities to get into the workforce and we will continue to support that.  We need to focus on that to ensure that people have that opportunity to get into the workplace.</p></speech>

However, my Department has made enquiries with the Department of Health, which has provided the following information.  Since the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, met for the first time, a commitment was given to collect and publish as much relevant data as possible while ensuring individual patient confidentiality is always maintained.  While the nature and scale of the Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented, the collection of timely and comprehensive data has been instrumental in developing the health service response to Covid-19 and to the advice provided by NPHET and the Department of Health to assist Government decision-making in the wider response to the disease in Ireland.  Comprehensive national statistics, information and data about Covid-19, including a timeline of confirmed cases by date, is published daily on the Department of Health website and on the Covid-19 data hub and dashboards.  Links to this data can be found on the <i>gov.ie</i>website.</p><p>The published data are based on official figures provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and the Health Service Executive.  All datasets, charts and maps are updated on an ongoing basis and in line with newly published data.  I am also aware that the Covid-19 data hub now offers regularly updated local electoral area, LEA, data.  However, as mentioned, care is required to ensure patient confidentiality is preserved and no potential identification of individual cases arises.  As a result, the data relating to confirmed cases by LEA are published weekly on a Thursday, reflecting new cases notified in each LEA for the 14-day period up to midnight on the previous Monday.  The Deputy may also wish to note that a range of data on the epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland, including data on county incidence levels and trends in transmission, are published in the daily report by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and is available on its website along with a daily report on the last 14 days in cases.</p><p>In the Department of Social Protection, 2,363 people were in receipt of the enhanced illness benefit as of 23 November.  To date, more than 89,000 people have been medically certified for receipt of a Covid-19-related illness benefit payment.</p></speech>

Has the Department looked at this issue?  As the Department of Social Protection, it should be looking at how people are surviving, and Covid-19 is the main event that is taking place.  It is not enough for the Department of Health only to be looking at this.  The Department of Social Protection should also be looking at this.</p>  <p>  I take it from the Minister of State's response that his Department has not taken a look at this.  Will he rectify this position because this is vitally important?  There are clear links between poverty and Covid-19 outbreaks.  The fact that people share accommodation and have to work in jobs that put them at risk and are low paid has huge implications for the Department of Social Protection in our fight against Covid-19.</p></speech>

The index is recognised as a robust and reliable tool for the identification of relative levels of affluence or disadvantage across geographic areas by using existing data from the national census.  The index allows for an objective regional and local assessment of relative disadvantage and affluence at the small area level which can be used both for targeting resources as well as measuring change over time.</p>  <p>  There are currently no examinations being undertaken to map the incidence of Covid-19 to the Pobal HP deprivation index that Pobal is aware of.  The Pobal HP deprivation index is freely available for researchers and policymakers to use from the Pobal website.  While Pobal had initially intended to undertake such an examination itself, the necessary level of granular geographic incidence rate is currently not available to Pobal for such an examination to take place.</p></speech>

We monitor poverty levels.  The Deputy will be aware of the at-risk poverty rate, which is the percentage of people with an equivalised disposable income below 60% of the national equivalised median rate.  We also monitor the basic deprivation rate and key in all of that is the consistent poverty rate, which is the percentage of the population that is both at risk of poverty and experiencing basic deprivation.  It was 5.5% in 2019 compared with a 2018 rate 5.6%.</p>  <p>  I also chaired the first interdepartmental group three to four weeks ago and I specifically raised this issue with the various Departments.  I said that they needed to keep an eye out for the people using their services and how they were going to be adversely impacted by Covid-19, particularly those on the margins.  I will be following that up at the next interdepartmental meeting.</p></speech>

Internationally and in Ireland, research consistently indicates that the provision of a personal advisory case management service to unemployed jobseekers is an effective method of supporting jobseekers to secure and sustain employment.  JobPath is simply a mechanism through which this support is provided.  It provides long term unemployed jobseekers with access to an employment assistance and advice service for a period of 12 months.  It is a payment by results model with day-to-day operational costs and risks borne by the contractors.  They are paid on the basis of performance and, with the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client achieves sustained, full-time employment.</p>  <p>  Job sustainment fees are payable for each 13-week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks.  The total cost of the JobPath service from 2015 to the end of October this year is &euro;247.9 million.  Given the total number of engagements to date is almost 284,000, the cost per client is &euro;873.  Delivering 12 months of employment service engagement, which requires meeting every client once every 20 working days, at this cost provides value for money and compares favourably with other contracted public employment services.</p>  <p>  To date more than 168,000 individuals had completed at least one full engagement with JobPath.  In excess of 64,000 jobseekers who had engaged with JobPath had secured employment.  In 2019, my Department published a review, in partnership with the OECD, measuring JobPath's effectiveness.  Findings indicated that weekly earnings of people who secured employment after JobPath engagement were 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath in 2018.</p> <p>Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes or the likelihood of a person getting a job in the same period, it means the overall positive impact was 37% in 2018 for those supported by the JobPath service.</p></speech>

In fact, the number who sustained it for a year is much lower.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost per client, the Minister cited a figure of &euro;873.  `Will she confirm that the referral fee of &euro;311 is paid every time a person is referred, regardless of whether it is for the second or third time?  We are aware that people have been referred for a second and third time.  If the fee is paid on each occasion, it does not represent value for money.</p>  <p>  On the cost per client of &euro;873, the Minister will be aware that there is a fee for each of the four 13-week periods for which a job is sustained.  The four sustainment fees are &euro;613, &euro;773, &euro;892 and &euro;1,965.  For every person who sustains a job for one year, there is a payment to the company of &euro;3,718.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether a payment is received if a person is referred for a second or third time.  I believe it is the case but I do not want to give the Deputy an incorrect answer.  I will clarify the matter for her.</p>  <p>  JobPath is just one part of the jigsaw.  We are also expanding the capacity of other contracted employment services, such as local employment services, job clubs and employability services.  The contracts are also being extended into next year.  I had a very good meeting with the local employment service providers last week at which I outlined clearly to them that they are going to play a vital role in getting people back to work.  I want to increase the capacity of the local employment services by 50%, from 20,000 to 30,000.  I also want to expand the community-based contracted service into four new geographical areas where a local employment service does not currently exist.  My Department hopes to issue a tender for those services before the end of the year.  We are also expanding the capacity of job search support services provided by the Intreo offices countrywide.</p></speech>

If that fee is paid every time the same person is referred, which can be up to three times, and if there are more than 1,000 people in this category, as in this case, it means &euro;10 million alone is given to the companies.  If that is the case, as I believe, it does not represent value for money.</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister said about the local employment service.  It is excellent and community based, and it includes the wrap-around supports, which are really important right now when people are suffering in other ways, particularly regarding mental health.  Again, I ask the Minister to consider the average payment because there are four sustainment fees that increase every 13 weeks.</p>  <p>  With regard to community employment, CE, and additional places in that regard, CE schemes cannot find participants to fill their places because everyone is being pushed into JobPath.  The Minister should really investigate the impact of JobPath on other schemes.</p></speech>

This cost compares favourably with the cost of the Intreo and local employment services and provides value for money for taxpayers.  I want to be clear on that.</p>  <p>  The maximum number of times a person can be referred under JobPath will be two.  One of the two companies delivering the JobPath service is a farmers' co-operative.  It is not a commercial enterprise and it is not for profit.  The other company is an employee trust.  It is owned by the employees and it is not commercial.  Neither of the two companies delivering the JobPath service, Turas Nua and Seetec, is profit driven.  The House should be made aware that they do not involve people coming in to try to make huge sums of money on the back of people looking for work.</p></speech>

People referred to the employment services are the long-term unemployed who have difficulty in getting work.  They are referred to the services so they can get the help they need to identify suitable jobs.  We do not actually provide them with jobs but we provide them with the assistance they need.  We continue to engage with them regularly to try to provide the supports.  Some of the supports needed to get people back to work are very specific and tailored.  What we want to do is work with those concerned, especially through the local employment services, JobPath providers and Intreo offices.  All the services exist to help to get people back into the workforce.  Sometimes it does not work so we re-engage and try to help those concerned and walk with them.  It must be acknowledged that, for some, it is difficult.  I acknowledge the work of all the staff in the service.  I spoke to representatives of the local employment services and of the local development companies last week.  They really are doing wonderful work.</p></speech>

CE placements can play an important role in breaking the cycle of long-term unemployment for some and improve their chances of employment.</p>  <p>  As part of the July job stimulus, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on State employment schemes, including CE and T&uacute;s.  My departmental officials will work with CE-sponsoring authorities to make the additional CE placements available to suitable initiatives, subject to the agreed scheme qualification criteria.</p>  <p>  The CE budget for 2020 is &euro;364 million.  At the end of October 2020, there were 19,244 participants in the scheme.  While referrals to CE schemes can continue during the period of public health restrictions, the number of new placements has obviously been impacted by both the need for some schemes to suspend or reduce operations and the fact that Department staff have been redeployed to support the payment of the pandemic unemployment payment.  During this period, CE-sponsoring authorities were supported in extending the placements of people whose placements were due to end and were encouraged to promote awareness of the benefits of CE and CE schemes in their communities, ensuring the CE vacancies were well publicised.  They can advertise their existing CE vacancies free of charge on the Department&rsquo;s JobsIreland website.</p>  <p>  As restrictions are lifted, my Department will work collaboratively with CE sponsors to identify and refer candidates not just to fill existing CE vacancies but also to establish and fill the additional places provided under the July jobs stimulus package.  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and I will continue to support and improve it for the benefit of the CE participants and because of the valuable contribution being made to local communities.</p></speech>

I recognise the full value of the CE schemes, especially for participants in rural communities.  They provide vital social and community services that otherwise could not be afforded by many organisations.  These include childcare, including early childhood care, environmental and resource work, bus driving, caretaking and other work of this kind.  They are very much part of the local voluntary and sports organisations.  Participants do fantastic work within their communities.  It is crucial that we broaden the CE schemes to include a greater number of people on the live register and that we standardise conditions in respect of duration, pay and the training budget allocated for each scheme.</p> <p>I would like to get an understanding of what we are doing to improve the budget around training and make it more attractive for participants to uptake into the CE schemes.</p></speech>

Can she give us the number of applications that are pending decision at the moment?  Will she consider putting in additional resources in order to clear the backlog, or is this something she has already done?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300009#G01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.</p>  <p>  The SAFE registration process, which involves the authentication of a person's identity in a face-to-face interview, is the normal method of processing an application for a personal public service number, PPSN.</p>  <p>  At the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, my Department temporarily suspended the SAFE registration process.  This decision was taken in order to comply with HSE and World Health Organization public health guidelines.  Although this suspension was lifted in June when restrictions eased, the throughput in terms of processing applications was lower than normal due to the need to limit footfall into our offices in line with social distancing requirements.  In order to deal with these constraints and as an exceptional measure, my Department introduced an email and postal service through which PPSN applications could be made.  By its nature this temporary service is not as efficient as the face-to-face process it has replaced.  For example, any issues which arise regarding supporting documentation take longer to resolve than would be the case in a face-to-face environment.  In addition, delays in issuing PPS numbers arose as staff in my Department were reassigned to deal with a huge increase in claim processing work arising as a consequence of the pandemic.  In this context, it was necessary, as I am sure the Deputies will understand, to prioritise getting people into payment above all other activities.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact of the measures we had to take on issuing PPS numbers and my Department has liaised with other public bodies, employers and other agencies to deal with urgent cases as quickly as possible.  Since the introduction of this temporary service, my Department has allocated almost 34,000 PPS numbers and is currently dealing with approximately just over 22,000 applications, most of which are now being processed.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, my Department has reassigned resources to deal with these applications.  This will result in improved processing times and will substantially further reduce the number of applications on hand over the next few weeks.  In addition, as level 5 restrictions are lifted, my Department is now resuming SAFE registrations for PPSN applicants.</p>  <p>  As public representatives, we engage with staff of the Department at local level through our constituency offices and many Members of the House will agree when I acknowledge the monumental effort that the staff have put in this year, at a time of national crisis, to ensure that payments were issued to those who needed it.  Since March, staff have processed 1.5 million claims, issued 13 million payments to 800,000 people and processed the equivalent of seven years' worth of jobseeker's applications in eight months.  On top of that, we issued &euro;130 million in arrears to 286,000 people this year.  Next week, we will pay &euro;389 million on the Christmas bonus.  I pay tribute to the staff and I know that the Deputies here will agree when I say that the staff of the Department of Social Protection were front-line workers.  They provided the absolutely essential supports that people across the country needed.  I acknowledge that.  It is sometimes easy to forget that the Department and the staff have managed to do that on top of their normal, day-to-day work processing pensions, disability payments and carer's allowance.  It is sometimes easy to take for granted that things will run smoothly and payments will be there every week but much work goes on behind the scenes to make that happen.  It has been a monumental effort, across the board, by staff in every county to keep the show on the road this year.  It is important that we acknowledge the effort, the huge amount of hours, overtime and weekend work they have done to make sure that everybody got their payments as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p></speech>

I, too, pay tribute to the staff, not only those who were reassigned to deal with the pandemic unemployment payment but also those who were left behind in smaller numbers than usual to deal with the likes of applications for PPS numbers.  I have been inundated by contacts from people for the past number of months.  We know that real issues are caused when people are left waiting for PPS numbers.  I am currently dealing with someone who is trying to buy a house but has no PPS number and their solicitor has advised that there is a 20-week waiting time for a number.  Another person who has moved to my county of Roscommon is looking to set up a business and therefore needs a PPS number for a number of things.  He needs it within 30 days to import his car from England.  Revenue has told him that he has 30 days to do that but the PPS section has told him he will not have his PPS number within 30 days.  That causes real difficulties for people who are trying to do their best in whatever situation they are in.</p>  <p>  I asked about the backlog and the Minister said that 22,000 applications are being dealt with at the moment.  How many staff are dealing with that backlog?</p></speech>

The reason that I submitted this question was that a constituent has had construction staff sitting idle for months now because they could not do the Safe Pass test.  Will the Minister liaise directly with SOLAS to ensure that at least those people who are waiting for PPS numbers can do the Safe Pass test?  The woman employing the constriction staff has been asking for flexibility to be shown for months to allow her new employees to be able to do the Safe Pass course.  Meanwhile, the staff have been unable to work and she has been supporting and accommodating them.  I know that the Minister appreciates how difficult things already are for businesses without having to do this.</p> <p>I completely understand the challenges Covid has presented for the issuing of PPS numbers and I hope to see an improvement in this.  If there was some way the Safe Pass course could be freed up, that would be great.</p></speech>

People have been waiting months to get PPS numbers.  For example, a lady who is a qualified nurse was waiting from June until October to start work in a nursing home and get up and running.  She is an essential worker, as I am sure the Minister agrees.  Similarly, a Lisburn man returning from Australia and wanting to get up and running in Cork has been waiting almost six weeks to get his PPS number, facing into Christmas and just wanting to get on with work.</p>  <p>  The Minister has outlined some of the measures being put in place.  How many people does the Department have on that?  How many extra have been put in?  Are essential workers being prioritised?  If so, how much faster is it for an essential worker?  What kind of target does the Minister have in mind to turn around those PPS numbers that are so essential for people who want to get going at their work?</p></speech>

It is something I am very aware of from my own constituency office.  This week, 200 additional people have been moved into the section that works on PPS numbers.  Deputies can understand that getting money in people's pockets in terms of the PUP was an absolute priority.  Then people were depending on arrears to come.  Some people were owed arrears, mainly because insufficient information had come in and we could not process the claims.  Then we got the information, processed the claims and they went through 1.6 million applications.  This week we have paid out arrears to 286,000 people, totalling &euro;130 million.</p>  <p>  That will give some idea of the volume of work that the Department of Social Protection has been dealing with.  I accept there have been delays with PPS numbers but Deputies will be glad to hear that more staff are going into it.  It is a priority for us to try to process them as quickly as possible.  If there are any specific cases the Deputies want to bring to my attention, I will be happy to deal with them.  We are doing everything we can and the staff are working as hard as they can to get this dealt with.</p></speech>

As the Minister has acknowledged, there are huge difficulties.  While I appreciate that getting money into people's pockets was the priority during Covid, the Minister also acknowledged that there are huge difficulties for people trying to get PPS numbers for various purposes, such as taking up a job or buying a house.  I welcome the action the Minister has taken and I hope it will see the average waiting time for people reduce quickly.</p></speech>

I look forward to an improvement in it.  Perhaps the Minister could liaise on the transfer over of cars.  People are trying to get their cars transferred over but cannot do so because they do not have PPS numbers.  A bit of common sense and flexibility around it would go a long way.  I commend staff who have done Trojan work on this, the PUP and other issues.</p>  <p>  A situation is arising for the workers and the Mandate union in Shaws in Castlebar.  They think they are not entitled to the PUP because they restarted at work last year.  It is a separate but connected question and if the Minister could bring clarity to that, it would be great.</p></speech>

The Minister is aware of it as well, as she has pointed out.  They are doing it in a very challenging time.  I also welcome the 200 extra people assigned to deal with the PPS numbers.  That will be helpful.  Will the Minister outline what kind of target time she is setting out to achieve?  How soon can people reasonably expect that, having made an ordinary application, they will have a PPS number?  Will it be a month or six weeks, when it is up and running?  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh daoine &aacute;balta uimhreacha PPS a fh&aacute;il agus t&aacute; moill mh&oacute;r sa ch&oacute;ras.  Mar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;antar gach iarracht ruda&iacute; a bhr&uacute; chun cinn.  What is the Minister's target time and is she prioritising any essential workers?  How much faster is the essential worker getting their PPS number than the ordinary applicant?</p></speech>

They are great.  A change has been made in PPS numbers.  In the past, wives and husbands were linked with the same number.  The only difference was that "w" was after the wives' number.  That has been changed, thankfully and properly, and everybody has been given their own individual number.  However, many women do not know this and I have a case of a woman applying for her driving licence who was told the PPS number she had, with "w" at the end, would not work.  She had to get a new PPS number, which is causing further delays.  She did not know that.  First, will the Minister do something to inform people of this change so they can apply for the new PPS number in time?  Second, is there any way they could still use the old PPS number to do things like getting driving licences to alleviate the backlog?</p></speech>

My number was changed to the same as my husband's with a "w" on the end of it.  That is quite some time ago.  I got another PPS number a good number of years ago.  I do not know if there are many cases where people have not got the new PPS number.  I imagine they are few and far between but I will check it out to make sure people are aware they got one in their own right.  I do not know why we ever had to be attached in that manner.  They were changed and now, thankfully, they are changed back.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Moynihan's question, we have put additional resources in.  We will try to deal with the backlogs as quickly as possible.  I assure the Deputy that arrangements are in place to expedite urgent cases.  We are working through them as quickly as we can.  Everything will be done to move them on because I know there are cases where people absolutely need to get PPS numbers as quickly as possible, for example to complete the purchase of a property and the drawdown of a mortgage, as Deputy Kerrane said.  These instances are across the board.  I confirm to the House we are doing everything we can to move the backlog.</p></speech>

Carer's benefit is a payment of up to two years' duration made to people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person in need of full-time care.  Under the provisions of the legislation, to be eligible to claim carer's benefit, a claimant must have paid PRSI contributions in classes A, B, C, D, E or H.  Self-employed workers who pay social insurance contributions at the class S rate of 4% are not eligible for carer's benefit.</p>  <p>  For a first claim, the carer must have 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurance and either 39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year; 39 contributions paid in the 12 months immediately before the commencement of the carer's benefit; or 26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the previous relevant tax year.</p> <p>Entitlement to social insurance benefits is generally dependent on the applicant's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid and other qualification criteria relevant to the schemes in question.  This is to reflect the fact that the payment is made to an individual to address a contingency that he or she is experiencing.</p> <p> A claim cannot be made for carer's benefit based on the contributions paid by another person, such as a spouse or partner.  Where a person does not have the necessary social insurance record, he or she can claim for carer's allowance.  The first &euro;332.20 of weekly income for a single person, or &euro;665 for a couple, is disregarded in the means test.</p> <p> Any proposal to amend social insurance entitlements would have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the current economic circumstances and the sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.  I hope my reply has clarified the issue.</p></speech>

While I appreciate that the disregards and allowance bands are high, I have encountered a few tough examples of self-employed people not being able to apply for the same carer's benefit as someone who has been paying PRSI class A.  The best thing I can do is provide an example.  A self-employed male electrician has a wife who had been in full-time employment paying class A before she fell extremely ill.  He may have to leave work to look after her, but he will only be entitled to apply for a means-tested carer's allowance and savings and other means will be taken into account.  This impedes the amount for which they can qualify.  There is a number of potential solutions.  Although I understand that the wife in this instance may be able to apply for illness benefit based on her contributions, could her contributions be used to allow her spouse to apply for carer's benefit?</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, the means-tested carer's allowance is available.  The means test has a generous disregard of &euro;665 for a couple.  I understand that there are difficult situations, but we have extended supports for the self-employed.  For example, they can now get jobseeker's benefit.  This is why many self-employed have been able to benefit from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which is only right and proper.  Many extra benefits have been made available to the self-employed, but in the case outlined, extending a benefit in the way the Deputy requested to attach it to someone else's contributions would represent a fundamental change in the social welfare system.</p></speech>

That contribution entitles a self-employed person to invalidity pension.  This welcome change was made a couple of years ago.  Could a self-employed person making class S contributions be allowed to avail of carer's benefit?  Could this potential solution be considered?</p></speech>

That would entail expanding further the benefits relating to a class S stamp.  I always want to consider how to review and improve, but this could result in the contribution increasing, given that the benefit is commensurate with the stamp paid.  I will consider the proposal and I would be happy to engage with the Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300011#J01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 34 and 53 together.</p>  <p>  We know from past recessions that young people tend to be disproportionately impacted by any labour market shock.  This is because many employers operate a last in, first out protocol when reducing their labour forces and young people tend to work in occupations and sectors that are most immediately affected by economic downturns, for example, retail and hospitality.</p>  <p>  Research recently published by my Department shows that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been no different.  Youth unemployment stood at just over 10% in quarter 1 of 2020 based on the labour force survey data, with approximately 20,000 under-25s on the live register.  By quarter 3 of 2020, these figures had increased to 20% and 25,000, respectively.  By the end of October, and if we include PUP recipients, more than 45% of young people in the labour force were unemployed.  However, it is important to note that the Government extended access to the PUP to students who worked part time.  As a consequence, one in four of those in receipt of PUP and under 25 years of age have self-certified as students.  Using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organization, these students would not normally be considered or counted as unemployed.</p>  <p>  While young people are disproportionately affected, we know from past recessions that youth unemployment levels typically fall quickly once economic activity resumes.  However, the evidence also shows that some young people will remain disconnected from employment and that those who cannot find their footing again tend to suffer permanent scarring effects, with unemployment and social isolation becoming entrenched.</p>  <p>  We are taking a number of important steps to create opportunities and options to help young people get back to work.  My Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are developing a range of support measures to assist young people.  Measures announced under the July jobs stimulus package to combat unemployment include expanding the capacity of Intreo centres to provide enhanced employment services and supports with the assignment of 100 job coaches; expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people from the live register; providing 35,000 new places in further and higher education courses; providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices through the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited; and facilitating access to the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period.  My Department is also developing a new work experience placement programme for those out of work for at least six months to encourage employers to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market, thereby helping to break the vicious circle of no job without experience, no experience without a job.  I expect to launch the programme in early 2021, subject to public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  In developing these programmes and services, the Department is working closely with, and being advised by, the Labour Market Advisory Council, which is composed of leading market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.  We will keep these programmes under review and report progress on a regular basis.</p></speech>

That is absolutely startling.  The Minister has today outlined a comprehensive response to that in terms of incentivising employment opportunities, apprenticeships and third level and further education places for those young people.  We need to make sure they are not adversely affected in the long term, which is why I am pleased to hear the Minister outline her plan to tackle youth unemployment in Ireland.</p></speech>

We will, therefore, have the Pathways to Work strategy and I will be launching that early next year.  We will significantly ramp up the number of places available on training and employment support schemes.  There will be 35,000 extra training places and 10,000 new apprenticeships.  That is being led by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and as I said earlier, funding was secured as part of the July stimulus.</p>  <p>  The public employment service, which covers the spectrum of services, including local employment service, JobPath, job clubs and employability service, which is focused on helping people with disabilities get into the work force, has a current capacity between all those services to deal with a total caseload of approximately 106,000 people.  I want to increase that capacity by about  87,000 to bring it up to around 193,000.  We will, therefore, be ramping up the capacity of the local employment services next year.</p></speech>

I am happy to engage with the Open Door Initiative as well.</p>  <p>  We want to increase the number of people being referred to the local employment services by approximately 50% next year.  We will also be tendering to extend the service into several geographical areas which do not have those services.  I have spoken to the local development companies to advise them this will be up for tender and I will be encouraging them to put in a bid to do that work.  It is, however, a competitive process.</p>  <p>  We are also assigning 100 new job coaches into the Intreo offices around the country to advise and support people.  We want to increase the number of people availing of the back-to-education allowance by approximately 7,700.  Approximately 19,000 people are currently on schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s.  I want to increase that number of places on those schemes up to approximately 25,000 next year.  We have secured additional funding to do that.</p></speech>

We sent a correction to the Minister's office and I hope it was received.  It is not about the total national childcare scheme, NCS, but specifically the after-school programme.  The Minister will be aware I already raised this issue.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300012#K01100"><p>Initially, it is important to state that stay-at-home parents are not excluded from the national childcare scheme.  More than 44,000 children have benefited from that scheme to date and included in that are many children of stay-at-home parents.</p><p>The NCS universal subsidy is up to &euro;1,170 per year and is available to all families, including stay-at-home parents.  An income-related subsidy is payable to children up to 15 years of age and the subsidy level is determined by the family's income and the child's age.  The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.</p><p>Stay -at-home parents who are not engaged in work for two hours per week or more or not enrolled in a national framework of qualifications, NFQ, level 1 or above course, can avail of 20 subsidised hours of childcare per week if they are not below the current maximum threshold of &euro;60,000 net household income.  The 20 hours are available all year round for children who have not started school and in non-term time for children of school age.  This latter rule is based on evidence that were a parent is available to care for a child, the child's development needs are generally met through school participation.  There are some exceptions to this which I will deal with momentarily.  Where parents are working or studying, they can access 45 hours of childcare.</p><p>My Department and SOLAS are working to increase awareness of the NCS supports for parents considering further study and to highlight the availability of accessible courses which would grant eligibility for up to 45 hours of childcare.  The NCS will advertise shortly through the further education and training course hub, <i>fetchcourses.ie</i>.  My Department will also be re-engaging with Intreo offices and the education and training boards, ETBs, to promote awareness of the NCS.</p><p>We discussed before that where children and families have extra needs that general NCS subsidies or rules do not meet, special sponsorship arrangements are available.  With sponsorship, families can avail of up to 45 hours of free childcare with no work or study rule, and sponsorship referrals can be made by a number of designated bodies.  Already, 700 children are being sponsored.</p></speech>

I would not be raising it again if I did not feel it was not still an issue.  It consistently comes up, not just in my constituency but throughout the country.  From Donegal to Cork, people have issues specific to the after-school part of the programme.</p>  <p>  I am aware that last time around, the Minister said it was a new enough scheme and he was willing to have a review of that.  Perhaps, he could elaborate further on when he sees that review happening.  Currently, children whose parents are not in either education or employment do not qualify for the after-school programme.  In the past, they possibly would have qualified through the subvention payment scheme.  This means an awful lot of kids benefited from after-school programmes, or possibly homework clubs that were a place they got a hot meal and proper dinner.  We have often spoken about child poverty.  Childcare earlier settings after-school settings are important in the eradication of child poverty.  A bunch of children are falling through the cracks.</p></speech>

That is one of the reasons we are taking this new initiative to make parents aware of the wide range of courses they can take.  If they take courses, many of which are level 1, for two hours per week, they get the full 45 hours of childcare, which will resolve that particular issue.  That was probably not well known.  That is why we are working with SOLAS and with Intreo offices around the country to make that information available and known to parents.</p>  <p>  We are also aware of the sponsorship arrangements because 700 children is good, but it is only a start.  I want to see more children using the sponsorship arrangements.  We are, therefore, engaging with the county and city childcare committees to enable them to put that information out further.</p>  <p>  We are also engaging with child and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSC, across the country so they can make parents aware of the sponsorship arrangements and link up and advise parents about how to tap into those sponsorship arrangements.</p></speech>

The reality for many people, however, is even though it might seem like a two-hour course is something a person could do and end up getting 45 hours, some people might not be in a place right now in their lives where they can access that, or have the capabilities to engage in it.  I feel that kids are falling through the cracks as a result.</p>  <p>  Does the scheme the Minister is talking about cover after-school programmes or is it just for a full day care place in a childcare setting?  I have a concern, because it seems there are huge issues in the childcare and early care sector.  We could discuss it at length and I would love that opportunity.  There is, however, an issue right now in after-school programmes.  We are seeing closures, we will see more closures and those places will be gone forever.</p> <p>It is important, therefore, that something be done for the children of parents who are not at work or doing a course.  Even if the course takes only two hours a week, they may not be in a position right now to take it.  These children are at risk of falling through the cracks but may not quite come under Tusla's remit.  It was brought to my attention that this issue applies to children whose first language is not English, such as those who come from Syria or other countries.  I appreciate the work that is being done on the matter but there is a little more to be done.</p></speech>

We have to do more with Tusla to ensure that it understands, from the top of the organisation down.  Tusla is a huge organisation.  I will talk about the matter with the chief executive when I meet him and the chairperson for our quarterly review.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point about after-school clubs and homework clubs.  While I do not have anything clear to say about it now, we are working to see whether anything can be done with regard to the appropriateness of the existing sponsoring bodies.  We are looking into that further and if we have any news on that point, I will be sure to update the Deputy and the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We have sight of a report, Pathways to Better Prospects: Delivering Proper Terms and Conditions for the Early Years Workforce in Ireland, of which the Minister will no doubt be aware.  It was produced by the department of work and employment studies at the University of Limerick.  The research was partly funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The report states that the sustainability of the sector is under pressure because "[t]he unsustainability is evidenced by a 2019 survey which found that 65 per cent of 3,200 early years professionals do not expect to be working in the sector in five years&rsquo; time".  When will there be a sectoral employment order or some such mechanism that ensures we can retain staff and pay them properly?</p></reply>

Improving access to high-quality and affordable early learning and childcare is a priority for me as Minister.  I have spoken to both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about this on a number of occasions and our officials are engaging intensively to progress the matter.  Children need and deserve the highest quality of early learning and care experiences and current staff turnover rates in the sector are unacceptable.  The primary cause of the high turnover rates is the terms and conditions and it is critical that this be addressed.  I am leading on a number of actions to find an effective and sustainable solution.</p>  <p>  The State is not the direct employer of early learning and childcare practitioners and, therefore, neither my Department nor any other can set the wage levels.  The Deputy will be aware that in the programme for Government, there is a commitment to the creation of a joint labour committee for the sector, which could offer a mechanism to create a pay agreement.  My officials are actively working to progress this in collaboration with colleagues in other Departments, including that of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for this industrial relations mechanism.  I have met representatives of SIPTU, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and Childhood Services Ireland to discuss the issue of pay and the development of a potential joint labour committee.  I hope that all the parties can continue to work together, that staff and employers will play lead roles in the process and that we can make progress in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that work is also progressing on a new funding model, designed by the expert group.  The model will be important to determine how, when we put significant State investment into childcare, we can ensure that one of the key deliverables is a well-paid early childcare workforce.  I am happy to say the other element, the workforce development plan, is progressing rapidly.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is represented on both the expert group and the workforce development plan.</p></speech>

He stated that work is progressing, but it would be useful if we had more definitive timelines and if we knew what the expectations are for a successful outcome to that such that it can be guaranteed that there will be an improvement in the pay and conditions at the end of the process.  The Minister told us that he and his Department are not the employer, but he is very mindful that the sustainability of the sector is in question because, even though there is increased demand for workers within the sector, that is not being met with increased rates of pay to reflect that demand.  We would like to hear from the Minister a more definitive timeline and a sense of what his expectations are.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as he noted.  We would like to know when he expects that commitment to be delivered on.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy a specific date today, although I would love to be in the position to do so.  Nevertheless, there is sustained engagement and I hope that in a short number of months, we will have a clear indication of where we are going with that process.  It is fundamental, which is why we are putting such efforts into providing it.  It is one part of a wider issue, however, and the funding model will be important as well.  There will be clarity on the funding model and key information from the expert funding group in the middle of next year, which can then inform my negotiations for budget 2022.</p></speech>

I welcome his reply and fully acknowledge that he cannot give a definitive timeline, and it is useful for us to have some sense of the workings, but we want this to end up as an interminable process that outlives the potential mandate of any sitting Government.  The workers in the sector expect clear timelines and clear deliverables and it is reasonable that they should not have to wait two or three years before they see some light at the end of the tunnel, which is the essential point I am making.  I want to keep the pressure on the Minister in respect of ensuring that we all move towards a scenario in this country whereby people are given a proper wage for the work they do and in recognition of their qualifications.</p></speech>

I have talked to childcare professionals and heard how they feel that having gone through significant training and education to take up the role, they are not rewarded.  They feel they do not have any career prospects.  That is why we are trying to bring together the workforce development plan, the expert funding model and the work we are doing on the joint labour committee.</p>  <p>  It can never happen fast enough - I fully understand that and know that childcare professionals have been waiting a long time - but in the sphere of what we are doing in this part of my Department, this is an absolute priority.  I have no doubt the Deputy will continue to put pressure on me with oral questions, and appropriately so.</p></speech>

I signalled previously that there would be a short time interval between receipt of the report and the separate arrangements for its publication.  It is essential that publication is done in the right way with former residents being given the priority and support they deserve.  In recent weeks, I have spoken to former residents and advocates in this area, including a majority of the collaborative forum and representatives of many of the organisations and individuals affected.  I have listened carefully to their views and concerns.</p>  <p>  The work around the publication of the report is at an advanced stage but I am mindful, too, that the uncertainty around when those affected will be able to read the report could add to their anxiety.  For this reason and in the hope of offering some reassurance, I wish to confirm today that I will be bringing a memorandum to the Government in the week of 11 January next seeking approval to publish the report immediately.  I also intend to publish the sixth interim report from the commission at the same time.</p>  <p>  I recognise how important it is that former residents and their families are the first to be notified about plans to publish the report and how to access it.  My Department contacted former residents earlier today to tell them of the planned publication arrangements.</p>  <p>  Deputies will agree that it is important that former residents are informed first.  In my communications to survivors this morning, I also highlighted the counselling supports available to those who feel they need additional support immediately and over the Christmas and new year period.  Available capacity in these services will be primed to respond to the anticipated increased demand when the report is published and in the weeks following.  An information line has been established in my Department and all relevant contact information is on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that the certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill was approved by the previous Government in December of last year and referred for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Due to the general election in February, this did not happen.  It is my intention to bring a memorandum to the Government on the general scheme of this Bill also in the week of 11 January and then refer it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability and Integration for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

I, along with many others, have been anxious to get a date but I am also mindful that today marks exactly three weeks to Christmas Eve.  I have been speaking to many survivors and various representatives over the past two weeks.  I have had a number of online meetings.  People are concerned that the report is to be published and everyone would leave them high and dry over the Christmas period.  Unfortunately, that has been their experience of dealing with the State over the years.  They have been let down.  I do not blame people for feeling like that.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the correct counselling supports are put in place.  They should have been put in place a long time ago regardless of whether a report was being published.  Now that we will have the report, which I believe is 4,000 pages long, it will be difficult reading.  Obviously, it was a difficult lived experience for so many people and their families.  It is important that there are the correct counsellors and that people are not merely guided on to some number, where one is on a waiting list and one will be 18 months waiting, or to somebody who does not really understand.  There needs to be trauma-specific counsellors dealing with people.  They need to be services that are available specifically for survivors and those affected, not added on to an existing overburdened service.  That is crucial.  I welcome that we have a date because it is important for people to be able to prepare for it mentally as well.</p></speech>

There are various views out there.  Talking to more and more of them as we get closer to Christmas - it has been a hard year for everybody - there is a real sense that this Christmas will be a difficult and unusual one.  With the significance of this report, it was clear to me that publishing it close to Christmas would not be appropriate.  That is why we are giving clarity today that we have a specific date.  It is the second week in January.  We will bring it forward in that week.</p>  <p>  I take on board all that the Deputy is saying about the need for the provision of appropriate counselling and supports at that time.  We are engaging on a consistent basis with the Department of Health and the HSE.  When the announcement is made, there will be clarity as regards the counselling services.  Those counselling services will be put in place at that time.  The Deputy is correct.  That is essential and necessary.</p></speech>

It is really important that survivors and people affected by this get the report first.  While that might seem like common sense to everybody, there has been a history and a pattern of things being leaked and of people hearing media stories.  I was contacted by people who thought the report was being published this week and that was not the case.  It is really important that survivors get copies.</p>  <p>  Some people have even contacted me to ask whether they will get a copy or will have to read it online.  We might think "of course they will get a copy", but that needs to be reaffirmed to them.  They need to be communicated with and told that they will get a copy and their views will be respected in terms of them getting this first, before it is released to the wider public.  That is the least they deserve.</p>  <p>  I want to briefly mention Bessborough.  I welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned that we will definitely have the pre-legislative scrutiny of the certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill in January.  In the past week or two, there has been a planning application in relation to the former site at Bessborough.  The burial grounds are included in that.  People are concerned that works will go ahead there.  We should have that pre-legislative scrutiny and have that proposed Bill passed before any works are carried out.</p></speech>

On Bessborough, I am aware of the planning application.  I have engaged with one of the leading survivor groups for survivors from Cork.  I was looking at the planning application this morning.  I am concerned about that planning application.  I will not say more about it now but I am aware of what is happening there.</p>  <p>  As regards engagement and informing survivors, the survivors on the departmental mailing list were mailed this morning with information.  The plan is that it will go to the Cabinet that week, and following the Cabinet meeting, the Taoiseach and I will host a webinar solely for survivors at which we will discuss and bring out the major conclusions of the report for survivors.  It will only be after that point that it will be available.  We will hold a press conference for the general public, but we will be engaging with survivors first and telling them first.  Probably the following week, because everyone will need time to read it, there will be time for an extensive D&aacute;il debate on the issue as well.  We will provide more detail in the new year about the specifics of getting this report to survivors.</p></speech>

To what extent has the Minister sourced and consulted international and national independent law and data privacy advisers in advance of the publication of the mother and baby homes report?  If he has not done this, will he appoint independent advisers of national and international standing in future?  I ask him to make a statement on the matter.</p></reply>

I had said that there would be a short time interval between its receipt by my Department and its publication.  I have now outlined the plans for publication.</p>  <p>  One of the matters undertaken was to refer the report of almost 3,000 pages to the Attorney General to ascertain whether there were any legal impediments to publication.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government, and he has not indicated any concerns to me in relation to data privacy or data protection in respect of the publication of the report.</p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, I am open to engaging with other experts on the data protection issues relating to matters connected to the report more widely, as my work on dealing with access to records continues.  To that end, I have already reached out to a number of experts - national and international - and sought a meeting to hear their considered views on this matter.  My officials are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General and I will ensure that any independent views are shared with that office.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the commission is independent in the manner in which it chooses to conduct its investigation and the commissioners are the appropriate persons to consider any data privacy or protection issues ahead of submission of the report to me as the prescribed Minister.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked previously about providing mechanisms for individuals to access personal information contained in the archive of records which is due to be deposited with my Department on 28 February next.  My Department is carefully examining the advice of the Attorney General and the views of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure we can put in place the procedures and practices that will enable relevant persons to access certain personal information in accordance with existing law.</p>  <p>As I said, I have committed to, and begun, the steps of engaging with international experts to obtain their advice and views on the provision of information.</p></speech>

I am pleased to hear that he has already made contact with experts.  He mentioned that the Attorney General has given advice in regard to data protection.  Previously, there was confusion as a result of the advice from different Attorneys General in regard to data protection.  It is important to have clarity in this regard.</p>  <p>  Survivor groups have expressed concern that there be adequate consultation with the international experts on this matter.  My understanding is that the groups offered suggestions in October as to the external experts with whom it would be particularly beneficial for the Minister to engage.  They also asked that a dedicated unit be established within the Data Protection Commission, which would have a dedicated advisory committee.  Will the Minister commit to setting up such a unit?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister also agree to reconvene the collaborative forum for former residents of mother and baby homes?  He said he has spoken to the majority of members of the forum, but has he spoken to the forum in its totality?  Will he reconvene it and appoint a chairperson and member with data protection expertise?</p></speech>

If Deputy Whitmore does not mind, I will address her last question in my reply to Deputy Pringle, in which I will set out my past and future engagements with the forum.  I have written separately today to all members of the forum indicating my intention to convene a meeting of it once the report of the commission of investigation has been published.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue of independent advice, the Adoption Rights Alliance gave me the names of two individuals.  I have approached those individuals to obtain advice.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and I am bound to accept his advice.  However, in order to get the widest range of views on how we can deal with this issue properly, I am also engaging with the international experts to whom I referred and the Data Protection Commission.  I cannot create a separate unit within the commission.  My understanding is that the survivor groups were looking for a separate unit within my Department to deal with these particular queries.  We are examining how we can best meet that request.</p></speech>

Many of them were traumatised by the recent debates.  It is really important that survivors do not feel they must fight for access to data concerning their own histories.  I ask that the Minister keep that consideration to the fore of all his decisions as he moves forward on this matter.</p></speech>

In respect of today's announcement about the publication date, we put survivors first by notifying them even before we notified the D&aacute;il.  That was the appropriate thing to do.  When the report is published, it will be presented to the survivor groups and individuals concerned before it goes out to the general public.  I have said a number of times that we will provide the full allowable GDPR access, but GDPR is not going to solve all the problems.  That is something even the Data Protection Commissioner recognises.  The way to resolve the issue of access to information is via information and tracing legislation.  It is important that I keep putting that on the record.  We are not going to have a panacea when the archive comes to my Department on 28 February.  The issue will be solved by information and tracing legislation.  I am engaging with the Attorney General in that regard and my Department is working hard on an options paper.  I look forward to bringing information and tracing legislation to the Oireachtas next year.</p></speech>

There were 13 forum members present, including the chairperson, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Healy, as well as the Minister's predecessor, Katherine Zappone, and six officials from the then Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  From the notes of the meeting, it seems that a number of commitments were made to the forum and follow-up was expected.  Instead, the forum was sidelined after the general election and blindsided when the Government introduced its legislation dealing with access to the database and records in October.  What meetings has the Minister had with the forum and what are his plans for the forum next year?</p></reply>

I am committed to strong and ongoing engagement with former residents of mother and baby institutions and their advocates.  The process of engagement with the collaborative forum, which was established by my predecessor, Katherine Zappone, as a representative advisory body on issues of priority for former residents, their families and supporters, was interrupted by the general election and the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was necessary to put meetings of the forum on hold in the context of the restrictions put in place to reduce the spread and impact of Covid-19.  A number of members travel to meetings from outside the jurisdiction and some would also be categorised as being in the high-risk category.</p>  <p>  Throughout 2020, the members of the forum have been apprised of developments and updated on matters related to the commission of investigation by the secretariat to the group.  It is the practice of my Department to inform them of any major announcements prior to their being made public.  In the course of the debate on the database legislation, I acknowledged my own shortcomings and those of my Department in terms of our communications and engagement with the collaborative forum.  I voiced my commitment to renewed engagement with survivors and advocates, including members of the forum.  As a first step towards that, I have spoken to former residents and advocates in this area in recent weeks, including a substantial majority of forum members.  I spoke individually to anyone who was happy to speak to me.</p>  <p>  I have given my commitment to convening a meeting of the forum in whatever manner is possible following the publication of the report of the commission of investigation.  I repeated that commitment in a communication I sent to forum members this morning as part of the notification process of the date for the publication of the report.  As I said, I am advancing the publication of the report for the week of 11 January.  I have communicated that to the collaborative forum, as well as my intention to meet it thereafter to discuss the report and its ongoing involvement in the process of advising and representing survivors, together with wider issues to do with the legacy, many of which we discussed in the debate on the database legislation.</p></speech>

It worries me that he talks about it not being possible to have meetings of the collaborative forum.  There is the option of video conferencing, which has been availed of by the Oireachtas.  That could have been put in place.  I am concerned that there is a possibility of the forum being put on hold.</p>  <p>  In the notes of a previous meeting of the forum, it was stated that members "feel that their voice and opinions are not being adequately recorded in order for it to be evident to a wider audience".  Forum members were told that the Department would organise a presentation on the report of the commission of investigation at the next meeting, which we now know will take place in January.  An action noted was that the Department was to seek clarification from the Attorney General and revert to the forum.  There seems to have been a reluctance to engage with members.  The Minister has much work to do to get people back on board given the way the database legislation was handled and how the forum has been treated over the past year.  Not all of that happened under his watch, but it is his responsibility now and he has a great deal of work to do to get things back on track.</p></speech>

Some of them were very forthright in their views on the issues, as is absolutely appropriate.  It was an important first step to rebuilding trust.  I made the commitment that we would convene subsequent to the publication of the report.  A number of members voiced their dissatisfaction that the forum's own report has never been published, only the recommendations.  I made a commitment to go back to the Attorney General to see whether we can get that report, or a substantial part of it, published.  A huge amount of work went into it and the forum members made the point that their recommendations, which were published, were very much out of context without the full report to give them a broader perspective.  I have made a commitment to engage with the Attorney General on the forum's report.</p></speech>

It seems that everything has been done according to his say in this matter, and that is worrying.</p> <p>The legal view takes a very narrow view of how things can actually be done and how people can be dealt with.  These people need a more humane view rather than a legal view.  That would go a long way towards meeting it.  The Minister needs to be strong and stand up to the Attorney General.  He needs to tell him it is the Department with responsibility for children, a Government Department, rather than a legal office.  This will be important in how the matter is dealt with in the future.</p></speech>

My engagement with him resulted in GDPR now applying to the archive, a significant step.  Everyone has recognised it as such.  That should be noted.</p>  <p>  Obviously the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.  I recognise that, in the context of the debate on the database legislation, I took a legalistic approach.  I saw a legal problem and saw that as a solution.  I am endeavouring to ensure that I continue to engage with survivors.  I have had significant engagement with survivors over the past number of weeks and I will continue to do so.  It has been extremely useful for me to hear at first hand the absolutely shocking and different experiences of so many survivors.

This year my Department is providing &euro;25.3 million to Tusla in core funding for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  I am also providing an additional resource of &euro;2 million to deal with specific once-off Covid issues.</p>  <p>  Tusla is aware that there were and continue to be issues for those experiencing domestic violence arising from the Covid-19 situation.  There may be particular concerns for victims around the Christmas period.  This is why since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, Tusla has prioritised domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services while actively engaging with all services to support a continuity of service, as well as to provide contingencies around service provision.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that there are currently 143 accommodation units available.  Of these, 103 are within the normal framework of refuge provision.  Due to the requirements for social distancing, there was a reduction in 36 of the family units within that framework.   In response to that need to reduce, however, Tusla has funded 25 additional off-site units and an additional 15 safe homes.  The most recent information we have from Tusla is that 106 units are already occupied, meaning there is capacity in the system for anyone in need.  Tusla is keeping the situation under review.  It has a systematic feedback and communications mechanism in place with the domestic violence service provider organisations regarding issues and difficulties that arise for organisations during this time.  Any specific measures implemented for the Christmas period will be based on feedback from services about pressures arising in December.</p>  <p>  I have already confirmed that next year Tusla will be allocated additional funding of &euro;4.7 million to support domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services across the country.  A total of &euro;30 million will be made available for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services next year.  There is an additional &euro;2.7 million in core funding which will bring it to &euro;28 million, as well as &euro;2 million in Covid contingency funding.</p></speech>

They are the ones reported.  We do not know how many go unreported.  It is important that all of what the Minister just outlined is made available to the public as far as is possible.  There are many people who may not be able to access some of the wonderful work and services available to them locally.</p>  <p>  What engagement has Tusla with local authorities?  In particular, local authority housing services are often the first point of contact for public representatives who may be approached by somebody looking for emergency accommodation.  What resource and spaces are available there?</p>  <p>  I want to take this time to acknowledge and commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its work through Operation Faoiseamh.  It does extraordinary, often unheralded, work right across the country, particularly this year.  I would like to see extra resources given to Operation Faoiseamh for the period ahead.</p></speech>

On Monday, I had the privilege to be present at the launch of an information booklet by the CYPSC, Children and Young People's Services Committees, for Fingal and Dublin north city, giving specific and invaluable information - I think is based on one from Roscommon - on domestic violence services in those particular areas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made an important point about local authorities often being the first point of contact.  One point discussed during the programme for Government negotiations was that there is an element of fragmentation about the responses to domestic violence with the policy and criminal side based in the Department of Justice, some of the housing elements being in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and with Tusla falling within my Department's remit.  An audit is being undertaken to review the overall responsibility and co-ordination for domestic violence services in this country compared with other jurisdictions.  It will make proposals on how we can streamline and better focus policy and delivery.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give me a timeline as to when that review will be completed and when he hopes to have an action plan around it?</p>  <p>  Many of the voluntary organisations in question have had a difficult year in terms of fundraising and their ability to fundraise.  This is the time of year when they need those funds mostly.  Will the Minister or the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, or the Minister of State in that Department, Deputy Joe O'Brien, be in a position to make extra funding available to them for this period to ensure their services will not be impacted due to a lack of financial resources?</p></speech>

An extra &euro;2 million has been put in this year specifically for Covid-related demands.  The final tranche of that is being released at the moment.  Tusla held it back for the Christmas period knowing the need for demand.  A further &euro;2 million Covid contingency will be available for next year from January.</p>  <p>  As regards the timeline for the audit, we just put out the tender documents and we are reviewing them.  A nine-month timeline was set out in the programme for Government.  We are still hoping to meet that.  It might go a little bit over that but we would hope that early next year we will have that audit complete.

The Deputy has raised this issue with me on several occasions and I am happy to continue to liaise with him on it.</p>  <p>  The investigation of burial arrangements of persons who died while resident in mother and baby homes was a key focus in the terms of reference given to the statutory commission of investigation.  We already know from the commission's interim reports that it dedicated significant time and effort to advancing its investigations into these matters.</p>  <p>  There is a designated child burial site in the grounds of the institution in question.  The commission has reported it was made aware of concerns about this burial ground and decided to undertake a geophysical study and subsequently a test excavation of the site.</p>  <p>  The results of this excavation were being examined at the time of publication of the fifth interim report.  The commission confirmed it would comment further on these matters in the final report.  As I outlined in my reply to Deputy Funchion earlier, I received the commission's final report on 30 October and I will publish it in the week of 11 January.</p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy can understand that I cannot get into specific details in advance of the report's publication.</p> <p>Once the report is published I am happy to meet directly with the Deputy to discuss those particular chapters of the report relevant to that institution.  I am happy to engage subsequently with groups representing survivors.  I have spoken to at least one person representing survivors' groups but I am happy to engage further once the report is published and we can discuss on the basis of what the commission has found.</p></speech>

Some of the residents feel very let down about the lack of engagement on the treatment of their data.  We have been giving the Minister an opportunity to speak to survivors and it has now been five weeks.  The process needs to be completed quickly.  The Minister has given a date to Deputy Funchion.  Now that the report has been submitted he must not make the mistake of thinking it is all over.  Many of the details of this sorry saga are still hidden from us.  Survivors of Shan Ross and their families are concerned about locating graves there that have not yet been identified, if the owner of the land in question is willing to allow digs.  I appreciate departmental digs have taken place but the survivors are adamant there are more plots on the site and they want to identify them and, if they are there, to bring those names into this also.  Will the Minister give the go ahead for these digs?  I spoke to the Taoiseach, who said he would speak to the Minister about commissioning another dig.</p></speech>

I have committed to engaging directly with the Deputy and with groups he feels should be involved, even prior to the report.  I do not know whether the Deputy made specific contact to get me to speak to survivors but I am happy to do so.  I have met a significant number of survivors over the past number of weeks and at least one representative of groups from Shan Ross.  I am happy to do more.  With regard to this being all over, I absolutely do not consider the publication of the report as the end of this matter.  We have a large body of work to do on legislation, policy and the long-term treatment of survivors, specifically with regard to mother and baby homes but also on the wider issue of legacy.  The statement the Government put out in late October listed many of the issues that need to be addressed in the context of legacy.  There is a lot of work still to do and I look forward to my involvement in progressing as much of it as I can within the Department.</p></speech>

I do not doubt his commitment to it.  In reality, some of the groups, particularly survivors of Shan Ross, say even on this issue of commissioning a new dig there has been no engagement, or very little engagement with them.  That is all they are asking for.  Will somebody in the Department or the Department of the Taoiseach let them know whether they are flying against the wind with regard to a new dig?  Please do not leave them hanging.  I ask the Minister to get in touch which Shan Ross survivors again and let the group know whether the Government will commission a new dig and see whether there are new plots on the site.</p></speech>

I will not be able to give a commitment on a new dig until after the report is published because it is important to see what the report says.  A very extensive piece of the report is specifically on Shan Ross and I do not want to give out bits of it.  I do not think it is appropriate to do that to survivors or anybody.  We will get the report and the Deputy and I can go through those sections in detail, and I can also go through the sections in detail with survivors, and we can make relevant decisions on the basis of the knowledge we will have then.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300017#P01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 106 and 120 together.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that, in order to support parents of children born during the strict lockdown measures, the Government intends to extend parents' leave from two weeks to five weeks for each parent of all children born or adopted on or after 1 November 2019.  The Government also intends to extend the period in which parents' leave can be taken up until that child turns two years or, in the case of an adoption, two years after the adoption placement date of the child.  This extension will apply to parents who may have already availed of their existing entitlements.  Heads of a Bill to effect these changes are being drafted in the Department and I intend to bring these to Government next Tuesday for approval.</p>  <p>  Payment of parents' benefit is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and I understand that some adjustments will be needed to the relevant IT systems in that Department and time will be taken to make those changes.  The estimated timescale for the necessary updates being put in place in the pay systems is April 2021  However, I am examining whether it may be possible for parents' leave to be taken in advance of these changes and the benefit claimed retrospectively, once the legislation has been enacted.  I will take advice from parliamentary counsel to ensure that it is possible to draft the legislation in this way.  I will ensure that parents are fully informed of their entitlements in this regard as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have discussed this issue with the view to progressing it as quickly as possible.  The extension to parents' leave and benefit follows a number of advancements in parents' leave in recent years, including the introduction of parents' leave and benefit in 2019 and the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks in September this year for a child under 12 years.</p>  <p>  As part of the same legislation that will deal with the issue of parents' leave, I will also bring proposals on adoptive leave.  This will allow all adopting couples, whether same sex or opposite sex, to have the right to select which of them would be the qualified adopter for the purposes of taking adoptive leave and benefit.  This is an important provision which was committed to in the programme for Government.  The proposed adoptive leave proposals will enable married male same-sex adopting couples to be eligible for adoptive leave.  As it stands at present, the Adoptive Leave Act 2005 allows only an adoptive mother to take adoptive leave.  The new provisions would enable either the adopting mother or the adopting father to be eligible to take adoptive leave once the choice has been made by the couple.</p></speech>

As a parent, I welcome any extension in parental leave or maternity leave, although my children are probably past that stage.  We did see a number of very genuine calls during the Covid pandemic for an extension, perhaps even a once-off emergency extension to maternity leave, for very valid reasons.  People were trying to juggle childcare or get back to work during the pandemic and people felt robbed of certain time in the early years, particularly with extended family.  It would have been fantastic if this had been introduced immediately after the budget.  I seek clarification on several points.  Is the Minister stating he hopes it might be able to be introduced in January and dealt with retrospectively?  Perhaps I understood this incorrectly.  I have another question that I will ask later.</p></speech>

Once the legislation is passed the leave can be granted.  There is a technical issue with regard to the arrangements for payment of the benefit.  The Department of Social Protection is under a lot of pressure at present with the Covid payments.  It is doing a huge amount more than it normally would.  We will try to speed up the process so that benefit can be provided quickly but once the legislation is passed we will try to make it possible for someone to take leave and retrospectively claim the payments once the benefit issue has been sorted.  When I bring the legislation through the House I will be able to provide more clarity on it.  It is to allow the leave to be taken as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

On a further point of clarification, let us say somebody is due to return from maternity leave at the start of December and their child is not two years old yet, are they able to take that additional leave sometime next year or is that not an option?  While that would be welcome, it can be difficult for many people to try to organise childcare and also try to organise their own job, depending on what job they do.  Many people will take some unpaid leave and some parental leave because to take it all together, in reality, is the best way for people to organise this.  It can be difficult, if they have a childcare place, to dip out of that childcare place for a number of weeks of parental leave, and that is why people tend to try to take it together in a block.  Is the Minister saying that if somebody started back to work on 1 December and their child is one year old, they can take that in the next year?</p></speech>

We have to get the legislation passed first.  However, once the legislation is passed, if a parent took their two weeks of original parents leave in January of this year, they will be able to take the additional three weeks leave in the forthcoming year.

The primary focus of the conference was on persons who had suffered abuse as children in industrial and reformatory schools and other residential institutions which cared for children.  In addition to the conference acting as a commemoration, the organisers utilised the opportunity to highlight and advocate for supports for survivors.</p>  <p>  The Facing the Future Together report is a snapshot of the presentations delivered as part of the conference by a number of advocates and experts.  The report clearly identifies the lasting impact of abuse on many survivors of institutional abuse.  It puts forward five key requests for all survivors of institutional abuse: enhanced medical cards and housing supports, easily accessible counselling services for survivors, the provision of advocacy support for survivors in the long term, trauma-informed medical and public service staff and the identification of supports needed by survivors based outside Ireland.  I note that these areas broadly mirror the recommendations of the collaborative forum on mother and baby homes, as published in April 2019, and both pieces of work will inform the State's response to the final report of the commission of investigation once published.</p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that these issues of concern to former residents of institutions relate to the policy and services provided by a number of Departments, most notably those of the Minister for Health, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is clear to me that we need to address these issues through a holistic approach.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has established an interdepartmental working group, on which my Department is represented, specifically to examine the future needs of former residents in the context of the anticipated closure of Caranua.  The Department of Education is circulating the Facing the Future Together report to all the Departments involved in this working group.  I understand the group is due to complete its important work shortly and my Department will fully engage with any of the recommendations which fall within my area of responsibility.</p></speech>

When this report is published, it will have huge consequences for former residents of these homes and their families.  The report points out the types of abuse that the former residents have suffered in these institutions and the consequences it has had for many of those concerned.  How to help them through the difficult times is the big thing at this stage.</p>  <p>  The Minister pointed out the five requests that were identified.  How far along are the arrangements that would meet the requests contained in the report?  There are massive consequences coming down the road for the survivors and they need all the help they can get at this stage.  How far along is the Minister in terms of addressing that?</p></speech>

We are working to ensure that the immediate recommendations are immediately in place at that stage and in particular to ensure there are strong counselling services in place for what is going to be a very difficult time for many survivors and adoptees on the publication of this report.  There are other supports and health services that have been referred to by the commission of investigation in its report and the Government will be publishing, at the time of publication of the report itself, how it is responding to these wider recommendations as well.</p></speech>

One of the biggest issues for survivors is that monetary considerations should not be put in the way of services being put in place for survivors.</p></speech>

One of the points we committed to in the Government statement made in October of this year was to advance a piece of research on the actual impact on survivors, and that is something we are undertaking in conjunction with the HSE.  We have a very clear understanding of the types of impacts that have been faced by survivors, so we can shape the responses that we will be providing to survivors appropriately.  It is particularly important that our response to this group of survivors is appropriate to their particular needs.</p></speech>

Last week, I announced 29 projects around the country that will receive funding to a total amount of &euro;700,000 under the 2020 LGBTI+ community services fund.</p>  <p>  The fund comprises two schemes, one dealing with community services and the other with visibility and inclusion.  The applications received were of a high standard and the application process was extremely competitive.  Some 58 applications were received and, of these, 29 were successful.  Ten of them will receive funding for measures supporting community services for LGBTI+ people, while 19 projects will receive funding to promote visibility and inclusion.</p> <p> The fund provides for initiatives that will promote inclusion, protect rights and improve quality of life and well-being for members of the LGBTI+ community, enabling them to participate fully in Ireland's social, economic, cultural and political life.</p> <p> The initiative is very much in keeping with the aims and objectives of the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy.  We are seeking to achieve tangible outcomes that will transform the lives of LGBTI+ people across Ireland.  The community services fund is designed specifically with that aim in mind.</p> <p> Services and initiatives that work to promote inclusion and visibility for the LGBTI+ community have an increased importance at a time when many LGBTI+ feel disconnected from their community.  I am confident that these projects will be successful in ensuring members continue to feel supported in 2021.</p> <p> In addition to the funding for the current year, I am pleased to confirm that I have increased the funding allocation for LGBTI+ initiatives in 2021, which will increase to &euro;920,000 next year.</p></speech>

It is very welcome news.  I want to raise the issue of LGBTI+ services in the mid-west.  Following the suicide of two men in Limerick in the 1980s, a group of volunteers set up the Gay Switchboard in 1986 in the St. Vincent de Paul building, later joined by the Limerick AIDS Alliance in the same building.  Those two services, with other services in Limerick, merged to form GOSHH, which stands for gender, orientation, sexual health and HIV, in the past decade.  GOSHH provides a vital range of services in the mid-west, including counselling, training and operating as a focal point for the community.  Can the Minister provide additional details on how he plans to support the GOSHH service in the mid-west in the next few years?</p></speech>

I would be aware of the huge amount of work GOSHH does in the mid-west.  It combines a range of services that add a community element to those vital health-based supports.  GOSHH submitted an application under the funding call and I am pleased to be able to say that it received funding for its rainbow development project of &euro;75,500.  It is a significant investment and recognition of the very important work that organisation does in Limerick and in the mid-west.</p>  <p>  On the smaller scale of things, but equally important, I am aware the Croom Family Resource Centre received a grant from the same funding stream of &euro;2,800 for a youth group and caf&eacute;.  While that amount of money is smaller, and the focus might be smaller, they are equally valuable, particularly for the ideas of participation and inclusion of LGBTI+ people, particularly young LGBTI+ people.</p></speech>

I will finish by asking about the status of the gay men's health service.  I know many gay men, trans men and men who have sex with men have been waiting for the resumption of that service since it closed in March.  Can the Minister given any clarity on when services will resume and what he is doing to expedite the opening of that much-needed service?</p></speech>

As we celebrated World AIDS Day on the first day of this month it is an important time to raise the need for this very important health service to be reopened.  It was an issue that was discussed at the steering group of the national LGBTI+ strategy, of which I am a member.  A number of representatives in the group raised their concerns about the continued closure of the gay men's health clinic due to the Covid-19 restrictions.  To update the Deputy, I have written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on that particular point and asked that he would expedite measures to open those services.  They are crucial in the fight against the spread of HIV and in addressing a range of health issues for this community.  I am engaging with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I will continue to do so.  I can provide the Deputy with an update on my engagements with the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

The phrase one hears regularly is that it is a second mortgage.  The Minister outlined very interesting proposals in the<i>Irish Examiner </i>some weeks ago in terms of his reviews of childcare, the status of working conditions within childcare and also the role of the State.  He mentioned that if he were to start again we would have State-funded childcare.  I want to know the Minister's timeline and plans for reducing childcare costs and enhancing the terms and conditions of pay and employment for childcare workers.</p></reply>

I am confident that work under way through First 5, including the national childcare scheme, NCS, and new funding model, will deliver on that.</p>  <p>  Annual investment in early learning and childcare has increased by 141% since 2015.  This funding has been directed towards improving accessibility, quality and affordability.  It has, for example, funded a second year of the free preschool programme.</p>  <p>  The two years of the ECCE programme are considered to save parents who use early learning and care services more than &euro;5,700 on fees.  The increased investment has also enabled the introduction of the national childcare scheme.  The national childcare scheme represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support towards early learning and childcare costs.</p>  <p>  Since it was launched in November 2019, and despite closures and reduced demand caused by Covid-19, 44,000 children have received subsidies under the NCS. Subsidies can be as high as &euro;225 per child, per week.</p>  <p>  The OECD's 2017 Faces of Joblessness report compared early learning and childcare costs for lone parents before and after the NCS.  It found that the NCS will bring net costs down from being the highest across the OECD, to the 11th highest.  This analysis did not take account of NCS enhancements in budgets 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>Notwithstanding this progress, the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare remains unacceptably high for parents.</p>  <p>  In addition to further investment, and First 5 has committed to a doubling of investment, a key project to address affordability is the development of a new funding model.  An expert group is leading on this work, with a central objective being to consider a mechanism to control fees.</p>  <p>  Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the group's work.  The research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the reform of the funding model in Ireland.  Recommendations from this group are expected next autumn.  Bearing in mind that the budget takes place in autumn, I contacted the group when I took over as Minister and suggested that we might support some of its initial key proposals earlier next year, towards the end of the summer, to shape what we were bringing forward for budget 2022, and it agreed to try to bring forward some of its final work.  It has published very interesting work on models to control fees and how funding would be targeted, in particular in disadvantaged areas.  That research is on the First 5 website and it is available to read should any Deputy choose to do so.  There are about five detailed research papers and I would advise any Deputy for whom this is a particular issue to go to the First 5 website and read some of that research.  I am happy to engage with all Deputies about this issue.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the progress of recent years by the Minister and the previous Minister, Katherine Zappone.  However, that burden is still very significant for families and parents across the country.  The Minister mentioned the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme but the difficulty with that scheme is that it does not operate outside term time and does not work for many parents.</p>  <p>  We also have to address the issue of the workforce, not in terms of the workforce development plan but a workforce that is properly paid for the kind of qualifications they are now bringing to the services.  They are minding, caring and nurturing our most precious resource, which is our children.  We have to acknowledge that in terms of working with providers but also with State agencies to pay them appropriately without having to pass on that burden to parents who are already paying over the odds, in terms of the OECD figure the Minister mentioned, for childcare costs.  When will parents will be able to see some specific actions or a reduction in their fees?  When does he anticipate that his budgetary decisions will be reflected in fees?</p></speech>

Needless to say I agree with all of it but it is important that I declare an interest, not only as the father of two young children, including one currently in an ECCE scheme, but also as someone who is married to a Montessori teacher.  It is not an underestimation to say that during the general election last February, which seems like ancient history now, this was the No. 1 issue in my constituency.</p> <p>I imagine the demographics in the Minister's constituency are not too different.  It was significant for the Minister too.  Addressing the combination of cost and the lack of services and, crucially, as Deputy Calleary said, making sure that providers and staff working in these facilities are respected are important.  Most people working as Montessori teachers and in childcare have level 8 and level 9 qualifications and deserve to be paid accordingly and, crucially, to have that security.  It is unfair that they can work for nine months of the year and have to go on jobseeker's payments for two months of the year.</p></speech>

With that money, we have three core aims, which are affordability for parents; quality for the children in these services, which means ensuring that childcare professionals are well paid so that they continue to enhance and grow the care they are providing; and keeping services sustainable.  When we see the amount of money we are providing and we see the dissatisfaction from parents, which the Deputies both spoke about, and when we hear the concerns about providers and the concerns of childcare professionals, we are not delivering on those objectives.  That is why I am doing this research.  Sometimes people roll their eyes at another piece of research.  We have acted in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner on childcare up until this point and we need some firm research on which to base the decisions we make in the next and subsequent budgets about where the extra money goes and how we can deliver on those three objectives.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about the three key areas and I agree with everything he says.  We need to look at the geographic constraints, with the costs in certain parts of the country, the requirements such as where a child cannot be put in for a half day, it has to be a full day, or quite simply the place is not there.  The waiting lists for childcare in my constituency are through the roof.  It is extremely worrying.  It is not just putting a burden on the families and the parents, but on the grandparents, employers and the providers themselves.  The extra work that childcare professionals have put in during these stressful months needs to be recognised.  When the Montessoris and cr&egrave;ches were closed, they did more than just FaceTime the kids.  They did drive-through Hallowe'en events and other wonderful things.  We need not just to recognise that but to have a direct resolution and we need it soon.</p></speech>

It is about putting in place a funding model that supports new services and some of the organisational infrastructure that can co-ordinate that.  We have city and county childcare committees at the moment.  They do great work.  The idea of identifying core demand in a particular geographic area and being able to act on it is not a capacity that we have right now.  We are looking at how we target money to the right geographic areas to make sure that we are delivering the necessary services.  We need to do that work.

It is IPAS's policy to prioritise the movement of family units from emergency accommodation when suitable accommodation appropriate to their needs becomes available.  In addition, IPAS is working towards all families being in some form of own-door accommodation which will meet their needs more appropriately than congregated accommodation.</p>  <p>  Residents are generally provided with at least ten days of notice before being moved to new accommodation.  The letter of transfer is issued in English.  However, where a person makes a request for this letter in another language, this can be arranged.  A confidential freephone telephone support service funded by my Department, but operated by the Jesuit refugee service, may also assist residents in this regard.  I will consider whether further measures are needed to translate this information into languages other than English.</p>  <p>  While it is appreciated that a move to a new home is difficult for anyone, particularly where a family may have started to establish connections within a community, most moves occur as part of a wider programme aimed at ending the use of temporary accommodation as recommended by the advisory group on the provision of support, including accommodation, to persons in the international protection process.  While it would be preferable to give a longer lead-in time prior to a move, the limited availability of accommodation and the need to make space available to new arrivals mean that moves to more suitable accommodation must be done quickly.</p></speech>

The family, who I will not name, lived in direct provision in Wicklow.  They were offered own-door accommodation in Galway.  The way in which this was handled was, unfortunately, problematic.  I am not blaming the Minister personally.  The family ended up being extremely distressed as they did not speak English and therefore did not understand why they were being moved.  Eventually, after a number of days, a letter was provided to them in their own language, which eased their concerns by a small amount, but at no point was a translator provided to explain why they were moving.  This family has come from a situation where people being moved by government has a much more serious connotation and they were understandably distressed.  It required the intervention of a schoolteacher known to the family, a local Deputy and a local county councillor to get information to this family.  As we move towards ending direct provision, which I know we both support, I encourage the Minister's Department to work on communication with people in this situation to make the transition from these centres as seamless as possible.</p></speech>

It was a situation where there was a good story, with a family being moved from emergency accommodation in a hotel to own-door accommodation in another location, but they did not fully understand the positive nature of the move because of the lack of translation.  I am aware of that and understand that we need to improve our engagement with residents, particularly where the English language is an issue.</p> <p>We have the Jesuit refugee service, representatives of which I have met recently.  It does great work in supporting families and individuals in direct provision, particularly those for whom English is not their first language.  I take the Deputy's point on board.  We will consider how we can better support the provision of translation services to residents in the international protection process.</p></speech>

Throughout this pandemic and long before it, our nurses and midwives have been our heroes and the heroes of our health service.  Since the outbreak of the virus they have put their own health and the health of their families at risk.  That has not deterred them from serving the Irish people.  A number of healthcare workers have tragically lost their lives in doing so.  With more than 3,000 health workers having contracted the virus during this period, and with our hospitals and health services put under pressure like never before, student nurses and midwives have stepped up and into the breach.  They have served their patients, worked alongside hospital staff and provided excellent care in difficult circumstances.  The Irish people are proud of them and of their service.  They have been taken for granted by the Government.</p>  <p>  Last night, the Government voted against a motion to pay student nurses and midwives for the work they do.  Many of these student nurses and midwives are asked to work for no pay.  That is not good enough.  Nobody other than the Government believes it is good enough.  It will not be lost on the public that at the same time that these workers are being asked to go without pay as they work on the front line, Deputies in this House have been offered two pay rises in the last year on top of their very generous salaries.  What message does that send out to front-line workers, to our student nurses and midwives and to the Irish people?  Student nurses and midwives, like all those on the front line, have kept our health services together.  The patients in our hospitals who receive care from our student nurses do not see them as student nurses but rightly see them as the people at the end or side of their beds who are caring for them, helping them to recuperate and providing them with the essential services.  Hospital managers, consultants and specialists would not have been able to do their jobs if they had not been supported by these student nurses.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives are not being paid and no one can stand over this.  The reality is that these student nurses and midwives are being taken advantage of, exploited and taken for granted.  They deserve so much more.  They do not need claps, slogans or platitudes but they deserve to be paid.  We asked them to go to the front line to put their lives and their families&rsquo; health at risk, and to step up, so the least that can be done is that they are rewarded with decent and fair pay.  The Irish people cannot understand why the T&aacute;naiste and his Government are against pay for student nurses at the time of a pandemic and a time when they have stepped up to serve the Irish people and their patients.  The payment of the student nurses is a litmus test for this Government and of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to fairness for front-line workers.  It tells us so much about what this Government stands for and whose side it is on.  </p>  <p>  My question for the T&aacute;naiste is simple.  Will he revisit the issue and change the Government&rsquo;s decision to ensure that student nurses in their first, second and third years should be paid and that other nurses should be paid fairly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300021#T00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Throughout the course of 2020 and this pandemic we have seen nurses and midwives doing an extraordinary job in our health service, as indeed have all healthcare workers, including doctors, therapists, cleaners, porters, people working in our laboratories and people working in administration, without whom no front-line worker could do his or her job.  It has been an excellent and professional job.  It is not fair to say that they have been taken for granted.  We have seen a very significant increase in staffing levels across our health service to respond to the pandemic.  There have also been two pay rises this year, albeit modest ones, in March and in October.  In most cases, workers in the public health service would have received a third pay rise in 2020 in the form of an increment.</p>  <p>  There are many students in Ireland.  The vast majority of students in Ireland do not get paid, including teaching students.  Exceptions are made, for example for garda&iacute; in training and for apprentices.  Indeed, nurses are among those exceptions and among the few students who are paid.  They are paid for their preregistration year, in recognition of the fact that the work they do then is unsupervised and would have to be done and paid for if they did not do it.  As the House will be aware, nursing and midwifery students are required to complete 45 weeks of training in total across years one, two and three and for a semester in year four.  This is a supernumerary clinical placement that they do to meet the standards and to complete courses.  Supernumerary clinical placement is the optimal clinical learning environment.  This places students on the front line in a learning capacity as an addition to the workforce.  It is fully supervised for certain periods of the year during each year of training.  This ensures that students can safely learn, observe and take part in a wide variety of clinical skills acquisition required for qualification.</p>  <p>  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and students have raised a number of issues around loss of income due to fewer opportunities for part-time work during the pandemic, particularly in nursing homes, together with HR issues in respect of difficulties with rosters, and issues also around overall student well-being, including the increased risk of getting Covid-19 which is a real concern for all of us.</p>  <p>  The matter of student pay is also being considered.  A review of student allowances is under way and will be completed shortly.  It is intended that this outcome, once negotiated with the unions, will take effect from September 2021.</p></speech>

He talks about pay rises but the core of this issue is that student nurses do not get paid for their work.  The T&aacute;naiste talks about supervised work as if this is all normal times.  This is not normal times.  Doctors, consultants and care assistants can see what student nurses are doing.  They have stepped up and into the breach and have put themselves and their families at risk.  They are on the front line.  They are our heroes, the T&aacute;naiste's Government believes they should not be paid for their work.  This is something that the Government should not be standing over.  The public is angry at this because many people believed that our front-line workers were being paid and rightly so.  The penny has dropped and it is now the case that this Government does not value the work that these student nurses are doing in the first number of years.</p>  <p>  While the T&aacute;naiste speaks of reviews, what is needed here is a commitment, one that was given by the previous Minister for Health and is now broken by this Government, which was that student nurses will be paid.  Can the T&aacute;naiste stand up and defend the position while those who are working in our hospitals as we speak-----</p></speech>

Praise, applause and kind words do not pay any bills or butter any parsnips.  I am very aware of that.  I am as aware of it as the Deputy is.  That is why we have ensured our healthcare workers in Ireland are better paid than is the case in many European countries, such as the United Kingdom and in Northern Ireland where they went on strike not very long ago and where the Deputy&rsquo;s party is in office.  That is why we ensured that all healthcare workers received two pay rises this year, albeit modest ones, one in March and one in October.</p> <p>This was not the case in other countries.  In many cases, there has been a third pay rise, in the form of an increment, for those on a salary scale.  Even though most students are not paid in Ireland, we do pay student nurses and midwives in their preregistration year in recognition of the work they do and its value.  That is why the matter is currently being considered, as I said in my earlier remarks.  A full review of student allowances is under way and it will be completed shortly.  There will be discussions with the representatives, and any changes will come into effect in September 2021.</p></speech>

I have been doing so in a non-political way, maybe to dial up our preparations for this collectively.  The Irish Times reports today that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is bringing a memo to the Government next Tuesday on who will be prioritised for vaccination.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste briefed his parliamentary party in this regard.  However, the Taoiseach said to me on Tuesday and Wednesday that we would have to wait for the report of the expert review group on Friday.  Therefore, I am confused.  Which date is it?  Who is leading on this?  Will we know about priorities on Tuesday or will it be on Friday, from the MacCraith expert report?  The Cabinet subcommittee is rightly making decisions but so too are the MacCraith expert group, the National Immunisation Office, which does fantastic work, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NPHET, the HSE and, obviously, the Department.  I am re-stressing a question: who is in control?  Who is making the decisions?  Who has seniority as regards decision-making?  It has to be the Cabinet but we are all aware of the issues that arose when both NPHET and the Government made statements.  I have just mentioned a long list of groups that all have a massive role to play, but we must not have confusion.  We need one person in charge.  I repeat that to the T&aacute;naiste today.</p>  <p>  I have asked a plethora of questions but I want to focus on three.  About a year and a half ago, there was quite a lot of controversy over the public service card and related issues and concerns.  How are we going to manage data with respect to vaccines?  The only unique identification code is the PPS number.  Hanging off that, in a new database that will have to be built, presumably through the National Immunisation Office, will be a large amount of information on underlying illnesses and personal details.  Are we prepared for that?  Is new, emergency legislation required?</p>  <p>  Second, if a company such as Intel decides privately that it is going to buy the vaccine to give it to its workers, will it be allowed to do so?  This goes for any company; I just picked one out of the air.  The issue is one of public versus private.  Should vaccination not be based on need rather than whether someone can pay for it?  Do we need legislation on this?  Will the State control how the vaccine is given out?  That is an important question.</p>  <p>  Public health officials must play a massive role in the roll-out of the vaccination programme but they are going on strike on 14 January, 21 January and 22 January because their pay is 48% less than that of consultants.  How is the Government going to deal with this considering the role they will have in the roll-out of the vaccination programme over the next few months?  I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste answered those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300022#U00300"><p>Those are valid and good questions and I do not necessarily have answers to them all.  The Deputy deserves answers to them and I will make sure he gets them.  To answer the questions I can answer, the Government is in control.  The Cabinet is in control and makes decisions based on advice, as it should.  The Minister for Health is the lead Minister when it comes to the vaccine programme, as he is for every other vaccine programme and as he should be.</p>  <p>  The task force will report on 11 December, I believe.  It is chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith.  It is in charge of purchases, delivery, administration, IT systems, communication and all such things associated with the vaccine.  It is a really good group and there is no better person than Professor MacCraith to be head of it.  Everyone is at the table, including officials from my Department and IDA Ireland because of our engagement with industry and the companies that developed and made the vaccine.</p>  <p>  As far as I know &mdash; I am fairly sure of this &mdash; prioritisation is not a matter for the task force; it is a matter for the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  That is the body that makes these kinds of decisions on other vaccines.  We expect a report from it very soon on the order of prioritisation.  I do not believe it will be rocket science.  Everyone understands that those who will be prioritised include those who need the vaccine the most, including healthcare workers, because they are at greater risk and because there is a risk that they will spread the virus to patients, and residents of nursing homes, those who are older and those with chronic diseases.  Logically, for reasons I do not need to explain to anyone in this House, those are the groups that will be prioritised.  Perhaps people who work in high-risk environments, such as meat factories, will be also prioritised.</p>  <p>  There will be no charge for the vaccine.  It will be paid for through taxation.  It will be ensured that those who need it the most get it first.  We have an option for purchase already with five or six of the companies that have developed the vaccine.  We are also providing an indemnity to companies, which we must do given that this is a very new vaccine.  We are indemnifying the companies that produce it, as are other member states.</p>  <p>  I do not know what private enterprises intend to do.  I am aware that they sometimes buy the flu vaccine and provide it as a benefit to their staff.  This is unlikely on this occasion, first of all because they have not entered into pre-purchase agreements with the production companies.  The Deputy should bear in mind that private enterprises would not be covered by the State indemnity and would be taking on the risk themselves.  If the Deputy&rsquo;s question is whether we should make it illegal for companies to buy the vaccine for their staff, we have not considered that yet.</p></speech>

I appreciate his honesty.  We do need to decide because private vaccination is an issue.  Considering that we must control the process by which the vaccine programme is rolled out, my question is very legitimate.  I would appreciate it if it were considered by the Government because it would require legislation.</p>  <p>  On data management, we may need emergency legislation.  We will support it.  The D&aacute;il will be sitting for only one more week this year.  Is there an issue, therefore?  The data being collated will be intense.  We have had issues with data in the past.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please consider this?</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I hear on the radio in the morning that many events are being planned.  Longitude is being planned.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and I would like to get to concerts sometime next year.

On the issue of companies providing the vaccine privately, it is a matter we will have to examine.  We certainly would not want it to undermine in any way our programme of vaccination, which will be free of charge and based on need.  It might be the case, however, that the company that produces the vaccine will want to vaccinate its own staff.  We would have to think long and hard about preventing it from doing so considering that it developed the vaccine.</p>  <p>  On whether legislation will be needed for the vaccine database, I do not know the answer.  I will check it out.  Secondary legislation, rather than primary legislation, may be required.  If it is primary, it will have to come to the House soon.  I will certainly raise that with the Minister for Health, if not immediately, by the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that there are now tickets on sale for some major events that we all hope will go ahead next summer.  My advice is that there is no guarantee that those events will go ahead.  It might be some time yet before we can attend matches, concerts and mass gatherings.  I hope it will be possible in the summer.  That is far from sure at this point.  Under the law, it is possible for companies organising events to cancel and reschedule them.  They do not have to refund the cost of a ticket.  People buying a ticket should be aware that they are not guaranteed a refund.  They might find the event is rescheduled.</p></speech>

As Minister responsible for energy, I was instrumental in bringing about a transition from peat but, under my plan, there was to be an orderly winding down of peat harvesting up to 2026.  In the next 15 days, however, two of the biggest peat-fired power plants in the world will stop burning peat and close.  The west Offaly power station is set to close tomorrow week and Lough Ree power station is set to close seven days later, on 18 December.  This decision will bring forward the closures by a decade and will have very serious economic consequences right across the midland counties.  It is equivalent in scale to the closure of the likes of Google in Dublin city.</p> <p>That is why, 18 months ago, I proposed that the Government bring forward and front-load a bog restoration programme to protect existing jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na in the short term, pending the reconfiguration of the company.  I am glad that the Government took up my proposal which resulted in the Cabinet approval last week of a &euro;108 million large-scale peatland restoration project by Bord na M&oacute;na that will create 350 jobs and protect the jobs of many permanent employees.</p> <p> However, there is a lack of clarity for the 280 seasonal workers.  Will they be re-employed?  Under what terms and conditions will they be re-employed?  Will their annual earnings be significantly curtailed?  These are key questions not only for the staff and their families but also for the wider local economy that is so dependent on the spending power of these employees.  Will the T&aacute;naiste provide clarity to these employees on their future prospects within the State company, Bord na M&oacute;na, in advance of the closure of the two power plants?</p> <p> What are the future plans for the power stations themselves?  It seems that despite concerns being expressed by the Government's just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, the ESB is determined to demolish both plants.  Mr. Mulvey, in his most recent report, stated, "On the visit of the Just Transition team to both Shannonbridge ... and Lanesborough ... we were impressed by the pristine state of the power stations."  These two power plants have at least ten years of operation left.  They have already been paid for by electricity customers throughout the country.  If they are demolished, it is effectively wasting &euro;176 million of electricity customers' money.  This is not in the best interests of local staff, the local economy or the country as a whole and electricity customers in particular who will foot the bill for the demolition of both plants and have to pay for alternative technology to provide replacement stability on the electricity grid.</p></speech>

They have provided well-paid and secure jobs that, in turn, create other jobs because of spending in the local economy by people who work in the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  That is going to change as we make the transition from brown to green and from a carbon-based economy to a zero-carbon economy.  That does not mean it cannot be changed for the better, including in the midlands.  That is why the Government is committed to a just transition and why we have dedicated significant funding to the workers, companies and communities affected by the closure of the peat-fired stations and the end of peat harvesting by Bord na M&oacute;na.  This will ensure significant job retention in Bord na M&oacute;na, as well as job creation efforts and new business opportunities for the wider region.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Naughten acknowledged, just last week the Government set aside &euro;108 million for Bord na M&oacute;na's large-scale peatlands restoration project, which will secure 350 jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na and contribute to our target of being carbon neutral by 2050.</p>  <p>  I will have to check on the specific question that the Deputy asked about seasonal employees.  I expect that they will still be needed because more work is done in the good weather and it is necessary to cover leave arrangements.  I will check on that for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The first progress report of the just transition commissioner was published on 22 May.  That reflects a comprehensive engagement with relevant stakeholders in the midlands, setting out for the workers, their families and communities the analysis of the challenges facing the region arising from the accelerated exit from peat harvesting.  The report contains important recommendations which will guide job creation efforts and create new opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the midlands.  Following the programme for Government commitment, a feasibility study into establishing a green energy hub using the existing infrastructure at the West Offaly and Lough Ree sites has now commenced.  This study is being overseen by a steering group chaired by the ESB and includes representatives of the Department of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the relevant local authorities and other stakeholders.  We expect that the work of this group will conclude by the end of this year having regard to the timelines required to meet the company's planning permission obligations on both sites.</p></speech>

The reality is that &euro;38 is being wasted in lost operational capacity for every single family in this country, who will be paying for it through their electricity bills.  There are also the demolition costs of the two power plants and the replacement electricity reinforcement costs.  All of those costs will be footed by families throughout the country.</p>  <p>  There are three separate power generation proposals of which I am aware, including the conversion of the power plants to hydrogen fuel power.  That would be the first in the world if it were to happen.</p>  <p>  We have seen the mistakes that were made in the past with the demolition of our two sugar plants in Mallow and Carlow, which I argued against at the time.  Do not let us repeat the mistakes that we made in our sugar industry.  Do not let the two power plants be demolished until all possible alternatives have been fully explored.</p></speech>

Prior to any development opportunity taking place, the ESB must satisfy the legal obligation to remediate the existing sites.  In addition, I understand that the power plant equipment cannot be used for any purpose beyond December 2020 because neither the planning consents nor environmental licences cover any such issue.  Notwithstanding this, the ESB is committed to the future use of the sites, and a feasibility study is under way to assess how this valuable infrastructure might be used in the longer term, taking account of its location, the infrastructure that is in place and the future requirements of the electricity market.</p></speech>

Mr. Gary Kearney wrote to me in October and asked for my assistance in bringing about the campaign.  My friend and well-known outstanding disability rights activist, Mr. Frank Larkin, had been due to help Gary with the campaign for Donegal, but sadly Frank passed away earlier this year.  I acknowledge Frank Larkin and the great advocacy work he did in his lifetime for persons with disabilities.  I also thank Mr. Liam Ward, director of services in Donegal County Council, for supporting this Purple Lights campaign this year.</p><p>In the spirit of nothing about us without us, I wanted to give persons with disabilities an opportunity to have their say.  Last Friday, I launched a survey and want to read to the T&aacute;naiste some of the overwhelming number of responses that I have received.  I thank Mr. Miche&aacute;l Kelliher for signing my short video about the survey.  One response read:</p> <blockquote> 	Disability services are working at reduced capacity due to the fact that HSE staff are being taken from these services to accommodate the need for additional staff for Covid wards/testing centres etc. </blockquote>  <p>Another read:</p> <blockquote> 	You don't notice what you have lost until it's gone.  For those of us with an acquired disability there is a continuous and overwhelming desire to 'get back to where we were'.  Even after decades we remember what it is like to negotiate the world without pain; the pre-planning of journeys; anticipating distances; nodding to the looks of sympathy when the pain is visible - yet wishing they didn't acknowledge at all. </blockquote>  <p>Another read:</p> <blockquote> 	I&rsquo;m a disabled driver living in rural Ireland no transport no choice.  I work in my nearest town &amp;amp; had to borrow to purchase my car.  I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones, I&rsquo;m earning a salary and can afford to pay a loan.  It&rsquo;s demoralising to watch this government allocate millions to bail out the FAI and most recently grant millions to the greyhound industry but if you have a disability you are not supported. </blockquote>  <p>Another read: </p> <blockquote> 	As someone who acquired disability in my 20s and now a wheelchair user I think that is what will surprise people most.  Most people assume if this happens you will be supported by government in fact you are not. </blockquote>  <p>Another read:</p> <blockquote> 	There needs to be legislation introduced to force businesses to become accessible and have appropriate toilet facilities.  This is a human rights and dignity issue.  Imagine going for a meal with a group of people and you have no use of toilet facilities.  What do you do?  Limit fluid intake?  Go home early? </blockquote>  <p>Another read:</p> <blockquote> 	Well on behalf of my wee man, I would like to highlight the complete lack of consideration given to disabled toilet facilities in public places, i.e. hotels, restaurants etc.  The bare minimal amount of space is given.  Is it too much to ask for proper spacious bathroom facilities for our disabled folk? </blockquote> <p>Another read: &quot;Silent pain&rsquo;s the worst.&quot;<br/><br/>In my #YourDayYourSay survey, I asked the question: &ldquo;As a person with a disability... what is positive about being in Ireland?&rdquo;  The responses included: &ldquo;The doctors&rdquo;; &ldquo;Good doctors but no help from government.&rdquo;; &ldquo;There is very little positive.  Everything has to be fought for.&rdquo;; &ldquo;All negative.&rdquo;; and &quot;Honestly I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;<br/><br/>I asked them what needs to change.  One response read:</p><blockquote>	They need to act not just sign Conventions and then ignore the principles. They know the disabled are stuck at home &amp;amp; couldn't even get to a protest which makes the State all the more hypocritical. </blockquote> <p>Another read: &quot;To treat all our children equally and provide the same opportunities to all including those with additional needs[.]&quot;<br/><br/>I will ask for something that the Government can do.  Will the Government ratify the optional protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities so that persons with disabilities can make complaints to the UN if they want to?</p></speech>

I thank him for raising them and I would be interested in seeing a copy of that survey if he wants to pass it on to my office later on.</p>  <p>  When I was elected Taoiseach three years or so ago, one of the things I said we would do on the first day I was elected was ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It had not been ratified for decades by previous governments and there was always an excuse as to why it could not be done.  I said it had to be done and, working with Finian McGrath, we got it done.  I am glad we got it done.</p>  <p>  It was always our intention to sign the optional protocol as well and it still is but we have to do it at the right time, when we are ready, and make sure we do it in a way that is meaningful.  Many countries ratify conventions and it stops there.  We do it the other way around in Ireland.  We make sure we can meet the standards of the convention before we sign, which we did when it came to that convention.  The same will apply when it comes to signing the optional protocol.</p>  <p>  It is right to acknowledge that much progress has been made in recent years, such as increases in the disability allowance and changes to make it easier for people with disabilities to take part in the workplace, particularly around keeping the free travel pass and the medical card if they take up work and if they can.  Remote working will be a real opportunity for people with disabilities to get into the workforce who could not before.  There has been a huge increase in resources for special education.  Not that long ago, there were almost no special needs assistants.  Now we have 15,000, 16,000 or 17,000, I think.  These are huge numbers and are much needed.  It has really transformed education for people with special needs.  The same applies to special classes in schools.  There are hundreds where there used to be a handful.</p>  <p>  In terms of spend, which the Deputy mentioned, the spend across the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Health runs to many billions of euro.  I think it may be as much as &euro;5 billion a year.  That is many multiples of what we spend helping the FAI or greyhounds and rightly so because people with disabilities in this country are numerous, important and much more valuable than those other things, important as they are.</p></speech>

Other countries ratified the convention straight away and it may have set a benchmark for them to make sure they could achieve it.  I would love to think we will ratify the optional protocol.  What is the timeframe for that?  I would like to know because I do not believe the Government intends to do it and, unfortunately, I do not believe people with disabilities think the Government intends to do it either, which is sad.</p><p>We know the budget for disability services and the work that is being done for persons with disabilities but it is not enough.  There are people being left behind, ignored and neglected.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to listen to their voices.  I will conclude with some of their voices:</p> <blockquote> 	People with disabilities are human too, we have feelings, we have needs, we deserve respect for what we live with and [live] through. </blockquote>  <p>Another says:</p> <blockquote> 	Children and families are falling through ruptures, not cracks [in relation to the assessment of need].  A two year wait for Occupational Therapy for a child is just not ok. </blockquote>  <p>Those are the kind of things we need to respond to, and to do so properly.</p></speech>

There are many countries, for example, in eastern Europe, that nobody would argue have better conditions or services for people with disabilities than Ireland and they signed the convention ten and 20 years ago because they just signed it.  Our approach has always been different to every convention of the UN.  We do not just sign it.  We make sure we meet or at least approach the standards and then we sign it.  That is what we did in the last Government.  We took the decision that we would do it when it was not done by previous government, and to reach that standard.  The same will apply to the optional protocol, which it is our intention to sign.</p>  <p>  Among the commitments in the programme for Government, which we are driving forward, are reducing the waiting times for assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005, which are unacceptably long; completing the establishment of progressing disability services for children and young people aged zero to 18; and enshrining disability rights by finalising the legislation required to make sure we are in line with the convention.</p></speech>

I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste a fortnight ago here in the D&aacute;il.  It entails shocking cases of delays and misdiagnoses.  I have also written to the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, twice in the space of those two weeks asking that action be taken in relation to this report.  I still await a reply.  The women and their families are waiting on answers and on progress.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said a fortnight ago on the floor of the D&aacute;il that he would read the report and look at the recommendations.  He said he would speak to the Minister for Health about the report.  I ask again whether the T&aacute;naiste has had that chance to read the report into the gynaecology services at LUH.  Is he mindful of the fact that that review talks about how women lost their lives as a result of the delays and misdiagnoses?  Has he discussed the report and recommendations with the Minister for Health?  Will the Government commit to a wider independent review of services at LUH because the people of Donegal are waiting for answers?</p></speech>

The State owns 71% of the bank.  My party was the only party in the State that voted against bailing the banks out ten years ago or more.  AIB had profits of &euro;1.25 billion in 2018 and &euro;500 million in 2019.  Now it is engaged in a vanity project of buying back Goodbody Stockbrokers, which it sold during the crash.  It is also charging serious fees to people who have less than &euro;2,500 in their bank accounts and will not engage with the Financial Services Union.

That is exactly what happened to the staff at Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and other banks which were allowed to fail.</p>  <p>  The banking sector is changing, like many sectors.  It is moving online, being digitalised and automated.  That is happening in the real world around us.  The vast majority of people no longer set foot in a bank branch, whereas people used to regularly go into bank branches.  That has changed and the sector has to adapt to that.  I had a good meeting with the Financial Services Union a few weeks ago to discuss some of the changes.  One thing they have suggested is a banking forum being established to think through what the future of banking services will look like in the country.  I am taking that up with the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

Keltoi is under the management of community healthcare organisation, CHO 9 addiction services and was temporarily closed to create an isolation unit for Covid-positive people.  That the staff have no idea when they will be returning to Keltoi is causing them significant stress.</p> <p> Recently, it has become clear that the people who have been placed in the centre to isolate have come via section 39 services, for example, the Coolmine service.  Since Keltoi is a HSE facility, this does not seem right.  Covid-positive people can be accommodated in facilities such as Citywest to allow the Keltoi centre to reopen.</p> <p> A recent review of the Keltoi service has highlighted the specialist work it carries out.

Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett was not present at the time.  As he knows, the majority of students are not paid.  However, nursing students are paid in their pre-registration year in recognition of the fact that they are among a small group of students who do valuable work for which they should be paid.  A review of their wider allowances and remuneration is under way.  It will be discussed with their union.  Any change that is made will come into effect in September 2021.  What Deputy Boyd Barrett did last night was pure party politics.</p></speech>

When is it expected to be published and tabled in the House?  I have been contacted about a recent High Court decision by Mr. Justice McDonald concerning debt-for-equity swaps in personal insolvency cases, which has effectively excluded thousands of distressed mortgage holders from achieving a solution that allows them to retain their homes.  Will this situation be addressed in the proposed legislation?  I want the T&aacute;naiste's assurance that the Bill is not only for the benefit of creditors and banks, but addresses serious issues for struggling mortgage holders.

The Government set up a task force under Ms Alison Harvey.  I am asking that it be expanded to include hard-working groups in the town's hinterland.  The Great National Hotels group is selling off the golf course in Ballykisteen at Limerick Junction.  The T&aacute;naiste has often been in its hotel there.  If the course goes, the hotel will go.  It is a focal point and important infrastructure in the region.  We have nothing else like it.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, to whom I have written, to intervene?  The golf course could be kept.  The captain of the golf club is Mr. Michael Lynch.  Several groups want to retain this amenity.  We are in the Covid pandemic and golf is an outdoor sport.  The course is used considerably.  We need the golf course and the hotel.  We cannot lose this valuable piece of infrastructure.  Will the T&aacute;naiste intervene, please?</p></speech>

Maybe I have, but people over the past couple of weeks have been placing me in all sorts of places I have not been.  Perhaps this is one of the latest examples, but that does not matter.</p>  <p>  The task force has been established and its work is under way.  Whether it can be extended to include the wider area is something about which I would have to speak to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke.  I will do so.</p></speech>

In Donegal, they have been asking me whether the supports they and their staff received while in lockdown would continue if they chose not to open at this time.

For example, staff who have been laid off will retain the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, regardless of what their employers decide to do in terms of reopening.  They have to be available for work, but that payment will not be taken away from them while they are laid off.</p>  <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, is based on a company's turnover and to what extent that turnover is down.  The weekly Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, payment is only paid if the company is required to close.  If it is allowed to open but chooses to stay closed, it will no longer receive the weekly payment.  We are giving an extra week's payment to all businesses that reopen in recognition of the fact that they need a little extra cash flow for their first week open.</p></speech>

It was appreciated.  This is now December 2020.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme at the time was not fit for purpose.  Thanks to the good work done by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, the requirement for a prior complaint was seen to be nonsense, and due to the failure to address a number of people's issues, it was removed.  My understanding is that the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme is still being reviewed.  When will the review be concluded?  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that students who attended the Creagh Lane school in my constituency of Limerick City, which I have raised in the D&aacute;il a number of times, will be included in the review?</p></speech>

In Mr. Justice O'Neill's review of 19 cases that had not been successful in their applications to the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme, he concluded that 13 were entitled to a payment from the scheme.  Sixteen offers of payment have now been made.  We appreciate that some people who did not apply to the scheme in the belief that they would not have been eligible would have been eligible under the O'Neill principles.  We are reviewing the scheme.  An extensive engagement between the Department of Education and the Attorney General's office is ongoing.  The idea is to amend the scheme and reopen it - technically it would be a new scheme - for people who ought to have received a payment but did not or who did not apply because they did not believe they would receive a payment.</p> <p>We have not brought that to a conclusion yet but it has been discussed.

I know that is not always the case, but it certainly should be.  I am surprised to hear what Deputy Andrews has to say because the amount of funding put into home care was increased by 40% in the past couple of years and is being increased again in 2021.  While some people may not need it anymore, those who do should continue to receive it.

They have six weeks of trading ahead and tens of millions of euro will be collected by the Arcadia Group and yet the workers have already been told they will only get the statutory redundancy.</p>  <p>  Today, we learned that Debenhams was sold to a vulture group for &euro;600 million, and yet it collected &euro;1.2 billion in profit before closing down and leaving the workers with nothing.

It is simplistic to put these things down to matters of company law or which fund bought what business.  The truth is that retail is changing.  People have moved online.  Last week in Ireland, more money was spent online than physically.  As a result, retail is going to transform before our eyes.  It was happening anyway.  There was inevitability that we would see more people shopping online.  That means the number of people who work in high street stores will fall.  No ideology or political party will change that reality.  It has been happening before our eyes for many years now and has been accelerated by the pandemic.  This is happening regardless of the ownership structure of companies.</p>  <p>  Under our law, if made redundant, people have a statutory right, a legal entitlement, to two weeks per year of service, up to a certain limit.  Anything agreed beyond that can only be honoured if the money is there to fund it.  I cannot say in this situation whether the money will be there to fund it but, generally, when a company goes bust, it leaves many debts and many people are owed money.  In most cases, people only get a proportion of what they are owed.</p></speech>

On top of this, we heard at the agriculture and the marine committee on Tuesday there will be a 5% decrease in white fish fleet fishing next year, which will mainly hit fishermen from Castletownbere in the south west.  This is on top of successive Irish Governments being unable to get lucrative bluefin tuna quota while our European counterparts are securing ample amounts of quotas.</p>  <p>  During negotiations with the Government, I pleaded with the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan for a stand-alone Minister with responsibility for fisheries, which fell on deaf ears.  We are now seeing the total destruction of Irish fishing rights to Irish fish in our sea.  In negotiations last week, Mr. Michel Barnier was offering 80% more fish to the UK, which was rejected.

As they do not receive any State funding, families go through the burden of trying to raise costs through GoFundMe pages.  Were it not for the help of family and friends, we would see these beautiful kids growing up without a companion.</p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider funding for the likes of My Canine Companion and other organisations that do great work so families do not have the burden of raising the money.</p></speech>

I have seen that with people who have been provided with a companion dog and the amazing difference it can make.  I am not sure what the situation is regarding Government funding for those organisations but I am happy to check it out and see if there is something we can do.</p></speech>

I am dealing with a parent who has paid &euro;5,000 to a private provider in Galway and whose son's course has since gone fully online.  I met a representative of the students' union at the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, last week, which is dealing with about 30 families seeking refunds from the same accommodation provider.  The reason given by the provider for not paying the refund is that the Government does not have restrictions in place on the use of student accommodation facilities.  This is a disgrace.  Parents are under immense pressure and many have to borrow to pay these student accommodation fees.  I ask that the Government intervene on these matters and that students get refunds of their accommodation fees.</p></speech>

As I think the Deputy will know and appreciate, when it comes to any form of accommodation, it depends on the contract that was signed on the lease or licence agreement and no Government can change a contract retrospectively.  If somebody enters freely into a contract to buy a service or pay for accommodation, it is what the contract states that matters.  Unfortunately, there is not any way that any Government or Oireachtas can change a contract that people signed and freely entered into.  Perhaps the best thing for the Deputy to do would be to take a look at the contract and see whether she can provide the parent with some legal advice as to what his options are.</p></speech>

I refer not just to one bank but to many, in different counties, so it is now a systemic problem.  One might say a mortgage relationship is a private contractual relationship between an applicant and a bank, but one might equally say accommodation is a private contractual relationship.  Nevertheless, we have outlawed discrimination by landlords against people in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  If this practice continues, will the Government ban discrimination against mortgage applicants whose employers are in receipt of the employment wage subsidy scheme?</p></speech>

There are a number of cases in my constituency, and I have discussed the issue with the banks and will do so again in the regular engagement I have with them.  I do not think it is simple as a matter of discrimination.  Banks have certain responsibilities and among them is to engage only in prudent lending.  If they lend money to somebody who cannot pay it back, that has an impact on wider society.  It means a loan is not paid back and harder credit and higher interest rates for everyone else.</p>  <p>  Banks have a social responsibility, therefore, to ensure they do not engage in lending money to people who cannot pay it back.  One of the real concerns that a bank has, and has to have, in respect of somebody on the employment wage subsidy scheme is whether that job will still be there in three, six or nine months' time when the scheme is gone.  It is something they have to take into account.  I know that is difficult to hear but it is not in anyone's interests for banks to issue mortgages to people who might not be able to repay them.  We hope that in the vast majority of cases, people who are on the EWSS will not have to be on it in a few months' time and that they will be fully paid by their employer again, but there is a risk they will not and banks have to take that into account because of the wider social implications.</p></speech>

Before the pandemic, the Government stated this could not be done, and families had to travel to the Netherlands and other places to get medical cannabis.  Will the Government commit to making the emergency temporary structures that are in place the norm, so that families will not have to worry and feel the uncertainty of having to travel for their medicine?</p></speech>

It has been discussed for years in this Chamber.  Emergency arrangements were put in place, which the Deputy mentioned, but we should by now have in place standing arrangements that work for people for whom the drug has been prescribed by a specialist.  It is an issue that falls under the remit of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, rather than me but I will take it up with him.  It is an issue we are keen to sort out once and for all.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by a constituent with diabetes who said that services for adults with the condition in Tipperary, Limerick and Clare are severely lacking.  She inquired about accessing an insulin pump but found that she would have to go to Cork to do so.   I have since become aware that this is the case throughout Tipperary, Limerick and Clare because this service in the University Hospital Limerick is available only for children with diabetes.  A service for adults is not available and they have to travel to Cork, Galway or Dublin.  This is just one of a range of problems for people with diabetes in the region, which also includes regular appointment cancellations because there are not enough staff to provide the service.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, regular appointments are important for people with diabetes; otherwise, they could face severe complications.</p>  <p>  Do the Government and the Minister for Health have plans to address the problem in the near future?</p></speech>

It is very important and relates to having a report to evaluate how the CRSS is working.  We all know that these schemes were introduced in a hurry.  There was not much time to devise them and the schemes are broadly based.  However, there are certain cohorts that have not been embraced at all from the point of view of the scheme.  I refer to publicans aged over 66, bus drivers, self-employed taxi drivers who own their taxis and those who have ready-mix trucks.  It is a large cohort.</p>  <p>  Some of those involved in the music and arts industry have great bands and a great following all over the world, from Nashville to Ballydehob, but I am talking about the local ones in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann, from Carrick-on-Suir to Moneygall, and the valuable entertainment they give.  There is the famous Louise Morrissey, Trudi Lalor, Fran Curry and Muriel.  I could stay naming them for the day.  They give great enjoyment and they have a large following.  I do not know if they will ever be able to fine-tune their voices again and to get back on the road.  The spirit will not be killed in them, because they have the spirit to entertain and they love it.  They get empathy back from the full halls and other venues such as the Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; cultural centre.  They travel far and near.  They must have a van to deliver their equipment, whether they are solo acts or two persons.  It is usually only one or two people.  The equipment costs a fortune.  Sound engineers and lighting engineers are also required.  The valuable pieces of equipment are very specialised.  They have put lots of money into it, but they have also trained heavily in how to use it.  They cannot avail of the scheme because they do not have a rateable building, as their investment is in the van parked outside the house.  They had to borrow for that.  In many cases they also have a lien on their house to cover the payments and they are not getting what they should be getting.  It is a case of n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  They are not getting those supports and there are many others in a similar position.</p>  <p>  I will finish on this point, a Cheann Comhairle.  This morning there were dance teachers outside Leinster House, mainly from Dublin, but they were also from as far away as Wexford, Gorey and New Ross.  They have been denied the right to go back to work.  Children had written letters to say how much they love dance, that they want to dance and asking to be let dance.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said last night, I am into Irish dancing.  There are many forms of dance from ballet to the performance arts and they have massive studios which are safe places.  There may be 30 children in a class in a prefab with a m&uacute;inteoir and perhaps two special needs assistants in a small area, while there are dance studios four times as big as that with proper ventilation.  Something must be done for those people to allow them to get back to work, not only for the teachers, the m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, and the families and businesses but for their mental health and the rinceoir&iacute; &oacute;ga, the young dancers, regardless of the type of dance they do.  The types of dance are wide and varied.  I have never even seen many of them.  Children want to dance.  It is not fair that a boy and a girl in a dance school are not allowed to dance or to get tuition but a boy can go to train for GAA, rugby and soccer.  They are just kept away from dancing.  It is very hard to keep buachaill&iacute; &oacute;ga involved in dance of any form because in the teenage years they drift off into cooler stuff.  For some children, dancing is their thing.  Look at Riverdance.  Look at Scoil Rince N&iacute; Chraith.  I must declare an interest in that as it is my own niece.  My own daughter wanted to go to the world championship this year but that did not happen.  They have all been devastated, but they need to get back to dance because it is their life and they love it.  It is part of our culture and heritage and it is protected under a European convention.  We are trampling over the Constitution and we must go back to basics and let these people flourish.  Look at the added value we will get.  Look at what Riverdance brought to us and all the other shows.  Look at Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann travelling the world, across four or five continents.  That is progress and we need to embrace that again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300028#CC00500"><p>My contribution will be short.  I did mention last night to the Minister, but our discussion was cut short, about pubs whose kitchens are not considered sufficient and they have been forced to close.  They will not be entitled to the CRSS funding either because they did sell food previously.  It would be fine if they were allowed to open but they are not.  Because they sold food that they were able to make on the premises without a full kitchen, they are losing out on the payment.  I would appreciate if the Minister could make a statement on that.</p>  <p>  A lot of other groups have also lost out because they do not have premises but that did not mean that they were not employing people.  I refer to people involved in tourism and booking holidays.  Although they did not have a premises, that did not mean they were not employing large numbers of people.  They have been losing out on payments.  People who were involved in activities, for example in Kinsale and as far as Castletownbere, such as water sports for example, do not have a premises but their business is closed.  They are falling between two stools and that is putting them in a very unfair situation.  I know it is very hard to expect the Minister to tick every box and for him to find money for everything, but the livelihoods of some people have been seriously hampered during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath is the "senior Minister" when it comes to Irish dancing.  He has supported Irish dancing in recent years in the D&aacute;il.  Like him, I met with the Irish dancers outside the D&aacute;il today.  They are terribly hurt.  They have only danced for seven days since last March.  They can work in a socially distanced way.  Money is not required.  It is good for their mental health.  It is good for the children and for their development.  Children love dancing.  They have been sending letters and emails to us.  It is our culture.  If looks to me that in this pandemic anything to do with our culture has been stopped.  There is the public house where people used to love to meet, tell stories, sing and play music or dance.  It is our Irish culture that the Minister is attacking.  He is not finding a way forward.  People are quite willing to work with whatever restrictions are put before them, but they need someone to talk to them and to work with them.  If that does not happen, then the Government is ruining our culture, but it is also ruining employment that people have spent so much time and effort putting together.  As I stated, activities such as water sports do not have premises.  All of these issues need to be addressed, including pubs with small kitchens that are not allowed to open now because they do not have a chef.  They are being exempted from the CRSS funding.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300028#CC00600"><p>I will be brief.  I wish to raise two points with the Minister.  The first is dance groups around the country.  We were lucky during the recent lockdown that children were at least able to train outdoors for sport, but a lot of young people do not get involved in sport and, for them, dance is a very important physical activity, especially from a mental health as well as a physical health point of view.  Because dance happens indoors, it is being shut down, point blank, under the current restrictions.  It is a bit like the argument that was made about churches previously.  The reality is that all of these groups have put together comprehensive plans to minimise risk.  It is important that we do not just look at this purely from the point of view of managing Covid-19.  We must weigh up the potential risks that exist, the comprehensive set of mitigation measures that are being put in place and we must also look at the physical and mental impact on children.  I come back to the argument that I made to the Taoiseach on a number of occasions in terms of providing the evidence and data on this issue.  The reality is that if it is done right and it is managed right there is a very minimal risk, but there is a significant benefit, in particular for young people.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue.</p>  <p>  The second issue is public houses.  I accept that it is a complex issue.  There are certain agendas, not within the Government, but with some of the medical advice regarding public houses in general and that is an issue that is going to have to be addressed.  If public houses are managed properly, and the vast majority of them are, then there is not a risk with them.  There were some that abused the situation, or there was abuse on their premises, and it did cause problems but that was in a minority of cases.  That said, we need to look in a far more comprehensive manner at the licensed trade across this country in the same way as when we discussed post offices previously.</p> <p>If there are two or three pubs in a village, is there a case for allowing a mechanism whereby some of those licences could be bought out to sustain the viability of the pubs that remain?  Is there a way to put a comprehensive support package in place for the businesses that wish to remain in the sector in order to ensure we have that network across the country which is coming under severe strain and pressure?  I believe that many publicans will never open their doors again.  That will have its own impact on communities across the country.  We need a far more comprehensive approach with regard to the licensed trade across the country.  The Minister needs to bring all of the players around a table and come up with a blueprint and strategy for that sector because it is a key social outlet for so many people.</p></speech>

It is not a new issue.  I raised it first in March, when the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated that all student nurses would be paid for the duration of the pandemic.  I may be wrong, but the pandemic has not gone away.  The only thing that has gone away is the payment for student nurses.  The restriction and strain on the health service have not gone away.  What has gone away is the Fine Gael promise to look after the student nurses who are working on the front line.  In March, a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy who is now a Minister stated that student nurses should be paid.  She stated that these students and trainees deserve to be paid like all other nurses during the Covid-19 period.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies posted all over social media about the need to pay student nurses.  They said they would be a voice for those student nurses and they called on the Government to sort out this issue.  They then had a chance to be a voice for the student nurses and to sort out this issue but, instead, they voted against student nurses.  How could we expect anything else?</p>  <p>  Less than a month away from the strangest Christmas any of us will ever experience and nine months into fighting the pandemic, what did nurses and midwives get in the post this week?  They did not get recognition of their hard work.  One cannot post a round of applause to them.  They got a letter asking them to pay &euro;100 for the privilege of fighting Covid-19 on the front line for this country.  Nurses have told me they are paying for the privilege of holding the hands of dying patients because their families cannot be there to do it.  I do not say that lightly; it is what nurses have told me.  That is what nurses are doing.  They are paying for the privilege of bruises on their faces from wearing masks all day long.  They are paying for the privilege of working long shifts in understaffed hospitals.  They look to places such as Scotland, where NHS staff are getting &pound;500 as a "thank you" for their work.  We have a retention crisis here.  How can we expect nurses and midwives to stay here when they can see they will be recognised and appreciated elsewhere?  There is nothing in the Bill for nurses.  The Government should hang its head in shame.</p></speech>

Is it any wonder we cannot retain or recruit enough nurses?  Who would want to take up the job given the way they are being disrespected and treated very badly?  I call on the Government to try to redeem itself by making sure student nurses and midwives are awarded a pay increase and that the retention fee of &euro;100 is waived.  Clapping them one minute and cutting them down the next is just outrageous.  I ask for that issue to be considered.</p>  <p>  On the issue of dance classes, several dance class teachers were outside Leinster House this morning.  I met them and discussed many issues with them.  It makes no sense that they are restricted so much.  They have taken every measure they could possibly take.  They have mortgages to pay.  Children are back in school but cannot attend dance classes.  One dance teacher told me that children and teenagers are absolutely heartbroken and that it is having a serious effect on their mental health and well-being.  I appeal to the Government to please show some goodwill and fairness in terms of lifting this restriction because it makes no sense when children are back in school and everything else.  This issue needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  I understand children can participate in soccer training but there is significant concern among schoolboy and schoolgirl soccer clubs in the midlands that children cannot participate in matches.  Doing so is good for their well-being and, indeed, helps to keep them healthy, the importance of which we hear so much about.  We are told that children need to participate in sports and that it is encouraged.  There needs to be some common sense shown.  I appeal on behalf of the soccer clubs that are very disillusioned for children to be allowed to play matches.</p>  <p>  Cinemas being open but theatres not being allowed to open is also a very serious issue.  It has been brought to my attention that Birr Theatre and Arts Centre has a cinema club.  There is no cinema in the town and the cinema club, which is within the theatre, cannot open because of this restriction.  I appeal to the Government to show some goodwill and understanding and empathy for people.  What is lacking is empathy for the hardship people are going through, some of it unnecessarily.  Some of the restrictions are completely over the top and make no sense.  Indeed, some Ministers and backbench Deputies have admitted that some of the measures make no sense.  We need to revisit them and I ask for that issue in particular to be considered.</p>  <p>  Rural pubs are being treated shamefully.  We hear the Government talking about rural Ireland and supporting a vibrant rural economy, which is a commitment in the programme for Government, yet we are seeing that rural pubs are absolutely being trampled on.  I have seen many rural pubs and I can tell the Minister that they are as clean as or cleaner than many surgeries and hospital wards.  They have put in place every measure possible.  The Government has to remember that, unfortunately, rural pubs do not face the same scenario as pubs in Dublin.  They do not have big crowds of people coming in.  There might be ten people or maybe 15 people at the weekend in each local pub   The restriction is having a significant impact.  The Government is speaking from two sides of its mouth all of the time.  It talks about rural isolation, but what about people living on their own who go to their local pub for a sociable drink?  It is the only time they meet anybody.  I have been told by constituents that they do not see anybody, apart from possibly seeing the postman three or four times a week.  That is a serious issue.  The Government is seriously damaging people and impacting on their mental health with the unfair restrictions it is imposing.  Many rural pubs will never reopen because of the measures the Government has taken.  I have supported those pubs from day one and I will continue to do so along with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to look at what it is doing and the impact that is having on people's mental health and well-being.  We need to make sure that experts from every sector are included in any decision-making.  I believe the whole thing is going wrong because we do not have insightful experts providing their accounts and information to be factored into the decisions that are made.  The decisions are being taken on a whim and I think some of them have gone much too far and need to be revisited.  Some of them need to be pulled back.  We absolutely need to take precautions but we cannot create a police state where the Government takes responsibility for every citizen.  There has to be personal responsibility.  I believe the State needs to ease up in that regard.  The Government is going much too far.  The draconian measures that are in place are absolutely going to destroy rural Ireland.</p> <p>I come from a constituency where an unjust transition is taking place.  There have been many job losses and farmers are struggling.  Now the Government is trying to take away our rural pubs and everything else.  The Government needs to take stock of the impact its poor decision-making is having on rural constituencies, such as Laois-Offaly, and many others.</p></speech>

It will be important, notwithstanding my general willingness to allow people flexibility, that we focus on the subject matter of the amendments.  Does the Minister wish to comment on these amendments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300030#EE00300"><p>I will deal first with the amendment from Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He is genuinely raising an issue concerning groups of workers severely affected by the impact of Covid-19 and who are finding it desperately hard to rebuild their incomes and to imagine getting their jobs back.  This CRSS is broad in that it is available to all parts of our economy which meet two criteria.  The first is that businesses must have a premises and the second is that the premises is closed or has a very low level of trading due to the guidance given by the Government regarding public health.</p>  <p>  I accept that means some groups of workers are not included in this scheme.  Within those groups is a smaller group of workers who, for example, cannot participate in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is a massive source of support now to almost 350,000 of our fellow citizens.  Changes, however, were made to the PUP payment to allow people to do some work and retain all or some of that payment.  My colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, have funding available, and they are using those funds to launch schemes to try to support workers in the sectors to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  I have no doubt at all that the Deputy will raise the case of those musicians who have been unable to get funding.  As we move into 2021, however, and maybe even later this year, I believe there will be opportunities for other rounds of funding to be run to allow, for example, more musicians and artists access funding to allow them to participate in the events or fund the activities to which the Deputy has referred.</p>  <p>  I reiterate what I said in a different section of this Finance Bill.  The different programmes contained in this legislation are helping hundreds of thousands of workers now.  Unfortunately, however, whenever we are designing any kind of a programme, particularly in dealing with an emergency such as this one, I will always hear more about those who are just about excluded from schemes such as this than I will about those who are included in and benefiting from these schemes because they deserve to benefit from them and they need that benefit.  That is fine, because that is the way debate in the Oireachtas should be.  It is understandable that we should be continually raising issues regarding those who are not receiving support but who Teachta&iacute; feel should be.  This is why the Ministers, Deputies Ryan and Martin, are putting in place programmes and changes to attempt to offer further help to the workers to whom Deputy Boyd Barrett has referred.</p>  <p>  Regarding dancing, which has been touched on by several Deputies, it is not covered in this Bill, but I recognise the work dance teachers do and how valuable that is.  From personal experience, I also know how valuable dance classes are and the effect they have on the well-being and physical health of young girls and boys.  I understand that aspect, but again, we have received advice and guidance from our public health professionals and experts regarding things we should not do if we are trying to facilitate the opening of more of our economy and society.  The advice we received and which we considered, and we examined this matter separately ourselves, is that certain forms of activity are safer to open now and to continue to keep open.  I refer to non-contact physical training, for example.  There is a higher level of risk, however, if we allow contact games or indoor physical activity.</p>  <p>  I recognise that creates hardship, but that is not because, as a Deputy suggested, we are trying to create a police state.  It is also not because any decisions are being taken on a whim.  We are very much aware of the impact of all the decisions we must make.  They are difficult decisions.  To support the opening of as much of our economy and society as possible, however, it will be the case that for some time we will need to leave other parts of our society not being able to function in the way they would wish.  We must make trade-offs now for the benefit of trying to get as much of our society open as possible.  These are not decisions made from a lack of empathy or understanding.  Opposition Deputies can meet a group and come in here and represent the interests of that group.  I do not have the luxury of being able to focus on one group.  I have a duty to all groups and to all of our society.  We are trying to get as much of society open as we can, and to do that safely.  Trade-offs are, unfortunately, required which are difficult but necessary to allow that opening to happen.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issue concerning pubs, we also discussed this issue in other parts of the Finance Bill.  To reiterate those arguments briefly, the data we looked at and the advice we received indicated that if we are seeking to open some pubs, restaurants and hotels, then to be able to keep them open safely and sustainably for as long as we can, we must make choices elsewhere.  It is hard for those who experience the consequences of those choices and it is hard to make those decisions.</p>  <p>  Turning to the CRSS, any scheme which is intended to apply to so much of our economy must have simple criteria that can be easily understood and applied by the Revenue Commissioners.  For those businesses which fall outside the remit of this scheme, there are many other schemes which they can participate in and benefit from.  Those businesses need that benefit and support, and we are trying to keep them going during what I know is a very difficult time.</p></speech>

The threshold for this support is turnover being down by 25% to cover the ongoing costs which businesses have.  I refer to insurance, fuel, maintenance and repayment costs.  Since March, I have been highlighting two cohorts who have been the most impacted.  Musicians have not seen their incomes impacted by 25%, or 30% or 40%, but by 80%, 90% or even 100%.  If they do not have a premises, however, musicians are excluded from the CRSS.  How are they supposed to pay insurance?  How are they supposed to make repayments?  How are they supposed to survive?</p>  <p>  I refer to the anger expressed by musicians yesterday, 87% of whom were excluded from the award scheme provided by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  That gives us an indication of the cruel injustice of this situation.</p> <p>Most musicians do not get the music industry stimulus package, MISP, award.  Most musicians do not get the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  Yet they are the people who are among the hardest, if not the hardest, hit along with the crews - the sound engineers and the light engineers - who stand behind them.  It is not fair.  I appeal to the Minister to make this scheme available to them.</p> <p> I will talk about the taxi drivers in my final contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300031#FF00200"><p>I too will be as brief as I can.  The cohort Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to, musicians, are such a vital part of our being and our entertainment and they have been excluded.  I refer to the funding administered by the Departments of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Some groups got funding under two or three schemes, but 87% of single acts, double acts and small groups got nothing.  They cannot live on the wind.  We are not making this up.</p>  <p>  I do not like the Minister's attitude that we come in here and we have the privilege of meeting groups outside the gate.  We live in the communities.  We get down and dirty with the people.  Maybe it is because the Minister lives in Dublin 4, Dublin 3 or whatever part of Dublin that he does not know what the people in rural Ireland think.  The people of rural Ireland are proud of their heritage and of their culture and they want to work.  They do not want handouts and payouts and Ireland ending at the M50.  They are proud of what they have.  I will not take lectures from the Minister again today, as I did last night, that we are trying to have fun.</p>  <p>  The Minister has had since March.  I acknowledged at the outset that the scheme was rushed.  We had to put a provision in place hurriedly but eight months later, we have not adapted or adjusted it.  We do not have the right people on the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to embrace the whole nation - the musicians, the actors and all the self-employed - and to have an understanding of those people and, above all, their mental health.  It is shocking the damage to mental health.  Some people live for those shows and the lift they give them.  They look forward from one week to the next to the social dancing outlets and they travel miles to them.  That is their life, and they love it.</p>  <p>  We will not have an industry.  These artists cannot go off digging spuds or coal or cutting turf anymore - it is all gone as well.  We want them to entertain.  We want Comhaltas to flourish under the ardsti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir, an t-iar-Sheanad&oacute;ir Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile, &Uacute;na.  The Ceann Comhairle was in Caiseal na Mumhan in Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;.  What wonderful culture.  The music, the dance, the song and the skills would sell Ireland alone without any of us opening our mouths or any schemes or anything else.</p>  <p>  We are looking after the people who have been left behind, and after facing nine months to Christmas without a penny, they need support and they need to be allowed to live.</p></speech>

The same argument that I made for the musicians and the crews, who I want to emphasise are behind the musicians, applies to the taxi drivers.  The taxi drivers' income is either non-existent because is not worth going out on the road or, for those who go out on the road, is down approximately 70%.  They have repayments on their cars.  How are they supposed to make them?  A taxi driver has to put fuel in his or her car to drive around the city looking for non-existent fares.  How are they supposed to pay for that?  How are they supposed to pay their insurance?  The Minister has got to give them an answer.  The pandemic unemployment payment, which I acknowledge the Government made changes to, is not enough to cover their ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  The reason CRSS was brought in, and is being given to businesses, is that the Government knows the huge numbers of businesses it is giving money to cannot meet their bills for maintenance, rent, insurance and repayments.  The Government acknowledged that point but for some inexplicable reason, it denies it to a group such as the taxi drivers who carry those same costs, the only difference being that a taxi driver's premises is his or her taxi.  It is a moving premises, but it is the taxi driver's place of work.  The taxi is what the taxi driver has invested in in order to have his or her small business as a sole trader.  I do not see how it is difficult to tweak the scheme to allow their inclusion and allow them to sustain themselves until things get back to where they were.</p>  <p>  I have made the argument.  I would like to hear the Minister justify it.  It would not cost much to do this but, God Almighty, it would remove much stress, pressure and hardship from 23,000 taxi drivers and their families, and the same goes for the musicians and the crew.</p></speech>

We brought in a scheme to support businesses that are shut or businesses that have an incredibly low level of trading because of public health guidance.  However, the overwhelming majority of businesses that are on this scheme are completely shut.</p>  <p>  We have many different schemes available to try to support those who cannot be helped by this scheme.  The Department of Transport and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have funding in place for programmes that are responding to the issues being raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p>  <p>  What we can do to best give the workers, to whom the Deputy is referring, the chance of a better income is to be able to safely reopen our economy and to give people confidence in public health.  This, in turn, goes back to the arguments we had earlier regarding the difficult choices that are involved in doing this.</p>  <p>  There is a justification for what we are doing in this scheme.  This scheme is really valuable.  It does something that will not always be acknowledged in this debate.  It may be acknowledged by some.  It is providing very valuable support to thousands of businesses on top of the other supports we have in place.  The Departments, the Ministers, the Arts Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, have the funding, have the ability and are responding as much as they can to the issues specific to the workers and to the sectors they are responsible for and that they regulate.</p></speech>

We are not blindly saying that there is no climate change issue, but we are saying that the carbon tax proposal in the Bill is unacceptable.  It is a denial of democracy.  I am in this House 13 years and have been involved in debating 13 finance Bills.  I might be a slow learner but it is a leap of faith that we will not have the chance to discuss this again until 2030.  We already have a plan running until 2040 that is destroying rural Ireland and herding people into the cities.  I will not say exactly what I would like to say about the Covid situation other than that it has taught us that it is rural people who are sustaining us.  I remember three recessions.  During the last recession, it was rural people and farmers who kept the country going.</p><p>The carbon tax is impacting hugely on less well-off people and families.  We all know that carbon taxes amounting to several billions of euro have already been collected from hard-pressed motorists and householders.  That money is not being spent evenly.  Deputy Nolan might speak about the just transition aspect because she knows more about it than I do.  There is no just response or just payback for people.  In fact, it is not about getting payback but the fact that people are not getting the physical infrastructure they need.  Fortunately, we have got a blueway in Tipperary and a fabulous greenway in Dungarvan, which is only out the road from me.  However, those facilities are being put in place by local authorities, which are having to go into huge debt to do so.  I salute the county managers and engineers who are driving these projects, as well as the visionaries and voluntary groups involved.  I thank Tr&iacute;ona O'Mahony of Munster Vales and Marie Phelan in Tipperary County Council, who have worked with local communities to drive those projects forward.  Knockmealdown Active has done good work in this area.  Communities in rural Ireland are trying their best to achieve a good carbon-free environment while also getting the amenities they need for people to get out ag si&uacute;l, ag dul ar an rothar agus ag rince, fad&oacute; fad&oacute;, although that is banished now.</p><p>The funds are being extracted from people but there is nothing being given in return.  I have not mentioned the farmers, agri-contractors and hauliers.  It is not being managed properly.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, promised us during the debates we had on the Covid pandemic and the budget that it would be done right, but that is not happening.  Places like west Cork did not get a penny for any greenway.  It seems like some counties are preferred and others are not.  Deputy Michael Collins has said that his part of the country is being treated like Jurassic Park.  It is a beautiful part of the country, not Jurassic Park, but a lot of the Ministers, and the Taoiseach, go there on holiday and then seem to forget about it.  They want rural Ireland to be a kind of playground, or a docile place they can visit.  We saw the same attitude in the recent debate about greyhound racing.  Some people in this House want to kill that industry, which together with horse racing, provides 40,000 jobs.  Are we going to have a utopian state where we are all smoking marijuana and listening to rock music or whatever?  Whale watching is something else we have heard mentioned.  I am talking about the everyday person who is going to work and trying to pay his mortgage, look after his family and educate the children.  There is discrimination against rural people in areas like transport, education and broadband.  People trying to learn and work from home cannot do so.  A family at home with one broadband line might have three or four children trying to do schoolwork and the father and mother trying to work, all at the same time.  They are all fighting over the one bit of poor broadband, or having to go into the village to access broadband and do their work.</p><p>The proposal on carbon tax is dastardly and it has been introduced in such a way that we do not have a right to review it.  I hope we will be back in Leinster House next year, rather than in the convention centre, but no matter where we are, we cannot discuss this provision.  I have never seen anything like it.  The carbon tax provision will be passed in this Finance Bill and we will not have a chance to evaluate it next year or the year after, na blianta ag f&aacute;s, until 2030.  That cannot be right or fair.  It is my duty, as a Deputy representing rural people, to say that this is wrong.  It is a denial of democracy at its most basic.  We have been talking about the denial of rights that come with the Covid restrictions, but this denial of democracy has nothing to do with Covid.  This grandiose scheme comes on top of the 2040 plan, which should be derailed and dismantled.  We have very few rail lines now but this is one train that should be halted and taken off the track because it is destroying the fabric of rural Ireland.  People cannot build a house or a farm building, or take out the forestry that needs to be replaced, because of the carbon footprint and the serial objectors.</p><p>As I said, the whole of rural Ireland is seen as a kind of a playground that is to be admired and where one drives to see the scenery.  I do not know what the Government wants us to do.  Are we to go back into hovels and be like the cavemen back in the antediluvian times?  It is shocking and it is not acceptable.  I would not be representing my people if I did not speak up about it.  I know the Government will vote down this amendment but the fact that we cannot debate the provision next year beats Banagher.  I have nothing against Banagher or Offaly but that is an old saying we have in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  The wool is being pulled over people's eyes.  Countless hundreds of millions - in fact, billions - of euro have been paid in carbon tax by farmers, contractors, road hauliers and ordinary motorists over the past ten years and more.  They are not getting anything back for it.  There is very little or no return.  We get announcements in the budget about the Luas, the DART and God knows what else.  There are proposals for terminals at Dublin Airport and to widen the streets and put in bus lanes, all here in the capital.  The capital does not own Ireland.  We know that and the people in Dublin know it now.  We all feed into the capital and there are more places than Dublin to be looked after.</p><p>There are very few rail lines in Tipperary and the rail services are not being run at proper times.  There is no proper, joined-up thinking about public transport and related issues.  We all want electric cars but we cannot afford them and there are not enough service and charging points.  It is all grand in plan and theory but it is a different story on the ground.  For the woman trying to heat her cottage or house with a bag of coal, even if she gets a fuel allowance, the carbon tax is adding to the cost.  Then we have coal coming across from Northern Ireland and destroying fuel merchant businesses here.  There is great inequity and unfairness inherent in the system and it is not acceptable or palatable for rural people or urban people.  Why should it be?  People in cities and towns also have to pay the carbon tax on their fuel and gas, and that is not fair either.  Then we have all the utility companies fleecing people with standing charges.  Even for the hotels, shops and pubs that are closed at this time, a fortune is being accrued in utility taxes.  It is shocking what is going on.</p><p>I cannot accept this provision, especially as there is no chance to evaluate it or have a vote on it next year.  We will not even be able to talk about it.  It is a nice plan to put it in this Bill and have it there for ten years and the lads cannot even talk about it.  It was Marie Antoinette who is supposed to have said, &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;.  We are sick of eating cake.  We would prefer bread and butter and a rasher inside in it.  We want a focus on plain living and ordinary living, not sweetness and pie.</p></speech>

This is related to the fuels, cars and extra costs which have occurred for the ordinary working person.  These extra costs are severe for the fishermen, contractors, the hauliers and the farmers, as well as for the ordinary mother and father taking their children to school and going to work every day.  The people of rural Ireland - no one else - will have to pay this extra tax.</p>  <p>  The carbon tax and all this were designed to take money out of people's pockets in rural Ireland.  I was totally opposed to it when it was first sold to my colleagues prior to the general election.  They were all in favour of it then and thought it was a great idea.  They were told it would raise moneys to give back to rural Ireland in other ways.</p>  <p>  The Government failed at the very first hurdle, however.  It announced &euro;63 million funding for greenways.  The constituency of Cork South-West, which will pay the most carbon tax in this country because it is the most rural part of the country, will not get one brown cent from this greenway funding.  Fabulous greenway projects from Cork to Kinsale, Innishannon to Bandon, the Bandon rail line all the way to Bantry, through Drimoleague and Dunmanway, the Bandon rail line to Schull, through Clonakilty and Skibbereen, were refused funding.  The moneys to be raised by this carbon tax were meant to put back into rural communities.  What really happened was the Government sucked as much as it could out of rural Ireland and landed it back here in the capital to aid projects that need to be carried out.  I do not have any issue with that because common sense states there have to be projects here too.  I have been proved to be 100% right that the Government failed with the greenway funding, however.  If it was a horse at the first hurdle, it would have collapsed and been taken off the track.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was holidaying in west Cork.  Every time I opened up social media on my phone, it told me the Taoiseach and everyone in the Government was down in west Cork.  While they are very welcome, when it comes to the time to give a bit of funding back to the people of west Cork, it is forgotten.  The Minister is the man with the keys to this car.  He is the driving force.  Why has funding not been given to the people of west Cork for the N71 or R586?  The road from Bandon to Ballydehob has no passing bays.  Eighteen years ago was the last time funding was given for a bypass in Skibbereen.  There has not been a brown cent since but only a little bit of pothole and storm damage money.  That is a disgrace.  We are living there too.  It is same with the R586 from Bandon to Bantry.</p></speech>

That is the argument I am trying to put.  That is why this amendment has been tabled.  It is to get the Minister to understand there is no point in putting a carbon tax in place when the moneys raised through the taxes from fuel are taken back to Dublin to spend on big projects there as well as in senior Ministers' constituencies but the people on the ground in rural communities suffer.  We need that funding from fuel to be spent in a fair manner, not in an unfair manner.</p>  <p>  The bypass at Innishannon, the northern bypass in Bandon and the Bantry bypass have all been waiting for decades for money but there has been no delivery.  The money from the fuel tax, the carbon tax or whatever polished word one wants to put on it, can give some kind of delivery.  That is not happening, however.  The people in my constituency are absolutely furious because they will have to keep forking out until 2040 before we can negotiate this measure again.  This is a bad deal.  That tax should not be taken out of the pockets of the people of rural Ireland unless it is given back in a fair manner.  We cannot be heating the homes or making a warmer home for the people throughout the capital or highly populated areas.  The people of rural Ireland need their warmer homes too but they are not getting that.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian aid for flooding did not deliver.  The Government announces schemes which 80% to 90% of people cannot access.  That is not fair.  There should have been a roadmap as to where the money would have been spent back in rural, as well as urban, communities.  On that, the Government has failed miserably.  The people on the ground are those who are going to suffer most.</p>  <p>  Fishermen are now paying massive fuel tax for their trawlers.  There were further announcements in the past week about the EU Brexit talks and how 18% of Irish fishing stocks has been offered to the UK to bring it on board.  Unfortunately, the Irish fishermen and fishing rights are in serious jeopardy.  Taxes are being taken from their fuels, and the same as is done to hard-pressed farmers, contractors and hauliers.</p>  <p>  How will the Minister spend the taxes from this fuel in future?  Has the Government considered the consequences of not spending money in rural Ireland?  Is this money going to be spent on infrastructure to open our communities in west Cork?  The Government cannot think that a few visits during the summer will suffice as our way forward.  I asked the Minister several times about the pubs earlier but I did not hear him answer it.  He might have answered it earlier but I did not hear it.</p>  <p>  I have been opposed to the measure in question.  I have been justified as the Government failed on the first hurdle with it giving &euro;63 million around the rest of the country but dropping west Cork off the map when we are paying the most.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300033#HH00500"><p>I will speak briefly on this amendment.  Again, any tax or measure that the Government brings in discriminates against the people of rural Ireland.  It talks about taxes all of the time and lowering CO2 emissions from vehicles.  It did not think, however, that rural Ireland is not getting the same chances.  There is regional imbalance.  The Government is not addressing those issues.  Instead, it is loading and hammering us with taxes all the time because it has bowed to a meaningless, empty Green Party rhetoric which has nothing to offer the people of Ireland in general and rural Ireland in particular.  We are paying the price for this aspiration and being punished for it.</p>  <p>  People say to me in my constituency offices that they feel they are being discriminated against and kept down.  We see tax after tax.  I have had many conversations about the carbon tax with contractors and farmers.  There is disillusionment among Bord na M&oacute;na workers with up to 1,000 workers going to lose their jobs.  I do not care what scheme the Government brings in.  Lately, it spoke about a bog rehabilitation scheme.  That will not replace 1,000 jobs.</p>  <p>  The midlands is a region which has not been given enough support by the Government.  It has been disadvantaged for many years.  As far back as 2016, I called for an agency, similar to the Western Development Commission, to be set up.  If that had been done in advance, maybe we would not be in such a dire situation now.</p>  <p>  For us, it is tax after tax but we are not seeing anything.  I have been contacted by many companies and people working from home who do not even have basic broadband infrastructure.  There is a great announcement about the roll-out of broadband.  Surely to God, common sense would have prevailed and the Government would have prioritised the midlands region, which is already under an unjust transition and is facing job losses.  At this point, it is not only about job creation but job retention.  The fact the Government is slapping taxes and measures on us but we do not see the benefits of them is concerning.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance must bear in mind that, when he takes any measure or implements Green Party policy, it does not make sense or meet the needs of people in rural Ireland.</p> <p>We are paying the price and really being punished for this aspiration and empty rhetoric.  Before the Minister makes a decision he needs to think about these regions and remember there is serious regional imbalance and people are struggling.  The midlands is the region with the second lowest rate of disposable income.  None of this is being taken into account.</p> <p> The Minister speaks about carbon tax but it will lead to fuel poverty.  The Minister is not giving enough money to the SEAI for the home insulation grants.  I have tried to get grants for people to insulate their homes and I cannot get them but we hear the lovely aspirational announcements.  The Government is not meeting the people halfway.  It is not taking a reasonable position.  It is an extreme and radical position in terms of embracing green policy without thinking about the impact it will have on people's lives.  I ask for common sense and a bit of balance.  Of course we want to do our best for the environment but there needs to be a sense of realism.  The Minister should abandon the unrealistic radical policies he is trying to implement that are leading to hardship for people and job losses.  Are people meant to sit around all day and look out their windows and plant trees?  Is that what they are meant to do?  The policies are leading to a lot of hardship for people and serious job losses.  The Government needs to wake up.</p></speech>

I will not go over the carbon tax because we discussed it at length on Committee Stage.  I have a specific question for the Minister.  The bands used here are related to the bands for vehicle registration tax, VRT.  There are 11 bands in place for VRT at present and with budget 2021 this is changing to 20 bands.  On budget day we were promised that the Revenue Commissioners would publish the list of the new 20 VRT rates quite soon.  That was two months ago.  Those 20 bands have yet to be published and there is huge confusion.  Will the Minister make available those 20 bands for VRT and have them published immediately to provide clarification on this?</p></speech>

I am sure we will get to the issues raised on the carbon tax later in the afternoon.  I want to inform Deputies that the amendment is on a different matter.  We need to put it in context.  The change in carbon tax to which we are referring is equivalent to an additional &euro;1.50 on, for example, a 60 l tank of diesel.  That is the sum change involved in it.  I appreciate that for many people, that &euro;1.50 and the carry through into the price of a bale of briquettes is something that can mean difficulty and hardship.  I understand that.  That is the very reason we have used the carbon tax to fund changes in social welfare allowances to support those who would be most affected by the increase in this tax.  There is nothing radical or extreme about it.</p>  <p>  We are recognising that we have a climate crisis on the way, on which I believe there is consensus in the House.  We are looking to change the price of something which, when consumed, is one of the main reasons we have the level of harm being done to our environment that is being done.  That is not radical.  It is a responsible response to the great challenge we face.  I am as aware as any Deputy who has spoken against the carbon tax of the hardship, difficulty and worry that is there regarding the effect of taxes such as this.  This is the reason we have used one third of the money raised by the carbon tax to change those parts of our welfare payments that can help the most.  That is why we have made this change.</p>  <p>   With regard to the claims being made that this is an attack on rural Ireland, of course I understand the issues the Deputies are raising regarding the need for more support for rural Ireland but that is why we will be rolling out as quickly as possible a national broadband plan to connect more and more of our towns, villages and rural homes.  I would have hoped we would have made quicker progress on it but it was disrupted by the pandemic.  That progress will recommence next year.  The very reason we have a national broadband plan is to put in place the investment in connectivity that can and will make a difference to the issues in rural Ireland that are being described.</p>  <p>  The particular measure opposed in the section, which is on the introduction of the worldwide harmonised light-duty vehicles test procedure, WLTP, to which Deputy Naughten referred and on which he asked a specific question, brings in a way of testing the emissions of vehicles which is all about being more accurate and ensuring we can accurately measure the effect that vehicles and cars have on the environment.  That is why this is being brought in.  The old system we had did not do it.  It was shown to be cheated upon.  Now we are bringing in a new system that can accurately reflect and tax the effect of these vehicles on the environment.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Naughten's comment on the number of rates, during the debate I will get the answer to that question for him and in my next response to the Deputy I will inform him whether they have been published or, if they have not been published, when they will be published.</p></speech>

The information is contained there.</p><p>Amendment No. 63 relates to the commencement of section 15 of the Bill.  Section 15 updates Part 35A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for transfer pricing.  In particular, section 15 updates the definition of a relevant person in section 835A and replaces section 835E, which provides for an exclusion from transfer pricing rules for certain domestic non-trading arrangements.</p><p>Following the publication of the Finance Bill, it became apparent that certain bona fide domestic non-trading arrangements were not specifically provided for within the exclusion.  I brought forward a number of Committee Stage amendments to extend the exclusion to additional domestic non-trading arrangements providing relevant conditions were satisfied.  It has since emerged that while amendments brought forward on Committee Stage will extend the exclusion in certain circumstances, there may be other circumstances that possibly should also be covered by the exclusion.  The non-exclusion of certain bona fide domestic non-trading transactions may be problematic for certain Irish businesses that have intergroup arrangements and are subject to transfer pricing rules.  The amendment will allow section 15 to be subject to a commencement order.  This will allow the officials, in consultation with officials of the Revenue Commissioners, sufficient time to consider further, prior to commencing the legislation, the scope and application of section 15.</p></speech>

The amendment was brought forward as it became apparent that the exclusion provided in section 835E may have been interpreted more broadly than was intended.  I understand it was to ensure the exclusion operates as intended.</p> <p> The Minister said there may be issues with it.  The proposed draft amends the legislation to make clear that the exclusion relates specifically to certain arrangements only and not to any other activity undertaken.  However, the amendment the Minister has brought forward on Report Stage proposes that it will be actioned or will come into force on a date that is set by the Minister.  We know from experience that this means it may never come into effect, and there has been an ample number of examples down through the years where there is a permission that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; bring something into effect.</p> <p> Having listened to what the Minister has said, it appears it is more than just a question of the timing of when this section would come into effect and is also a question of the consequences or unintended consequences of this section coming into effect.  There is an acknowledgement across the House that the section is required.  However, what we are hearing now is that there may be consequences of bringing in the section.  Instead of trying to fix that in a timely manner, the section might not be introduced at all or it might be introduced at a later stage.  That is not a good situation and I ask the Minister to clarify this issue further.</p></speech>

I am concerned.  We had a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in this regard.  I was quite surprised at this amendment because I am concerned it could lead to this section not being implemented for a long time.  When we had the discussion on Committee Stage, it was our understanding that it would come into effect on 1 January 2021.  I have been concerned about the perceived weakness of this.  Even with the enactment of the Bill, there could still be possible arbitrage opportunities in this regard.  I would like the Minister to clarify this further.  We have consensus that this needs to be enacted and I would be deeply concerned if this leads to it not being enacted.</p></speech>

I have made many changes in regard to transfer pricing in previous Finance Bills that I have brought in.  What has happened here is that, since the Finance Bill was published and I indicated this change, I have received contact through the Revenue Commissioners from a number of Irish companies which expressed concern that this could have an effect on very legitimate structures they have within their companies.  I am very happy, once I am clear on whether there is an issue, to provide Deputy Doherty with a note on this.  It is not my intention to defer the implementation of this section indefinitely.  I just want to ensure that if I do bring it in, it does not have an effect on Irish employment and Irish companies at a time of great pressure with other things going on.  I am very happy, once I have received further information on this matter, to share this with Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>

We understand there is a need to bring in an amendment of the law with regard to this section, and it has been brought in.  It now emerges there may be what I think I am right to classify as unintended consequences, and the Minister needs to clarify what those unintended consequences are.  However, there is still a belief that the section needs to be brought in to deal with other matters.  The problem in front of us is that we will only have two choices in the future, that is, to implement the section or not to implement the section, and that choice will be solely the Minister&rsquo;s.</p>  <p>  The Minister indicated this on Committee Stage, so obviously it was flagged to him that there are potential concerns.  What should be done is that we should use the time before the Bill goes to the Seanad to address this issue and to deal with it by amending the section, if needs be, and then allowing for the amended section to come into effect.  The problem is that, if the Minister is convinced, from the correspondence he has had, that there are consequences for what he calls "legitimate structures" in Irish companies, then the only choice he will have is not to commence it at all.  Does that not leave a gap?  That is my concern.  Why can this not be further looked at by the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister&rsquo;s officials before the Bill goes to the Seanad for scrutiny?  Can this not be addressed in a timely manner?  Otherwise, as we know, it is unlikely the Minister will address this between now and next year's Finance Bill.</p></speech>

I am making an offer to the Deputy in good faith, which he can take up, that when I am clearer on whether there are genuine issues that could affect employment or the registration of companies in our country and how they are structured, I will share that with him.  If there is an opportunity to make changes on this matter before it goes to the Seanad, that is something I will look at.  The experience I have of transfer pricing shows me how deeply complicated it is.  I became aware, just as I was commencing Committee Stage, that there were some issues being raised via the Revenue Commissioners that I simply need to understand further so I can judge whether action is needed in this area.  When I am clear on that, I will be very happy to provide a briefing to Deputy Doherty and his team on this matter.  If there is an opportunity to address some of the issues before it goes to the Seanad, I will do that as well.</p></speech>

Between 2010 and 2019, there were 214 fatal accidents on farms.  Of these, 65 involved a farm vehicle, 39 involved machinery and 39 involved livestock.  These three areas accounted for 67% of all fatal accidents on farms.</p><p>In an effort to tackle this, I am bringing forward a change to capital allowances treatment of certain farm safety equipment and adaptive equipment for farmers with disabilities.  Currently, capital allowances are available at 12.5% per annum over eight years for agricultural equipment generally.  I propose accelerated capital allowances of 50% per annum over two years for eligible equipment.</p> <p>This eligible equipment is listed in the amendment.  Any future changes or additions to the list will have to be by way of primary legislation.</p> <p> The introduction of an accelerated capital allowance scheme is aimed at incentivising the purchase of farm safety equipment and the replacement of equipment that may be old or substandard.  The measure is also designed to assist farmers who have a disability to continue work, with certain adaptive equipment also eligible for the scheme.  It will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and be subject to a scheme total equipment cost of &euro;5 million per annum.  This would amount to an upfront estimated tax expenditure cost of &euro;1.5 million per annum.  As the scheme will allow for an acceleration of capital allowances for the equipment such that they can be claimed over two instead of eight years, I believe the net cost over eight years would be neutral.</p> <p> For the purposes of ensuring the scheme remains within its cost parameters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will issue a farm safety-adaption accelerated capital allowance certificate for submission to Revenue in support of such claims.  The issuing of this certificate will not imply entitlement to the accelerated capital allowance.  It will be the responsibility of all claimants to familiarise themselves with the relevant provisions of the tax code, including, but not limited to, eligibility conditions.</p> <p> The Report Stage amendment underlines the priority afforded to the issue of farm safety in the Government programme and reflects a commitment to make further progress soon.  The aim is to get a scheme in place, and the measure will be kept under review in 2021.  As with all such measures, the scheme will be reviewed periodically and it will be subject to a three-year sunset clause to the end of 2023.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300036#LL00300"><p>I will begin by thanking the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials in the Department of Finance for their work and co-operation on this very important measure, which has been a goal of mine since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for farm safety.  This is one of a range of measures I have wanted to introduce.  The purpose of it is twofold, as the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outlined but an accelerated capital allowance will incentivise the investment in farm safety measures.</p>  <p>  In my dealings with many victims of life-changing injuries as a result of farm safety incidents, as well as with families who have lost loved ones, it has been very evident that more needs to be done for those whose lives have been changed by incidents that have happened on farms.  In that regard, this accelerated capital allowance is an important step in that direction.  For somebody who loses a limb, becomes wheelchair bound or suffers significant injury, not only is their life changed irreparably but, as self-employed farmers, their income stream is also taken away.  Their ability to be able to continue to work is greatly diminished unless they can modify the way they operate, modify the machinery and all the rest.  This accelerated capital allowance allows them to make that significant investment, which is as important for their mental health in terms of being able to continue to work as well as their physical well-being and income streams.</p>  <p>  In that regard, the measures in this accelerated capital allowance to cover equipment such as access lifts, hoists, integrated ramps for farm vehicles, including modified entry, where required, wheelchair restraints and docking stations are all a very important step, as are modified controls to enable full hand operation instead of the use of foot pedals where there has been the loss of a limb, as well as modified seating, modified machinery constraints, quick hitches on the front and the back of tractors and machinery and modified elements of machinery.  These are the type of investments that somebody who suffers a very significant injury has not been able to make in the past because of the level of cost involved.  This accelerated capital allowance will allow them recoup the 100% cost of that over the first two years of its expenditure.</p>  <p>  On the other hand are the other enhanced safety measures that will encourage farmers to invest in elements that will make our farms safer and avoid more injuries in the future.  As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outlined, agricultural vehicles and machinery have been the biggest cause of farm safety incidents followed closely by incidents involving livestock.  Anti-backing gates for crushes are a very important investment.  We need to incentivise farmers to understand that this investment will make a very big difference because in the likes of beef farming in particular, where margins are tight, prioritising that type of investment is key, as well as measures such as chemical stores, big bag lifters for half tonne bags of fertiliser and so on and quick hitch mechanisms.  Those are measures that are not covered by targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, so that support has not been available to date.</p>  <p>  This is very much in keeping with the Government's commitment to reducing farm safety incidents, injury and deaths.  The programme for Government sets out a clear ambition in that regard.  My appointment as the first Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety is a key indication of the programme for Government.  I am delighted to be able to work closely with my ministerial colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Department of Finance in that regard.  I again acknowledge the work of my officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who have done much work on this also in engaging with the Department of Finance on these measures.  It is one of a range of farm safety measures we are looking to introduce across a host of areas to make our farms safer and drive down the unacceptably high level of farm deaths and farm safety incidents that occur.</p>  <p>  This week we launched an innovation partnership scheme, an EIP model, for which I secured &euro;1 million in the budget, which is a locally-led farm safety initiative.  It is a call for ideas from the ground up that can be funded now by my Department, which hopefully could feed into a new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  I want to see farm safety as an integral part of a new CAP.  This EIP was launched this week and the call that will be open until 29 January is an opportunity for farmers, community groups, voluntary organisations, farm organisations and the rest to come together and put forward their ideas.  We will evaluate them and fund the best of them that have the ability to be scaled up.  The EIP model has been successful in many other areas and one I am very excited about using in the area of farm safety.</p>  <p>  We also secured &euro;14 million for our training budget that will train up to 50,000 farmers in the area of farmer health and well-being.  That will be rolled out throughout 2021.  The train the trainer programme, On Firm Ground, where we take farm advisers and advise them on how best to deal with the farmers they deal with on a daily basis, is another element to that.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge my work with the Minister of State, Deputy English, regarding our restructuring of the farm safety partnership as part of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  I also have ambitions to develop a dedicated Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine farm safety strategy that will roll that out.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge again the role of the Department of Finance.  I hope this accelerated capital allowance will be welcomed and supported by Members of the House.  I outlined the other measures because the accelerated capital allowance alone is not a panacea but it is a very important step in a range of measures we are taking to make our farms safer, drive down the number of farm safety incidents and the unacceptably high level of fatalities and significant injuries we are seeing on farms across the country.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and compliment him on his appointment and on this initiative, which he understands because he is a farmer.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, embraced it and made efforts in terms of faster tax rebates and relief because the number of incidents and accidents on farms that result in loss of life and loss of limb is shocking and they bring trauma to wives, husbands and families as well as the entire farming community.  In the past, farms were full family enterprises.  They have become very lonely places but not any less dangerous.  They are probably more dangerous because of the size of the tractors and other equipment.  All the measures the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, outlined for people who have had accidents are very important.  He referred to quick hitches, hand levers, front and rear pick-ups and so on but they will not deal with the problem of the size of the tractors.  Farmers will not see anything coming in their direction because they are ginormous.  Unfortunately, that is the way farming has gone in terms of everything being so big.</p>  <p>  I welcome the provisions in the Bill and will support the amendment.  I salute everyone involved in farm safety.  A great scheme was set up by two ladies, the name of which will not come to me but the Minister of State might be able to help me.  They had a video on farm safety and went around visiting national schools.  It has stopped now because of the Covid-19 pandemic but it was a wonderful scheme.  They gave a talk and showed the video on the inherent risks and dangers on farms.</p> <p>We all see children on tractors and it is frightening.  There is always potential for accidents.  Farms are now a lonely place.  There is normally only one farmer and he will not even see the milkman because they come at three or four in the morning.  That is how it is with Glanbia and the creamery.  This all leads to the conversation about the loss of local pubs, shops and post offices.  It is lonesome.</p> <p> I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to bring up the issue of farm inspections.  They are happening in the middle of Covid.  Farmers need support for mental health.  They cannot get staff because the staff are sick.  There is a farmer in south Tipperary with more than 10,000 sheep.  There is an ongoing battle, although it should not be a battle because he wants to work with inspectors, but they are coming to inspect the sheep.  Why can they not use drones or other forms of technology?  If there is animal cruelty that has to be eradicated - I am all for that.  He has a shepherd who has died and another who is sick.  Now a member of his family is sick from the trauma and stress.  The days are too short now with fog and rain to try to get sheep off the sides of mountains with sheepdogs.  It is nigh impossible.</p> <p> Inspections should be postponed until February or the spring unless there is clear suspicion that there are animal welfare issues, and surely we can examine that with technology.  I thought there was an EU directive that minimal numbers of farm inspections should be happening.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, might be able to clarify that.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and to officials in the Department veterinary office in Tipperary.  It is causing significant pressure and stress.  Farmers need support in these trying times, since they cannot get staff and are dealing with the weather, prices, Covid and lack of people around them on the hillsides of Tipperary and east Cork, including the Galtee Mountains, the Knockmealdown Mountains, and the famed Slievenamon.  Farmers want to work and have complied.  We need engagement and training.</p> <p> I welcome all the changes raised.  I welcome the community aspect too.  I ask the Minister of State to have common sense and to postpone these inspections until the spring, when the days are longer, the weather is better and farmers will have some help again.  It is a lonely occupation and they cannot get staff to do that work.  They have to have trained shepherds to go out and round up sheep with sheepdogs, mind them and get them in for inspection.  Unless there is a desperate, grave need, I appeal for these inspections to stop.  Instead, Department veterinary office inspectors should be asked to visit farmers, do it online or telephone them to support them and ask them what problems they have.  They have many problems with bills to pay at this time of year, poor prices, Brexit worrying them and so on.  We do not need over-regulation and intimidation.  We should support these farmers, many of whom are on their own.  It is lonely.  I wholeheartedly support the amendment and the change regarding farm safety has to be welcomed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300037#MM00200"><p>I welcome this initiative and thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  It is timely and welcome.  It hope it will have a positive impact on many farms across the country.  I ask the Minister of State if he will do two things for me regarding the work he has done for the Minister for Finance.  Will he chat with the Ministers for Finance and Health about some of the 1,500 people with missing limbs who are on the waiting list for the disabled drivers' scheme and are waiting for the primary medical certificate?  It will be some time next year before those farmers and non-farmers get an appointment for that assessment, because of a suspension last June, and another 150 people a month are being added to that, including farmers because of farm accidents.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, might use his influence to put the squeeze on the two Ministers about that issue.  He can facilitate that by supporting amendment No. 82 when we come to it later.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to have a word with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, ComReg and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the roll-out of 5G across the country.  Farmers work on their own in isolated areas and having access to mobile phone coverage is vitally important.  Sadly, every mobile phone licence that was issued in this country to date has been issued solely on the basis of population coverage rather than geographic coverage, which means that farmers who are working out on their land on their own have no way of communicating with someone else to get the services and support that they need if they have an accident.  I ask the Minister to engage with ComReg and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to ensure that the next round of 5G licences is issued on a geographic basis and provides universal geographic coverage across the country so that when farmers find themselves in a predicament where their lives or health are at risk, they are in a position where they can contact someone or the emergency services.</p></speech>

Many accidents happen so it is important that every machine is equipped properly.  The fact that we are going to support it by having accelerated tax incentives is a good bonus.  We have many people involved in farming who have had accidents.  I want to recognise here and put on the record the work of an organisation called Embrace, which educates farmers through the fact that its members lost limbs or were seriously injured in accidents and were lucky enough to survive.  Today is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  It is important that we recognise that the number of accidents that are happening is frightening.  There have been a number of cases in my constituency, including one this year, which involved a person who was alone.  Having proper telephone communication for farmers when they are working in isolation is important.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for the work that has gone into this.  It is the first step in a direction that we have to take.  As I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, I think we would welcome this as something that will be positive.  I would like to see it implemented as soon as possible with the least amount of paperwork attached so that people can avail of it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300037#MM00400"><p>Like other speakers, I welcome this important provision in the Finance Bill and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, for the work that they put into it.  It is long overdue and, as other speakers have pointed out, there is still more to be done, especially the updates to machinery that are simple to apply and do not take even a day to be fitted to be made workable.  One or two things come to mind, such as some of the power take-off, PTO, shaft covers that are still operational which are very difficult to put in place, especially if one person is doing it, which are vital to the safety and maintenance of the machine.</p>  <p>  I also refer to the difficulty with animals.  Animals with which the owner is familiar may well be easy and safe to deal with in ordinary circumstances, but circumstances sometimes change, and with that the animal's attitude may change too.  Without delaying the House, I ask that an awareness campaign be mounted alongside the legislation to ensure that farmers, as other speakers have said, can readily recognise the dangers of working alone and the need to make provision for modern communications in the event of an accident.  We have all heard and dealt with various horrific accidents over the years that have cost the owner of the farm or the person running it a significant amount, through disability and reduction of output, and have made them dependent on others.</p>  <p>I congratulate all involved in this particular provision.  It is well worth doing and was in need of doing for some considerable time.  I hope it will be taken on board by everybody operating machinery and dealing with animals, including those who may find themselves confronted by a stray animal or by an animal on land during hunting time, or whatever the case may be.  All animals are unpredictable and need to be treated as such.</p></speech>

I congratulate all involved.</p></speech>

I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will join me in supporting the County Kildare Access Network's light up Kildare purple week.  That is what I am doing with this mask here today.  The proposal before the House with regard to the accelerated capital allowance addresses the issues of those who have suffered disablement from farm accidents.  It is very much an acknowledgement of them.  On the last point made by Deputy Durkan, the measures covered in this amendment include PTO covers and a quick-hitch mechanism for rear and front three-point linkage to enable the hitching of implements without needing to descend the tractor, thereby taking that risk element out of it.  Some of the measures covered in this list of accelerated capital allowances are preventative ones and some are for those who have suffered injury in the past.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the support of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the establishment of this important list.  As the first Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety, I do not think this list will ever go away.  It might be amended in time, but now we have established the principle of farm safety being an integral part of this budget and every budget that is brought forward.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned a video that was done.  We have seen many bad videos on farm safety.  I commend the students of Nenagh CBS, led by their teacher Paul Butler, for their excellent TikTok video.  The video in question, "Open Your Eyes To Farm Safety", has received the backing of Embrace FARM and others for its really positive approach.  The students in Nenagh have done great work on the positive promotion of farm safety elements.</p>  <p>  I take on board Deputy Naughten's views on the delays that exist.  We want to see these measures developed further because we need to support people who are left behind following the loss of limbs, etc.  I do not want to see anybody left behind, particularly from my perspective on the farm safety side.  We want to assist people in getting their lives back on track.  We also want to stop these accidents happening in the future.  We want to see fewer people on Irish farms suffering such injuries.  I also take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the importance of 5G coverage.  On the broadband side, we have the national broadband plan to roll these services out.  5G and mobile coverage is very important for farmers in isolated areas.  The farm advisers who go into farms to deal with farmers on a daily basis, and are very trusted on farms, can signpost supports to farmers who may be suffering as a result of isolation.  Such supports are now on firm ground.  I have taken on this initiative with my colleague in the Department of Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  It is being jointly funded with my Department.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point about an awareness campaign, I agree that these measures are only as good as the awareness of them.  I intend to make myself available across all local media and beyond over the coming weeks to promote the use of these measures as well as the roll-out of the open call for innovation partnership.  We want to see many applications for that scheme from community groups around the country.</p></speech>

I was very pleased to work with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to bring forward this amendment.  I want to emphasise two points on it.  First, this is as much a preventative measure as it is about trying to support those who have already suffered great disability due to terrible accidents on farms.  We worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to come up with an amendment that would be able to do both.</p>  <p>  Second, the list in section 35, in Part 2 of the Bill, is important because we are looking to put together a list of various forms of equipment that can help those who have suffered and help others to avoid the accidents that can cause such suffering.  I hope the clarity we are providing in the amendment will make it easy for Revenue to be able to implement this measure.  I thank Revenue for its co-operation in this regard.

The amendment seeks a report on the implementation of an 80% cap on capital allowances that can be offset against profits accruing from intellectual property.  This arises from recommendation No. 18 of Seamus Coffey's review of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax code, which was commissioned by the Department of Finance:</p> <blockquote> 	In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, it is recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%. </blockquote>  <p>This policy was endorsed by Professor Stephen Kinsella, who is an associate professor of economics at the University of Limerick, in January 2020:</p> <blockquote> 	Sinn F&eacute;in have correctly identified that intangible assets are a key resource for the Irish economy in the 21st century.  I argued for a rethinking of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with intangible assets some weeks ago, but more importantly, so did the Fiscal Council&rsquo;s Seamus Coffey.  Sinn F&eacute;in want to tax these intangible assets properly.  Introducing an 80% cap on profits in intangible assets, particularly those on-shored between 2015 and 2018 by multinationals.  This is an excellent idea that will result in some capital flight from the country, no doubt, but which will fund the Exchequer handsomely and help offset the inevitable loss of tax revenue from the introduction of new OECD rules on digital taxes. </blockquote>  <p>We know that capital allowances for intangible assets are claimed under section 29(1)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section provides for the offsetting of capital allowances on the development or acquisition of a range of intangible assets against the income arising from the use of that intangible asset.  Ireland&rsquo;s national accounts have been impacted by a number of intangible on-shoring events in recent years, with profits generated by these intangible assets now included in gross measures of Ireland&rsquo;s national income.  Most notably of all, there was an increase in the stock of intangible assets in Ireland of approximately &euro;250 billion in the first quarter of 2015, while the fourth quarter of the national accounts for 2016 showed investment in the acquisition of intangible assets of approximately &euro;25 billion.</p><p>What we see here is a great onshoring of intangible assets.  A change that was subsequently made in a Finance Bill a number of years ago does not capture intangible assets that were onshored in the period from 2015 to 2018, which is the crucial relevant period.  As I have said, approximately &euro;250 billion of intangible assets were onshored in one quarter of 2015.</p> <p>This is an issue of fairness.  It is also an issue of timing but it is more than that.  Mr. Seamus Coffey elaborated on it in one of his blogs.  There is a risk that by the time the tax is due - if a company has used up all its allowances such that the full tax is payable and intangible assets may not be written off against profits at a rate of 100% - the company may have restructured or, indeed, international taxation arrangements may have changed.  Therefore, it is important that only 80% can be offset against the relevant profits in any given year, as opposed to the 100%, which rate is applicable only to the assets onshored during the relevant period.  Obviously, if intangibles are onshored after that period, they would be subject to the 80% rate.</p> <p> This is not an insignificant measure.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance lectured me on paying for public services and all the rest of it but this measure is the biggest example of how revenue can be generated at this time.  A measure of this nature, proposed by the former chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the author of the key report on taxation commissioned by the Department of Finance, would yield in excess of &euro;700 million in 2021.  It is not insignificant.  It is a very serious measure and it is worthy of consideration.</p> <p> I have raised this proposal with the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions but he has obviously refused to accept it.  People will draw their own conclusions.  We have had reputational damage regarding this matter because it is all connected to some of the Panama leaks and various restructurings.  When one door was closed to companies, they exploited the loophole under discussion.  Based on all the responses to freedom of information requests I have received, nobody has ever argued for an increase of the rate to 100%.  Based on all the documents I have got from the Department of Finance and from external sources who argued the rate should be increased from 80%, some of whom argued it should be increased to 90%, I have never been able to understand why the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael Noonan, increased it to 100%.  The rate was reduced again to 80%, which is the appropriate rate.  I believe the current Minister reduced it, but, crucially, when he did so, he left a gaping hole.  In other words, the arrangement does not apply to onshored intangibles in the category I have mentioned.</p> <p> The Minister has not argued recently that my proposal would amount to retrospective taxation because I believe that argument has been debunked, including by Mr. Seamus Coffey at the Oireachtas committee.  It is nothing like retrospective taxation.  We are not suggesting that additional taxes be imposed on companies that offset against profits in years gone by at the rate of 100%.  What we are saying is that for 2021, 2022 and years thereafter, companies would not be allowed to offset at a rate of 100% when calculating taxable profits.  Only the rate of 80% would apply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300039#OO00200"><p>I was not lecturing the Deputy yesterday.  We were engaged in a debate.  Each of us was making political points on an important section of the Finance Bill.  It was not a lecture.</p>  <p>  With regard to the amendment, the costs of assets used to generate taxable trading profits are recognised as legitimate business expenses.  While these costs are not fully tax-deductible in the year they are incurred, tax relief is available through capital allowances that spread the cost of the asset over a number of years.  This gives a fairer reflection of the performance of the business for accounting and tax purposes, which is why capital allowances are a well-established feature of most OECD tax codes.</p>  <p>  By the early to mid-2000s, it was clear that the development and exploitation of intangible assets had become a significant driver of economic growth in OECD economies, some of which had introduced specific tax schemes to address the particular features of these assets.  Therefore, the Finance Act 2009 introduced capital allowances for certain intangible assets that a company manages, develops or exploits.  These intellectual property allowances encourage substantive activity and high-quality employment in the management and exploitation of intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, know-how, customer lists and research rights.</p>  <p>  The success of our approach to encouraging genuine substantive investment is clear from Revenue analysis that shows that claimants of intellectual property allowances accounted for 24% of net corporate tax payments in 2019.  In addition to corporation tax, claimants of intellectual property allowances are making a significant contribution to the Exchequer in the form of payroll tax receipts.  When intellectual property allowances were introduced, the maximum deduction available for such allowances and related interest was restricted to 80% of income from the relevant trade.  No such cap applies to other capital allowances so the cap was removed in the Finance Act 2014 to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of other assets and similar assets in other jurisdictions.  The 80% cap was reintroduced in budget 2018.  It was in response to a recommendation in the Coffey report with the aim of smoothing corporate tax receipts and helping to support their sustainability.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is well aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect.  The cap does not affect the overall quantum of relief; it merely extends the period over which intellectual property allowances are used, with any restricted amounts carried forward for use in later periods, subject to the 80% cap in those periods.  It is relevant to note IDA Ireland's assessment that Ireland offers a strong and growing research, development and innovation environment and its finding that one third of multinationals in Ireland have had operations here for more than 20 years.  These companies have long-established and deep-rooted links to the Irish economy, which are supported by our stable and transparent approach to corporate tax policy.  Having regard to the volume of discussion on record with regard to this issue, I do not believe a report would add further value.  What I have sought to do in finance Bills in this area was make the changes I believe are important to ensure our tax code is in line with the kinds of standards needed in Europe and across the world.  I have also sought to make the changes in such a way as to strike the right balance between competitiveness and certainty in our tax code.  The change I made in the relevant Finance Bill and in budget 2018 got that balance right.  Even since then, we have seen continued growth in corporate tax receipts, which shows that the foreign direct investment in our economy and companies that have been located here for so long continue to be so important from employment and income points of view.  It is a question of making changes that bring our method of taxing intellectual property into line with standards in this regard across the world.  Also, it is appropriate that we do so in a way that continues to respect the fact that stability within our tax code is important.  That is what I have sought to do in making changes in this area and others, and I do not believe a further report is merited.</p></speech>

Others, including professors of economics and the former chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, have added their weight to the debate.  The Minister blatantly refuses to do as proposed.  One could refer to the existing arrangement as a loophole, but loopholes are not supposed to be designed.  The arrangement is deliberately designed.  We are aware it exists in our tax law.  It benefits one company, in particular.  It allows it to reduce its tax liability by millions of euro, or possibly hundreds of millions of euro.  The benefit of the change would be that it would yield more than &euro;700 million per year.</p></speech>

It is a considerable relief to support the development of the film industry.  However, as the Minister knows, the specific condition attaching to this relief is that, in order to access the relief, the film producers must provide quality employment and training and must comply with all relevant legislation on workers' rights.  They must also take responsibility for their employees and trainees.</p>  <p>  My amendment is asking for the Government to investigate with a review, to be done in a very short time, as to whether that is happening.  I have also added a particular reference to the question of acknowledgement of service of employees who have worked for those same film producers over many years.</p> <p>That acknowledgement is required under fixed-term workers contract law.  Despite the Minister's efforts and mine, and despite the declaration forms that film production companies are supposed to fill in and in which they must solemnly commit to give quality employment, take responsibility for employees and comply with all employment law, they are brazenly flouting that law, refusing to acknowledge the legal rights of their employees and blacklisting out of the industry those who attempt to assert their rights.  They have already blacklisted a significant cohort of people.  They are signing the declaration, which is the condition for getting the relief, and committing to the requirements, but they then walk into the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to state publicly that they are doing none of that.</p> <p> All the Minister has to do to establish that the relief is being abused, the law is being broken and rights are being denied is cross-check the declarations given by these producer companies with the statements they are making in the Labour Court and the WRC when the workers engaging in their film productions, which are supported by public money, attempt to assert their rights.  Workers recently attempted to assert their rights around the issue of collective agreements made with film producer companies.</p> <p> I will provide evidence to back up what I am saying.  A letter went to the Minister this morning from representatives of the workers.  Its two pages briefly summarise the situation and I appeal to the Minister to read it carefully.  I will cite a submission to the Labour Court, dated 19 September, from a film producer company that has got a great deal of money for many years.  Workers engaged in the company's productions took a case over a breach of a collective agreement.  According to the producer, which signed the Minister's declaration, the claims were raised on behalf of a number of individuals who were previously engaged on productions associated with the respondent, that being, the producer.  The producer stated that neither this nor any of the other complainants were its employees.  It accepted that they were associated with and employed on productions funded with section 481 reliefs, but in an Orwellian twist, it claimed they were not its employees.  It went on to say that workers such as the complainant were engaged by designated activity companies, DACs, which were set up specifically for each production if and when commissioned, that there were no employment contracts with the respondent and that any employment relationship existed between the employee and the specific DAC.  It claimed that, as such, each DAC was the employer and there was no continuity of service where an individual was employed by different DACs.  The worker in this case had worked for that film producer, who gets money from the State on the basis of complying with the fixed-term workers Act, for ten years.  This is a flagrant breach of the declaration.</p> <p> On 6 October, the CEO of Screen Producers Ireland gave evidence in the Labour Court in a case involving another producer.  She stated that she would give evidence before the court that there was no possible basis, having regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties, those being the employees who worked on the film production and the film producer, which got the section 481 relief on the specific requirement that it be the employer and acknowledge all the rights of the employees.  This could not be more blatant.</p> <p> The Minister has published a declaration that commendably requires producers to give commitments.  They sign the declaration, take the money from him and then publicly go to a State body and say none of these legislative measures apply to them because they do not provide employment to anyone and they do not have employees at all.  The next day, they return to the Minister and tell him to give them some money because they will provide employment.  The Minister cannot let this stand.  Will he investigate these cases seriously and withdraw section 481 relief from companies that are abusing him and the taxpayer?</p></speech>

As he acknowledged, I made changes on foot of that.</p>  <p>  We debated this issue on Committee Stage.  I will not repeat the arguments because the Deputy knows what they are and he knows that I take this matter seriously.  As I indicated to him in the previous debate, it is my view that the conditions must be met, not just by a producer company, but by the DAC formed for the production of a film.  If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, it may not be eligible for the corporate tax credit and any amount already claimed may be recoverable, with interest.</p>  <p>  The auditing of many of these issues in the context of employment rights legislation is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am awaiting the outcome of a process that is under way at the WRC.  I hope that there will be agreement later this year on a framework approach to these matters in the sector.  It will be an important step forward in dealing with the issue that Deputy Boyd Barrett and I have debated for the past number of Finance Bills.  My departmental officials are following the process in the WRC.  We hope that it will yield a successful conclusion.  We will then use a framework that may emerge from it as another way in which the various issues that we are debating can be monitored.</p>  <p>  If further action is needed, I will take it because I take this matter seriously.  I will read the letter that the Deputy mentioned.  I have not seen it yet because it only seems to have been issued to me today.  The next step for me in trying to reach an overall agreement on issues within the sector will be the process at the WRC.  If that process yields an agreement, which I hope it will, it will be a further way in which the issues we are debating can be addressed.</p></speech>

I have given him some new information, which I hope he will follow up.  The letter, which he would have got today, elaborates on that.</p>  <p>  There is Orwellian, Janus-faced double-speak coming from the producers that are getting the relief.  In order to get the money, they are telling the Minister that they will do certain things.  They are not just quietly not doing them and breaking their commitments, though.  Rather, they are breaking them publicly.  Their representative from Screen Producers Ireland has given witness evidence in court against workers to the effect that the recipients of section 481 relief could never be anyone's employer.  This is a serious abuse.  The same producer companies are getting the relief year after year.</p>  <p>  The consequences for the workers are serious.  If the continuity of service provided by someone whom the respondent agreed had been working on productions associated with it for ten years did not make the producer the employer, it means the employee's pension rights are messed up.</p> <p>The Unfair Dismissals Act does not apply to them.  Rights they have by law simply disappear because a producer who gets the relief sets up a designated activity company, DAC, then says he or she has nothing to do with any of these things or the employees in the DAC.  It is shocking.  The consequence is not just for those workers, but for delivering on the creation of an industry with a permanent, developing and trained pool of workers - the crew one needs to make films and, indeed, attract investment to film.</p></speech>

I can remember the exact debate he and I had on this a couple of years ago when I said this tax credit is predicated on quality employment being made available.  He asked me in the D&aacute;il Chamber what would happen with the tax credit if that quality employment was not available.  I said at that point we would have to review how the tax credit is being made available and what the consequences would be for the company in receipt of it.  That is what we have done with the process that is in place.</p>  <p>  I will look at the information Deputy Boyd Barrett has shared with me.  I assure him of my continued interest in this matter and my hope that the process that is under way in the WRC, which I believe our debates and the action I have taken in previous Finance Bills have been a catalyst for, can lead to changes that get the balance right between creativity in the sector, despite the fact I know employment can change from project to project and film to film, and making progress on issues which appear to be there from an industrial relations point of view and an employment rights perspective.  We will continue to debate this matter and I will continue to be interested in it.  I hope later in the year or early next year we see a step forward in the WRC on this matter.</p></speech>

I will make one or two other brief supplementary points for his consideration.  There has been much talk about the possibility of a collective agreement as a way of resolving this.  I will point out that the producers to whom I refer, and the people who support no change in the situation and who were defending the<i>status quo</i>in terms of denying responsibility for employment, essentially refused to go to the forum for stakeholders that was agreed by the Oireachtas joint committee.  They refused and, effectively, vetoed that forum.</p><p>One way to resolve it is for the Minister to have the forum, to have everybody in and to hear the case in front of independent people, like the Minister, who can hear the points and then adjudicate independently on it.  There is intense lobbying coming from a certain sector that does not want the change.  If it has nothing to hide, or if anybody else has nothing to hide, bring them all in and let us hear from them.  Let us hear the different cases and make a fair and independent adjudication.</p><p>In terms of a collective agreement, no collective agreement is legally possible if we are not talking about the employer and employee.  When there is reference to the Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, employment agreement or a collective agreement, SPI is a representative body and is not an employer.  In fact, it is saying publicly that its members are not employers.  Its members or it, as a body, cannot legally establish a collective agreement because it is saying it is not the employer.  Only employers and employees can have a collective agreement.  By the way, the Labour Court found in a recent hearing that these same producers were in breach of a collective agreement they had previously undertaken.</p></speech>

I will make a brief point.  This amendment is about loopholes and establishing a minimum effective corporate tax rate.  We have rehearsed the argument at length.  I believe, however, the argument the Minister makes is that if we did this, we would somehow endanger foreign multinational investment in this country.  I do not believe that is true because they are paying such a low level of tax.</p><p>As I pointed out to the Minister the other day, even on the day Mr. Joe Biden was elected, Mr. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat congressman, was asked on national radio whether these multinational companies would leave if a little bit more tax was requested or levied on them.  He said he did not believe so because they make so much profit here and Ireland is such an ideal location, particularly because of our trained and skilled workforce, our access to European markets and the fact we are English speaking.</p><p>Why would we not consider having a minimum effective corporate tax rate to address the clear and fairly brazen exploitation of loopholes, particularly in the areas of intangible assets and intra-group transactions.  By the way, during the Committee Stage debate I was wrong to say that had changed in the layout of the revenue reliefs.  It a bit hard to find online but just so we know, there was &euro;16 billion in intra-group transactions relief.  That is one loophole totalling &euro;16 billion.  That is the movement of profits to subsidiaries where they become costs for those companies, and through that mechanism they write down their tax bill, their taxable profits, to negligible levels.</p><p>I believe the Minister knows the argument.  He knows our view of it but, surely, one way to make things a bit fairer, to get a significant additional tax contribution and to close off what is clearly an abuse, to some degree at least, would be to enforce a minimum effective corporate tax rate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300043#SS00900"><p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 70 which proposes that a report be drawn up to look into the question of a doubling of the corporation tax rates from 12.5% to 25%, which is a policy I support.</p>  <p>  I will start with a couple of clear facts.  The first is that Covid-19 will cost Irish society a large sum of money.  The costs that have been heaped on society by Covid-19 are currently being paid, first and foremost, through borrowing.  I have no problem with that.  One can borrow on the international markets for extremely low rates at the moment. It is not, however, a policy that is indefinitely sustainable and at a certain point, the question will arise as to how this is paid for and who pays for it.  I am opposed to working people paying the price the way they did during the austerity crisis.  I am also opposed, broadly speaking, to middle class people being made to foot that bill.  I believe there are those within Irish society who can afford to pay for it.</p>  <p>  It is also incontrovertible that enormous profits are being made by big business and the multinational sector in this country at the moment.  The figures of the Department of Finance underline that.  The fact the Department of Finance can estimate that corporation tax receipts will raise &euro;12.5 billion this year as opposed to &euro;10.9 billion last year, an increase of more than &euro;1.5 billion, is a sure sign that massive profits are being made at the moment.</p> <p>In fact, 40% of those profits are estimated to be made by three companies alone, namely, Google, Facebook and Apple.  Economists talk about a K-shaped recovery, pointing to the fact that sections of society and of the corporate sector have increased their profits significantly, not despite but because of Covid, in particular in the tech and pharma sectors.  The argument against doubling or increasing corporation tax, or even collecting all corporation tax, is that if we go down this road, corporations will do a runner.  The argument is that they will go and there will be severe job losses as a result.</p> <p> Is this the case?  Why do corporations come here in the first place?  The tax policy, without doubt, is a factor, but there are other, larger factors.  The pool of educated, skilled labour in this country is a major one.  That Ireland is a country where English is the language that the majority of people living in the country can speak and that it has access to the EU market have always been key factors for multinational investment in this country.  A major change is taking place, however, about which there has not been sufficient discussion or debate.  Until now, those corporations have had a choice between the UK and Ireland, but Brexit makes Ireland a more attractive country for multinational investment and at the very least would be the basis for a serious review of the 12.5% policy in that regard.</p> <p> This issue is often presented in sensationalist ways by the media and Government politicians.  They say we are talking about a doubling of corporation tax.  Yes, I am; I think corporations can afford it and there would not be a flight of capital if that were to be introduced.  Looked at another way, if we take 12.5%, corporations are left to keep 87.5%, while if we keep 25%, they will be left to keep 75%.  Their profits will be reduced not by one half but by one seventh, a far more modest sum in that regard.  If the State had those resources or the majority of them, and if it could collect the moneys that are currently not collected through all the various dodges that exist, what could be done about a national health service, about investment in social and affordable housing or about eliminating the scourge of poverty from society?  All those issues would come onto the agenda of what would be possible.</p> <p> The proposal is that a report be produced on this issue.  I commend amendment No. 70 to the House.</p></speech>

The trading profits of companies in Ireland are generally taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Some of the main features of the current corporation tax regime are its simplicity and the fact it applies to a broad base.  Our growth-friendly tax system has contributed to improvements in living standards for all citizens and is consistent with the OECD's recommendations for how best to support economic growth.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that a range of analysis has found that the effective corporation tax rate in Ireland is between 10% and 11%.  This includes research conducted by my Department, co-authored by an independent academic, reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and annual data published by the Revenue Commissioners.  While this percentage is lower than the 12.5% rate, this can be attributed to the availability of a small number of targeted tax measures that may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid.  Furthermore, while our headline rate is low, the yield from corporation tax revenue constitutes a substantial portion of Exchequer revenues.  Corporation tax was the third largest tax head in 2019, accounting for more than 18% of total net tax receipts.  For the year to date, corporation tax receipts have continued to perform well, notwithstanding the current economic circumstances.  Sustained corporation tax receipts are critical to maintaining Exchequer revenues and funding the Government supports to both individuals and businesses that have been affected by this disease.</p>  <p>  It is my view that any increase in corporation tax rates would be detrimental to our economy.  Deputies may be aware that the Department carried out a comprehensive economic assessment of our corporation tax policy in 2014, which found that any increase in our tax rate would have had a significant effect on the level of investment within our country.  The implications are very clear.  An increase to our 12.5% corporation tax rate could be expected to damage inward investment flows and reduce investment in economic activity in our State, with negative effects on the overall corporation tax yield and employment.</p>  <p>  On the question of so-called loopholes referred to by Deputies, all companies and self-employed individuals are entitled to take a deduction for legitimate business expenses when calculating their taxable profits.  In addition, Ireland offers a small number of tax measures designed to support particular policy objectives that are clearly set out in law and available to any qualifying company.  Both my Department and Revenue publish detailed information annually outlining the cost of tax expenditures.  Clearly, these statutory deductions and reliefs are not loopholes.  The only way for such reliefs and incentives to be introduced or amended is through the normal legislative process.  In addition, Revenue provides guidance on the conditions for relief and carries out compliance interventions to ensure the accuracy of amounts claimed.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the tax code is under continuous review to ensure it operates as intended.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners work together to bring forward the necessary legislative provisions to address any potential issues that may arise.  Ireland is fully engaged in the international process of tax reform and in this regard works in conjunction with EU and other OECD member states.  By doing so, we have introduced extensive reforms in recent years to tackle aggressive tax planning.  Some of the many actions taken in this regard include reform of company residence rules and transfer pricing rules, the introduction of new controlled foreign company rules, anti-hybrid rules and an exit tax, and improved transparency reporting requirements and information exchange.</p>  <p>  In summary, I believe that the measures proposed to increase the rate in our corporation tax policy would be harmful to jobs and to the investment that is playing such a critical role in providing tax to our country at a time in which it is needed and providing jobs in our country at a time in which they are so badly needed.  It is for those reasons that I will not accept the amendments.</p></speech>

We did that on Committee Stage and the basic points have been outlined during this debate.  Nevertheless, I will make one further point to the Minister.  I have outlined a variety of reasons that corporations invest in this country.</p> <p>I underlined the opinion - I think it is a fact - that a key reason there is high multinational investment in this country is because it is a country where the majority of people speak English and it has access to the European Union market, and that circumstances are about to change with Brexit.  Surely that would point towards the idea of increased investment or, when multinationals are deciding where they will invest, increased attractiveness in Ireland as a location for that.  That, in itself, is an argument for a review of the policy to see whether it is appropriate to increase the tax or leave it as it is.  The Minister did not make any reference in his comments that I caught to that change in circumstance.  Does he not feel that change in circumstance is the basis for looking at this with fresh eyes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-03a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120300045#UU00200"><p>Deputy Barry is correct that there is a change of circumstances with what is happening with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  I make two points on the Deputy's analysis.  The first is that, with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, it does not change the fact that other countries are still eager to maximise the amount of international jobs and investment they could have.  Indeed, the United Kingdom may make decisions in the future regarding what is the rate of corporate tax that it wants to charge in its jurisdiction.  For all of those reasons, it is as important as ever that we have a stable corporate tax rate.  By stable, I not only mean it not going up but that it is equally important to indicate that we are not planning to reduce it either.  Ireland will not be part of any race to the bottom in corporate tax rates.  This is a competitive world for the jobs and investment that are important to our country and the point that Deputy Barry has made does not take away from that.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second point regarding the reason international companies are located here, the Deputy referred to us being an English-speaking country within the European Union.  It is far broader than that.  It is the quality of our education.  It is the quality of our public services.  It is the general tone and attitude that we have here towards companies being located here and a recognition of their value and the jobs that they provide.  It is far bigger than that we are an English-speaking country but the reason Deputy Barry does not want to recognise that is it points to a quality of public services, a quality of education and qualities about our country that do not fit in with the narrative that Deputies such as Deputy Barry have about our country.  There are many reasons that investment is here.  The quality of our education, the quality of our public services and a recognition of the value of investment in our country are easily as important as the fact that we are an English-speaking country.</p></speech>

These are not our figures, but international figures.  Somewhere between &euro;3,000 and &euro;9,000 will be paid by each member of society in this carbon tax.  That is a great deal of money, especially in the middle of a pandemic, and in any case, without any proper fair analysis of the impact this is having and the joined-up thinking.</p><p>We will be told there are different carbon initiatives, different schemes and different advantages.  Where are they for rural Ireland?  They are not there.  For example, there is a two-year waiting list for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, warmer homes scheme.  It is a shocking indictment and so frustrating for people.  The Tipperary Energy Agency, which is in my home town of Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, is wonderful.  It does great work.  Companies have been in touch with me on different occasions over the past number of years because they cannot get paid and they have the works carried out on people's homes to try and generate energy savings and provide some bit of comfort and solace for people living in rural and urban areas.  This scheme covers the country.  When asking will I raise this issue, they then say that we cannot and that if we say anything they will lose the contracts.  They are being held, and they are carrying on credit for work that has done two years previously.</p><p>There is a two-year waiting list and it has grown incrementally.  While that is going on, it is a fake scheme because the funding is not in it.  People want to embrace climate action and climate change and retrofit their homes but they are bogged down in bureaucracy.  Some assessments may be taking place during Covid but no work is being carried out.  One could add another seven or eight months to the waiting list.  In one case, where the family offered to vacate the home in order to have the retrofitting take place, they were told that they still would not get it done.  There is no money in the bank to pay it.  It is as simple as that.  We are taking the people's money under false pretences with no proper analysis or impact assessments of the damage that this is doing to people and the ability to live, and indeed whether we will be successful in our carbon strategy.</p><p>We are pushing this amendment because it is related to a number of amendments that we have down which, obviously, we will not get to.  We are concerned about the bland sweeping action of the Finance Bill and budget 2021 and that we will not have a chance to discuss this again.  As I stated early, we already had the 2040 plan which is destroying rural Ireland - just laying it waste.  With our county development plan being discussed at present - one of the only powers councillors have is the function to make the county development plan - it can be overruled by the Department and by a new quango that has been set up.  It is to Hell or to Connacht for the people and I am saying here, neither to Hell nor to Connacht.  We need to live.  We need to be able to get to and from work.  We need to have services and transport and meaningful schemes, not all announcements for Luas and DART.  I have nothing against the people of Dublin as they need them.</p><p>The Minister earlier was saying that I was not speaking to the amendment.  I am speaking to this set of amendments, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has read out, because the Rural Independents who put them down are hugely concerned and annoyed.</p> <p>We have had tokenism, pious platitudes and all kinds of promises when it comes to getting a bang for our buck and a return for the moneys that have been levied, and will be levied, on men, women and children in families all over the country.  We have got nothing out of the moneys that were levied heretofore.  In fact, it is not true that we got nothing.  We got supports for some greenways and other projects.  As I mentioned earlier, we have a blueway in south Tipperary and a wonderful greenway in Dungarvan and Port L&aacute;irge.  However, the county councils have been left hugely indebted as a result of pushing forward those projects.  I salute the community groups for their work in this area.  I mentioned Knockmealdown Active earlier and other community groups that are doing their best on a daily basis to promote tourism products and a greener economy, with mountain and hill walks and everything else.  That is being taken up in a huge way and people from the cities are going to those areas to walk.  However, we need supports for people who are having to pay out these taxes on their fill of diesel, their home heating oil and their bag of coal, briquettes or heat logs.  We need that support but we are not getting it.</p> <p> I am crying extremely foul that this provision is being introduced for a nine-year period and we will not have a chance to debate it in next year's Finance Bill.  Fair play is all that we want.  Fair play is fine play with me any day but it is a long time since we had fair play for the people of rural Ireland.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows the services are not there.  I hear her talking all the time about a ring road for Galway.  We need a ring road for Tipperary town that will allow people to live their lives.  We pay all the taxes but we do not get the returns.  It is one of the last towns to be bypassed, certainly in County Tipperary, and lorries are parked up there, polluting the air for hours on end as they try to get through.  Business people cannot do business and motorists will not drive into the town.  They park somewhere else, outside the town, which is part of the policy and strategy that was put in place.</p> <p> We will be pressing this amendment.</p></speech>

We had a very detailed discussion on Committee Stage regarding the broad thrust of carbon taxes.  However, in the case of the agricultural sector, there is no alternative available because farmers in Ireland do not have electric tractors.  The whole objective behind carbon taxes is to get people to move to sustainable alternatives.  It is not about bringing in additional income but, rather, getting people to migrate to more sustainable forms of transport.  In the agricultural sector, people do not have such alternatives.</p>  <p>  Farmers are going to face a bill of an extra &euro;27 million in 2021 as a result of the carbon taxes that have been introduced.  As I said, they face those taxes in a situation where they do not have alternative options.  While we can argue over the mechanism of levying carbon taxes on the rest of the population, there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for imposing carbon taxes on agricultural diesel when there is no alternative.  It is disproportionately impacting on rural Ireland and the agricultural sector.  Brexit is coming down the road in the next couple of weeks and there is huge pressure on the beef sector.  These carbon taxes will add to that pressure.  It makes no sense to introduce this particular levy given the current situation in which our agriculture sector finds itself.</p>  <p>  As I have said to the Minister before, the way these taxes are structured is regressive in that they are disproportionately penalising rural Ireland, where alternatives are not available, and not taxing urban Ireland enough to motivate people to get out of their cars and onto public transport.  A total of 37% of our population, or nearly four in ten people, live in isolated rural communities throughout the country.  They do not have alternative modes of transport available to them and, as such, they have no choice but to use their car.  I expect the Minister will respond that farmers can use the taxation code to avail of refunds and rebates in respect of carbon taxes.  However, that option only arises if one is liable to pay tax in the first place.  As we know from the annual Teagasc farm surveys of farm incomes and the huge downward financial pressures being put on farm incomes, many farmers do not have a taxable income.</p>  <p>  Looking at the broader issue of carbon taxes, I have pointed out to the Minister before that, based on the structure that is currently in place, half of households in Dublin will pay less than &euro;9.11 a week in transport costs, when the Dublin Bus subsidy is taken into account, at the point where carbon taxes reach &euro;100 per tonne.  On the other hand, rural commuters, who cannot avail of alternative transport options, will pay &euro;39.50 a week.  In other words, rural people will pay four times more than the Dublin resident who has a bus running by his or her door every five minutes.  The way the charges are structured is unfair.  The carbon tax is a regressive tax when it comes to rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for energy matters, I put alternative proposals for the structuring of carbon taxes to the Minister for Finance.  As a backbench Deputy, I submitted a proposal to the climate action committee.  In our pre-budget submission, I again made the alternative argument to the Minister that we should introduce a system that is based on the actual emissions from vehicles, which would see people paying more when their car is sitting in congestion.  In his response to me on Committee Stage of this Bill, the Minister said that something along these lines could be introduced over the longer term, which might involve altering emissions-testing procedures at national car test centres to read the emissions profile of a vehicle over the period of, say, three months prior to its being brought in for the NCT.  This is the type of innovative change that is needed.  It is the type of innovative change that will motivate people out of their cars and onto public transport where it is available to them.</p>  <p>  We have seen in the past that motor tax has been a far more effective tool than carbon taxes in addressing the environmental issues associated with the use of motor vehicles.  Small incremental taxes do not make people change their behaviour.  The motor taxation changes in respect of diesel led people to change their behaviour in the past and the same approach can work again in the future, if taxes are restructured in a way that penalises the owners of vehicles who drive on congested streets and sit in traffic in congested towns on a regular basis, rather than those who are commuting long distances and do not have alternatives available to them.  I ask the Minister to think again in regard to how we structure carbon taxes.  In regard to the agricultural sector, I plead with him to exempt agricultural fuel from the carbon tax in a context where farmers do not have electric tractors.</p></speech>

Scandalously, it is being perpetrated in the name of environmentalism.</p> <p>There is nothing related to environmentalism with regard to the carbon tax.  The carbon tax is simply another revenue-generating measure.  It would be helpful if people before the House were honest and actually set out what exactly the carbon tax is.  The carbon tax increase on fuel, added on budget night, has done nothing for the environment.  The only net result of that decision on budget day is that less money is in the pockets of people already struggling to make ends meet.</p> <p> This is a tax on ordinary workers and families who do not have alternatives and who simply cannot afford to change their diesel or petrol cars for electric vehicles.  They are the people who are penalised as a result of this tax.  For those who cannot afford to change their home heating system, this is a tax.  For the hundreds of thousands of people who are in rented property and do not have any say whatsoever in the type of home heating oil system in place in their rented properties, this is simply a tax and an additional burden on them.  What is more, the Government Deputies know it.</p> <p> What makes it worse is that there has been no full analysis of the carbon tax that has already been in place.  There has been no analysis of its financial impact on those who are forced to pay it or its environmental impact.  International studies have shown that carbon taxes are actually the most minimal contributors when it comes to actually changing people's behaviour and acting as an incentive for people to address the very real challenges with carbon tax.  Why has the Minister not put in place a systematic appraisal of the carbon taxes already in place with regard to their environmental impact as well as their impact on the financial situation of ordinary workers and families?</p> <p> The Government has not only decided to increase the carbon tax this year and the next, it has decided to legislate for a year-on-year increase until 2030.  That is some arrogance to put in place a punitive tax on ordinary workers and families and then commit every Government until 2030 to introduce similar increases.  The Government did not put in place legislative provisions to ensure that the old age pension would increase every year between now and 2030.  People still do not know what the age of pension entitlement will be in 2030 because, of course, that has been fobbed off for another review.</p> <p> Ordinary people will, at some point, come to the realisation that this is a fraud.  They will come to the realisation that this is not an environmental measure but a punitive tax in the name of environmentalism.  I suggest the House collectively supports the amendments put forward by Deputy Pearse Doherty and others.  We must recognise the failures of the policy to date.  Instead, we must put in place a real climate action strategy that is about working with ordinary workers and families throughout this country, including those from rural communities.  We must work with those who, up until this point, have had no option but to drive their diesel car to work or to heat their homes with solid fuel.  We must work together to address climate change.  We must stop the pretence, the tokenism and the hypocrisy.  We must work with the ordinary working families who have no choice but to hop in their cars every day to drop their children to school because the school transport system is such a mess under the Government.  We must work with the ordinary working families who have go to work away from their local communities because we have not got the regional balance or investment that all these communities are crying out for.  We must work with those who have no choice but to hop in the car to bring their children to their local GAA match because public transport is an absolute joke in rural communities.  We cannot pretend for one second that this carbon tax is about addressing any of those issues.  This is simply a way of increasing the burden on ordinary workers and families for Exchequer funding.  It is a fraud.  I hope the House will take this opportunity to reject its provision in the Finance Bill.</p></speech>

It is turning people against the environmental agenda, environmentalism and the effort to address climate change.  It has no appreciation of the challenges in people's lives.  Approximately 400,000 people in this State live in fuel and energy poverty.  There are commitments in the budget and the Finance Bill concerning mitigation measures.  They are only partial mitigation, however, and do not go anywhere near addressing the impact of the carbon tax in its totality, not this year and certainly not for the years to come.</p>  <p>  The promised retrofitting schemes, the commitment to which I welcome, will not address the shortcomings or offset the impact of the carbon tax this year or into the future.  There are waiting lists in the region of two and a half years.  It should not be forgotten that some of these programmes are specifically targeted towards our most vulnerable, such as people living in poverty or with additional healthcare needs.  The services and supports that are supposed to be in place - I accept Covid has had an impact - are not there for them or are not being delivered on time.  Essentially, this is an additional tax with nothing to offset it in any real or meaningful way.  The retrofitting schemes have to be bolstered.  There needs to be a significant commitment in terms of the recruitment of people.  There are workers ready and willing to do that retrofitting work.  That needs to happen as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  On 1 December, the protections people had against utility disconnections were stopped.  Last year, more than 5,000 people had their electricity disconnected and in excess of 2,400 people had their gas supply disconnected.  There is no commitment or protection from the Government for those people today.  However, we will introduce a carbon tax, essentially an additional levy for people who cannot afford to pay at this point in time.  The public service obligation has been increased by 130%.  Again, this is an additional burden on people whom the Minister intends to levy with a carbon tax as well.  It simply makes no sense to people and they cannot afford it.</p>  <p>  For those living in fuel and energy poverty, there was an emergency credit increase from &euro;10 to &euro;100.  However, there was a levy on that.  Instead of paying back the &euro;100 recipients were grateful to get, they were forced to pay up to &euro;170.  People are penalised for living in poverty.  That is the truth.  That is what we get off Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and now the Green Party in government.  The carbon tax is an insult to injury for those people, a point which the Government just does not realise.</p>  <p>  On the just transition fund, those living at the coalface are the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands and the energy sector.  They have been moved out of that employment.  They are living with promises from the Government about alternative pathways which have not materialised, again adding insult to injury.</p>  <p>  The previous Government committed to a strategy to combat energy poverty but that has not materialised.</p> <p>It committed to an independently chaired energy poverty advisory group but this has not materialised.  We are told by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that it will be reviewed next year.  It is simply not good enough.  It does not connect with the day-to-day experience of people and it is completely unacceptable from the Government.</p> <p> With regard to the points made by previous speakers, it is one thing where there are alternatives for people but significant sectors of the population, particularly in rural areas, do not have alternatives available to them.  This carbon tax is all stick.  It adds insult to injury and in my firm opinion it does nothing to serve the environmental green agenda.  In fact, it runs completely contrary to it.  There is a firm commitment to introduce this for a number of years but there is no firm commitment on mitigation measures nor appreciation or understanding of the challenges people have, at a time when we are essentially forcing people back into their cars because Covid-19 means public transport is at 50% or 25%, depending on the level of Covid restrictions.</p> <p> Along with the previous speaker, I support entirely the amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  I firmly believe the Government needs to realise the practical implications of the carbon tax as it is presented for ordinary people living their day-to-day lives when there are no alternatives for them.  The Government has no intention or interest in providing those alternatives.  This raises a serious question about what the carbon tax is about.</p></speech>

Earlier, we spoke about safety on the family farm and the equipment and tax concessions or rebates.  We were applauding one another on the fact this was being introduced and that it is a great move.  What the carbon tax will mean for farmers trying to eke out a living for themselves and their families is that they will pay more in tax and they do not know when or how they will get the alternative.  The alternative will be the electric tractor, electric machinery or another form of an autonomous vehicle they can use on their land.  This will not happen in 2021.  Even if it were available, the cost would probably be prohibitive.</p><p>We have to look at this, and the motivation for our group in tabling the amendment was to highlight the issue.  Where there is no alternative for farmers, the Government should not be taxing them.  I strongly believe the Government should consider this.  We have asked the Minister to do a report in the first 90 days on how he would exclude agricultural diesel from the carbon tax.  It would be a very small token to offer to the farming community when there is no alternative.  We spoke about the just transition and the fact that the carbon tax would be a fund to help us with it.  I fail to see where in the just transition we will fit the farmer who is paying more and who has no alternative.  I ask the Minister to consider the fact that this tax is coming prematurely for the farmers who have no alternative.  Effectively, it is an additional tax.</p><p>I want to speak about fuel poverty.  We have introduced schemes such as the SEAI scheme for improving insulation in houses and we introduced a 100% grant for households that are getting a fuel allowance.  Those applying today will be told they will have to wait 24 months before an engineer will come out to inspect the property to decide the types of measures that can be done.  At the same time, if a family or older couple in fuel poverty need a car, which most people in rural Ireland do, they will pay more for fuel for their vehicles.  They will not get a benefit from the fact the house is not being heated.  They will find again that they are paying a tax without reaping a just reward or being part of the just transition.</p><p>We have heard other speakers discuss public transport and the fact we have very little.  Last night, I was standing in Kildare Street and seven public transport buses passed one after another with signs for different places.  If I saw that in County Galway in Tuam, Gort, Loughrea, Kinvara or Headford, I would ask what was going on because we had a proper public transport system.  However, we do not.</p><p>Because people are trapped and they do not have an alternative, we are penalising them prematurely.  While we need to have a carbon fund we need to make sure that alternatives are in place where we are gathering the funding so people can change their habits.  We all agree that one of the basic fundamentals to make climate action work will be getting people to change the way they do their business and how they travel to work, and all of this has to be taken into account.  We say we have to educate our young people, but while we do not have the infrastructure in areas where no transport is available, we should not be penalising people by taxing them.</p><p>I said yesterday, and I say again today, that the west and north west are regressing in terms of economic development.  This has been told to us by the European Commission.  That area is now in transition and it has been downgraded.  This means the amount of funding being spent <i>per capita</i>in the area is approximately one third of what it is on the east coast.  If we continue with taxation systems that do not take into account the regionality of our country, the diversity we have and the complete inequality in services, we will continue to leave these places lagging behind.  The principle of the just transition is that we will leave nobody behind.  I ask the Minister to look at this from the point of view that these measures will leave a lot of people behind.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that amendment No. 74, which I tabled, was ruled out of order.  I do not know why because it was a very simple amendment based on the fact that agricultural contractors do 90% of the work.  I know the Minister will tell us about the tax rebate the farmers have and that there is double taxation.  The reality is that farm contractors do 90% of the work, be it silage or slurry and various work carried out on the farm, because many farmers do not have time to do that section of the work.  These contractors do not get a grant and they do not get a rebate.  This is why I tabled the amendment in support of the other amendments.</p>  <p>  The Government, which has been like myxomatosis with the Green Party, has now decided that rural Ireland will be the carbon sink for the rest of the country.</p></speech>
