There are many caveats to the plan and my party has many concerns.  What specific input does the Department of Rural and Community Development have into the plan in terms of rural areas?  Will those areas be prioritised as they are the areas that need the plan most?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy and I am glad he raised the issue; as a rural Deputy it is very close to my heart.  As Minister of State with responsibility for community development, natural resources and digital development, I work across both the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I also chair the mobile phone and broadband task force which was established in 2016 to identify and overcome obstacles to mobile phone and broadband services.</p>  <p>  As someone who comes from a rural area, I am keenly aware of the importance of access to high-speed, high-quality broadband services in rural areas and I engage regularly with my ministerial colleagues in both Departments to find ways to remove barriers to the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall policy responsibility for the national broadband plan.  However, the Department of Rural and Community Development works closely with that Department and with local authorities to help prepare rural communities for the roll-out of high-speed broadband.  </p>  <p>  The mobile phone and broadband task force, which is co-ordinated by officials of the two Departments, has successfully addressed a number of complex issues over the past three years, many of which will facilitate the roll-out of the national broadband plan when the contract for the State intervention area is signed.  Quarterly progress reports on the work of the task force are published on the websites of both Departments, with the most recent report covering the first quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development also supports preparations for the roll-out of the national broadband plan through the network of broadband officers located in each local authority.  The broadband officers are co-funded by the Department and provide a vital point of contact for industry and the public regarding telecoms issues. </p>  <p>  The broadband officers are also leading on the development of digital strategies for each local authority.  These digital strategies will enable communities to make full use of digital technology in their daily lives and will be particularly beneficial when the broadband plan is rolled out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900003#A00700"><p>I said this is a potential game changer and a proper roll-out of this plan for many areas might be the last chance saloon.  The Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment said at the end of April that after year ten of the national broadband plan all premises in the intervention areas will have access to high-speed broadband.  The Government in its PR said seven years.  Is it ten or seven?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the role of the broadband officers.  Some of them are doing excellent jobs.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and I have a very good officer in our county.  However, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State advised that many of them - I believe the figure was 18 - had not responded or co-ordinated their activities with the Department.  Has that situation improved?  Did the Minister of State follow up with those reports that were outstanding?</p>  <p>  When does the Minister of State expect the contract for the national broadband plan to be signed?  What are the consequences and penalties for the operator if the operator does not deliver to rural communities, in particular, within a certain timeframe?</p></speech>

I think what the Deputy is referring to is when they were asked to provide some information on black spots and some of them did not respond.  However, at the time they were only just in office and some of them did not know their full role.  Since then ComReg has published the map that shows the black spot areas.  I have met all the broadband officers and the local authority chief executives on a one-to-one basis since I came into office.  I have also met them on a number of occasions at different meetings they have had.  I am very happy that the broadband officers are working to ensure that their rural areas are ready.</p>  <p>  The national broadband plan is to ensure that the 1.1 million people who are mainly living in rural areas will receive an equality of service in the next seven years when the roll-out happens.  The Deputy asked when the contract would be signed.  The conditions are being progressed at the moment and I expect it to be signed before the end of this year.</p></speech>

Given that the contract has yet to be signed, I suggest that the Minister of State and the Minister work to ensure that local companies and local tradespeople are involved in the roll-out of the project to provide employment opportunities.</p><p>If this is done properly - I always add that caveat, as we are still sceptical - it will represent a major infrastructural investment in many communities across the country.  That investment should be aligned with employment opportunities for locally based companies.  In designing the contract over the next few months and then rolling it out, will the Minister of State in his roles in the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Rural and Community Affairs try to ensure that small businesses located in rural areas get a part of it and an opportunity to deliver services in their areas as opposed to what normally happens, that being, large outside contractors - sometimes, they are not on the island - taking all the work with no local return?</p></speech>

That took 40 years, by the way.  We will roll out broadband using current technologies over the next seven years, but it will also be maintained and future-proofed for the next 35 years.  I am proud of this investment, as is everyone in rural Ireland because we have been left behind for so long.  The broadband officers, my Departments and the Ministers, Deputies Ring and Bruton, are working to ensure that everyone will benefit from this as quickly as possible.  Like every other Deputy who lives in rural Ireland, Deputy Calleary knows that there must be broadband and proper connectivity.  In addition, it will not be 30 Mbps.  Rather, it will start at 150 Mbps and increase to 300 Mbps.  That will be a game changer for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The Minister announced earlier this year that he would put an indemnity scheme in place for the owners of land beside walkways so that, if someone wandered onto their land, it would not be an issue if that person got hurt and took a case.  We have heard much about cases in the past week or so.  A great deal of the conflict could be resolved if there was a proper indemnity scheme.  I would like clarity in that regard.  When will the scheme be in place, who will have cover, how will it work, and will it be for marked ways only or will other walkways be covered?  How do we ensure that the tourism potential can be unlocked by having this in place early?</p></reply>

The insurance policy covers trails that meet a specified standard and includes all trails currently included in my Department's walks scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my officials have been working to develop a national scheme to protect private landowners in upland areas from possible claims from recreational users while on their lands.  My Department has been advised that the introduction of any such indemnity scheme would require legislation.  My officials met the Attorney General's office recently to explore the various options open to the Department and to identify the precise legislation that would be required to implement an indemnity scheme.  This is a complex issue, as it is not possible to define trails on hills and mountains in the same manner as the way-marked trails and many of the lands are commonages.</p>  <p>  The legal rights of landowners must also be respected by any scheme while at the same time trying to maintain access to these lands for recreational users on a permissive basis.  My officials will continue to work to resolve this matter.  In the meantime, I will shortly announce the details of a new mandate for Comhairle na Tuaithe, the Countryside Council, to help strengthen the development of the outdoor recreation sector generally and to realise the potential of outdoor activities for the benefit of rural communities.</p></speech>

That is a problem, though, as we all know how long it takes to get legislation through the Houses even when it is clear cut and easy.  The Minister gave people a great deal of hope a few months ago when he stated that he would put a scheme in place.  That was ill-thought out, given that there was no evidence that the proposal could be introduced quickly.  People I have spoken to around the country, in particular people in the tourism business, tell me they are hoping to see more tourists visiting.  Many tourists who are interested in walkways and in using our mountains are visiting Ireland, but the Minister is now saying that the hope he gave to the many parts of rural Ireland where that potential lies must await legislation, which will take a very long time.  This will cause a major difficulty.</p>  <p>  Is there an alternative way to do this?  Has any alternative been considered?  We must put something that works in place quickly.  The issue of legislation just blows this out of the water.</p></speech>

If it were that simple, it would have been in place for the past 20 years, but it is not that easy or simple.  We must introduce legislation.  We are holding discussions with the Attorney General.  We are also examining other ways of doing this.  This is a significant decision.  We are trying to protect the landowners and I want to ensure that we get this right.  This legislation was included in the list of promised legislation that was published earlier this year.  It is my job to ensure that the legislation I introduce is correct.  If we can put a scheme in place without legislation, that will be fine.  We are considering all alternatives, but I must take the advice of the Attorney General.  I do not want incorrect legislation to be introduced and lead to difficulties in the courts, as happened in the past.  We are in talks with the Attorney General and the State Claims Agency.</p>  <p>  I want to resolve this matter.  It is important that no farmer or other landowner ends up before the courts without the protection of the State.  If landowners are allowing people to go through their lands, the State must protect them however it can.  In whatever legislation or scheme I introduce, I must be careful to protect them.

The difficulty is that, when the Minister announced the scheme, he did not say that it would need legislation.  People believed the scheme would arrive sooner.  However, that is as may be.  The greater issue in many areas is the question of the controls that are in place in respect of walkers using lands.  A man told me a couple of weeks ago that, when people came to walk through his land, someone would just pull up in a car, open the boot, three big Labradors would jump out and away they would go.  Some kind of rule need to be in place.  Most of this is happening in mountainous areas where there are sheep.  The landowners are concerned that dogs are worrying their sheep.  The dogs may not attack the sheep, but that they are there barking and howling and running up and down through what is essentially open countryside is causing a major problem.  A tighter regime needs to be put in place to ensure that landowners feel protected.  Ultimately, they are concerned about their livelihoods.  Farmers also use commonages to graze sheep so that they can make a livelihood.  If landowners are put under threat, the Minister will encounter major difficulties in trying to open up such areas.</p></speech>

It will meet again next week.  I expect that it will assist me on the question of legislation in whatever way is necessary.  My first priority is the landowners.  They must be protected.</p>  <p>  The Deputy was right to raise the example of people letting out their Labradors or other dogs, but there is separate legislation to deal with that situation.  Such people should have respect for those who are allowing them to go through their lands.  My priority is to look after the landowners.  They are the people who own the land and have the rights.  They are the ones whom I want to protect.</p>  <p>  I want to open the walkways.</p><p>I want to open the trails.  That is why my Department and I have put substantial money into the outdoor recreation scheme.  These schemes are working well.  They are good for the communities and tourism and for the well-being of people.  They cost nothing.  That is why this year we have doubled the funding for the walks scheme from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million.  I want to ensure that we reward the people who deserve to be rewarded.</p></speech>

In 2016, the amount of funding allocated was in the region of &euro;37.5 million.  For 2018 and 2019, the figure is &euro;39 million.  The projected figures from the Department for the years to 2022 suggest that it will remain at &euro;38 million.  In light of the programmes underpinned by this funding, will the Minister review the amount of money involved?  Given the need in the communities, the programmes underpinned by the funding would effectively see cuts if funding were to remain at the same level when everything else is growing.</p></reply>

The allocation shows an increase to &euro;38.03 million in 2018, up from &euro;37.44 million in 2017.  The 2019 allocation remains the same as in 2018.</p>  <p>  Funding for SICAP from 2020 onwards is subject to the budgetary process.  I assure the Deputy that I will review the level of funding of all programmes each year as part of the budgetary process.  It remains my intention to continue to prioritise funding for SICAP.</p>  <p>  I recognise the vital work of the programme in helping so many individuals by improving the life chances of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or unemployed.</p>  <p>  SICAP also supports collective community engagement and the development of more sustainable and stronger communities.  This is done through providing direct supports to local communities and developing the capacity of local community groups to ensure they can better engage with other groups, actively improve the lives of people in their communities and start to address the social exclusion issues that affect them.</p></speech>

We know at whom the programme is targeted.</p>  <p>  The Minister indicated loosely that he will see what is available during the budgetary process.  That was not exactly what I asked.  I asked him to do it the other way around.  What is the level of need?  What level of funding would be required to deal with the level of deprivation we have across the programmes underpinned by SICAP?  I say this seriously because several programmes dealing with our disadvantaged communities are not seeing annual increases in line with other Departments.  Our disadvantaged communities are not seeing the level of funding increase.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the Minister's funding.  What was known as the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development or RAPID programme has become the community enhancement programme.  We need to target funding where there is deprivation, drug abuse and issues relating to our most disadvantaged communities, but funding for these areas is not increasing.  Rather than simply engage in the budgetary process, I am asking the Minister to review the adequacy of funding of the programmes.</p></speech>

That is a substantial amount.  I would not like the Deputy to think that it is not.  My capital budget is &euro;80 million.  A total of &euro;38 million is going into SICAP.  I agree with Deputy Curran because he is talking my language.  I would like to see the figure doubled if I had the money.  I will be looking at it.  I will be talking to the Minister for Finance and his Department in the coming months about the budgets for the years ahead.  I will see if I can find extra funding.</p>  <p>  I like this scheme.  SICAP deals with disadvantaged areas.  In the last round, a total of 110,000 people were dealt with and supported on a one-to-one basis.  Some 29% lived in disadvantaged areas while 47% were long-term unemployed.  I will outline some more figures.  People gained a great deal of employment from the one-to-one assistance and they created employment.  We dealt with young people and Travellers.  We dealt with people who needed more education.  Deputy Curran is correct in stating that SICAP is a great programme.  I would like to see more funding for it.  My plan is to ensure that the people in disadvantaged areas are looked after.  We have seen &euro;119 million over three years.  The figure of &euro;38 million per year is a substantial amount of money to be putting into these programmes.  Of course I would like to have more.</p></speech>

It is not long since the Government recognised that places such as the north-east inner city required additional funding such was the level of deprivation and intergenerational neglect over a long period.  This is not about casting blame at one Government or another; it persisted for generations.  The Minister states that &euro;119 million over three years is substantial but the problem is that SICAP has to be matched with the other funding programmes.  It needs to grow and to be measured by the element of need in those communities.  In parallel, as I have informed the Minister previously, there must be targeted funding that should and could have come through RAPID, but that is no longer available in the sense that it has now become a community enhancement programme and has a far broader remit.  Our drugs task forces have seen no increase in core funding.  These are not all in the Minister's Department and I am not blaming him for this but we need a joined-up Government approach across all Departments to deal with the issue of significant and sustained disadvantage in particular areas.  The Minister needs to ensure that SICAP grows significantly because the issues the programme deals with are as great today as they ever were.</p></speech>

We have put &euro;5.5 million this year on top of other funding as part of SICAP.  That is joined-up thinking because there was a specific problem there that we dealt with.  I hope we can run other pilot schemes.  There is no doubt that the funding we put in place for inner city Dublin has really worked.</p>  <p>  Let us consider some of the figures again.  Some 15,923 people set up new businesses.  Some 1,695 people from SICAP got into full-time employment.  We dealt with 12,473 young people who were not employed.  We are bringing together and working with local community groups.  Deputy Curran is quite correct in that many of the schemes are tied in with SICAP, but SICAP is different because it deals with individuals and specific problems.  It deals with different areas, including those relevant to Travellers, Roma and people who need further education.  It is about giving people a chance in society.  If we create the jobs we are creating and give people a chance and opportunity, then the programme works well.  It does not matter to me whether we do it for one, 100 or 1,000 once we save one, help one or help numbers of people.  The programme will certainly get people back into the workplace and society.</p>  <p>  Sometimes I listen to people in rural Ireland talking about the difficulties we have.  Sometimes I wish some of these people would go into the inner city in Dublin and other inner city areas to see what is going on.</p></speech>

The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over ten years to the fund.  A total of &euro;315 million is allocated to the fund for the period 2019-22.</p>  <p>  The first call for applications to the fund closed in September 2018.  There was a large response to the first call with 280 applications received.  On foot of the first call, a total of 38 successful category 1 projects and 46 category 2 projects were announced, with funding of &euro;86 million provided from the fund to support projects worth &euro;117 million.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that calls under the fund are determined on a competitive basis and not all projects that meet the requirements may be funded.  In that regard, all applications to the rural regeneration and development fund undergo a detailed evaluation process.  This involves assessment by my Department and oversight by an independent project advisory board established to assist in making recommendations on the suitability of applications for funding.</p>  <p>  Under the first call from the fund, I announced funding of &euro;4.4 million for eight projects located in County Cork.  Among these projects was the development of a multi-purpose flood-lit all-weather facility in the village of Banteer.  The facility will be available for use by the community throughout the year.  Another project involved the relocation, restoration and fit-out of a heritage building in Kinsale town centre as the new library for the town.  A further project involves development of an international standard mountain bike trail in the Ballyhoura region.  The new trail will provide recreational, health and tourism benefits.  Other projects include the development of regeneration strategies for the towns of Rathcormac and Ballydesmond.</p><p> The second call for category 1, shovel-ready applications to the fund is now open.  Applicants who have been unsuccessful in the first call may reapply for the second call.  I want the Deputy to listen to my next point because he always complains.  In 2018 and to date this year, my Department has provided &euro;27.75 million in funding to Cork.  The Deputy might be parochial but I am not.</p></speech>

I do not always complain.  I have praised the Minister on many occasions - possibly more than I have praised most of his ministerial colleagues.  When the Taoiseach launched this fund, he stated that it was set up to create jobs in rural Ireland.  Those 48 projects in Cork county applied for funding in the second round in February.  From what I gather, &euro;276,000 was allocated to the whole of Cork county.  The Minister can juggle figures all day long but those are the facts and they speak for themselves.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a budget of &euro;363 million, which it deserves.  It receives a massive amount of money from rural regeneration funding, as does Coillte, while community and voluntary organisations in west Cork - be they in Schull, Clonakilty, Innishannon, Bandon or Dunmanway - spent &euro;500,000 of their own money and had projects shovel ready but received they did not get funding.  Those groups whose projects were not shovel ready did not receive any advice.  The Minister should not throw dirt at me across the floor of the House.  These are the facts and the facts speak for themselves.</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy the facts.  Kinsale Library was funded, as was Banteer Community Sportsfield.  Unsuccessful projects included those in Ballyvourney, Bandon, Macroom and Bantry, which were not shovel ready, while the Kanturk link road, Schull harbour, Ballinspittle and Skibbereen did not score well compared with others.  Successful projects in category 2 included those relating to Ballydesmond and Ballyvourney.  The development of the rural digital innovation hubs across the country will benefit west Cork.  There were unsuccessful projects that did not score well in comparison with others.  The evaluation board brings the schemes to me and I make the decisions.  Some of these projects did not make the cut because they were not shovel ready or did not score well enough.</p></speech>

These projects are getting no advice as to where they stand.  They are submitting the applications and I am talking to the groups.  There is no communication from the Department from the day those applications arrive to the day the projects discover that they have not been successful.  Yes, Kinsale received funding during the first round, something for which I congratulate and thank the Department, but west Cork has been completely omitted since then.  A total of 48 projects received little or no funding in the second round.  The amount involved, after so many millions had been spent throughout the country, was &euro;276,000.  Why was proper advice not given to these communities?  The Minister should remember that these are community and voluntary groups.  They do not have &euro;363 million like the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the budget of which the Minister tops up, or Coillte, the budget of which is also topped up.  These groups have received no advice and the Department or the local authority should come back to them and explain matters.  I am concerned that this matter is turning into a political football.  Local community and voluntary groups are being overlooked and Ministers can wag the tail of the Government.  We must turn it around.  This funding was meant for rural projects but it is not being delivered in rural areas.  Six Fine Gael councillors ran in west Cork but only two got across the line thanks to the Government.  They are great people but the Government let them down in the Clonakilty-Bantry electoral area.  West Cork has had it with the Government, not with me.</p></speech>

It means that the project is ready to go when it gets the grant aid.  The county council sent us an application for a project and told us that it would be ready in the fourth quarter so it wanted us to allocate money for a project that would not commence until December of next year.  That is not shovel ready.  Shovel ready means that a scheme can start the minute the funding is granted.  Any of the projects that were shovel ready were considered by the evaluation committee.</p>  <p>  The Deputy does not like facts but I will give him the facts.  My Department has allocated &euro;27.75 million in funding to Cork in 2018 and to date this year.  That is a substantial amount of money.  LEADER, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation scheme and the local improvement scheme and many other projects in Cork were funded by the Department.

Here is a fact for the Minister; the EU has downgraded the Border, midland and western, BMW, region from developed to a region in transition after an independent analysis of the GDP figures for the period 2015 to 2017.  This proves what we all know but we now need to act.  Are opportunities available for that?  The Minister cannot do this on his own.  We need a whole-of-Cabinet approach to rebalancing regional growth in this country.  Those figures show that it is not happening.</p></reply>

The main EU funding streams for cohesion policy and regional development include: the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the European Social Fund, which is overseen by the Department of Education and Skills; the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which is delivered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which is also overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  As far as my Department is concerned, EU funding to support regional development is provided through LEADER and the PEACE IV programmes.  Some EU funding is also provided to my Department from the European Social Fund under the SICAP programme.</p>  <p>  LEADER contributes significantly to the development of rural communities and businesses.  Almost 2,000 projects with a value of &euro;69 million have been approved under the current LEADER programme.  LEADER is funded through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.</p>  <p>  PEACE IV is a cross-Border programme for the period 2014 to 2020 that supports peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of the Republic of Ireland.  Overall responsibility for the programme rests with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, my Department is accountable for three of the four measures under the programme.  The total funding allocated to date under these measures is approximately &euro;179 million.</p>  <p>  Both LEADER and PEACE IV make a significant contribution to the development of the regions.</p></speech>

When was the Department informed of that decision and what will be the consequences of that decision?  The Minister outlined the various funds to which the Department has access.  There are proposals in the European Commission to reduce some of those funds.  For example, cohesion funding could potentially be cut by 13%, while there is a &euro;1 billion cut on the table for the CAP, which funds LEADER, particularly in the context of Brexit and the departure of the UK.  What role is the Department playing to protect those funds and defend rural and urban communities from bearing the brunt of cuts to those funds?  What role is the Government playing in the negotiations on the new multi-annual financial framework to ensure that communities, rural and urban, will not take the brunt of these cuts?</p></speech>

When funding is coming from Europe and being allocated to each Department, my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development is to rural-proof the spending of same at Government level.  It is my job to make sure that rural Ireland and, as Deputy Curran consistently argues, the community sector, are given due consideration.  The community sector is very important, particularly in disadvantaged areas and I must make sure that the funding made available to every single Department is rural, urban and community proofed.  I must make sure that we get the funding that we require and that every other Minister understands the issues on the ground.  The Deputy is quite correct in saying that this is not just an issue for one Minister.  I cannot be the only Minister dealing with the development of rural and urban communities.  There must be a combined, across-Government approach.  All Departments must support me and must ensure that a fair percentage of the funding available to them is invested in things like the SICAP, LEADER and other programmes that focus on disadvantaged communities, particularly in rural Ireland.  We must ensure that we develop the regions.</p></speech>

When was he informed of that and what consequences will it have?  I agree with what the Minister just said but the fact remains that the funds to which he refers are under threat.  Decisions on these funds will be made and the groundwork for the next EU budget will be done during the summer period.  We need to know that the Minister will be involved in those decisions and negotiations and that the Taoiseach, in the context of the current negotiations on various jobs within the European Commission, is standing up for these funds because they are the only source of money for many rural and urban communities.  We must be sure that someone stands up for these funds and that we are awake to the threat of losing them.  I have no doubt that the Minister is awake to that threat but I seek assurances that there is a cross-Government approach to protecting these funds in the context of the EU budget negotiations.</p></speech>

Funding of up to &euro;60 million for the programme has been approved by the European Commission, with &euro;30 million in ESF funding being matched by &euro;30 million Exchequer co-funding.</p>  <p>  A number of steps must be taken in order to claim ESF funding for the programme.  In this regard, my Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the ESF managing authority in Ireland, which has submitted an application to the European Commission this month for approval of a repayment method so that the draw down process from the ESF can begin.  The repayment method is due to be approved by a Commission delegated regulation in quarter four of 2019.  No refund of expenditure is possible until this regulation is approved which means that, to date, there has been no draw down of funding from the ESF for SICAP.  In the first quarter of 2020 a claim will be submitted to the European Commission for reimbursement of expenditure for 2018 and 2019, up to the approved budget of &euro;20 million per year.  This will be made up of &euro;10 million in ESF financing and &euro;10 million in national co-funding. </p></speech>

I asked this question because I have a particular interest in highly disadvantaged communities and youth employment in such communities is very relevant in the context of the aforementioned scheme which ran from 2014 and which will cease in 2020.  Why is it that the Department is only submitting an application for funding at the end of the scheme period?  Is this the maximum level of funding that was available?  I ask the Minister to provide details on whether the funding was used for targeted programmes, particularly in the context of youth employment in our more disadvantaged communities.  I understand that the reference year to qualify for funding was 2012, at which point youth unemployment had to be at least 25%.  Certainly, in this country at that time, youth unemployment stood at more than 30%.  Given that the programme timeframe was 2014 to 2020, why is the funding only being drawn down now?  Is the funding being back paid for those earlier years?</p></speech>

The regulation has not been made by Europe but we expect it to be signed in the near future.  When it is signed, we will make our claims.  As I said previously, in 2020 we will be reimbursed for the money we have spent.  This is not the fault of the Department or the Government.  The regulation must be signed by the European Commission and I presume we will have to wait until the new Commission is in place.  The minute the regulation is signed, we will be looking to get our money back.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;60 million is to be spent over three years, at &euro;20 million per annum, in a co-funding arrangement between the EU and the national Government and that money will be spent.  The money will be drawn down as soon as the regulation is signed.  We cannot submit our funding application until the regulation is signed.</p></speech>

Obviously, the regulation has come very late in the process, given that the scheme timeframe is 2014 to 2020.

While all funding must be committed by the end of 2020, payments can and will be made in subsequent years as projects are completed.  This is no different from the situation which applied under the previous LEADER programme.  To date, almost 2,000 LEADER projects have been approved for funding of &euro;69 million by the local action groups, LAGs, which deliver the programme across the country.  Another 373 projects with a value of &euro;26 million are going through the approval process.  Total expenditure to date by the LAGs on the LEADER programme is &euro;50 million.  Of this, just over &euro;21 million has been paid out to more than 800 LEADER projects.  Given the level of additional projects also approved for LEADER funding, it is clear that the level of project payments will rise significantly in the coming months as these projects are delivered.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;27.2 million has been paid in respect of the administration costs of the LAGs, including their engagement with promoters to develop projects.  LEADER administration costs are always higher in the earlier part of the programme as the LAGs work with businesses and communities to develop project proposals.</p><p>However, administration costs cannot exceed 25% of a LAG&rsquo;s budget over the lifetime of the programme.  Therefore, by the time the programme is concluded, there will be three times more expenditure on projects than on administration.  This is similar to the situation with the previous LEADER programme.  The table which accompanies this reply provides details of core project approvals and project expenditure in each LAG area to date.  The figures do not include expenditure under thematic schemes such as the LEADER food initiative and co-operation projects.  These are delivered centrally outside of the LAGs' existing budgets.</p></speech>

What has the result of his work been and has some sort of consistency of performance been established?  Has the Minister looked specifically at those LAGs which are not delivering?  Is there any LAG which is at risk of exceeding the 25% threshold in terms of administration versus overall budget?  Is it the threshold for the overall national budget or does it apply within each company?</p></speech>

It is 25% over the life of the programme and under no circumstances can it be exceeded.  I will not give the Deputy all the same answers he has got before but I will say the following.  He has asked a fair question and I will give him a fair answer.  I refer to the new table that was distributed with the reply.  Every time the Deputy and other colleagues ask this question, I return to my Department, bring in my officials and ask them what is going on.  We have sent officials out to different LEADER companies nationally.  To be fair, some of them are performing very well and some are not performing at all.  I need to look at this and I will do so.  The Deputy asked what we are going to do with the companies that are not performing.  I will soon be in a position to make decisions on budgets and I will reward those LEADER companies that are doing well.  The ones that are not doing well will not be rewarded.  I am looking at the LEADER companies that are not performing and I will have to deal with that.  I am not going to leave it too long either.</p></speech>

I ask him again for the likely expenditure figure in money paid out by the end of 2019.  Have there been any discussions between the Department and the European Commission on the slow expenditure profile?  How does our expenditure profile compare with the expenditure profiles of other countries with LEADER programmes?</p></speech>

Our profile is well up in the first five months of 2019 on the same period last year.  I have no doubt that by the end of the year, we will see a major improvement on spend.  I have to be fair regarding the companies that are allocating the funds.  We have to wait for the schemes to be built and for the work to be done before the money can be drawn down.  That is not what I am worried about.  Where the allocations have at least been made and the projects are going ahead, I can put up with that.  The problem is where no allocation has been made and there is no spend.  I do not want to name names but some are as low as 1% of allocations.  This cannot and will not go on.  I have to do something about it.  I am sick and tired of talking to my officials and telling LEADER companies about it.  People out there tell me they need money to spend on projects they want to complete.  The money is there.  It is European and Irish Government money and I want it spent on projects that provide value for money, create jobs and enhance communities.  I do not want it lying in LEADER companies not being spent.</p></speech>

We saw the green wave in the local elections, which was partly due to the Government's failure to address the issue of climate change, an extremely important matter on which there must be a renewed focus and a proper strategy to implement.  What role does the Department have or is envisaged for it to ensure the targets outlined in the cross-party recommendations of the recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action are implemented?</p></reply>

Acting on climate change now is a Government priority and important for the future of all our communities.  My Department is actively participating in relevant cross-Government discussions and plans and will contribute to the overall national effort on climate action through its work with communities, including communities in rural Ireland.  Supporting the development of resilient and sustainable communities is at the heart of my Department's mission.  I will work with colleagues across Government to deliver a fair transition to a low carbon economy.  To ensure buy-in to the changes in behaviour required, it will be important to support communities, particularly those in rural areas, during the transition.  Engagement with communities will be key to the delivery of climate change targets and my Department will work to make this happen within existing community structures such as local community development committees, or LCDCs.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to support and fund community initiatives to help Ireland's transition to a low carbon society through the wide range of programmes we deliver.  These include the LEADER programme's rural environment theme, which will see almost &euro;24 million invested in projects up to 2020, funding from the rural fund, the social inclusion and community activation programme, and the town and village renewal scheme.  Climate change can present opportunities for rural communities.  As such, I have also allocated LEADER funding to those exploring the potential of renewable energy locally.  Social enterprises can also make an important contribution to Ireland's social and economic progress, including the delivery of environmental and climate action related services.  A draft national social enterprise policy published in April for public consultation closed on 14 May 2019.  The views expressed during the consultation will now be considered by our line Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, in advance of finalising the policy.  Our Department will continue to keep under review its policies as they apply to communities and rural Ireland and each of the funding schemes and programmes to ensure they complement the overall Government objectives of climate change mitigation.</p></speech>

We have received a warning and we must now get off our behinds.  That we need to change is well known across all sectors and communities, both rural and urban.  In rural areas, the big question is how to protect farmers and workers during this change.  In other words, managed change is required.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been a very important strategic employer across the midlands for 60 years or more.  Various communities and families grew up in and around Bord na M&oacute;na's plants and operations, including at Derrygreenagh and Rochfortbridge in County Westmeath, Derryadd and Lanesborough in County Longford and Boora in County Offaly.  Great families were sustained by the work of Bord na M&oacute;na which will now be lost.  The company is to close 17 of its 62 active bogs immediately and is due to end peat harvesting in 45 more within seven years.  Up to 500 jobs will no longer be available.  What plans does the Department have for peat workers, people working in peat factories, harvesters and those in the surrounding communities?  Alternatives must be put in place to secure the future of these families and the workers in those plants.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the transition for farmers, which is very important.  I am sure he will agree that it is also important to state that farming rates at a high level in our carbon emissions only because we are not a very industrialised nation.</p><p>Farming rises in the pecking order as a result.  The Deputy is correct that we must provide supports to ensure that the changes we have to make to farming are transitional.</p> <p> With regard to Bord na M&oacute;na, I am working closely with it in my capacity as Minister of State in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I understand what the Deputy said, but Bord na M&oacute;na can be the model by which all companies in this country go from brown to green.  There are many exciting projects and opportunities in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I visited its site at Mount Lucas and have had a number of meetings with the company about projects that are in development stage, such as fish farming and wind farming.  It has 80,000 ha of land so there is real potential for development and creating jobs in the communities the Deputy mentioned.  I am confident that with Bord na M&oacute;na we will show how to model a brown company to a green company and create additional jobs.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which I strongly support, called for "Developing local economic diversification plans that support decent work and provide community stability in the transition."  If there is a fall off a cliff, it will be a disaster for many areas.  It is important that the Minister of State has development plans and perhaps he is in a position to outline them.  I urge the Department to start those development plans because the Department of Rural and Community Development will be important in responding to that specific recommendation.  That is critical.  We all have a role to play.  Some changes that are perceived as unpalatable will be required, but they are for the betterment of the long-term future of the country.  We have to tackle it but it must be in a planned and phased way with proper transition periods and set objectives which will ensure that people can still earn a living in their rural communities.</p></speech>

It is important to speak about the just transition.  People are beating a drum for making changes quickly now, but that will be more harmful to our country and people, especially to rural Ireland.  We must plan for the future and ensure that we bring everybody along with us.  There is a great responsibility on all of us.  It starts with the Government and the action plan.  With regard to rural areas, we cannot simply use a big mallet to crack a nut, destroy much of rural Ireland and create something we would not like.  We must create the sustainable jobs, provide rural transport and public transport and ensure that when people are told that fossil fuels must no longer be used there are alternatives in place for them.</p></speech>

Last year, I provided a special men's shed fund under the community enhancement programme.  This made &euro;500,000 of ring-fenced funding available to men's sheds groups to carry out minor capital works or to purchase equipment.  Men's sheds groups were also eligible to apply for funding under the main community enhancement programme, under which &euro;12.5 million of funding was made available in 2018.  This year, I have announced an initial allocation of &euro;4.5 million for the community enhancement programme and the men's sheds continue to be eligible to apply for funding under this programme.</p>  <p>  My Department also has responsibility for SICAP, which provided 40 grants to men's sheds groups in 2018.  This support will continue to be available throughout the current SICAP, which runs until 2022.</p>  <p>  Additionally, in 2018, under the LEADER 2014-20 programme, ten projects which are for use by groups, including men's sheds, were approved funding to the value of &euro;670,685.  This funding stream will continue in 2019.</p></speech>

Men's sheds are beneficial for the people who operate in them.  The people who run them in my constituency tell me they have benefitted from them both mentally and physically.  The funding is certainly needed.  The Minister referred to equipment.  It is important for these outlets to provide equipment for these gentlemen to operate.  The Minister spoke about &euro;4.5 million for the community enhancement programme.  Is that for the current year or is it over the 2018 to 2020 period?  It is vital that we encourage men's sheds.  We have seen the number of them in certain areas and the enthusiasm of those who gather in them.  They work not only for themselves in the men's sheds but also for their communities.

Deputy McLoughlin is correct that extra funding was made available last year.  With regard to additional funding this year, it is something I will consider later in the year when I see how my expenditure is going.  I fully support the men's sheds.  The organisation does a tremendous job for the Tidy Towns competition, communities and sporting organisations.  Primarily, however, it gives men an outlet and an opportunity to meet and talk to each other.  That is good for their well-being.  I am delighted with the great success of this scheme.</p></speech>

In talking about men's sheds, we could incorporate females into the sheds as well.</p>  <p>  I know many people who retired some years ago who are now involved with men's sheds.  They are giving back to the community in terms of the expertise they have.  They are also training other men in the men's sheds, which is important.  The Minister is quite right.  It is vital that funding can be made available for the men's sheds in the future.  It is money well spent, whether it comes through the LEADER programme, the community enhancement programme or otherwise.  Equipment and materials are costly and it is important that we ensure the funding is made available for these people to continue the wonderful work they are doing.</p></speech>

During the election campaign, the Minister and I were in Kiltimagh and Ballina with men's sheds.  The local sheds are doing phenomenal work but the national organisation is struggling with success.</p><p>The national organisation is an incredibly hard working team which is trying to co-ordinate all this activity.  Some time ago, when Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was Minister, there was a programme to support national organisations growing at the rate at which the men's sheds is growing.  There are huge local supports for sheds but without national co-ordination, they will certainly not grow and any plans to move them around the world will not proceed either.  I ask the Minister to engage with the national organisation to see if a funding stream could be found to support development workers and give them some back-up that would support the work that is being done on the ground.</p></speech>

Instead of dying away after starting off, it has got stronger and stronger.  I have had a number of meetings with men's sheds and my Department is looking at the applications from the national organisation.  Many applications have been received and I did not realise there were so many organisations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and I are going through them at the moment but it will not be possible to accommodate everybody with the amount of money we have.  Nevertheless, we will make decisions on the applications in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

In this context, my Department is currently involved in comprehensive consultation with the City and County Management Association and other stakeholders to ensure that the LCDC review is as robust as possible.  While this engagement has been very worthwhile, it has taken longer than anticipated.  I expect to have a draft for my consideration very shortly and would hope to publish the final report in July 2019.</p></speech>

However, it is very disappointing that it has taken this long.  The review was set up way back in 2017, when the LCDCs had been in operation for three years.  Various replies, from before the current Minister's time, told us it would be 2018 and early 2019 but now it is to be July 2019.  Is the Minister certain it will be published in July?  This document is vital because we have to look at whether the LCDCs are operating properly in terms of governance.  We also have to look at them in the context of sustainable development goals and climate change, which have taken on a new urgency.</p></speech>

I want to get it right and, as with the social report we did recently, I want to ensure we learn from the past number of years.  I am very confident that I will get the report but I do not want to talk about what will be in it or out of it.  I want it to be robust and I want everybody to have an opportunity to express their views.  I hope we come back with a very strong report.</p>  <p>  The LCDCs are working very well around the country but we need to look at them and see if changes are needed to strengthen them.</p></speech>

The review was to see if the LCDCs were robust in how they operate on the ground but we are now looking at the review to see if it is robust, almost two years after it was due to report.  The Minister will see why I am sceptical about this matter.  We all feel that the LCDCs are doing very good work but the review was to see how effective they were and if they were able to change with the changing circumstances, in particular in the areas of climate change and the sustainable development goals.  It is very disappointing that it will take until July.  Can the Minister assure me that it will be published in July?  Who is actually sitting on it?  How many representatives of the community are involved?  I worked in LCDCs for 17 years and I have a certain scepticism about management pushing things.  The work I have seen on the ground came from the community and that was the best work I have ever seen.</p></speech>

I guarantee that, when I go back today, I will ensure this group gets the report to me immediately.  As soon as I get the report, I want to publish it.  I guarantee that it will be published.  The Deputy is right that this has gone on too long so I will start to put the pressure on now to make sure it is published.  I want to make sure the steering group gets it right.  This is a new Department.  We have done a lot of reviews of schemes in the past 18 months and that all takes time.  The Department is working very hard and I compliment my officials.  The steering group is independent of me but I want it to produce a robust report.  I give the Deputy a guarantee that I will have it ready for July.</p></speech>

The rural opportunity roadshow and campaign was a cross-Government initiative led by my Department.  It was designed to highlight the opportunities available for rural communities to access funding for projects in their areas through the range of programmes provided across Government.  The events took place at rural venues in Thomastown, County Kilkenny; Granard, County Longford; Corofin, County Clare; Drimarone, County Donegal; and Castletownroche, County Cork.  Representatives from community groups and stakeholders in rural areas were invited to the events and we had an excellent response, with over 120 attendees at each event.</p>  <p>  At the events I shared the stage with representatives from communities and business in rural Ireland who successfully availed of Government supports for projects in their area.  These case studies showed how the supports available have made a positive impact in rural Ireland in terms of community development, job creation and tourism and cultural development.  More important, they communicated to those in attendance how such supports could be secured and they hopefully inspired other communities and individuals to develop their own community, tourism or business projects.  In order to spread this message as widely as possible, my Department also created a video which showcased other successful projects funded by Government already delivering in rural Ireland.  This video has been pushed out on social media and has already been viewed over 630,000 times on Twitter.</p>  <p>  After each event, officials from my Department, along with other Departments and State agencies, met with attendees.  They provided guidance and advice to those seeking information on the range of rural supports available.  In that regard, the rural opportunity campaign complemented the helping hands workshops being rolled out by my Department and Pobal, with the help of local authorities and local development companies.  These workshops set out to assist less experienced community groups and organisations in accessing funding schemes and programmes.  The rural opportunity campaign, combined with the assistance provided by the helping hands workshops, will inspire and assist communities all across rural Ireland.  With the aid of the supports available across Government, these communities can make their vision and ambition a reality.</p></speech>

The money being spent in communities by the Department, and as a result of the Minister's intervention via Pobal and other organisations, is very welcome.</p><p>Many communities and businesses wish to improve their lot.  The way to do this is through funding, which is something the Minister can provide.  Hopefully, such funding will be available.  Will the Minister indicate the amount of funding that will be available in coming years?  People in rural areas speak of the Minister, his Department and the money that is being spent.  All communities are benefiting as a result of the intervention of the Minister and his Department.  I can see - and I am sure other Deputies must see - the money that is being spent in constituencies.  Perhaps more funding needs to be made available but I welcome what the Minister said and I ask that he continue what he started.</p></speech>

The rural roadshows were undoubtedly a great success.  They brought together people who drew down funding from LEADER and various Government schemes.  Community activists attended and explained how the schemes worked.  We also sent the Helping Hands roadshow around the country.  I think Deputy Calleary was at the event in Ballina that was attended by a couple of hundred people.  I am trying, particularly with Helping Hands, to do something to which Deputy McLoughlin referred, namely, ensure that groups which do not receive funding get an opportunity to make applications for funding.  I set up Helping Hands and got my officials out to assist communities in order to ensure that they are able to make applications.  Sometimes professional groups or professionals within organisations are able to put applications together.  Sometimes the groups I really want to receive funding are unable to draw it down.  That is why we are out there giving them the help and support to do it.  It is important that every corner of rural Ireland gets the opportunity to be able to make applications and draw down the funding.</p></speech>

It is also important that he listens to the feedback from the roadshow.  It was very clear that the town and village centres need investment.  I compliment the Minister on taking that feedback on board.  The new rural regeneration and development fund applications will be successful, I am told, if there is an emphasis on village and town renewal projects, making them better places in which to live and work.  Will the Minister comment on this?</p></speech>

Sometimes when one listens to national media, one hears about what is going on in rural Ireland.  It is a pity that some of the media did not come out to see what is actually happening on the ground.  I visited the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county, Donegal.  The enthusiasm that was there and the number of people who turned up was remarkable.  I visited Deputy Carey's county, Clare.  One can see what is being done in rural Ireland by community groups.  I will just say that I would love for RT&Eacute; to go out and cover a small bit of positivity and see what is actually happening on the ground.  I would tell Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that is not all bad.  There is a lot of very good stuff happening in counties Kerry, Cork, Donegal and Mayo.  RT&Eacute; does not see the good stuff that is happening and I invite its people down so that I can show them.</p></speech>

The Minister and Deputy Michael Collins had an interaction, rather than a discussion, on this earlier.  The reality is that only 38 of 280 applications were deemed successful for project funding.  The Minister has a concept of a project being shovel ready, and I welcome that, but is the Department's understanding of shovel ready different from that of local authorities?  There is some sort of difficulty in the application process.  The number of projects that are unsuccessful is incredibly high.</p></reply>

The rural regeneration and development fund seeks to support ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities.  The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over ten years to the fund and &euro;315 million is allocated to the fund for the period 2019-2022.</p><p>The first call for applications for the fund closed at the end of September.  There were 280 applications submitted to the first call.  Some 126 applications related to category 1, shovel ready projects and 154 related to category 2 projects, those which needed development funding to become potential category 1 applications in future calls for applications.</p><p>In November 2018, I announced the first set of 18 successful category 1 projects.  These 18 projects received &euro;24.4 million in funding and have an overall value of &euro;34.6 million.  In February, I announced another 20 successful category 1 projects and 46 category 2 projects.  These 66 projects will received &euro;62 million in funding and have a total project value of &euro;83 million.  Overall, the first call from the rural regeneration and development fund will provide &euro;86 million in support for projects worth &euro;117 million.</p><p>In order to ensure the prompt delivery of these important large scale projects, my Department has drawn up contractual obligations for successful applicants with funding based on the achievement of key milestones in the projects.  In that regard, while there has been no drawdown from the fund to date as expected I am pleased that a number of the projects are approaching the completion of their first key milestone.</p><p>I launched the second call for applications to the fund in April 2019.  This current call is open to category 1, shovel ready applications only and the closing date is 12 noon on Tuesday, 6 August.  A further call for category 2 applications will follow in October.  Information on requirements of the second call are on the <i>gov.ie</i>website and information sessions to assist potential applicants will be held by my Department.</p></reply>

What is the timeline in the Department for that money to be drawn down?  Like many funds in his Department, there are many announcements but they are not matched by the drawdown and the expenditure does not seem to match the hype.  Is the Minister monitoring the scheme for potential blockages?  I do not want this scheme end up like LEADER whereby there is inconsistency in areas throughout the country and a huge amount of money is left unspent as the programme comes to an end.  This scheme has the potential to be very successful.</p>  <p>  Is there a difficulty with local authorities providing matching funding?  Are local authorities shovel ready in terms of the money they have to put into this scheme?</p></speech>

We benefited from &euro;7.5 million in the previous round.  For example, great work is being done in Lahinch in advance of the Irish Open.  Money from this fund is being used to upgrade the public realm and make it more attractive.  Lahinch Seaworld is also receiving a massive injection of funds.</p>  <p>  It is important to outline the changes that will be made in the next round.  It will limit the number of applications that can be made to three per local authority or development group.  There should also be an emphasis on upgrading town and village centres.  They are dying and they need investment.  An emphasis needs to be place on them in order to make them more attractive.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Calleary, contractual agreements are entered into in respect of these schemes and timeframes are set out.  The latter include milestones for when funding can be drawn down in the major schemes.  I hope that no local authority made an application without having matching funding ready.  Under the contracts, the work must be done.  These are contractual deals so local authorities must honour what they are doing.  Deputy Calleary asked what is meant by shovel ready.  Shovel ready is when it is ready to proceed.</p></speech>

The funding is &euro;1 billion over ten years and &euro;315 million between 2019 and 2022.  This scheme is going to work.  These are major projects and schemes.

Families who for generations have contributed so much to our democracy, along with our peacekeeping overseas, and who have such pride in the history of our Defence Forces cannot comprehend what is happening to them.  A former head of the Army Ranger Wing, Commandant Cathal Berry, who subsequently headed up the health service in the military, said:</p><blockquote>The sense of absolute betrayal is palpable.  It is visceral.  I have not seen anything even remotely like it in 23 years&rsquo; service.</blockquote><p>On the Government, the previous Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, he said: &quot;To reduce a highly effective and proud organisation to an utterly demoralised outfit over an eight-year period is some achievement.&quot;</p><p>This level of criticism is unprecedented from a former head of the Army Ranger Wing.  It should not be surprising, however, to the Taoiseach and the Government.  The lack of morale, along with the retention crisis within the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, has reduced the capacity and strength of the Defence Forces to an all-time low.  The Taoiseach has been alerted to this time and again in the House and outside it.  I attended a protest march in Cork last month led by former retired Army, Naval Service and Air Corps personnel.  Their language, commentary and speeches at that meeting were on a par with what Commandant Berry has said.  Former Army officers warned about the dismantling of our Defence Forces, the haemorrhaging of experienced personnel, the reduction of its capacity and the length of time it will take to repair and recover from this damage.</p><p>Naval ships have been unable to sail because of a lack of crew.  Up to 50 sailors are sleeping on board naval ships because they cannot afford soaring rents when off-duty.  The Taoiseach is aware of the University of Limerick&rsquo;s research into the conditions of many Army officers.  There are significant safety issues in the Air Corps.  Commandant Berry recalled how a recent recruit who had been in the Army for 12 weeks and was in line for the best soldier award had to go back to his old job working in a meat factory with twice the pay for half the hours.  He said he was not leaving because he hates the Army but because he loves it.  He said he cannot sit back any more and watch the Defence Forces being completely dismantled and demoralised before his eyes.  He spoke about the humiliation and suffocation of the Defence Forces.</p><p>Does the Taoiseach feel ashamed of the manner in which he, the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, have demoralised and dismantled our Defence Forces?  Does he understand the level of anger within Defence Force families and personnel about this continuing neglect?  When is the Government going to finally respond to this crisis in an effective and comprehensive manner?</p></speech>

It was a stinging criticism.  Sometimes the Government needs to hear criticism and sometimes it needs to take it on board.  I am very much aware of the anger among Defence Forces families and members about the current situation.</p>  <p>  When it comes to recruitment, it is actually going very well.  We are recruiting hundreds of new people into our Defence Forces every year-----</p></speech>

It is going into new vessels, new aircraft, new equipment, better and improved barracks, as well as improved pay and pensions for members and retired members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are covered by the public sector pay agreement.  We have a pay agreement across the entire public service which provides for full restoration of pay for almost all public servants, including soldiers and Air Corps and Naval Service personnel by October next year.  That is happening in phases and is already well under way.</p>  <p>  Separate from that, the Public Service Pay Commission has been asked by the Government to consider issues which are unique to the Defence Forces.  It has done that work and received submissions from the Departments of Defence, Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Chief of Staff, senior personnel in the Army and the representative groups like PDFORRA and RACO.  There was a suggestion that this report was to be published yesterday and it had something to do with elections.  That is not correct.  The report was only received recently and has not yet been shared with the Cabinet.  It will be in the next couple of weeks and will be responded to.</p>  <p>  We are serious about responding to the retention difficulties we have in the Defence Forces.  At the same time, however, we have to bear in mind that anything which happens with public sector pay has a knock-on effect.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin&rsquo;s spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, asked me questions last week about where I was going to find extra money for broadband and the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  That was a fair question.  It must be borne in mind that a 2% increase in public sector pay costs about &euro;400 million a year alone.  That is much more than the extra money we need to find for broadband or the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It is not once-off.  It is recurring.  I have to bear that in mind.</p></speech>

The Army goes to the heart of our democracy.  Does the Taoiseach understand that?  We need a strong, proud, healthy and dynamic Defence Forces where morale is high and to which personnel are attracted to stay and develop.  Our Army withstood subversion in the State for over 30 years.  It raised our international reputation by bravely serving in many dangerous overseas missions.  It will protect our citizens again into the future and our democracy against future threats.</p>  <p>  The bottom line, however, is that Commandant Berry was the head of the military medical school.  He met many of those contemplating leaving the Army.  What struck home was the sense that they were being discriminated against not by colour or creed but by the uniform they wear.  That is the overwhelming sense of many within our Defence Forces.  That is why they are leaving in their droves.  It is at a dangerous level.  I have met officers and people across the board.  They are at pains to point out how dangerous this is for our society and democracy and for the health of that democracy.</p><p>The Taoiseach needs to get that point and stop the codology that has been going on for the past two years of burying his head in the sand.  There was a suggestion from Commandant Berry, which most people in the Army, whether rightly or wrongly, believe given everything else that has been announced in the past number of weeks, including &euro;3 billion and billions more for this, that and the other.  However, one thing was not announced.  The Taoiseach has seen the report according to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, as has the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  However, it was not published in advance of the local elections.  Whether that is right or wrong, that is the sense out there among members of the Defence Forces.  When will the Taoiseach comprehensively respond to the wider issue and the lack of morale in our Defence Forces and the danger to our democracy as a result?</p></speech>

We have a strong and proud Defence Forces in this State, ensuring the security of our State, protecting our democracy, asserting our sovereignty, dealing with subversive threats, participating in peacekeeping missions for the UN and the EU - for example, we recently extended the mission in Lebanon - and also providing essential aid to the civil power, particularly the Garda when it comes to dealing with organised crime.  It is not the case, however, that members of our Defence Forces are discriminated against because of their uniform.  In fact, they are tied into the public sector pay agreement so any pay increases that are secured by trade unions, which can go and have gone on strike, also apply to the Defence Forces.  They are part of the public sector pay deal.  That means full restoration of pay for almost everyone in the Defence Forces by October next year, which is already happening in phases.  To give the Deputy an example, the average gross earnings, excluding overseas allowances, for a three star private has gone up to &euro;37,529; for a corporal, it has gone up to &euro;41,000; for a lieutenant, it has gone up to &euro;42,000; for a captain, it has gone up to &euro;56,000; and for a commandant, it has gone up to &euro;66,000.  That is up on where it was a few years ago and it will continue to increase until we have pay restoration by October 2020, as agreed.  The Public Service Pay Commission is examining issues that are particular to the Defence Forces.  We accept there are issues that are particular to the Defence Forces and that it why it has been tasked with that job.</p></speech>

Last week, a man was shot in broad daylight in Darndale in a laneway adjacent to a primary school.  These murders follow on from a spate of other shootings and killings in recent weeks and months in Dublin, Drogheda and other parts of the country, with numerous people dead and seriously injured as a result of criminal feuds.  People in those communities are living in fear.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that these are great communities.  Darndale, Coolock and Drogheda are great communities but people are living in fear and they deserve better.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the complexity of gang feuds and dealing with them, as well as the enormous challenge of tackling gangs which cannot be understated, the reality is that this Government is not doing enough.  The response, to say the least, has been lacklustre.  The Garda has done some good work in recent times.  We have seen drug seizures and arrests but the Garda is operating with one hand tied behind its back.  It is confined by a lack of resources and personnel.  The figures speak for themselves.  We have fewer garda&iacute; now than we had ten years ago.  This is not only an urban issue.  People in rural Ireland are also fearful of crime.  We have had an increase in burglaries and break-ins to people's homes.  People need protection.  Many Garda stations across rural Ireland have fewer garda&iacute; and resources now than they had ten years ago.  Many communities, towns and villages have no Garda stations because they were closed by the Taoiseach's Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The approach to tackling violent crime has been, for the most part, a reactionary one on the part of the Government.  We need more garda&iacute; on the beat and more resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so they can put these people behind bars.  We also need to do more to divert young people from crime.  That means more resources for those who work in the field of tackling drugs and making sure that people have alternatives.  All the drug task forces, which have also been decimated by Government funding cuts under the Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il, are now coming home to roost and are biting.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that these killings are unacceptable and the people in the affected communities deserve better.  What is the Government going to do about them?</p></speech>

I want to share with the House our collective revulsion at the killings that have happened in different parts of Dublin and Drogheda in recent weeks and to express solidarity with the communities in which these killings have happened.  This is a matter which Cabinet discussed on Monday night at the specific request of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who represents Darndale and Coolock which are part of the constituency, and also the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  The Minister for Justice and Equality spoke with the Garda Commissioner about the matter today and intends to visit the area.  I will do the same as soon as I can find a little time.  The people who live in the north-east inner city, Darndale and Drogheda and in Corduff in my constituency are good, hardworking people.  They have a right to feel safe in their homes and communities.  We all share in that sentiment.</p>  <p>  In terms of what the Government is doing, after many years of retrenchment and cutbacks as a consequence of a financial crash, which this Government did not cause, we have now fixed the economy and because of that we have been in a position in recent years to provide unprecedented resources to the Garda.  The Garda budget has increased to &euro;1.76 billion for this year, the highest allocation ever.  The total number of garda&iacute; is now back up to 14,000 and the figure reaches 17,000 if we include civilian staff.  There is now an armed support unit in every Garda region and a 24-7 armed support unit in the Dublin area.  There are 600 garda&iacute; entering training this year.  That does not mean a 600 increase in Garda numbers because there will be retirements but there will be a further increase in the number of garda&iacute; this year.  New headquarters have been established in Kevin Street, Galway and Wexford because it makes sense to have new modern Garda stations, not small ones based on an old fashioned policing model that dates back long before mobile phones and Garda cars.  An additional &euro;10 million has been allocated for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles.  Therefore, action is being taken.</p>  <p>  The Garda has made a lot of progress in tackling the threat of organised crime.  It behoves us to thank garda&iacute; for that and offer our further support.  The Garda is also working closely with colleagues in other jurisdictions in investigating the supply of drugs and guns.  Intelligence-led policing, involving many Garda units around the country, is yielding significant results.  I commend garda&iacute; on their tireless efforts in continuing to tackle organised crime.  They have had huge success in doing that in the north-east inner city, as they had prior to that in Limerick, and I every confidence they will do so again.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the increase that he spoke about has simply not been enough.  Senior garda&iacute; in the affected communities have said that.  We have heard them say it in Drogheda, Dundalk, Dublin and rural parts of Ireland where they simply do not have the required resources.  In 2009, we had 14,547 garda&iacute;.  We now have 14,160, which is 387 fewer and the population has increased.  The Taoiseach referred to the number of Garda recruits.  That number was meant to be 800 but a decision was made to reduce it to 600.  Can the Taoiseach stand over that decision given what has happened?  He acknowledged these are very serious crimes which are having a big impact on the affected communities.  How can he stand over reducing the number of new recruits from 800 to 600?</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that the drug task forces, whose funding have been decimated year on year since 2009, will have their funding restored to 2009 levels?  That is a clear challenge I put to the Taoiseach.  I and the people living in these communities want to hear a clear response to that from the Government.  If the Taoiseach increased the number of new recruits from 600 to 800 and ensured the number of garda&iacute; was restored to at least the number we had ten years ago and funding to the drug taskforces was also restored, people would see more of an effort was being made by the Government.  However, the Government is falling short and that is having an impact in all those communities.</p></speech>

When we approach full employment, there is only a certain number of people who can possibly be recruited into the public workforce or the private workforce.  Notwithstanding that, the Garda budget is at an all-time high of &euro;1.7 billion and extra recruitment is happening every year.  We reopened Templemore after it was closed by a previous Government and have been recruiting ever since.  In fact, 200 more garda&iacute; will come out of Templemore next week.  We will continue to see an increase in the number of garda&iacute; over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner makes a decision on the balance of recruitment between sworn officers - garda&iacute; - and civilian staff.  He took the decision, instead of having 800 sworn officers, to have 600 sworn and 200 civilian staff because for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to work as a modern organisation it also needs to take in civilian staff working in specialist areas.  The increase is still the same but the balance is different.  A modern police force probably needs to have more civilian staff so that it can free up garda&iacute; to do police work.</p></speech>

We cannot reassure ourselves that children are protected.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the national review panel report was published yesterday following a leak.  Co-incidentally, on the same day, a report from HIQA confirmed ongoing inadequacies in child protection.  The summary report is dated December 2018.  I understand it was completed at the end of November.  The clear question is why did it take so long to publish it and why did it have to be leaked.</p>  <p>  The report acknowledges the grave and heinous sexual abuse perpetrated on the three children while they were in the care of the State.  It refers to serious errors of judgment, flawed assessment and decision-making and lack of management oversight.  The report found that sufficient evidence existed at the time to indicate that the children should be moved.  The measures taken by the social work department were deficient, to say the least.  There is a whole list of deficiencies, including a safety plan that was put in place but really not implemented, and rarely referred to in subsequent meetings.  My time is limited so I will not go on.  Has the Taoiseach read the report and what will he do about it?</p>  <p>  On the terms of reference of that report, I have serious concerns as to how this was done from day one.  The final disclosure was in 2011.  The national review panel got its referral in April 2016.  It is now May 2019.  There was a slight delay, it would appear, because somebody somewhere asked it to delay it.  The times are not given, nor who asked for it.  On top of that, there was no publication date.  Yesterday, I raised it with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, who told me it was always going to be yesterday.  Significantly, over the course of a year, in a series of questions asking when this would be published, I got no indication that it would be yesterday.</p>  <p>  I refer to the most grave and heinous abuse.  The response from Tusla, I have to say, was not reassuring when it referred to a point in time because that point in time is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The report from HIQA was co-incidentally published on the same day.  It looked at six national standards and assessed the operation of foster homes in three counties under those headings.  Four were non-compliant and one was "major non-compliant" in relation to child protection and issues in relation to safety plans were ongoing.  A number of other issues were identified, plus an absence of staff and a number of children who do not have a social worker.  Could the Taoiseach tell me, without jargon and without a reply from whoever writes the speeches, in the first instance, what is his response to that summary report?  Can he confirm what actions the Government will take and explain how this report did not come back to a Minister, given the serious nature of this, and to the D&aacute;il for discussion so that we all could take comfort from the reassurance that children are protected?</p></speech>

I have not had a chance to read it yet but I have it and I will certainly read it before the end of the week.  These terrible, tragic and appalling events which befell these young women are almost unspeakable and hard for us to even think about or speak about as human beings.  They are events, though, that occurred in 2007 and the period before that, and much has happened when it comes to child protection since then.  Child protection was not much of a priority for previous Governments.  In fairness to my predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, he made it a priority by establishing a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs and by taking Tusla out of the HSE and establishing it as a stand-alone agency when it was something of an afterthought in previous times.</p>  <p>  Since then, much has been done.  Tusla was established as a stand-alone agency separate from the HSE and a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was carved out of the Department of Health and given full Cabinet status.  We have had a children's rights referendum and we have acted on that, with meaningful legislation and mandatory reporting brought in not too long ago so that people have to report child abuse when it occurs.  That was not the case in the past.  When it comes to foster care, and at the heart of this is a foster care case, there were only three social workers looking after the children in foster care in that region at the time.  Since then resources have been increased fivefold, by 500%.  There are now 15 social workers working with foster care families in that region, making sure that everyone in foster care is assigned to a social worker.  Much progress has been made on child protection in recent years, spearheaded by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the former Minister, now MEP Frances Fitzgerald, before that, but there is always more that needs to be done and we acknowledge that.  That is why the recommendations of this report will be taken seriously and will be responded to.</p></speech>

It was not a point in time.  It did not finish in 2007.  It took until 2011 for a second child, who had been regularly raped, to come forward.  The first child's allegation was deemed credible and the second child's allegation was deemed credible.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach is a busy man.  Yesterday's report from HIQA in relation to Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan confirmed that there are ongoing issues in relation to child protection.  Perhaps somebody could read the report for the Taoiseach and point out the facts, including that the safety plan issue is still a problem and the allocation of social workers is still a problem.</p>  <p>  On the review itself, the system - the social workers and management - failed to comply with their statutory obligations at the time.  They have failed to comply with their statutory obligations on a repeated basis.  Nobody has considered talking to the children who were in that family before these courageous children came forward and made their complaints.  Did it occur to anyone to consider the children who were there previously to see if they were subjected to the same abuse?</p>  <p>  On the terms of reference, has it occurred to the Government to ask how could a report of this significance take so long?  How could a referral be made in April 2016 and how is it that we are talking about it in May 2019 as a result of a leak to RT&Eacute;?  RT&Eacute; deserves "congratulations" from us, if that is an appropriate word.  It was RT&Eacute;'s programme that led to a referral in the first place, not Tusla.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Taoiseach might look at Charleton and other HIQA reports which state that Tusla is incapable of holding a mirror up for reflection.

Once the abuse was disclosed in 2007, there was sufficient evidence for the long-term foster children to have been removed from the family.  This did not happen.  It should have happened and the report calls out some poor decision-making in that regard.  No abuse was found to have occurred after 2007.  However, the reviewers highlighted that the safety plan was not effective and the main weaknesses related to the flaws in the management of the case.  The complexity and seriousness of the credible allegation should have generated a high level co-ordinated and persistent response and the report refers to the prevalence of groupthink as a factor.  The report is clear that social workers in the area were committed and often went above and beyond their brief to provide support.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the report are being closely examined and a number are already being implemented.</p><p>Changes have been made since 2007.  Indeed, these events happened seven years before Tusla was established.  I outlined in my previous reply what has happened since then.</p> <p> It is important to be mindful, and I ask the House to pay attention to this, that a number of the young people involved in this case may still be extremely vulnerable.  The past hurt and current well-being of all young women are a real concern.  While one of the young people in this case has chosen to waive her anonymity, the others have not.  There is legal protection of witnesses in such cases and it is understood that this remains in place as regards the other women involved.  The summary report is understood not to compromise this legally protected anonymity.  We need to ensure that none of us does that.</p></speech>

I thank Maura Canning from the IFA for all the support she gave us at that time and since then.  Since then we have had numerous commitments from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who I accept is genuinely trying to progress the matter, that legislation to give effect to these changes is on the way.</p>  <p>  However, other more serious matters have come to light during the intervening time.  Analysis by Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, revealed that the HSE is paying nursing homes up to seven times more than the fees being paid to private and voluntary counterparts which raises issues of competition and displacement of staff using state aid.  This is totally unacceptable.  This information only came to light after the HSE consistently refused to disclose and stonewalled as to the costs of care in its homes over a five-year period and would not give us answers.  Now we know why.  In the figures released, we see that the spend to provide care for 5,000 residents in nursing homes is approximately &euro;366 million per annum whereas the equivalent spend to support 17,000 residents in private and voluntary nursing homes is just &euro;600 million, which is not even double the earlier figure.  There is something rotten here that has to be rooted out.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must accept that such overpricing is threatening the sustainability of the entire fair deal scheme.  Can the Taoiseach clarify if this is the reason for the delay in introducing the reforms?  Something is holding it up.  Is the HSE resisting this obvious threat to its revenue generating activities?  Goodness knows the HSE is holding up enough issues and is underperforming in so many areas.  It is outrageous to have rural people - farmers and business people - discriminated against in this appalling fashion and it is by no means a recent problem.</p>  <p>  As far back as 2015, I called on the then Minister for Health, t&uacute; f&eacute;in, Taoiseach, to explain to the south Tipperary participants in the fair deal scheme why they are paying, on average, &euro;26,000 extra per year to access the scheme compared to participants in north Tipperary, all of whom are in the same county.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  It is almost ten months since July 2018 when Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, announced that the Cabinet had approved a proposal to change the treatment of farms and businesses under the scheme and to extend a three-year cap to farms and businesses.  The Minister of State said at the time that he was looking forward to progressing changes in the Oireachtas in the autumn session.  Can the Taoiseach please confirm if we are any nearer to progressing this matter, given the considerable delays that farm families and many thousands of other families have already had to endure?  The situation is totally unfair.</p></speech>

I want to recognise the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and the Government of which she was a member, for bringing that through.  It gives fair access to nursing home support to people when they need it.  We are working very hard at the moment to ensure that we keep the turnaround time down to between four and six weeks, which is being achieved.  The budget for this is approximately &euro;1 billion a year, which is a huge amount of money which is being invested in nursing home care for our elderly, when they need it.</p>  <p>  The heads of the Bill being brought forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, are expected to go to Cabinet in June.  That will ensure that the fair deal becomes a fairer deal for people who own a small business and for farmers-----</p></speech>

That legislation is overdue but we expect the heads to be at Cabinet in June, and we will see that through.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about the difference in cost between public and private nursing homes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is doing an analysis of that at the moment.  It is important to bear in mind that we are not necessarily comparing like with like when one compares a public nursing home or community hospital with a private nursing home.  Very often the public nursing home takes in a different profile of resident - often those who have much greater needs and need much greater care and attention.  Given their acuity and need for more care, this requires more staff and more cost comes with that. It is important to compare like with like and comparing public to private nursing homes is like comparing private and public hospitals.  It is not the same thing.  Those with the highest and most expensive care needs are the people who tend to be in the public facilities.</p></speech>

It is daylight robbery of families and it is totally and inherently unfair.  The Taoiseach said the heads of the Bill will be brought to Cabinet in June.  How long more will it take after that?  Will we be out knocking on doors and will the Taoiseach's Government be gone, with the unfairness and the discrimination against rural, farm families and ordinary small businesses still there?  They are entitled to the same care.</p>  <p>  I accept part of the Taoiseach's answer that there may be different needs and care levels in public and private nursing homes, but I will not accept it in full.  There could not be that much discrimination or extra cost.  It is outrageous and people are being milked high and dry.  Farmers and business people need their assets as going concerns in order to work, to be able to pay their taxes, to provide for their families and to pay their employees.  We cannot attack and strip away the resource of those assets year-on-year.  It is totally and inherently unfair and discriminatory against rural families.  I hope somebody challenges this because it is totally illegal.  We had have enough of this.  We fought hard in the programme for Government to get this issue changed and it beggars belief that it would take so long.  The heads of the Bill were supposed to go to Cabinet a long time ago.  The Taoiseach said they are going in June but what progress will be made and what will be the process after the heads go to Cabinet?  How long more will this be delayed?  How long more will this discrimination against rural and farm families and businesses continue?</p></speech>

Clearly, these drug gangs have no respect for human life or for the communities in which they live, given the risk that so many people faced yesterday.  This involved someone driving into a housing estate in Coolock in broad daylight at 3.30 p.m. to assassinate a man who was visiting the family of a man who had been murdered last week.  There are families with children who are afraid to walk the streets in these areas in Dublin, Drogheda and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Heroin use is still a major problem but cocaine use has gone up by 32% on 2017 and its use has doubled in the last six years.

Last week, I tabled a parliamentary question regarding waiting times for child supports in the south east.  The reply seemed to state that the average wait time in Waterford for a child occupational therapist is seven years.  For Carlow-Kilkenny and south Tipperary, it appears to be ten years.  The figures I received indicate that the average wait time for a child speech and language therapist in 2018 was 204 months in Carlow-Kilkenny and 223 months in south Tipperary.  The average wait time for a child occupational therapist was 122 months in Carlow-Kilkenny, 122 months in south Tipperary and 84 months in Waterford.  There is a dire shortage of child psychologists across the State.  This is having an impact.  In my constituency office yesterday, we saw five families of children with complex needs who were in need of supports.  Can the Minister clarify the replies that I received to my parliamentary questions?  I find them astounding and want to know if the figures are accurate.</p></speech>

I can inform the House that the number of people waiting more than three months for an operation or procedure is 10,000 lower than it was this time last year.  The number is also down 2,000 in the past month.

Originally, the strike was due to last ten hours but it will now be for 24.  What contingency plans are in place?  Thus far, the HSE legal team has been dealing with the legal team of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, strikers, and has not been engaging directly with the strikers.  Is the Taoiseach going to ask the Minister to step in or is this a deliberate tactic to undermine the union?  Is the Government willing to endanger lives rather than deal with the strikers face to face in order to put a contingency plan in place?</p>  <p>  The HSE has not responded to three invitations from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to have discussions about this dispute.  It seems the Government would prefer to see about &euro;250,000 paid to a legal team to engage indirectly.  On the Taoiseach's head be it that the first ever strike of this nature is going to proceed and that there has been no direct engagement with the workers involved to put contingency plans in place.</p></speech>

Clonmel is a big town under the guidance of Superintendent Willie Leahy.  Extra officers are needed.  There is also a severe shortage of cars.  I do not know if it is cyclical or whether it is due to the fact that squad cars are only allowed to clock up a certain mileage, but garda&iacute; are being obliged to use their own vehicles or to hire vehicles.  This is appalling.  The Minister mentioned that there is to be a new fleet but there is something wrong with the way the cars are allocated.  The garda&iacute; in Clonmel do not have vehicles at present.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The officers in question are working in Dickensian conditions in Clonmel Garda station.

The ambulance medics are going back out again on Friday for a 24-hour strike.  They have been out three times already and have engaged in two protests outside the D&aacute;il, yet this matter has still not been resolved.  These people have a human right to join the union of their choice.  On the contingency plans, for the previous three days of action the workers came up with the contingency plan, not the HSE.

The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, as always, was helpful but the Minister for Justice and Equality was not present.  I wanted to ask the Minister about Garda overtime.  Is there a problem in that regard?  Have there been cuts?  Are there sufficient personnel to police what is effectively an emergency situation?  Is the 2006 Act - the McDowell Act - infirm in some regards in respect of combating gangland crime and gang leaders?  Do we need to urgently revisit the legislation?  This morning, the Minister mentioned on the radio that he will be liaising with other stakeholders on whatever resources were needed.  I presume these would include Dublin City Council and local community bodies.</p></speech>

It is quite extraordinary that, to date, innocent people have not been caught up in the rampant shootings that are taking place.  Obviously, it is a question of providing more resources and more Garda personnel in that area.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Garda has the expertise to deal with gangland crime and the feuds that are taking place throughout the city and the country?  Would he agree that there is a need for investment in these communities in north Dublin, in Kilmore West and Darndale, including investment in employment, education, youth and community services?  There are great organisations like Northside Partnership, the Dublin North East Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, the Kilmore youth project, and the City of Dublin Youth Service Board.  What is needed is a whole-of-Government approach and a targeted response designed to deal with this problem.</p></speech>

I am from Darndale.</p><p>I grew up there and it is correct to state that great people live in Darndale.  The people of Darndale, Kilmore and Coolock feel they are being ignored.  They feel that resources are going elsewhere.  Will the Taoiseach explain why Garda numbers in Coolock went in one direction, namely, down, between 2011 and 2017?  Will he explain why the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the local anti-drugs unit has plummeted by one third?  Will he also explain why Garda vehicles are not being replaced quickly enough?  The lack of support for those communities and for the garda&iacute; working there is unacceptable.  This matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I was in touch with the Garda Commissioner this morning because I am keen to ensure that those responsible will be brought to justice.  I accept, as Deputy Haughey stated, that our fundamental duty is to ensure the protection of our citizens.  That is why unprecedented resources, amounting to &euro;1.7 billion, are now available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I mentioned earlier the addition of vehicles to the Garda fleet and improved technology.  I assure the Deputies from the area that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making relentless efforts to stop what is, in essence, a local feud.  The armed support unit is active in the area, there have been thousands of Garda checkpoints in recent times and garda&iacute; have been on patrol.  While the unacceptable violence, resulting in murders, has been the issue on everybody's lips in the area, we must acknowledge recent successes on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of arrests and the seizure of weapons, drugs and cash.  On behalf of the Garda Commissioner, I assure the House that those responsible for and engaged in criminal activity will be brought to account.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Haughey that the response has to be more than one of a criminal justice nature.  I spoke to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, during the week regarding this issue.  I will be happy to engage with other colleagues from the area as well to ensure, as Deputy Haughey suggested, that there is a whole-of-Government response.  My responsibility is in the area of criminal justice-----</p></speech>

We all know what is happening in respect of housing.  There are people in Kerry who are being deprived of the right to build their own houses on their own land by one serial objector.  In all of these cases, Kerry County Council had granted planning permission.  However, the objector in question has appealed all of the council's decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Even though inspectors have visited sites and decided that planning permission be granted in line with what Kerry County Council has ordained, An Bord Plean&aacute;la then refuses said permission.  The people who made the applications are left without houses or without the opportunity to build houses for themselves.  They cannot afford to buy houses in towns such as Killarney, Kenmare or Dingle, nor can they afford to seek judicial reviews.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about these serial objectors?</p></speech>

Of the 18,000 built last year, some 3,000 or 4,000 were one-off homes, mostly, but not entirely, in rural areas.  This means that people are obtaining planning permission and that those in rural areas are still able to build houses, as should be the case.  There is a planning process, however, and that must take other important factors into account.  People are entitled to object to a council if they do not believe that permission should be granted.  They are also entitled to appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if they do not agree with the decision of the council.  I do not know if it is feasible in a democracy - and this is a democracy - to bar people from objecting to the granting of planning permission if they wish to do so.</p></speech>

The most recent Fianna F&aacute;il Government had a similar position and it was held by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  One of the things that had a great impact on many counties was the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Ring, two years ago to support the agricultural and industrial shows.  There are shows in Ballivor, Longford, Strokestown, Mohill, County Leitrim, and Bonniconlon, County Mayo.  There are more than 100 shows in all.  The funding provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development was significant and important.  I read an article by Eithne Dodd in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>which indicated that funding has been cut back.  I want to be fair.  The grants are not being taken away entirely but the amounts provided are being reduced.  Those agricultural and industrial shows now have increased insurance costs, as well as many other costs.  They are vital for local economies and add much to the areas in which they take place.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to have an answer today.  Will he, however, ask the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to restore the previous level of funding?  It was a great initiative when it was brought in and it is sad that it has been cut back.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to attend many shows last summer.  I was at the Iverk show in Piltown and also at the show in Virginia.  I hope to have the opportunity to make it to some shows this summer.</p>  <p>  The budget of the Department of Rural and Community Development increased significantly this year.  I think it was one of the biggest percentage increases overall.  It is, however, the responsibility of the Minister to decide how those funds are divvied up.  I am not sure what the situation is exactly in the context of rural shows.  The Minister is in Castlebar at a very important political event, namely, the impending election of Maria Walsh  to the European Parliament, giving Fine Gael a second seat in that constituency and topping off our best result in the European elections since 1984.  I digress but I will definitely get the Minister to check on the issue raised by Deputy Eugene Murphy and respond to him directly.  It might be four seats or five, but it will be the best result for Fine Gael since 1984.  As a result, I have given the Minister the day off.</p></speech>

I have heard reports about inaccuracies in the electoral register.  I will give an example.  A 73 year old man from Mount Melleray in west Waterford turned up to vote, having never missed a vote in 55 years.  When he got to the polling station with his wife, he discovered that he had, through no fault of his own, been removed from the register.  I have also heard reports that people who died in the past year were still on the register.  Are there any plans to try to update the electoral register to ensure that it is accurate?  We hear many reports that it is not accurate.  I imagine that we will be facing into an election cycle in the next 12 months-----</p></speech>

Similar complaints to those raised by the Deputy have reached me from other parts of the country in recent days.  The public consultation report will be published as soon as possible.  The aim is to introduce a new process of online registration, as well as a hard-copy registration process, in the autumn of this year.  Matters are slightly complicated by the fact that we do not want to do anything that would undermine public confidence in the system and the process.  As the Deputy pointed out, we are not yet sure when some future voting events might take place.  However, her point is accurate.  Most of the returns from the public consultation focused on the desirability of using people's PPS numbers to ensure that those who have passed away are removed and also that those who have changed address are registered at the right location.</p></speech>

I speak specifically of the children with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA.  This is raised in this House every week.  I am not just speaking on my own behalf because Deputies Calleary, Aylward, Lisa Chambers and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in have raised this also.  We are meeting the parents of the affected children.  The matter has been on the agenda for a long time.  The Taoiseach, as a medical doctor, will realise that the physical condition of the children is deteriorating.  The one thing they do not have on their side is time.  I have met the affected children in my area.  Their condition is deteriorating.  In the response, the Minister of State will say negotiations are ongoing under the 2013 Act and that there will be a meeting and the HSE will revert to him.  This has gone on month after month and we have not had a positive outcome.  If after the next meeting this is not resolved, will the Taoiseach amend the legislation?  Ireland is the only country in Europe that has not been able to make what I propose available.

I do not believe they should be political decisions.  We decided as a House on a cross-party basis in 2013 to allow independent pharmacologists, doctors and economists to make these decisions.  A decision is made by the HSE's national drugs committee on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  So far, 23 new medicines have been licensed for reimbursement this year but Spinraza is not yet one of them.  I understand the applicant has made a revised proposal.  The applicant was not willing to accept the fair price proposed by the HSE and has made further representations.  The HSE is currently considering that information.  I hear what the Deputy is saying, however.  Very often in Ireland, we fund medicines such as Orkambi long before other countries.  The case in question is an anomaly in the sense that we are one of only two countries in the European Union that is not funding the drug.  This appears to me to be anomalous and I am keen to see this resolved as soon as possible.</p></speech>

One of the challenges we will be working on in the climate will be to show how we can scale those up and develop new models that are capable of being scaled up because of the levels of interest and need.  We are putting a lot of thought into the future rolling out of retrofitting right across the country.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health will be aware of the case of Mr. John Holmes from Kilkenny, who has a very rare form of cancer.  One of the country's foremost experts, Professor John Crown, has recommended that he be treated with Pembrolizumab.  The John Needs Pembro fundraising group and the local community have been doing sterling work in attempting to raise funds to pay for the 30 infusions of the medicine, at a cost of &euro;5,111 for each treatment.  They need help.  The Government must assist Mr. Homes in accessing this treatment.  I request that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, meet the Holmes family as urgently as possible to assist in the case.  I also request that he take immediate steps to reduce the unaffordable price of the drug by removing the cost of VAT on it.  The Government must take steps to assist this man, who has been in a fight for his life for the better part of a decade.  The treatment is effective and the drug is already approved for cancer.  Since the man in question has a rare cancer, it is not recognised.  If it were recognised, he could be treated, at cost.  There is a life at stake here.</p></speech>

The heads of the Bill were approved in June two years ago and pre-legislative scrutiny has taken place.

I am prompted by a constituent who contacted me to advise that Fingal Adventure Centre will not open at North Beach, Rush.  It is saying it is because of the astronomical quotations it has received.  We have no Garda insurance fraud unit and no evidence of the Judicial Council Bill being enacted by the summer.  We have not seen the amendments the Government promised to bring forward to review awards.  There are no amendments from the Minister to Sinn F&eacute;in's Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which, as I understand it, is ready to roll.  Individuals, including small business owners, are watching this and businesses are being forced to close.  Jobs will be lost.  Vital tourism in my constituency will be lost.  Vital tourism revenue will be lost if action is not taken on this.  What is the Taoiseach saying to small businesses about the escalating cost of insurance?</p></speech>

From my perspective, as Minister of Justice and Equality, there are two areas, in particular, where I can act.  The first concerns the Judicial Council Bill and the setting up of a judicial council, one of whose functions will be to introduce guidelines to assist the court.  I expect to have the amendments published within a couple of weeks.  I appeal to Opposition parties in the D&aacute;il to assist the Government in ensuring the enactment of the legislation prior to the summer recess.</p>  <p>  The other area within my remit, raised by Deputy O'Reilly, concerns the matter of insurance fraud.  Again, this is an issue I have discussed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am satisfied there is an expert team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dealing with this issue.  I appeal to the insurance companies to assist in the provision of evidence to the Garda to ensure these issues can be tackled to a greater extent.  I advise Members of the House that any fraud is a crime and is treated as such.</p></speech>

On the following evening, I was honoured to host the delegation at a dinner in Dublin Castle, which was attended by guests representing diverse aspects of the US-Ireland bilateral relationship, including from politics, business, culture and civil society.  The delegation, which comprised nine members of Congress, also included Congressman Richie Neal, who is co-chair of the Friends of Ireland caucus and chairman of the influential Committee on Ways and Means in the House of Representatives.  Our meeting in Government Buildings was an opportunity for a broad-ranging discussion covering Brexit and Northern Ireland, US immigration reform and Ireland-US bilateral relations.</p>  <p>  The delegation apprised me of its visit to the UK immediately before it arrived, where it had held a number of meetings to discuss the implications of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.  The delegation explained that, during its visit to the UK, it repeatedly emphasised its view that Brexit should not impact on the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and that a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland should be avoided in all circumstances.  Speaker Pelosi, Congressman Neal and the other members of the delegation were unwavering in their support for peace in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the continued, unequivocal support of the US Congress on this matter, which is testament to the deep and historical bonds between our two countries and the strong attachment of US politicians to the Good Friday Agreement, given the enormous contribution that some US politicians made in its creation.</p>  <p>  I also thanked the delegation for its continuing backing of Irish immigration priorities, specifically the E3 visa Bill, which has since been reintroduced in the US Congress.  We will continue to work hard to secure the passage of the Bill, which would offer new opportunities for Irish citizens to live and work in the US.  Speaker Pelosi is also aware that we are keenly interested in resolving the situation for the undocumented Irish community in the US and that we will continue to engage with Congress and the US Administration to seek a satisfactory resolution.</p></reply>

There are 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens in the United States.  The Taoiseach has met some of them and has raised this issue on a number of visits to the United States.  They live in a state of continuous fear and worry and are concerned about the failure of the US Congress to pass an immigration reform Bill during the previous congressional term.  The Taoiseach said he had a discussion with Speaker Pelosi on this issue.  What was the outcome of that discussion?  What was her view on how this matter would be progressed?  Was there any sense of a new Bill coming before Congress?  Is there hope that this matter will finally be resolved for the undocumented who need Congress to act to ensure they no longer live in fear?</p></speech>

Did he have any discussions on the possible impact this visit will have on legitimising efforts to sabotage climate change and, more generally, on promoting his toxic agenda on a whole range of issues, whether it is supporting Israeli annexation of Palestinian and Syrian territory, the denial of rights to Palestinians or his sale of arms to despotic regimes such as Saudi Arabia?  The list goes on.  Did the Taoiseach discuss the manner in which Mr. Trump is encouraging very dangerous policies, whether it is from a foreign policy point of view or from a planetary sustainability point of view, and how all of that will be viewed in terms of him coming here and how it will play in the United States?  It seems to me that it does nothing but advance and encourage his agenda.</p></speech>

Many in Congress are just as worried as the majority here about the possibility that we are entering into a period where there will be rising conflict on trade matters.  At various times in the past two years, the Trump Administration has initiated moves against trade with the European Union.  President Trump backed off from some of these moves and there are negotiations under way which appear to be going nowhere.  The expectation is that as he gets closer to his re-election campaign, he will ramp up his rhetoric against trade deals and there will at least be serious turbulence.  There also appears to be no possibility of reactivating the ambitious deal which was being discussed by the European Union and the Obama Administration.  This is serious for Ireland, given how much we rely on international trade for employment.  As we keep seeing from various parties and candidates, anti-trade rhetoric here is strong.  Those who use it are almost never challenged to explain to the workers who rely on trade where else their jobs and wages will come from.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach indicate what he expects to happen in the next six months in the context of US-EU trade talks, the wider trade environment and the implications for Ireland?  Will he raise this matter with President Trump when he arrives in Ireland, in particular his negativity towards the European Union?</p>  <p>  In a wider context, are there any efforts under preparation to explain the central role of trade in Ireland's economy and the implications for us of new barriers to trade being created?  When will we have a debate on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and the EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement in this House?  We provoked a debate on CETA but that was in Private Members' business.  I am at a loss as to why we have not had a full blown debate on the matter in the House.</p></speech>

There is no reason we cannot or should not have a debate.  It is just that a debate has not yet happened.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.  It is appropriate that we should have a debate and I am not entirely sure why we have not had one yet.  CETA and most of the agreements are already in operation, although some have not been formally ratified yet.</p></speech>

They have to be ratified.  There is one particular issue around disputes that has yet to be resolved but I will check the position and revert to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I look forward to discussing trade policy with President Trump when he visits Ireland next week.  I am a big believer in free trade and free enterprise.  Free trade makes us better off in the round and has been very good for Ireland given the extent to which our economy and jobs are based on trade with other European Union countries, the United States and the wider world.  As I understand it, President Trump's current focus is on China but there is a school of thought that he may move his focus towards the European Union later in the year.  That is something that we need to be aware of.  We will need to respond, as a Union of 28 members, to any aggressive action that may take place.  When I meet President Trump I will once again make the case for free trade.  Free trade between the US and EU makes us all better off in the round and creates more jobs in the round.</p><p>I will point out to him again that the relationship between the US and Ireland goes both ways.  It is often seen as though it is only a one-way street, as it was decades ago, but that is not the case anymore.  The US has a large surplus over us in respect of trade of services, while the inverse is true in respect of trade of merchandise.  When the two are taken into account, it works out as approximately even, although often the White House takes only merchandise into account, which I think is flawed.</p> <p> For investment, too, the relationship works both ways.  There are now nearly 100,000 Americans in 50 states working in companies that are Irish and Irish owned but that is not always fully appreciated or well known.  It was once very much a one-way street but it is now a two-way street.  I will use the opportunity of our meeting at Shannon to emphasise that point and our support for free trade between the US and the EU, subject to environmental concerns, health and safety, employment rights and other standards, or what might be called the level playing field.  I will also encourage the President to re-enter negotiations on what would be the largest trade deal ever, namely, between the US and the EU.</p> <p> Climate change was not discussed with the congressional delegation, to my recollection.  The focus was very much on Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement, immigration issues and trade.  At the time, there was no indication of the visit of President Trump and, therefore, it was not discussed either.</p> <p> On the issue of undocumented Irish citizens in the United States, we do not have an accurate figure for the number of people.  Figures range between 10,000 or 15,000 and 50,000, although nobody knows for sure.  I have met undocumented Irish citizens in the US on many occasions, on both official and personal visits, and I feel for them.  Many of them are people who have set up businesses in the US, employ others, pay their taxes and obey the law but they are not able to return home for events such as family funerals.  They fear that should they ever commit a minor offence, it could lead to their deportation and separation from their family.  Most people who assess the situation believe that immigration reform to assist undocumented Irish people in the US can only happen on a comprehensive basis and that it would not be possible to have a pathway to citizenship for Irish people but not for people from Mexico, El Salvador or other parts of the world.  I fully understand that view.  We are not seeking, and have not sought, a special arrangement for Irish people.  It can only be done in the context of wider immigration reform, which is very much what the Democrats in the US Congress have said to us.  The E3 visa is separate and it would be for Ireland only.  It would be available to Irish people who currently reside in Ireland to give them the opportunity to live and work in the US.  Irish people often did that in the past but it is now very difficult.  It would be a sort of modern version of the Morrison visa.  Perhaps we will call it the Richard Neal visa if we get it over the line.</p> <p> The Government has shown a good example on the issue.  We should not be two-faced about it.  There are undocumented people in Ireland, too, and we have introduced a scheme to regularise people who came from overseas on student visas and became undocumented for various reasons thereafter.  It was an important step for us to take as a Government because we cannot go to the US and ask that people who went there on J1 visas and remain there many years later be regularised if we do not adopt a similar approach to people who came here on student visas, remained here, are law-abiding, work and pay their taxes.  Perhaps we have given the US an example it could follow if it ever gets around to comprehensive immigration reform.</p></speech>

As I said in my press statement, I got to know Theresa May quite well over the past two years and I wish her the very best for the future, as I did personally in Brussels yesterday.  The Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and I are committed to maintaining close contact while she continues to be Prime Minister and there will be ongoing engagement between our respective officials.  We will meet again next month in Brussels.  I look forward to working closely with her successor, whoever it may be.</p>  <p>  I saw the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, most recently at the European Council meeting dinner in Brussels last night.  We also met, along with other world leaders, at the Christchurch Call to Action meeting in Paris on 15 May.  While we did not have a substantive meeting on these occasions, we had the opportunity to engage and recalled our prior meeting on 24 April when we both attended the funeral of Ms Lyra McKee in St Anne&rsquo;s Cathedral, Belfast.  In coming together with other political and civic leaders, we paid tribute to Lyra McKee and gave expression to the clear will and determination of all the people of these islands to reject violence and to support peace and a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland.  We also heard the unmistakable message to all political leaders that people throughout Northern Ireland want to see a new momentum for political progress.  At that time, the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and I agreed to initiate a new round of political talks, involving the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, and we issued a joint statement to this effect on 26 April.  The aim of these talks is to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement that are not currently working, namely, the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council.  The other institutions, namely, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, and the British-Irish Council remain in operation.</p>  <p>  The talks process started on 7 May in Stormont, led by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Karen Bradley.  As Taoiseach and Prime Minister, we agreed to review progress in the near future.  The talks are now in their fourth week and I welcome the constructive engagement by all parties.  The Prime Minister and I also agreed in April that a meeting of the BIIGC would take place in London on 8 May.  At this meeting, the BIIGC considered east-west relations, security co-operation and political stability in Northern Ireland.  The opportunity was used to sign a memorandum of understanding to underpin the common travel area.</p></reply>

She had a difficult time, having inherited a difficult issue.  While she doubtless made mistakes, no one could doubt her commitment to the public well-being, her sense of duty as a Prime Minister and her best endeavours to arrive at a reasonable resolution of the Brexit impasse.  Nevertheless, she failed to win the support of her party or the wider British Parliament.</p>  <p>  Two and a half years after the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland were wrongly collapsed due to a heating scheme, there have finally been some serious talks about how to overcome the blockade created by the two largest parties in the North.  It has been reported that next week the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will carry out some form of stock-taking.  Will that happen?  Following the conclusion of the opening period of the talks, very little is known in public about what has been discussed, except the red lines that have, at various times, been reiterated.  Yet again it appears that some participants believe that a parliament is somewhere to go after one's demands have been met, rather than being a place where one goes to promote one's demands.  I will never understand why the entire edifice of the assembly was collapsed over a heating scandal.  We in this Parliament do not decide to collapse D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, nor leave and stay outside for two years, because our demands are not met.  Parliament is not the property of any political party; it is elected by the people, which should be respected but it has not been in the North.</p>  <p>  Equally, it appears that others cannot understand that equality is not an option but an imperative.  In the light of the overall budget review that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced, given that the assembly and the Executive have been suspended, Northern Ireland has no one at the table speaking for its concerns.  Will the Taoiseach commit to raising with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, a concern that some means must be found to ensure that Northern Ireland's interests are represented in the spending review?  Will he press on her the need to reverse the policy of cutbacks, spanning the past eight years, which set a bad foundation on which to build stable institutions and overcome deep problems?  There have been several cutbacks in the North and they hurt all communities.</p></speech>

It is not about making demands outside of institutions in some vacuum.  Rather, parties must agree on programmes for government.</p><p>We are up for that.  As the Taoiseach knows, there was an agreement last year but it was reneged on.  We have to move on and get agreement.  We accept this and will do our best.</p> <p> The local and European elections have dominated the news in recent days but something that has received little coverage thus far in the South is the fact that the people of the North have elected two remain MEPs.  This sends a very strong message to people in Britain and in the European Union that the DUP does not speak for the people of the North when it comes to Brexit.  The electorate has made this fundamentally clear.  Theresa May will be gone soon, as people have said, and a new prime minister will be in place in July.  Where does the process go from there?  People will be concerned there is again the prospect of a hard crash.  We are hoping this will not happen.  It is something we are all trying to avoid.  What is the process now to get us to a point where we can avoid it, given the vacuum in British politics, the turbulence in the Tory party and what has happened in the European elections in Britain and throughout the European Union?  Where do we go from here and what is the Irish Government's response to what has happened over recent weeks and months?</p></speech>

Frankly, it is rather depressing that Farage in particular has done well in these elections.  Ultimately, this is the failure of the political centre and Theresa May.  It is the consequence of the disastrous failures of Theresa May's policies and the British political centre and of pandering to these obnoxious forces.  In this regard, I ask the Taoiseach in all sincerity whether the European People's Party is making the same mistake when it comes to people such as Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  If we do not face down these people and instead pander to them or soft peddle around them we promote and encourage their agenda.</p></speech>

The noxious, dangerous far right is on the rise in Europe and Europe has to take a good look at itself, and the European People's Party has to take a good look at itself, and ask to what extent are their political failures responsible for creating a ground for these forces to rise and what are they going to do about it.</p>  <p>  This brings me briefly to the North.  One of the other features of the recent election that I very much welcome, and which has not been fully trumpeted, is a resurgence in the growth of left-wing politics seeking to offer an alternative to green and orange tribal politics.  I am delighted that People Before Profit won three seats in Belfast, going from one to three, and two seats in Derry, where we had none.  This indicates something else happening in the North, which we should very much welcome.  To some extent it is manifest in the growth of other forces that are not associated with the green-orange divide but seek in different ways to offer an alternative to it.  It is a reflection of the grassroots movement we saw on issues such as marriage equality, environmental issues and other issues.  In this context, I disagree with Deputy Martin because if we do not challenge corruption on something such as renewable heat incentive and state there is a problem with being in government with a Minister who has presided over a rotten corruption scandal involving hundreds of millions of quid-----</p></speech>

I do not think we should assume there was corruption, at least until the inquiry reports and states there was.  I want to put this on the record.  The general approach is to carry out the inquiry before making a judgment and this is the approach we should generally take.</p>  <p>  The interparty talks are now under way.  They involve all of the major parties and not just the two main parties but, of course, the two main parties are crucial to this given that they represent 50% or more of the electorate.  Now that the local and European elections are over there is a small but real window of opportunity to secure an agreement.  The Prime Minister, Mrs. May, is very keen in her last months in office to see this happen.  I am very keen to work with her and the parties to make it happen.  There will be a stocktaking exercise.  It was initially intended to happen at the end of May and now it may happen in June but we will do it.  Deputy Martin asked about the spending review and I will certainly raise that with the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, when I see her again in the next couple of weeks.  I will also have an opportunity to meet the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, tomorrow and I will talk with him about some of these issues.  We met briefly at the funeral of Lyra McKee but this will be the first time we will have a substantial meeting and I look forward to hearing his reflections on Brexit and Northern Ireland issues.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the possibility of a no deal hard Brexit at the end of October I am still confident it will be avoided.  Whether by the ratification of the deal, revocation of Article 50 or a further extension that may be requested by a new Prime Minister or even a new Government I am confident it can and will be avoided but we must be prepared for it.  Our preparations, which were complete at the end of March, are still complete but are continuing and will be augmented.  We particularly want to send a message to businesses that have not yet engaged in Brexit planning not to assume it will be all right on the night and if they have not yet engaged in Brexit planning to do so please.  I emphasise this message.  Many businesses have done so but some have not and they need to prepare for this very real possibility.</p>  <p>  With regard to the far right and far left, the House will know that for me very often they are two sides of the same coin and agree on many issues.  Hostility to the European Union and opposing European integration and treaties is something the far right and far left often coalesce around.</p></speech>

I will answer questions on yesterday's meeting separately.  President Tusk convened the meeting on 9 May, with a view to an initial informal discussion of our strategic priorities for the years ahead.  Our first session focussed on the EU's place in the world, while our second session was focused on internal challenges.  Obviously the two are closely linked.  Our discussions were based on four broad themes.  These were protecting citizens and freedoms, developing our economic base, jobs and living standards, building a greener, fairer and more inclusive future, and promoting Europe's interests and values in the world.  We adopted the Sibiu declaration, setting out ten basic commitments to guide us in our discussions on our new strategic agenda for the period from 2019 to 2024.  The European Council is expected to discuss further and adopt this agenda at our meeting in June.  My remarks at the summit were based on our national statement on the European Union, which was published on 17 April and discussed in the D&aacute;il the following day.</p><p>This outlines our priorities, which include achieving a prosperous and competitive Union that is equipped for the future, including the completion of the Single Market in all its aspects; preparing for the social and economic challenges of the digital  transformation; sustainability and leadership in climate action, including through a well designed and adequately funded Common Agricultural Policy, CAP; maintaining peace and security; and achieving a more effective partnership with Africa.  I stressed that working to ensure a close, comprehensive and ambitious future partnership with the UK must be a priority for the Union.  While I had no formal bilateral meetings in Sibiu, I engaged with most of my EU counterparts in the margins of the meeting, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Ireland's interests and to explain our case.  I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands the previous day, 8 May, where we discussed current EU issues and the excellent bilateral relations that exist between Ireland and the Netherlands.</p></reply>

It seems reasonable to assume that the risk of failing to agree a full withdrawal treaty with the new Tory leader is very high.  I think the Taoiseach will agree that anybody who has dealt with Boris Johnson knows that his understanding of and engagement with Irish matters is superficial at best.  None of the other candidates appears to understand what is required to protect the progress seen on this island in recent decades.  Obviously, it is right that we have to be ready for a no-deal scenario in October.  The issue is whether we will be ready this time.  Previous to 31 March, the original Brexit date, the Government constantly said it was stepping up and intensifying no-deal preparations.  However, when 31 March arrived it was clear we were nowhere near ready.  We had new custom booths in our ports but we did not have the staff to man them and 50% of companies who trade with the United Kingdom had not completed even the most basic registration in order to be able to continue that trade.</p><p>This week, it has emerged that the Department of Finance is only now finishing work on the fiscal implications of a no-deal Brexit.  The Taoiseach will remember that in March he said that the fiscal impact of a no-deal Brexit was not large enough to require it being announced then.  In contrast, yesterday, <i>The Irish Times </i>was briefed by Government that a serious adjustment may be required and that this will be outlined in the delayed economic statement next week.  No one has been briefed on this matter, even where the Government has an obligation to provide such briefings.  Has the Taoiseach received any report on why Ireland was not Brexit ready on 31 March?  What extra steps does he propose to take to ensure that we are ready on 31 October?</p></speech>

It is good that a new diverse centre is taking shape in the European Union.</p>  <p>  On the European Council meeting in Sibiu, obviously a number of issues were discussed, including, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, the future of Europe and the rule of law supervision.  As regards climate change, I raise with the Taoiseach an issue I raised with him recently.  On the initiative by nine member states to make climate change central to the EU five-year strategic agenda, which will be agreed in June, I understand that Ireland did not sign the letter from the nine member states.  In this regard, the Taoiseach is quoted as saying that the targets were too onerous.  The targets are to be met by 2030, as proposed in the letter from the nine European Union member states.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment will bring forward his plan shortly, following on from the all-party report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the remarks he made outside of the meeting in Sibiu to the effect that the targets were too onerous and for that reason Ireland could not be part of the initiative?  Will he also update the House on the meeting which took place last night in regard to the appointment of the President of the European Commission, including whether it will be decided upon by the European Parliament or the European Council?  Obviously, the European Parliament will have a veto but there is a lot of wheeling and dealing taking place.  I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's take on the discussions on that issue last night.</p></speech>

This is linked with the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett earlier in regard to the failure of Europe to grasp the fact that neoliberal policies have had a real impact on the lives of people across the European Union and have led to the rise of the far right.  Thankfully, that has not happened to the extent that people across the European Union thought it would in the most recent European elections.  However, it remains a real danger and a matter we should be concerned about.  We need to ensure that green issues are considered and that greater social supports are put in place, but we also need to be mindful of public services and public transport and the role the European Union plays in that regard.  This is very much linked to whether this State is Brexit ready.  The Taoiseach is right that we need to avoid a hard crash at all costs - I am hopeful that we can to do so - but if, through no fault of our own, we end up in a hard crash, we are in for a very bumpy ride economically.  There will be economic turbulence and businesses will need to be supported.  We will have to protect our economy and that can only happen through investment in public services, infrastructure and public transport.</p>  <p>  There is no point in pretending that we can become more environmentally friendly and reduce our carbon footprint if we do not invest in public transport.  In rural Ireland, public transport has been cut.  Bus routes have been cut.  There are other examples of where we are going backwards rather than doing what is right.  The Taoiseach said the discussion was about building a greener, fairer and more inclusive future.  What substance will come out of that discussion in terms of environmental issues and making Europe fairer?  If we do not make Europe fair and we do not value and invest in public services and so on that impact on people's lives and the environment, these words will be hollow and what we will see, in my view, is a continued rise of the far right.</p>  <p>  In the cut and thrust of politics we can have debates but for the Taoiseach to say that the far right is in any way allied to the far left is completely wrong.  There is a fascist undertone to the far right that is about racism and divide and conquer.  Whatever the Taoiseach's views of the far left in this Chamber and outside of it, they are completely different.  I do not include myself in the category of people at whom the Taoiseach was directing his earlier comments.  It is disingenuous and wrong of the Taoiseach to make comments like that.  It plays into the hands of those people who want to exploit other people's fears on issues like immigration.</p></speech>

On climate, is the Taoiseach, in talking the talk on climate change with his European counterparts while at the same time sabotaging efforts to do what is the central demand of the climate movement, namely, to keep fossil fuels in the ground, not guilty of gross climate hypocrisy?  Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is the central demand of Greta Thunberg, the school students who protested and will protest again, Extinction Rebellion, Friends of the Earth, the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  The majority of Members of this House support a Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground and have democratically voted for that legislation on two occasions.  Despite the clear desire to keep fossil fuels in the ground and for emergency measures on climate action, in the last 24 hours there has been another attempt to sabotage a Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground, with licences having been issued to two of the largest multinational fossil fuel corporations in the world to drill for more fossil fuels.  This is shocking hypocrisy.  The Minister's justification for this is that it will not make any difference to our targets, as if the destruction of the global climate has frontiers which stop at our borders.</p><p>The point about climate destruction and climate change is that neither knows any borders.  Does the Taoiseach accept what the intergovernmental panel and all the scientists have stated, namely, that to prevent reaching a 2&deg;C increase in temperatures globally, 80% of known fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground and that looking for new fossil fuel reserves and facilitating such activity flies directly in the face of what the global climate movement is seeking?</p></speech>

We both spoke to the crowd in Trafalgar Square on St. Patrick's Day in 2012 or 2013.  He seemed to have a good understanding of St. Patrick's Day but we did not have a chance to engage much on Irish affairs.  That was the only time I met him but the T&aacute;naiste has met him on a number of occasions.  As I have stated on many occasions, Brexit has not affected budget 2019 and nor will it.  There was no need for a mini-budget in the past year, notwithstanding the risks and uncertainty that have arisen as a result Brexit.  What we will be doing in the context of the summer economic statement - we will be happy to arrange a briefing for Opposition parties on this - is recognising that there are two potential scenarios.  The budget will be introduced in October.  We do not know where matters will stand at that point.  We could be facing a hard Brexit within weeks, a further extension, no Brexit at all or a deal.  We think it is prudent to set out two different scenarios in the summer economic statement in respect of growth, employment, revenue and the deficit.  The budgetary decisions will have to be framed by that.  If we are going to have less growth, fewer jobs and lower revenues-----</p></speech>

What we are doing for next year is slightly different because we recognise that a different scenario will apply.</p>  <p>  I did not suggest that the far right and far left are the same.  I stated that, on some issues, they represent two sides of the same coin.  I gave an example of that, which is opposition to the European Union, European integration and support for Brexit.  I acknowledge that there is a big problem here and, in the context of racism, that there is a real dark element on the far.  There is also an issue with anti-Semitism on the far left and, in my view, that is also a form of racism.</p></speech>

It calls for carbon neutrality by 2050 and we support that.  However, it also calls for much more onerous targets for greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 which we do not believe are achievable.  We believe that we can achieve what we have committed to do by 2030 but we do not want to commit to targets which are more onerous, to which most other countries do not want to commit and which we do not think are achievable.  This Government believes in and is taking climate action.  We want serious climate action that works but also sensible climate action.  It should be climate action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions but not climate action that makes us poorer, costs jobs or threatens our security.  There are two examples of sensible climate action taken by this Government in the past week.  Irish Rail began commissioning 600 new hybrid-battery locomotives-----</p></speech>

That is sensible climate action being taken by Irish Rail, a Government-owned company.  Yesterday, I signed a joint letter with President Macron, the purpose of which is to seek EU funding for a Celtic interconnector in order that we can link the electricity grids of Ireland and France, so when the wind is blowing in Ireland and not France, we can send our electricity there and <i>vice versa</i>.  Those are two examples of sensible climate action taken by this Government just this week that will make a difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>On oil and gas exploration, the Government is adopting a sensible climate action approach.  Approximately 30% of our electricity is produced using renewables.  We believe that we can get to 70% by the end of the next decade.  However, that still means that we will need to use gas.  Gas powers many of our homes and businesses.  We will still need gas to power some of our electricity plants for the foreseeable future, well into the third decade of the century, possibly even the fourth.  It is a transition fuel which is much cleaner than other fuels and which we will need to use for foreseeable future, certainly the next couple of decades.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledges that it is a transition fuel, as do most climate scientists.  If we know and accept that we have to use natural gas for the foreseeable future, certainly until 2045 or 2050 when we reach carbon neutrality, the question is whether we use our own natural gas or import it from Russia, Saudi Arabia or Qatar or whether we import shale gas from North America.  If we have to use it for the foreseeable future, it makes more sense to use our own gas.  It makes sense in the context of cost, energy security and, because of the reduced risk as a result of transporting less gas, environmentally.  That is the approach that the Government is taking.  We can agree to a moratorium on exploration but it must kick in at a time that makes sense, not immediately.</p></speech>

Ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter in the Topical Issue debate.  Each day we hear of a new business or community group that has to close because of skyrocketing insurance premiums.  It is happening across the board.  Recently, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, chair of the Personal Injuries Commission, said that claims arising at the lower end of the scale, namely, whiplash and soft tissue injuries, of the compensating personal injuries, account for more than 70% or almost three quarters of all injury claims in Ireland.  Moreover, as the second report of the Personal Injuries Commission clarified beyond any doubt, we compensate claimants here at a rate 4.4 times greater than in the UK and at rates far in excess of most EU member states.  One could ask what is happening here.  In recent years the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, outlined what he was doing and he produced a report with 70 different actions.  If we had seven actions that would have been fine and there would have been progress, but that report is probably gathering dust.  There is evidently an unwillingness on the part of the Government, the system and the legal system to tackle the issue.</p><p>Mr. Justice Kearns went on to say:</p><blockquote>Closure is now the order of the day for many other small businesses besieged by personal injury claims and rising premiums.  This crisis has spread across many small businesses, leisure facilities, shops, places of employment and is now causing people to lose their jobs in areas where, but for this market distortion, would be thriving and prosperous.  Those in a position to do something about [this] must now finally get up and do the right thing.</blockquote><p>However, the Government is not getting up and doing the right thing.  It is appalling that we cannot have a book of quantum, as in other jurisdictions, that is reasonable and sensible.  I have no issue with somebody who suffers a serious injury making a claim but I take serious issue with frivolous and fraudulent claims.  The recent exposure about a colleague in this House is shocking.  It sends out a completely wrong message.  Questions also arise about certain legal firms connected with this House representing the person concerned.  What is going on is despicable and it is time to stop.  It makes it worse that the example was given by the Chair of an Oireachtas committee.  Often, people who have genuine injuries do not claim because they want to get back into work and into the community.  The Minister of State does not seem to be doing anything whatsoever about it.</p><p>I am a small business man who employs up to 20 people.  I just renewed my insurance recently and it has gone up by 30%.  That is 30% on top of 30% on top of 30% on top of 30%.  It is just not funny anymore.</p><p>Settlements are made out of court for frivolous claims.  It is time that the gravy train in the Four Courts was stopped in its tracks.  We should have a book of quantum which outlines what one should receive for a broken limb or broken finger.  The fat cats, the gravy train and the lawyers should be taken out of the equation, as should the no foal, no fee approach and advertising for cases.  We did not have such advertising 29 years ago but we have it now.  The fraudulent claims industry is sick and despicable, and it is time the Government did something about it.</p> <p> Companies and businesses contact me every day of the week.  A voluntary community group in Cahir recently had its playground closed down because it was grappling with insurance costs.  The county council will not take it in charge unless it is given a guarantee that it will be inspected every morning and that it will open and close at certain times.  Community groups raise funds and the Government contributes to their efforts.  They are being closed now and many activities are affected.  There is a fabulous walking festival and rhododendron festival in Clogheen next weekend but it is also facing issues with insurance.  I wish the organisers well.  The festival is good for exercise and the physical and mental health of people.  However, this sick culture of claims is being propagated and a Member of this House got involved in such a situation.  There is a suggestion that adults should be supervised when taking part in some leisure activities.  What will be next?  Will children be left to mind adults?  In this House it seems that the animals are minding the zoo.</p></speech>

I have never spoken about an individual case.  I have been doing this job for two years and I do not intend to speak about an individual case before it gets to court, when it is in court or afterwards.</p>  <p>  I love how Deputy Mattie McGrath is almost always entirely wrong.  He said there is an unwillingness to deal with this issue.  I have never seen as much desire to deal with the issue of insurance as there is now.  However, this is not a simple matter.  The Deputy asked me why I do not change the book of quantum.  I do not have the authority to do that and nor does anyone in this House.  We do not have the authority to act in that way due to the separation of powers.  It is a matter for the Judiciary rather than Deputies in this House.  </p>  <p>  A number of years ago, the cost of insurance working group produced reports on employer liability and public liability insurance.  The second report was launched by the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, and it proposed the establishment of a judicial council.  This council would include a committee made up of members of the Judiciary which would re-examine the guidelines, in effect creating a new book of quantum.  That is the work we are doing.  The legislation is before the other House.  Report Stage will take place in the Seanad, I hope, within a couple of weeks.  The objective is that the legislation would pass through the Upper House and this House before the end of the summer session.  I appeal for the help of everyone to get this legislation through.  If we get it through before the end of this session, I will request an early signature motion by the President so that the judicial council can be established.  The members of the Judiciary can then do the work with which they have been tasked by the Personal Injury Commission, namely, to review the guidelines.  That is a crucial piece of work.  If we do our work in a quick and efficient manner, I can see no reason members of the Judiciary cannot do the same.  I have put in place a schedule for the completion of this work by the end of this year, which is a reasonable timeframe.  It would ensure that the businesses of this country which have been caught by awards or exaggerated claims or small claims are able to reduce their premiums.  The crucial aspect of this is to ensure that the insurance companies do not get the opportunity to pocket the awards.  I do not want circumstances to arise in which the awards come down and the premiums do not.  That is not what I am about, and I believe nobody in these Houses is in favour of such a move.  We must ensure that businesses are allowed to trade in an efficient manner.  They employ people and with employment comes the opportunity to access everything that is required for the dignity of people, allowing them to advance in society.  </p>  <p>  For every one fraudulent claim, there are hundreds of exaggerated claims where people who have been affected through no fault of their own jack up the amounts they are seeking.  I believe that is a fact.  For every one exaggerated claim, there are hundreds of claims by people who want the correct amount.  However, awards here, according to the Personal Injuries Commission report, are four or five times higher than in England and Wales.  We must also be careful around this issue.  Every business person pays insurance so that if someone is affected by an accident caused in part by negligence, those people will be paid efficiently and well.</p></speech>

A child in kindergarten could see what is going on.  I will not take a lecture on this from the Minister of State.  Hotels, nightclubs, big bars and playgrounds have seen their premiums increase by 300%, 400% and 500%.  Representatives of those groups have appeared in these Houses, lobbying us.  Fine Gael has been in Government for nine years and insurance payouts are still 4.4 times higher than in England.  The Minister of State suggested that it is not our duty.  It is our duty, as legislators, to change the legislation and allow the Judiciary to implement changes within a certain time.  It cannot be allowed to dilly-dally and delay matters.  Businesses are disappearing like snow from a ditch.  They are being destroyed.  People start at a young age, get business loans and put all their might and main into it, only to be forced out of business by fraudulent claims which are supported by a culture in the Law Library and the Four Courts.  It is sickening.  I have been the victim of such claims in my own business.  Days can be spent in court waiting for something to happen, only to be told eventually that the matter has been settled on the steps of the court.  There are hundreds of people in court on occasion; it is like a bloody Munster final.  I was in Waterford court on one occasion, and it is a farce.  Everyone is in the courthouse on the same day and it is a total waste of money.  Certain people are getting paid because the clock ticks on.  It is despicable.</p>  <p>  The problem with this House is that there are too many vested interests here that will not allow change to happen.  It is time for Fine Gael to do something about this beyond talking, delivering pious platitudes and promising to rush legislation through the House.  The Government's legislation will get support from this side of the House because most of my colleagues are self-employed.  The latest legislation in the House, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, has been held up for a long time in the Seanad and there is not a word about it in the media.  When we held up the shameful Road Traffic Act introduced by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, we were pilloried in the media and described as backward and gombeen men.  There is a Dublin 4 mentality at play here, with a "screw everyone outside the Pale" mentality.  It is time for action rather than words.  The report the Minister of State mentioned has 70 recommendations when seven or even three would have been enough.  We need fair compensation for reasonable injuries.  The legal aspect should be cut out and a transparent system put in place which will provide support to people if they get injured and those with serious injuries are paid.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he has committed to supporting the Bill.  He is a member of the Business Committee, along with the Chief Whip, and I welcome the fact that he has committed to getting the Judicial Council Bill through as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The insurance companies are no white knights and their settlement channels are wrong.  Some insurance companies pay out "go away" money rather than settlement money.  As the Deputy stated - he is sometimes right - other insurance companies wrongly drag people through the courts, which is not fair either.  The settlement channels have to be reviewed.  </p>  <p>  I believe the brother-sister test should be applied.  If an incident happens in a venue that is a business premises and potentially has insurance, it does not automatically mean that people should make a claim.  A claim should not be made where the person would not claim in circumstances where a similar incident took place in his or her brother's or sister's house.  The high level of awards here and the easy money to be made in some instances have given rise to an attitude where people will try to get what they can out of it.  That is wrong.  It is a compensation culture that must be broken down because it is not a victimless cost.  The cost is not to the insurance company but to the person paying the premium to the insurance company because it will be passed on.  Last year, three Bills were instigated.  The Judicial Council Bill, which I hope the Deputy will continue to support in this House, was one.  The Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2019, sponsored by Deputy Michael McGrath, was another, and I would be delighted if that Bill was passed.  The third is the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 sponsored by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  I intend to amend that Bill, which I also hope to get through the Houses.  With the support of this House, we can do a great deal in the area of insurance to protect businesses.</p><p>When business is protected in this manner, jobs are protected.  Every Member will agree with me on that.</p></speech>

It was damaged by floods in 2009 which caused much damage.  While the work being done is welcome, it was needed to be done long before now.</p>  <p>  The weir is a crossing point on the Shannon on an important walkway, the Beara-Breifne Way, which runs from Breifne in Leitrim to the Beara Peninsula, straight through Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands.  It is important it is kept open.  I know there is difficulty with doing the work outside of the summer period with the possibility of damage to the fisheries.  The problem is that people using the walkway have not been informed it is closed.  Many businesses, particularly tourism businesses, are directing people up the walkway as far as the bridge but they cannot cross it.  Over the past several days, some tourists could not cross the river at the point.  Perhaps a solution could be found to reroute users through an alternate route or have the footbridge open for certain periods of the day to enable people on hiking holidays in the region to get across it.</p>  <p>  A simple solution can be found.  I put it down as a Topical Issue matter because it was raised by the area&rsquo;s Councillor Dermot Connolly with me.  He told me it is a simple matter that could be resolved if raised at the right level.  I trust the Minister or someone in the Department would be able to have a word with the Office of Public Works to find a solution to accommodate the work that needs to be done which is valuable and welcome, as well as accommodating the tourism industry to ensure the walkway is kept open.</p></speech>

The weir which is over 300m in length with a 12 sluice barrage maintains and regulates the navigation level for that section of waterway between Athlone in Lough Ree and Meelick in Lough Derg.  Navigation between both is through Victoria lock which is adjacent to Meelick weir.  The weir and its walkway link the historic village of Meelick in County Galway to Lusmagh in County Offaly and forms part of the Hymany Way.</p>  <p>  The weir level is increased by the installation of weir boards from an overhanging waterway to maintain an ordinary summer level for navigation while the boards are removed in winter to allow additional water conveyance outside of the boating season.  The weir and its boards are an integral part of the Shannon navigation while also managing water levels and flows on the mid Shannon.  The levels are managed by Waterways Ireland at Meelick in conjunction with those at Athlone and Parteen by the ESB.</p>  <p>  In 2009, during an extreme weather event, the weir and its walkway from which the weir boards are placed and removed were extensively damaged.  In the 2015-16 severe weather event, the last remnants of the walkway were destroyed.  In 2012 Waterways Ireland began a design process including environmental assessment for the replacement and re-instatement of the weir, the walkway and more modern system of weir board management.  In 2015 Waterways Ireland sought planning permission to replace the walkway and install a system of tilting weir boards from Offaly and Galway County Councils.  Planning permission was received in 2017.  In 2018 Waterways Ireland sought to appoint a competent construction company to undertake the works on its behalf and a competitive tender process was undertaken in August 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 March this year, I was happy to be able to announce that &euro;3.2 million will be invested by Waterways Ireland in the restoration and replacement of the Meelick weir walkway.  I had the pleasure of attending the turning of the sod for this development shortly afterwards.  I am fully aware of the importance of this restoration to the counties of Galway and Offaly and, in particular, to the local communities which have been without the walkway for several years.  Construction works have now commenced on site.  The weir, adjacent quay and hardstanding area is currently closed to members of the public and will be for the duration of the works.  Construction is due for completion by the end of this year, subject to favourable weather conditions and water levels.  Access to the Beara-Breifne Way through the works site is restricted.  However, alternative access to the way at various adjacent locations remains.</p>  <p>  We are conscious this closure is impacting on the walkway but this is important and necessary work.  The completed project will add immensely to the attraction of the area, safety and connection between the two villages in question.  The Department has informed me that alternative ways are signposted.  If the Deputy passes me on the concerns of Councillor Dermot Connolly, my former colleague, I will get the Department to respond on the alternative crossing points. </p></speech>

We are on the same page on this.  The work is welcome but the difficulty seems to be that access through various adjacent locations is not clear to people using the walkway.  If there is an issue with communication or signage, it needs to be dealt with.  It probably should have been dealt with some time in advance with better communication and consultation with local tourism providers.  I will tell Councillor Dermot Connolly that the Minister of State would welcome some contact for reassurance on this matter.</p>  <p>  There is much work to be done across the Beara-Breifne Way, particularly north of Leitrim village.  It would be welcome if the work could be done as speedily as possible.  If reassurances can be given and better signage put in place, this issue could be easily resolved.  In some of these cases, one can find individuals who do not think outside the box or do not try to find the solution when one is clearly there in front of them.  Perhaps a word in the right ear might be able to resolve that issue.</p></speech>

If it is a simple issue in terms of better communication or signposting, this can certainly be dealt with.</p>  <p>  There are different funding streams available through the rural regeneration scheme and LEADER for different sectors.  I am sure the various local authorities on the Hymany Way and other routes are involved in progressing and forwarding plans and planning permissions.  It is clear this will be a successful project once it is restored and will add significantly to the Hymany Way and the attractiveness of tourism in Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands.  It is a wonderful project.  I am sure the co-operation between the local authorities involved and the Department will continue to ensure the restoration of the full Hymany Way.</p></speech>

That decision left north and south Tipperary with a mental health service which was not fit for purpose.  It is important to note that all stakeholders at the time, namely, staff, patients, GPs and the public, were opposed to that closure.  It meant that south Tipperary patients had to travel to Kilkenny for inpatient treatment while north Tipperary patients had to travel to Ennis.  These units themselves were not fit for purpose.  For confirmation, one only needs to look at various HIQA reports and a prosecution and conviction for failures in the Kilkenny unit.  The units are overcrowded, leading to late admissions for Tipperary patients as well as early discharges.  It is leading to serious transport difficulties for families and friends supporting patients.  Outpatient services and community-based teams are understaffed and underfunded.  They did not and still do not comply with A Vision for Change standards and staffing levels.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has accepted the closure of St. Michael's unit was wrong and should not have happened.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State, representatives of the Save of Our Acute Hospital Services committee and Members from Tipperary to reinstate inpatient beds in the county.  I hope that work will come to fruition soon.</p>  <p>  A specific promise made at the time of the closure was that there would be the construction of a purpose-built mental health crisis house in Clonmel.  Seven years later, the public, patients and staff have seen little or no progress on this.</p><p>Will the Minister of State clarify the position regarding the construction of this unit?  I have a number of questions for him which might help us ascertain exactly where this project is at.  Will he indicate the timescale for the construction this crisis house project?  Will he confirm that funding for it has been approved and is in place?  Will he confirm also that the project and funding of it will not be affected by the overrun on the national children's hospital?  Has formal approval for the project to go to tender been confirmed and, if so, when is it envisaged that will happen?  When is it envisaged that construction will commence?  Is there a targeted date for the completion of the construction of this unit?</p> <p> The construction of a purpose built crisis house is urgently required.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm today that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency and that progress will be made in the tendering of the project and the commencement of construction of the unit.</p></speech>

I thank him for selecting this Topical Issue matter.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.  I have said here previously that one of the most admirable characteristics of any Deputy, or Senator for that matter, is consistency.  I acknowledge Deputy Healy's consistency and thank him for his continuing interest in all areas related to mental health in the area he represents in Tipperary.  He has continuously raised this issue and challenged us on it and I acknowledge the good work he has done on behalf of the mental health sector in promoting awareness of the issue in his local area.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the issue of the construction of a crisis house in Clonmel, as the Deputy will be aware, I am quite familiar with the project.  I have met him and his colleagues on a number of occasions and have visited the area and met them there also to view the services that are available and to see how we can progress this project.  I am anxious to see the crisis house project in Clonmel developed as soon as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware from our meetings, new building regulations have been introduced since the project was designed which, as the Deputy said, dates back seven years.  New building regulations have had to be taken into account and that has been done.  A detailed redesign has taken place accommodating the new building regulations, therefore we had to recost the project, which is being done.  I am anxious to see this project included in the capital development plan, which will be launched shortly by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris.  There is nothing to stop it progressing from there.</p>  <p>  As alluded to by the Deputy, I have been down in the area and have acknowledged there is an issue with accommodation and beds in the greater Tipperary area.  I view this as an absolute priority on a national front and I do not say that lightly.  People in every constituency are looking for something to be done in their area but I have no difficulty whatsoever in saying that I would like to see the crisis house project in Tipperary top of the list of projects coming under the mental health area and to see that need being addressed because there is an issue there.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also know that my philosophy is very much to build a level of infrastructure at a lower level, and I do not like using the word "lower" but a reduced or a lower level of infrastructure for mental health.  Thankfully the Jigsaw service will be rolled out in Tipperary, which the Deputy has publicly welcomed previously.  We need more investment in that level of infrastructure to prevent the need for people having to access psychiatric beds.  When we reflect on our history and look back to the 1960s there were 20,000 psychiatric inpatient beds in the country and all of them were filled.  Today, there are fewer than 1,000.  We have come a long way in how we deal with the challenges presented by people with mental health issues.</p>  <p>  In the two years I have been in this job I have tried very much to refocus and reorientate the system towards having more proactive, bottom up supports, earlier intervention to prevent people having episodes of psychosis and such like which result in they sometimes having to go into care.  We have to deal also with the issue of people presenting with acute mental health issues.  I accept the challenges that exist in terms of accommodation and people having to travel to Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  I am anxious to see this project progress as soon as the recosting is done, with which I do not envisage there will be any delay.  I do not see any problem with having the funding available for it.  This has been a top priority nationally.  Thanks to the good work of the Deputy and his colleagues, they have ensured that it remains so.  The people in the HSE are aware of my concerns and those of the Deputy and his colleagues regarding this project and our anxiety to see it proceed as quickly as possible.  I certainly will do everything I can for my part to ensure that the crisis house project is built in Clonmel without delay.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the fact that he believes this project is a priority issue for mental health services in Tipperary.  The existing crisis house is not fit for purpose.  It is an old building.  It is particularly not fit for purpose having regard to modern psychiatry and modern standards.  The construction of a purpose built unit for the purposes of a crisis house is necessary and an urgent priority.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to welcome the Jigsaw project which the Minister of State mentioned.  It is one we have sought for quite some time in Tipperary.  It has been welcomed widely across the county.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge briefly the work of the staff in the mental health services across Tipperary.  They work above and beyond the call of duty.  It is also important to recognise the work of many voluntary organisations across Tipperary which are working in the field of mental health.  I welcome the Minister of State's reply and hope we will see JCBs on the site in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly endorse it as a priority nationally and not only one for County Tipperary.  I have no difficulty whatsoever in standing over that.  I am determined to see it being developed and delivered for the people of Tipperary.  We will continue the work we are doing in the other areas of mental health in the county.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy and his colleagues who have continued to keep a keen focus on the area of mental health in County Tipperary.  Many of his continuing efforts have resulted in decisions such as the Jigsaw project opening up in the area.  I look forward to the next phase in the development of mental health services there.</p>  <p>  I concur with what the Deputy said about the staff who deliver the services.  Often people can be very quick to run down the services in the mental health area and say they are non-existent, not in place or not available but staff are working very hard in the delivery of services.  We all hear the hard, tough stories.  We would prefer we did not ever have to witness them and that nobody would have to go through some of these extremely upsetting episodes but many children and adults are availing of mental health services across County Tipperary on a daily basis being delivered by exceptional staff in a very challenging area.  I concur with the Deputy in acknowledging the work and thanking the good people of Tipperary who have been delivering mental health services across the country during the past number of months and years.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing this debate.  I specifically thank the Minister for his attendance to take this matter.  This is not an area I raise often but there is a particular issue and it is important that it is addressed specifically.</p><p>In a response to a similar question a year ago, the Minister stated:</p><blockquote>The Government is committed to ensuring strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress in achieving this goal.</blockquote><p>The Minister highlighted in the D&aacute;il this morning the fact that there are now more than 14,000 garda&iacute;.  In all the stations in my constituency I am seeing the benefit of that but I am not seeing it in Rathcoole Garda station.  I want to put some figures on the record.  Often when I get replies they contain global figures referring to the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR and so forth.  I want to compare two stations that are side by side.  At the end of December 2012, there were 26 garda&iacute; in Rathcoole and 95 in Clondalkin.  Admittedly the Garda College in Templemore was closed and the number of garda&iacute; fell, and that is reflected in what happened in the coming years.  At the end of 2013 the number of garda&iacute; in Rathcoole dropped to 23 and to 91 in Clondalkin.  At the end of 2014, the number of garda&iacute; in Rathcoole stood at 23 and there was a further drop in the number in Clondalkin to 89.  At the end of 2015, the number in Rathcoole stood at 21 and the number in Clondalkin was 87.</p><p>At the end of 2015, there was a change, and we see the Garda numbers in Clondalkin increase.  At the end of 2016, Garda numbers in Clondalkin increased to 94 but those in Rathcoole continued to decline to 19.  At the end of 2017, Garda numbers in Clondalkin further increased to 97 and Rathcoole further declined to 14.  This year, on the last date that I checked, there were 105 garda&iacute; in Clondalkin and 14 in Rathcoole.  As we are seeing Garda numbers increase, we are not seeing them going back to Rathcoole Garda station.  At the end of 2012, we had twice as many garda&iacute; in Rathcoole as we have today.  The area has grown significantly in population.  It is not a village.  Policed from Rathcoole are Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Citywest.  The area has increased in terms of population, retail and industry.  In the rural parts of the constituency, around Redgap, etc., people feel insecure in their own homes.</p> <p> There is a Garda station in Rathcoole and it is manned part time.  The number of hours it is open, whether 10 a.m. to 12 noon or 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., is subject to a garda being available.  It does not always open on those hours.  With 13 or 14 garda&iacute; in Rathcoole, there are units of two or three.  If somebody is on holidays or sick, these are not efficient and effective units.  There are simply not enough garda&iacute; based in the Rathcoole area to deliver the type of policing service that the Minister stated he wanted, that is, "to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country ...".  That is not happening in Rathcoole.</p> <p> At a time of restoration of numbers - I gave the Minister the Clondalkin numbers in parallel - it is the same in Lucan and in Ronanstown but Rathcoole has been in constant decline since 2012.  The population, economic activity, retail and industry have grown but we are seeing a decline in numbers.  The service is insufficient and unsatisfactory for the population that currently resides there.</p></speech>

The distribution of Garda resources is constantly monitored taking into account all relevant and appropriate factors, including population and new and emerging crime trends.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Commissioner has publicly spoken about issues such as protecting our most vulnerable and he has highlighted that his priority is a policing model that will provide the best outcomes for communities.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  With the accelerated recruitment of Garda members continuing this year, it provides the Commissioner with the ability to increase Garda numbers and visibility in all Garda divisions, including the DMR west division.  Rathcoole Garda station forms part of the Clondalkin district in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, West Division.  The Garda strength of the DMR west division, as of 30 April last, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 715, of whom 200 are assigned to the Clondalkin district and 14 are assigned to Rathcoole Garda station.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 63 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR west division.  It is envisaged that the DMR west Garda division will receive further allocations of probationer garda&iacute; from the Garda College this year.</p>  <p>  There is also provision for uniform and plain-clothes patrols within the district to support Garda operations, and support provided by divisional units, such as the divisional and district drugs units, roads policing personnel and community engagement personnel.  Where appropriate, local garda&iacute; are supported by a number of Garda national units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, which also have had an increase in resources this year.</p>  <p>  Additional recruitment of Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully-trained garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line policing over the course of this year.  The injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; to deliver, as Deputy Curran said, a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities in all divisions, including the DMR west division.</p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019 in addition to a very significant capital investment, which includes &euro;342 million for Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies and &euro;46 million for the Garda fleet.  As of 30 April, there were 75 Garda vehicles assigned to the DMR west division.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle anti-social problems head-on, it cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.</p></speech>

A number of weeks ago, Councillor Trevor Gilligan and myself attended a public meeting on this issue regarding resources in the greater Rathcoole area.  It was very well attended.  People spoke of their own particular incidents and the response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not only the case that they want a Garda presence.  There is a physical record of an increase in crime, as reported at the joint policing committees, JPCs.  Burglary, for the first four months, in comparison to the previous ones, was up almost 50%.  Criminal damage was up 47%.  Theft from motor vehicles was up 67%.  Public order incidents were up 57%.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated in his reply that there would be a further deployment.  I acknowledge fully that it is not up to the Minister to allocate the resources from Garda station to Garda station but, as a public representative for the area, an area whose population believes it is being ignored and is missing out, I see no evidence to suggest that any of the additional deployment that has occurred to date has materialised in the Rathcoole area.  Therein lies the problem.  DMR west may well be increasing, but the number of garda&iacute;, at 14, is the lowest since last year, at 13.  At 13 and 14, respectively, it is the lowest ever recorded.  In every other station, we are seeing the increase in resources the Minister talked about.  People in Rathcoole deserve the level of service the Minister talked about in terms of a physical presence.  It is not happening.</p>  <p>  I need the Minister to bring this point directly to the Commissioner and to say to him that the Government is making additional resources available, DMR west is benefitting from it, but the area around Rathcoole, Newcastle and Saggart has a minuscule number of garda&iacute;, an ineffective and inefficient number to police the greater area that it is supposed to cover.  I appeal to the Minister to make that plea to the Garda Commissioner.  I acknowledge that the numbers are being deployed in DMR west.  I am specifically saying we need to increase them in Rathcoole.</p></speech>

I assure Deputy Curran that the distribution of Garda resources in terms of personnel is monitored constantly.  It takes into account all the appropriate and relevant factors, for example, crime trends in the area and the valid point, as raised by Deputy Curran, of the population distribution across the district.  I accept what Deputy Curran said in terms of that growing urban area to the south west of Dublin.</p>  <p>  It is important that these issues remain closely monitored by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I said that Garda numbers alone will not deal with the issues raised.  While working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for the Garda, we need to ensure there is a strong focus on quality of life issues.</p><p>We also need to ensure that there is a strong focus on collaboration with stakeholders in local communities, that local authorities are involved and that everybody is working together to help and assist to the garda&iacute; to eradicate anti-social behaviour.  It means drilling down to the root causes of anti-social behaviour.  I, of course, accept that Garda numbers is an issue and I will be happy to convey to the Garda authorities the specific point raised by Deputy Curran about an individual Garda station, namely, Rathcoole.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900029#GG00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Rourke, who is co-sponsor of this Bill, and with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.</p>  <p>  All parties and Members of this House, regardless of ideology, are wedded to the notion that the best place for an elderly family relative or a relative who is sick, infirm or unable to look after himself or herself is in the security and comfort of their family home.  Everybody espouses that notion, at least verbally.  It is obvious that if one is keeping an elderly person at home, a person who is ill or unable to look after himself or herself, in most cases it will require alteration works to be done to the house - for example, a downstairs bathroom, grab rails and various other items which we all deal with every day in the course of our constituency clinics.  The sum of &euro;71 million provided for the housing adaptation grants last year.  It should be a greater amount as it is not sufficient to do the job but this Bill is not about that and that is for another day.  This Bill is about the difficulties in the administration of housing adaptation grants.</p>  <p>  Everybody with a passing knowledge of the electorate or of their constituents will know that the administration of housing adaptation grants is very slow, tedious, bureaucratic and varies from one local authority to another.  That very fact was recognised in the Government's National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which gave a definitive commitment to review how the application process should be streamlined.  If the application process was perfect and was working very smoothly, it would not have been recommended that a study should be done on how it should be streamlined.</p>  <p>  What we are proposing here is to streamline the process.  In essence, this Bill provides that certain information is needed together with the completed application form.  The applicant should collect this information and submit it with the application form to prevent this toing and froing with the county council writing out after a couple of months looking for a another document or amending a certain document.  The applicant should collect all the relevant documentation, including the quotations, and submit them together with the completed application form which would enable the council to make a decision on the matter within four weeks.  We recognise that it would not be practicable, for whatever reason, in unusual cases to make a decision within four weeks but the target for the local authority will be four weeks.</p>  <p>  The language and wording of the Bill may not be perfect.  Some Deputies may believe too much latitude is given to the county councils and if they want us to tighten up on the wording, I and my colleague will be more than happy to listen to any reasoned amendments in that regard.</p>  <p>  This process, if adopted, will bring uniformity and efficiency.  It will remove the present uncertainty and enforced waiting periods.  When a family applies for a grant towards the provision of an extra, or a downstairs, bathroom to enable a disabled relative to stay in the house, they often have to ascertain from the local authority how much of a grant they will get in order to see if they have the resources to go ahead with the work.  If somebody needs a grant, the work cannot start until approval is given to go ahead.  This has caused enormous delays and it has had a knock-on effect.  In 2018, for example, 206,000 hospital bed days were lost due to delayed discharges.</p>  <p>  This has created much anxiety, distress and worry for families who did not know if they would get the grant, how long it will take to get it and how much it would amount to in order for them to plan ahead.  We propose, along the lines suggested by the national disability strategy document, to remove that uncertainty and to introduce uniformity and efficiency into the process.</p>  <p>  Private Members' time is usually used in an adversarial manner to criticise Government policy or to have a go at the Government but this is an exception to that.  This is not an adversarial Bill, it is not political and there is no cost involved.  I said that I would like to see the amount for housing adaptation grants increased but this Bill is not about that.  In fact, it will be of assistance to local authority officials as it will enable them to operate more efficiently if the documentation is provided to them and they just need to check it out.  Most importantly, it will assist vulnerable families who are looking after vulnerable people.  There are 115,000 disabled people living in private accommodation.  Last year only about 3,000 housing adaptation grants were approved.  We are not looking for headlines or credit here.  I do not care who gets the credit, quite frankly.  I simply want the right thing to be done.</p>  <p>  In politics, sometimes, but all too rarely, one gets the opportunity to do something that is going to make a tangible improvement in people's lives, something that is visibly and demonstrably good.  When that opportunity comes along, collectively, we should take it and do the right thing.  I note the Government is proposing to introduce an amendment to delay the implementation of this Bill, which I have not seen.  Nobody has thought it worth his or her while to forward it to me.  If that is the case, I would be extremely disappointed and would need a very good reason the Government believe that such a delay is necessary.  Back in 2017, the Government's disability strategy document recommended that the process should be streamlined.  If the Government is prepared to allow the current clearly unsatisfactory situation to continue, which every Deputy, Senator and councillor has experienced, it had better have a very good reason for doing so.</p>  <p>  This Bill is non-political, non-adversarial and will not command the headlines tomorrow.  One could be sure that if this Bill was passed today, tomorrow's front pages would be all about the Taoiseach having a word with some backbencher, some other twist in the Brexit crisis or some other development in the crime situation in north Dublin.  This is not high-profile.  This is simply an opportunity to do some good for people who deserve a lift.  I urge the Government with all the resources at my command to accept this legislation.  It can take all the credit it wishes for that.  We do not want any credit but want to do something good for people who deserve to have something good done for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900029#GG00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I am co-sponsoring with my colleague, Deputy O'Dea.  To capture some of the points made by my colleague, this Bill is being brought forward for the right reason, which is to alleviate congestion in a process that is unnecessarily backlogged.  It will help the most vulnerable in society, that is, the elderly who need their houses adapted or people with a disability.</p><p>We do not want it to grab a headline.  We just want it to help the people who are on the front line and need access to this service, and for these grants to be approved more efficiently and effectively, so they can improve their standard of life and keep living at home where they are happiest.  That is key.  I am completely opposed to the Government amendment proposing to delay the process for six months.  It is unnecessary.  What we are suggesting here is to help the process in line with the review that is being carried out at the moment.  These provisions could be implemented tomorrow morning and they would not affect the review.  All the Bill does is provide that the relevant information would be gathered and submitted at the same time as the application and a decision would be made within a month.  That is not the case at the moment.  There is no good reason not to accept this because it is a positive, practical, pragmatic piece of work that my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, and I have undertaken.  </p> <p> The proposed measure is mainly geared at people living in private homes who need adaptation work done as they get older or due to a disability.  We know the same grant system for council tenants is administered through a completely different process, namely, the architects' departments in the local authorities.  This will streamline the process and make it much more efficient.  When we spoke to colleagues in different local authorities we found that decisions on applications can take six months or more.  While some local authorities are exceptionally good, there is, unfortunately, inconsistency in the process.  This inconsistency places the most vulnerable, the people who are suffering, at risk.</p> <p> I am familiar with the position in hospitals and nursing homes through my work in my home county.  People are waiting for grants to be approved and are going through a lengthy process, which is unnecessarily dragged out.  People are medically fit to be discharged from a hospital or nursing home but cannot leave due to delays in grants being approved and in completing the modification work needed to make their homes suitable for them to operate independently.  That is a serious problem.  People who want to be independent want to be at home, not in hospitals or nursing homes, especially when they know they could live happily at home if some modifications were done to their house with the aid of this grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000.</p> <p> It is worth pointing out the detail of the Bill.  It would not create an extra cost for the applicant.  The current process and the one proposed are similar and parallel.  The only difference is that our Bill provides for the information gathering to be done at the one time.  The application still has to be completed by the applicant.  He or she still must submit all income details and confirm that he or she has paid the property tax where applicable.  The Bill provides that applicants would submit an occupational therapist's report.  The occupational therapists in the community or in hospitals are working with the people who need these modifications.  In most cases, they make a recommendation with the application in the first instance or may even contact the local authority to help these people get back to independent living.  The irony is that we have suitably qualified occupational therapists in the community making practical, pragmatic recommendations that are completely ignored.  That creates further delays and problems in the process.  The Bill provides that the recommendations of occupational therapists operating on the ground, who are helping people with these applications, would be submitted with the application.  In addition, two registered, tax compliant contractors would submit quotations for the works, as is currently the case, except that this is done at the moment over a protracted period.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the quotations would be submitted with the applications.  In most cases at the moment there is no need for an architect to do any design or drawing unless the works are substantial.  Currently, if a drawing is required, it is up to the applicant to submit the drawing.  Therefore, we are not changing anything.  We are providing that such designs by a suitably qualified person will be submitted if needed.  There is no change or additional cost to the applicant.  There is no impediment.  Applicants have to submit all of this information over a protracted period at present and the Bill provides for it to be submitted at the one time and for a decision to be made within four weeks of the application being submitted.  That makes the whole process much more efficient and streamlined for the applicant.</p> <p> Occupational therapists working in the community with those who are ageing or have a disability see the complications in the home that need to be addressed quickly.  At the moment, when the application goes into the local authority and it sends out its own occupational therapist, he or she can take a view that is completely at variance with what is practical and pragmatic.  He or she may have no understanding for the issues people are experiencing or the turmoil in their life caused by their condition.  In one recent case, one of these occupational therapists recommended to put someone who was severely disabled into a room with no window.  That is the level of silliness and inconsistency that is going on at the moment.  When it was flagged in the community occupational therapist's report, who was working with the individual on a weekly basis, it was completely ignored.</p> <p> We are trying to cut out all the delay and unnecessary red tape and to work with suitably qualified people on the ground.  Our population is ageing, as the Minister of State knows, and more and more people will want to live independently at home.  The Bill is a good way of making sure that happens sooner rather than later.  I hope the Government embraces the Bill, the positives in it and the sentiments behind it.  It is motivated only for the sake of one individual, the applicant, who needs to live independently in his or her own home with the help of a grant to overcome the issues caused by age or by having a disability.</p></speech>

These grants are very popular and once applications are sanctioned, the transition goes quite smoothly most of the time.  It is getting to this point that is the problem.  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2020 makes provision for a review of housing grants in any event so why not expedite matters and ease the burden on persons with disabilities and their families?  One of my offices in Cork South West is assisting a person who suffered a stroke at the end of last year.  This person is set to be discharged from hospital.  However, the family awaits a decision on an adaptation grant.  The position as of today is that the family will have to rent a house, which they can ill afford, so that their loved one may be discharged.  This person could, of course, linger on in hospital.  However, as my colleague stated, beds are being underutilised because of circumstances such as these.  I have stated previously that a disability should not mean that a person cannot live an independent life.  The State needs to up its game.  People with a disability and their families deserve a break and it is time to secure what is needed and necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900030#HH00300"><p>I commend Deputies O'Dea and O'Rourke on bringing forward this Bill.  As politicians, many of us in this House have been involved in local authorities at one time or another.  We are very much aware of the works that are needed to help and support elderly people in their homes.  Those who apply for this type of grant have often suffered some medical event and are in hospital.  They need to get out and, as colleagues know, everybody wants to live in their own home.  That is where they want to be.  This Bill will ensure that decisions on applications for a housing adaptation grant are made within a month of an application being submitted.  As was said earlier, the works involved do not cost a fortune.  The maximum grant is &euro;30,000 but in most cases &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 would make all the difference to the applicant.  It may allow people to come home or to have a level access shower or whatever they need in their homes.  It is, therefore, very important to them.</p><p> Sligo County Council processed a significant number of grants last year.  This year, the council made funds available in its budget for 2019 but unfortunately the allocation to the council was cut by &euro;200,000.  Many people will be left in hospital because a grant is not available.  In April 2019, the HSE confirmed that 620 patients are in hospitals because of delayed discharges.  These are people who are medically fit and would be ready to go home if their homes were suitable.  The current approach is penny wise and pound foolish.  It is crucial that these grants are made available quickly because waiting for the outcome for two or three months holds up a bed in a hospital or somewhere else.</p> <p> Housing aid for the elderly is another issue involving Sligo County Council.  For the past 18 months, except in the case of a category one application, which doctors are very reluctant to approve, no grant has been available.  Some people in Sligo have not been able to avail of a grant for 18 months.  These are important grants because they provide funds to fix a leaking roof, broken windows and other repairs needed to secure a house and make it suitable for people to live in comfortably.  Will the Minister of State address this issue because it is very unfair?</p></speech>

It may be the result of weeks spent on canvassing during the local elections.  I am sorry the Deputy did not get a copy of the amendment.  It is on the Order Paper, however.  It is a straightforward amendment which proposes to move the second reading of the Bill six months into the future, if possible.  I hope Deputy Scanlon and his colleagues will agree to it.  I will explain the reasons for doing so as I go along.</p><p>We recognise the spirit of the Bill and that it is not political legislation but a genuine effort to discuss how we can improve in this area.  In that vein, while we are happy to agree with the Bill in as far as possible, we are seeking a time extension to deal with some aspects of it.We are not opposing the Bill, even if we might not agree with everything being put forward.  This amendment seeks to secure agreement in the House.  Deputies, councillors and others all agree that this is an area that needs change.  We want to see this money spent much faster on the homes of those who need it.  We started work on this issue some months ago.  We want to continue with the review and the workshops that are taking place to enable us to implement the appropriate changes.</p><p>Clearly, everybody wants changes in this area but we have to get these changes right.  Making some small changes now and then some other minor ones later is not the answer.  We need full reform of this area, which is why we started the review.  We also launched a document some months ago.  It details a whole policy framework and a new approach from the Departments of Health and Housing, Planning and Local Government with all of the local authorities.  It focuses on housing options for those who are ageing.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson on matters affecting older people, Deputy Butler, agreed with the plan and indicated it was a good process.  The plan includes a commitment to review this whole area and the review started some months ago.  We want to make changes and we recognise that has to happen.  Everybody here has expressed that view as well.  We are committed to making positive changes where that can be done.  It is not the case that we are trying to hide or run away from this issue and this is not an attempt to apportion credit.  People know me at this stage and that is not what I am into.  This is about doing the right thing.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il will come on board and agree to park this Bill for six months as we complete the work that is under way.  That would allow us to bring in all of those changes as well. </p><p>I thank Deputies O'Dea, O'Rourke and Murphy O'Mahony for bringing forward the Bill.  It is important that we have this discussion and debate.  We probably do not discuss this issue enough in this House.  I stated before that the whole issue of housing for the elderly and people with disabilities is one we have to focus on much more.  At every meeting we have with local authorities we push the need to focus on the needs of those from different age groups and those with different abilities.  We are also planning ahead for new housing for people who are ageing so that we will not always be trying to adapt.  We recognised at the policy launch that while we are waiting for the supply of new houses to come on stream, we will have to adapt much of the housing stock in the private and public sectors.  We are committed to doing that and to increasing funding in this area every year in the foreseeable future. </p><p>I may be incorrect but I thought I heard a previous speaker refer to funding of &euro;1 million being available this year.  The figure for this year is &euro;71 million and it was &euro;64 million last year.  A second fund exists for the adaptation of social housing.  Spending in the area we are discussing is &euro;71 million this year.  It is correct that it should be at that level and the amount allocated will increase every year.  We need to do that because we recognise that there is major demand in this area.  Last year, this funding helped with the adaptation of 11,000 houses and we hope to do the same again this year.  Deputy Scanlon is right that in some cases the spending required is not substantial.  In many cases, the amounts involved are between &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000.  A figure closer to &euro;30,000 may be needed in some cases but in many cases an intervention of &euro;10,000 makes a big difference and is life-changing for a family.  We all recognise that and we want to work on that as well.</p><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this.  I am seeking to table a reasonable amendment to the Bill proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il to defer the second reading for six months to explore further the extent to which the underlying ambition of the Bill can be addressed in the context of a review, which has been under way since April, of the operation of the relevant grant schemes and to allow for further consideration of certain legal issues associated with the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a requirement that local authorities adhere to a defined decision time when administering the housing adaption grant for people with a disability.  </p><p>While not subscribing to every aspect of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, the Government will not oppose it.  In the time available, I will outline some of the issues that require consideration and some of the actions that are under way to improve the quality and management of the grant application process.  We have workshops with all of the local authorities where we encourage best practice.  Some counties excel in this area and make quick decisions, while others, which the Deputies will know well, are behind the curve in administering these grants.  The money is allocated and the local authorities know it is coming, yet there are still major delays.  These decisions are often administered locally.  I want to stress that some local authorities do a great job and we must acknowledge that.  We cannot paint everyone with the same brush.  </p><p>The suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability for private homeowners is 80% funded from the Exchequer, with a 20% funding contribution from the resources of each local authority.  These grants are implemented locally by the local authorities.  Three distinct grant types are available.  The housing adaption grant for people with a disability provides a grant of up to &euro;30,000 to assist people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out on their homes.  The housing aid for older people scheme provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out.  The mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast-track grants of up to &euro;6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household.  Demand for the grants has been consistently high since the schemes were introduced in 2007.  Rebuilding Ireland includes a commitment to increase funding and make the grants more accessible.  A similar commitment is made in A Programme for a Partnership Government and the policy document launched some months ago and sponsored by two Departments.  Everybody is focused on this area.  Deputy Scanlon acknowledged that he is trying to be helpful and is not being political.  </p><p>The recently published policy document, Housing Options For Our Ageing Population, also strongly emphasised the Department's commitment to streamlining the application process and ensuring that grants are more accessible to applicants, specifically those who need them.  This debate on Second Stage provides us with some time to consider the general principle of the Bill.  I will outline some of the issues of concern to the Government on which we need to reflect in the months ahead.The key provision in the Bill is that decisions must be made by the local authority on grant applications within four weeks.  The motivation behind the Bill, as I mentioned, may be to address the longer waiting times that exist in some but not all local authorities.  The approach of legislating for a precise defined timeline on applications does not address the real underlying causes of longer waiting times in some local authorities.  There are a number of issues involved, including the priorities of some local authorities and the demands they face in respect of local agendas.  The submission of incomplete applications can also lead to delays.  We have addressed this issue and we want to focus on whether the forms are too complicated and if there is too much red tape involved in the process.  Deputy Scanlon referred to that point.  Some local authorities require the submission of additional documentation.  We also want to focus on that issue, try to reflect best practice and streamline the processes involved.  A requirement for planning permission is also a factor in some applications.  This is very often a grey area that needs to be clarified.  The availability of occupational therapists and construction tradespeople to provide estimates of costs is another issue in certain areas.  </p><p>From a practical perspective, the Bill, as presented, may have unintended consequences.  The grants already have a legislative base under the Housing Acts and the regulations made under those Acts.  It is in those regulations that operational arrangements are appropriately set out, not in separate primary legislation that may only serve to confuse the legislative landscape.  It might be a case of having to change those regulations instead of the primary legislation.  The full scheme title, as covered by the relevant regulations, is the &quot;Housing Adaption Grant for Older People and People with a Disability&quot;.This Bill, however, is entitled the Housing (Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability) Bill 2018.  It is unclear, therefore, whether the Bill intends to cover all three of the grants available under the scheme or just the housing adaption grant for people with a disability.  I trust that probably is the intention but this matter must be identified and rectified.</p><p>If it is intended to cover the housing adaptation grant only for those with disabilities, it may lead to a two-tier system whereby applications under other schemes are processed differently.  I doubt that is something the proposers want to achieve.</p> <p> Enactment of the Bill would mean an applicant would have to submit a report from a construction professional such as an architect or building engineer with the completed application stating the dwelling is suitable for the proposed works, which is to say that it is suitable for a person with disability.  Currently, this function is normally carried out by local authority inspectors following the receipt of an application.  This legislation could require an applicant to source and pay for a report before an application is submitted.  That is the danger of the way the legislation is drafted and it is something we want to address.  I accept that is not what it is sought to achieve, I state simply that it arises as an issue.  We have to ask whether it is the right approach and tease it out.  The Government's view is that the provision is contrary to the objective of reducing the quantity of documentation required at application stage.  We should give consideration to the issue before progressing the Bill.</p> <p> We must also consider the practical implications of the legislation in respect of the requirement for an occupational therapist's report.  The Bill requires that such a report be submitted with an application.  According to Deputy Frank O'Rourke, the intention is that the community occupational therapists will provide the report, but in some cases people have to pay for that service.  I acknowledge that the approach is consistent with the practice of a number of local authorities which require an applicant to pay for the occupational therapist's report up front and to claim up to &euro;200 back from the local authority.  However, the proposal would close out flexibility for other local authorities which cover the costs by engaging panels of local occupational therapists to evaluate applications when they are received.  The latter approach is easier for the applicant as the local authority handles the provision and payment of the therapist who works on a panel.  Further, there are cases in which an occupational therapy report is unnecessary.</p> <p> I raise also the concerns that arise in the proposal that two estimates of costs be submitted by an applicant along with proof of a contractor's tax clearance certificate.  Local authorities already operate this policy, but they advise the Department that applicants are finding it increasingly difficult to get tradespeople to provide quotes.  Local authorities do not require two costs estimates if there are genuine difficulties obtaining them but the Bill has the potential to remove this flexibility.  I recognise that the majority of authorities have this requirement, but they are telling us they want to move away from that.  It is something one might want to change in the Bill.</p></speech>

I commend Fianna F&aacute;il on introducing the Bill and hope sincerely that we can all work together to improve dramatically the entire process whereby citizens with disabilities access vital funding to carry out adaptation works to their homes.  Improving the system through a speedy and simplified process would be a great relief to family members who find themselves utterly frustrated, annoyed and under severe stress as they try to navigate what can be an arduous bureaucratic nightmare.  Their energies would be better channelled towards their suffering loved ones.  I note from a reply to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, last week the significant disparity in the drawing down of funding across local authorities up to 30 April 2019.  This is consistent with the position in years gone by when funding drawdown appeared to have no consistency on a local authority by local authority basis.  To the end of April 2019, not a single euro was drawn down in Cavan, Laois, Louth, Offaly or Wicklow by any local authority to fund housing adaptions.  Kildare has drawn down just &euro;19,228 whereas Wexford County Council drew down &euro;637,136.  This is absolute madness.  While budgetary processes and timelines may offer some explanation, the differences recorded are beyond belief.  In that regard, I must say "Well done, Wexford".</p>  <p>  Housing adaptations must be streamlined in a single system and funding must be apportioned without delay on the basis of need.  The time it takes for funding to be returned by a local authority which does not use its allocation to meet the demands of another leaves people waiting unnecessarily.  Money must be made available as a matter of urgency for those in need.  What we know for sure is that changes must be made because the system in place does not work in the manner it needs to.  Of course, there is an onus on local authorities to ensure works proposals and related funding requirements for housing allocations are as accurate as possible.  As such, there should be no extensive waiting lists for housing adaptation grants.  Similarly, funding provision must be fluid with funds being made available as need arises across all local authority areas.  Adapting houses on the basis of need is economically and socially prudent.  It is widely recognised that the best care a person can receive is provided in the setting of their own homes and communities surrounded by family, friends and neighbours.  We are all aware of the cost of full-time residential care in nursing home settings, whether public or private.  We are aware also that there is an acute shortage of beds with long waiting lists to secure a nursing home place.  It is imperative therefore that funding is made available to carry out adaptations to homes when needed.</p>  <p>  I turn now to address a related housing and disability matter as the debate allows.  I am sure all Deputies will know Ms Sinead Stack who has lobbied every Deputy, Senator and MEP in relation to her brother who is desperately seeking a residential place in County Kerry.  Ger Stack is 40 years old and has a profound intellectual disability, physical disability and epilepsy and he is non-verbal.  Ger and three peers are all now middle aged with complex care needs requiring high level, 24/7 support for all aspects of their lives.  They are all living at home with aging carers, in most of cases their parents.  Many of their parents are struggling with health issues of their own.  What is required is a residential service to provide a forever home for these four adults.  Engagement with the HSE and the St. John of God organisation took place two years ago and an application for emergency funding was submitted to the HSE.  The HSE agrees that there is a residential service requirement to meet Ger Stack's long-term care needs, but no funding has been received for the development of a service in 2018 or 2019 for Cork and Kerry community healthcare.  Mr. Stack's needs have now been placed with a residential placement committee which comprises representatives from all relevant organisation in the Cork and Kerry area.  The committee reviews applications for residential places and assigns priority on the basis of need.  Mr. Stack's data have also been placed with the management assessment process of the disabilities services.  That allows a profile to be established and a residential place identified should a vacancy arise.  I ask the Minister of State to note all of what I am saying in the absence of the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities who I expected would be here tonight.  In December 2017, Ms Sinead Stack and family members and advocates met the Minister of State and did so again yesterday.  I appeal in the strongest terms for the issue to be looked at as a matter of urgency and given the priority address it undoubtedly requires.  Direct intervention is necessary and I urge the Minister of State, Deputy English, to speak to his colleague to ensure this matter is addressed at long last.</p>  <p>  The Bill states that its aim is to provide for ease of access to housing adaptation grants for people with disabilities where applicants qualify for same and to provide for related matters.  The Bill states further that local authorities administering housing adaptation grants for people with disabilities shall from establishment day process in so far as practicable an application for such a grant within a period of not more than four weeks from the date of receipt of said application.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports these aims.  I join Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in urging the Government to support the Bill on Second Stage to allow the proposals contained therein to be addressed in greater detail on remaining Stages.  As disabilities spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, I commit our support for the Bill on all Stages.  I commend those who moved the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900032#KK00300"><p>The Bill calls for standardisation, ease of access and time limits in respect of applications for housing adaptation grants and I support that call.  However, if the matter of insufficient funding for the volume of applications in the system is not addressed, speeding up grants will be illusory.  I refer to my experience with Louth County Council where there are 460 outstanding grant applications.</p><p>This includes 138 roll-overs from last year that could not be processed, as we were told, due to the lack of funding.  Some 76 of those were deemed to be priority 1 and this year's allocation is inadequate to process all of those, including the roll-overs from last year.</p> <p> I will provide a couple of examples.  An elderly couple contacted my office about their application.  The husband has a malignant tumour affecting his bowel and bladder.  He also has epilepsy and breathing problems.  His wife has steadily worsening mobility issues and other chronic illnesses.  They have to use an upstairs bathroom.  They submitted an application for a downstairs bedroom and bathroom in January 2018 and they were deemed by the council to be priority 1 in April 2018.  The following month, they were told that the budget had been fully allocated for 2018 already.  They were told that if the council did not receive additional funding then their application could not be processed until this year.  I wrote to the council many times about their application and stressed that they are both seriously ill.  Finally, this month they have been informed that the works will go ahead - 18 months after they first applied and both being deemed priority 1.</p> <p> Another constituent had two hip operations and is unable to access his bath.  He applied for a grant for an accessible shower and a stairlift.  He was informed that the grant was approved in February 2018.  In February of this year, 12 months later, I had to write to the council to query the delay.  It responded to the effect that he is on a housing list, that the application for adaptation works had been added to the relevant waiting list and that it could not confirm a timeline for the commencement of those works.</p> <p> Given that there are carryovers every year, funding is in no way sufficient to deal with the sheer volume of applications.  People are struggling to perform basic daily tasks such as using the bathroom or even having a shower because they cannot access a bath.  They are waiting years for downstairs bathrooms and showers to be fitted because of delays and insufficient funding.  Priority 1 emergency cases are having to wait much longer.  I have provided two examples but I could outline many others for the Minister of State.  Some of the cases are really serious and it is shameful that people have been made to wait so long.</p> <p> Not only must it to address matters relating to ease of access, time limits and standardisation, the Government must also address the fact that the funding available is insufficient.  Tinkering around the edges is pointless if the funding is insufficient.  That is one of the major issues in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900033#LL00200"><p>I commend Deputies O'Dea and O'Rourke on tabling the Bill.  I support the Bill's general principles, although the issues are far wider than the specifics of the Bill.  This is an opportunity for us to raise those issues.  Deputy Munster has outlined in fair detail the kind of cases that we are all dealing with in terms of delays and inadequate money.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, stated that &euro;71 million has been allocated this year.  I presume that is just for the private grants - those for older people and the disability and mobility grants - all of which make a huge difference to people's lives and allow them to remain at home or be discharged from hospital or from long-term care in a way that is beneficial to individuals and their families but also to the public purse, out of which hospital charges, long-term care costs, etc are paid.  It is one of those schemes that generally gives rise to a far greater benefit than the actual cost involved.  Unfortunately, the different Departments operate in silos and they all have their own spending budgets.</p>  <p>  We all need to make the case for more money for these grants because, as has been stated, there is a shortage of money.  In addition, waiting times are far too long, particularly for people who desperately need access to certain facilities.  I deal a lot with individuals who cannot get into their baths and they are looking for level access showers.  Some really good wet rooms and showers have been installed in people's homes.  These have made an enormous difference to the lives of those involved because they have been able to remain in their homes.  Similarly, there are others who have been waiting for far too long.  In many cases, such individuals have physical disabilities which mean that they simply cannot manage in houses that do not have level access showers.</p>  <p>  There is something of a postcode lottery at play here.  The system is far more efficient in some local authority areas than in others.  There needs to be a level of consistency imposed by the Department.  I am aware that local authorities are singular entities and that they are autonomous in many ways.  However, surely there can be some national monitoring strategy or policy which ensures that there is that level of consistency throughout the country.  Calling local authorities in and telling them what they should be doing does not seem to be effective with some of them.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, the Bill relates to private grants.  However, I am concerned about council tenants.   I was shocked in the past week when I received an email in respect of a particular applicant who is a council tenant and who needs a bathroom conversion.  The reply stated, "At the moment we are not accepting applications as we have over 2 yrs of backlog and are still awaiting funding to be released from the department so we cannot accept new applications at present."  That is two years of a backlog in the local authority area in which Deputy O'Dea and I both live.  I am sure it is not the only local authority that has such a backlog.  These grants are good whether one is a private house or a council house but people in council houses should not have to wait that length of time.  If a person lives in a private house, he or she might have some chance of managing to do some of the work himself or herself.  However, people who live in council houses cannot do such work.  They have no choice about the matter and, as is obvious, they are in a lower income bracket.</p>  <p>  There should be a greater focus on funding for those who live in council houses.  I know of many people who live in these houses and who have not been able to these adaptations done within any kind of decent timescale.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that a greater focus is placed on council tenants.  I am not saying that money should be taken from Peter in order to pay Paul.  However, this area has been neglected and more funding is required in respect of it.  When the Minister of State is allocating funding again, I hope he will look at that aspect.  The European Committee of Social Rights issued a report yesterday which basically states that the condition of council homes in Ireland is very bad.  I accept that this is a more general form of criticism but if there was more funding available in respect of these grants, people would probably enjoy better living conditions.  That is the main point I wanted to make, although there is a general point on which I agree with previous speakers.</p>  <p>  On the Bill, I am not quite sure why there is so much detail in the requirements which the Minister of State has said may need to be changed in terms of occupational therapy reports, the need for two estimates, etc.  It was probably not necessary to include that level of detail but perhaps it is there for a reason.  The Bill should proceed to the next Stage.  If necessary, it can be amended to make it consistent with the existing legislation, which covers the three grants, namely, housing aid for older people and the disability and mobility grants.</p>  <p>  In general, I support the Bill.  As stated, however, I would like to see a focus on council tenants who are waiting a long time for adaptations in their homes.  Their homes are as much theirs as are those of people who own private dwellings and who make applications.  We need to ensure that we do whatever can be done in order to allow people to live in their own homes.  Everyone agrees that the latter is best for people, particularly if it can be facilitated.  I will support the Minister of State if he needs to get more money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to ensure that we can do what is necessary.  It makes sense, from a cross-departmental perspective, to spend this money because it will lead to money eventually being saved by the Department of Health and result in the best outcome for the people involved.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>

I am sure everyone will agree the current process in most local authorities is highly cumbersome.  It needs to be streamlined, while the guidelines for the adaptation grant should be clarified because they are quite bureaucratic.  Anecdotally, there have been cases where people who needed modifications have died while waiting for the grants to be processed.  That has happened in the area covered by South Dublin County Council to individuals who waited for more than two or three years for essential work on their house but who died in hospital while waiting for their application to be processed.  That is not good.</p>  <p>  The funding for the adaptation grant was reduced from &euro;95 million to &euro;71 million this year, which has a knock-on effect for local authorities and, more important, people who avail of the grant.  In South Dublin County Council, &euro;2.5 million is provided for private tenants, which is oversubscribed, as it is for council tenants.  The waiting time is two years for a stairlift or walk-in shower, which are essential forms of adaptation.  Without them, people cannot leave hospital, while if they live at home, they must sleep downstairs because they cannot go upstairs.</p>  <p>  I turn to the criteria for the grant.  The maximum grant is currently &euro;30,000, although I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong.  I have done some calculations with that figure.  If two parents earn the average industrial wage, it will put them over the threshold in South Dublin County Council.  While the average industrial wage is no great shakes, if both parents earn it, or above &euro;60,000, they cannot avail of anything - not a penny.  Despite potentially having a child with special needs, they will not receive any money through the grant, which is deeply unfair.  The thresholds and income disregard should be much higher than they are, which goes to the crux of the issue.  Some people are disadvantaged because they work, while others do not work but are nonetheless at a disadvantage because they cannot have the necessary works done.  It is important to reconsider the means test, the threshold and the income disregard because as time passes, people wish to remain at home rather than move to institutions or hospitals.  That is how community care has developed and will continue to develop.</p>  <p>  I am glad we are having the debate and hope something can come out of it.  I have been a Deputy for three years and know that while issues such as this are often discussed, sometimes nothing ever happens.  I hope that through the Bill, along with the Minister of State's amendment, circumstances can be streamlined and improved for everybody to whom they apply.</p></speech>

The grants are available when changes need to be made to a home to make it suitable for a person with a physical, sensory or intellectual disability or a mental health difficulty to live there.  The grant can help people make changes and adaptations to their home by, for example, making it wheelchair accessible, extending it to create more space or adding a ground-floor bathroom or stairlift.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced funding for 2019 of &euro;71.25 million nationally for the housing adaptation grant for older people and people with a disability living in private houses.  This included an allocation of &euro;1.4 million to Donegal County Council for 2019.  The funding was for two separate grants, however, which was not made clear in a reply to my recent parliamentary question on the issue.  The problem since cuts to funding were made since 2010 during the peak of the recession is that local authorities were running into deficits because the Government never matched the funding required for the grants.  Donegal County Council spent faster than the money was coming in from the Government, which put the council in a crisis where grants were severely restricted and as a result the criteria were changed to restrict the number of people who could qualify.  Furthermore, it meant that a hierarchy of illnesses emerged for applicants, where only those with the most severe of disabilities were eligible while others had to be adjudicated on.</p>  <p>  This was all done as a way to manage local government funding rather than effectively manage the needs of people with a disability.  Money was available to be spent accordingly, such as on social housing rents, but this was not done.  Over the years, the local authority reduced funding for other grants such as for non-essential repairs.  A domino effect resulted in the continual curtailing of funding and other services to maximise the use of the limited money available for the housing adaptation grant.  The council tried to facilitate the same number of people but each person ended up receiving much less.  It was also a way of satisfying councillors and their demands to ensure that the grants would be made available to people who needed them.</p>  <p>  I was initially supportive of the Bill until I examined it and realised that it will change the process by placing an additional onus on the applicant and moving the burden of proof away from the local authorities and towards the individual.  Currently, the council sends someone to check the layout of the work in the applicant's home and send an application to the occupational therapist, who then decides whether works are required to adapt the home adequately for the applicant.  An added complication is there are not enough occupational therapists within the HSE, which adds to delays in application waiting times.  I wonder whether the Bill is an attempt to free up the HSE of increased demand by restricting the number of successful applicants through placing the burden on the individual with a disability.  It is unclear whether the Bill fails to address the existing burden of proof imbalance or whether it might be a way of trying to manipulate the system, but at least Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that the system is broken.</p>  <p>  I will not, at this time, support the Bill because it will bring greater hardship to individuals with a disability seeking a housing adaptation grant.  We need increased funding and a move towards transferring the burden of proof from applicants to local authorities in order that disability supports and local supports, in general, will be viewed as a human right.</p></speech>

It should be progressed and we can take all points on board during the debate in committee, where Deputies can work out how we can most effectively accelerate the application process.  That is the most important aspect of the issue.  I am aware of a case of a woman who had to go into care and was waiting for her grant application to be processed.  An extension to her house was being built but, unfortunately, she passed away just before she had the opportunity to return home.  In another case, a man contacted me in September, having made an application in February.  When we called the local authority, we were informed it would be another eight or ten weeks before the decision was made.  When I called the man today for an update, he said that while the application had been granted, he was still waiting for the job to be done.  He has waited since February 2018, which is not acceptable.  These are not exceptional cases.  There are more such cases than there are straightforward cases where the application is processed and granted promptly.</p>  <p>  Another issue that has been raised with me relates to when some part of the application form has not been completed properly or where the occupational therapist report has not been included.  The application is returned to the applicant by the local authority and when it is resubmitted, it is put at the end of the list rather than being filed under the date on which it was originally submitted.  Section 2(2) seeks to address that.  If somebody needs a support such as a ramp to gain access to his or her house, it needs to be provided immediately because the person needs it, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree.  Leaving an application for so long is ridiculous.</p><p>In my short contribution I want to mention occupational therapists.  Many people must go to private occupational therapists and pay out &euro;200 when they should be getting the service through the system.  This also needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

We know the social and psychological benefits of this as well as the economic benefits.  The difficulties I have encountered include that the level of documentation required is often very problematic for the applicant.  While we know people of various ages apply for the housing adaptation grant the general demographic is older people, and when we look at the extent of the paperwork, red tape and emails it is very difficult.  People might have a family member who can assist them but sometimes they do not.  I wonder about the old-fashioned phone service with a real person at the end of the phone.  Could this be put in place when it is necessary?</p>  <p>  The turnaround time is also problematic.  People qualify for a housing adaptation grant for a reason.  The condition or disability warrants whatever improvements must be carried out to improve the quality of life.  The illnesses and disabilities do not stand still while the documentation is being filled in and the application is going through the system.  We know people have had to try to make do by bringing a bed downstairs, probably in a very small space, and using a commode.  This makes life very unpleasant.</p>  <p>  As has been said, there are people who cannot afford to pay for private therapy and we need to look at the availability of occupational therapists.</p>  <p>  We know people feel comfortable in their own homes because that is where their friends, neighbours and community services are, whether day care centres or meals on wheels.  There is a responsibility to try to keep people in their homes as much as possible.  It is a much more caring approach.</p>  <p>  We do not want the hassle that the housing adaptation grant system is at present.  I must say that in the dealings my office has had with Dublin City Council we have found the staff to be very engaging, helpful and professional.  It is fine to have individuals who are helpful but the process needs to be revamped to make the system much more efficient, timely and responsive to people when they have needs and not what we have seen, whereby the adaptation grant is provided but not until after the person has passed on or has had to go into a hospital or nursing home.</p>  <p>  We could also look at extensions to houses.  We know about the housing crisis and overcrowding.  Some houses have the space to extend, whether at the back or side, and we could look at this because it would remove people from the housing list if they could have their own door on part of the land they have.  We are looking for efficiency for ease of access for those who really need it and that it is addressed in a timely way.</p></speech>

It is the Independent Alliance.</p>  <p>  I compliment Deputies O'Dea and O'Rourke for bringing forward the Bill on an excellent scheme.  When common sense applied and there was plenty of funding many badly needed adaptations were carried out and I salute the staff on the local authority for the work they do.  I also commend the occupational therapists on going out.  It has become a bit bureaucratic of late, like everything else.  This is a pity because it is a great scheme that keeps people out of hospitals and nursing homes.  Above all, it keeps them where they are happiest, which is in their homes with their families, neighbours and friends.  It is a saving and a win-win for the State.</p>  <p>  This is a vital issue that can significantly affect the quality of life of a person with a disability.  A total of 15% of the population in Tipperary, amounting to 23,593 people have at least one disability, more than 10,940 people in Tipperary have a difficulty with pain, breathing or other chronic illness or condition, while 10,374 people have difficulties with basic physical activities.  We have good hurlers in Tipperary also so do not get bogged down with these figures.  These are large enough numbers of people to whom we must show compassion and look after.  Disability and the need for adequate housing conditions to enable independence are vital issues for many people.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Dea said when he introduced the Bill, there are serious defects in the administration of the current scheme and how it is operated by various local authorities.  Nothing is uniform as it varies from local authority to local authority.  It is not as efficient as it should be or could be.  We need to address this to ensure fast turnaround times to enable people to live in their own homes, and we need to do this with compassion and empathy.</p></speech>

I thank Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy O'Dea for giving us this opportunity.  The housing adaptation grant is very important for people who need it.  None of us knows the minute or the hour when someone belonging to us would become ill or disabled and it is very important that people can access the housing adaptation grant and get a little bit of help through this.  However, there are difficulties.  We do not have enough funding for bigger issues, such as somebody who wants an extension.  I know of several cases and in one case the husband is in a wheelchair and the wife is very incapacitated.  They have been waiting for a number of weeks for an occupational therapist.</p>  <p>  I honestly believe the Government is the best crowd in the world for the bush in the gap.  There is a problem with people accessing what the Government tells them they are entitled to.  If they were keeping a thieving heifer out of a field they would have no bother because it is now impossible to access some of the services people are told they are entitled to.  This is no fault of Kerry County Council because it is one of its best sections and it does tremendous work in giving people what it can but its money is limited.  When people ask for a bathroom, shower or stair lift it is turned around very quickly because it is small money but when it increases to &euro;15,000 for &euro;20,000 people are waiting for a year and a half.  This is too long because year and a half for an invalid or someone in trouble is too long.  The answer we get from the local authority is that it does not have enough funding.  Will the Government please address this issue?  We need more funding for this grant.</p>  <p>  An issue giving people an awful lot of difficulty is that the age for eligibility for grant aid for the elderly has been increased to 66 years.  Previously the local authority had discretion to turn it around and do something for someone aged 59 or 60 who had a leaking roof, whether there was a door or a window falling in.  We say we want to keep people in their homes for as long as possible but over the past three or four years when people over the age of 60 look for some help they have severe difficulty because the council cannot or will not give it to them until they reach the age of 66 years.</p></speech>

Whether we speak about essential repairs, disabled person's grant or mobility aid grants they are the very grants that are so important because they help to make it practical for people to continue to live in their own homes.  Whether a person is getting older and suffering various infirmity problems, or whether, through old age or an accident, a person needs to have a house adapted, it is probably the most important work that could ever possibly be grant aided for them because it makes the difference between being in a hospital or nursing home setting or being in their own home.  This Government, previous Governments and, I am sure, future Governments will always maintain the proper place and the best place for any person to ever live is in their own home, if it is practical and possible for them to do so.</p>  <p>  At this point I want to highlight the work done by our local authority, Kerry County Council.  If we do not boast about our own crowd we cannot boast about any crowd, and I would put it to the Minister of State that Kerry County Council and the department that deals with the administration of the funding this and other Governments give to them are second to none in Ireland.  With regard to efficiency, they do their level best.  The clerks of work who look at the actual practicalities of what it takes to do the job and the engineers - I could name them but I will not embarrass them by doing so - are not good, they are excellent.</p><p>They put their hearts and souls into their jobs.  The departmental officials who process the grant applications understand that those applications are not simply forms but requests for grants for adaptation of homes to enable people to remain in them.  </p></speech>

I support the Bill as it makes provision for ease of access to housing adaptation grants for people with a disability.  Currently, huge delays are being experienced across the sector in the processing of various applications.  People with disabilities should be given vital funding to renovate their homes within one month of a request.  It is appalling that some are being forced to live in nursing homes for up to seven months owing to lengthy delays in the processing of applications for funding to adapt their homes to their physical needs.</p>  <p>  When out canvassing in west Cork recently on behalf of my brother, Danny Collins, one of the most common complaints from my constituents was the delay in application processing times.  People are on bended knee waiting for applications to be processed.  In some cases, the people waiting have no other source of income.  I was appalled to hear that not only are people waiting months for an application to be processed, in some cases people are waiting over a year.  In my view, Cork County Council is doing the best it can with the resources it has.  The area for which it is responsible stretches from Kinsale to Castletownbere.  It needs additional resources.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, cannot stand idly by and allow these delays to continue.  People are suffering.  The average time to process a housing adaptation grant for people with a disability is four months, with some applications taking up to seven months.  </p>  <p>  I support this Bill as I believe it is only fair that the local authorities that administer the housing adaptation grants on behalf of people with disabilities should complete the processing of an application within a timeframe of no more than four weeks from the date of receipt of the application.  This timeframe should apply not only to the processing of adaptation grants but across all sectors.  There is no doubt that the population is growing and thus we are seeing increases in applications across all sectors and Departments.  It is a no-brainer that this Government will need to provide Departments with additional administrative staff to meet the increased demand.  People should not have to wait months for an application to be processed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900036#OO00300"><p>These are extremely valuable grants.  We hear often from people who benefit from them, particularly older people, that they help keep them safe in their homes.  Let us all acknowledge that there is good work happening as a consequence of these grants.  I do not think that legislation on its own is always the only policy response required.  Processing times vary across the country.  There is a huge difference in the number of local authority staff employed by some local authorities relative to others.  Kerry was mentioned earlier.  Taking the example of Kerry and Meath, there are 60,000 or 70,000 more people living in Meath than there are in Kerry but the last time I checked Kerry County Council had double the number of staff of Meath County Council.  The ability to process applications is often related to staff numbers.  It is not that staff are not doing their jobs.  In areas where there is a shortage of staff application turnaround times can vary.  This needs to be examined in addition to legislative change.  It may well be that legislation is not required if administrative ability is strengthened where necessary.</p>  <p>  The means testing for some of the grants can leave a cohort of people far behind.  This cohort most definitely includes a family with a child with a disability.  Where there is a reasonable amount of earning power but there are other children, one of whom might, for example, be in college, the means test is an unfair disadvantage.  There is a different weighting required where there is a child with a long-term disability.  I do not think this requirement is being fairly or properly captured in the current grants system.  It would be useful to hear not only from the local authorities but from those people who have applied for grants and received them and those who applied and did not get them.  It would be important to hear from a focus group of that cohort about their experiences as this would enable us to identify the shortcomings and tailor our responses to those experiences.</p>  <p>  Like other speakers, I am routinely contacted about people who are in a hospital and cannot return home.  Local authorities do not take such matters into consideration in the processing of applications.  They administer applications on the basis of date of receipt and then by category but applications in respect of funding for adaptations to enable people to return to their homes are not a category in their own right.  If we are to keep people at home, well and safe and out of nursing homes, there will have to be an adjustment made in this respect.  It is really important that this is factored in.</p>  <p>  In the main, these grants are an incredibly important solution for people to live safely in their homes or to live independently.  Whatever changes need to happen need to be for the better but there is a lot that is happening that is very good as well.</p></speech>

As public representatives, this is an issue about which we are frequently contacted in our constituency offices.  This is about some of the most vulnerable in our society, some of whom are at home but ill while others are in hospital or in nursing homes.  This proposal seeks to speed up the adaptation grants processing system which is broken in the sense that processing is done at various stages.  This is tedious and difficult for families who may be already faced with the difficult task of trying to get a loved one who was ill or had a stroke home from hospital.  These grants are important to these families.  They enable people to live independently or at home in familiar surroundings, where we know people recover and make the best progress, in a lot of cases.  Also, enabling people to live at home is less costly to the State.  Bureaucracy has taken over and, perhaps, gone mad in relation to housing adaptation applications.  Local authority administration of applications is often delayed by outstanding occupational therapy reports, quotations from a builder and income statements.  While all this work is necessary, this proposal means it can be done more efficiently and faster and, thus, families will get a quick response and can then move to get their loved one home from a hospital or nursing home.  These families not only have to care for the person who is sick or has a disability, they have to bear the expenses incurred in doing so.</p>  <p>  I support this Bill and I again thank my colleagues for this tangible and practical initiative that will be welcomed across the country.</p></speech>

As stated by previous speakers, the Housing (Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability) Bill 2018 is geared towards making the system more efficient.  In doing so, we will free up hospital beds.  We all know there are people in hospital beds because their homes are not suitably adapted to enable them to return to them, which, as stated by Deputy Niamh Smyth, is the right and proper environment for them.  The introduction of a four week timeframe will speed up the process.  In my own county, the staff who deal with these applications do an excellent job.  Processing can be slow and tedious at times but that is more a fault of the system than of the staff.</p><p>They do an excellent job dealing with such grants.<br/><br/>I join my colleagues in welcoming this proposal.  I hope it will come to fruition.  I firmly believe that if it gets through the system, it will certainly improve matters for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

I know from years in local government that this grant scheme has been a victim of its own success.  It has been invaluable to people who had no money to get their houses upgraded and for those who want their loved ones to remain at home.  I welcome the Bill.  I know we often put agreements in place but we need personnel too, including occupational therapists.  Local authority staff do a great job.  Where possible, local authorities get their staff to assess the projects.  However, they do not have enough staff, particularly occupational therapists.  It is no good putting timeframes in place unless we have the personnel in place to carry out the necessary work.  I welcome what is proposed.</p></speech>

There is a crisis across the disability services sector in the context of access to those services.  I refer here to delays in respect of respite, home care, home help and home adaption grants.  Such delays affect the most vulnerable in society.  People with disabilities are increasingly being affected by poverty and social exclusion.  They want to live full, fulfilling and engaged lives and can do so with the right supports.  The Government continues to hinder access to the necessary supports for these people.  That makes little or no sense.  It certainly makes no economic sense because the State must pick up the tab when people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals are not supported.</p>  <p>  There is also the failure of the Government to act on Fianna F&aacute;il's and Deputy O'Dea's proposal to allow home care to be provided under the fair deal scheme - a sound and important idea - because it is of the view that this would be a false economy.  Instead of empowering people to live at home and have an better quality of life, their disabilities are being compounded by the lack of services available.  I compliment Wexford County Council.  It does a fantastic job of providing services when it can, but it is clearly not being given the necessary resources to allow it to offer timely supports.  People with disabilities want to live at home.  It is effective for them and good for their quality of life and their mental health.  It is also effective for the State.  The Minister needs to take action in respect of the legislation before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900037#PP00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Housing (Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability) Bill.  I thank my colleagues for introducing it.  We all acknowledge and recognise the significant and important role that the adaptation grant has played.  We have all seen it in our own communities.  When I was preparing a note for this, I quickly realised that there are two cohorts of people who avail of the grant.  The first is somebody who is living at home whose condition is deteriorating over time, whose family has the opportunity to make necessary arrangements.  The people we see in our constituency offices are those who have experienced a crisis or a traumatic event.  For example, where an elderly person has had a fall, a stroke or something similar.  They are in the hospital and the family comes to us because they want to know what to do, what is available and how to get the person home.  This is an element which is slowing the process.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, there are people in hospital today who could be in their own homes if there were appropriate and adequate facilities available to them.  That is where they want to be and it is where their families want them to be.  This legislation will assist in facilitating that.  It is important to recognise that this is only one aspect.  Previous speakers made the point that legislation only goes so far.  It is important that this legislation is enacted but it should be underpinned by the provision of home care supports for older people.  The cost of a person in the greater Dublin area spending a week in a nursing home is approximately &euro;1,500 per week.  The economic and financial benefits to the State of being able to keep somebody in his or her home, where he or she wants to be, needs to be recognised.  We need to take legislative and administrative steps to make that happen.  In many cases, people apply for the grant and try to get quotations at the same time.  It is an extremely protracted process and they are asked for additional information.  A previous speaker made the point that, during the existing application process, there is no discrimination between somebody whose case might be deemed urgent and who is currently in a hospital and ready for discharge and a person whose case does not have that level of urgency.  This creates substantial anxiety and pressure for the families involved.</p>  <p>  One or two speakers had issues with parts of this legislation.  Those issues can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I encourage Members on all sides to allow the Bill to progress.  I encourage the Government not to delay the Bill and to accept it in a positive way in the context of the other steps that could be taken.  I refer here to home care packages that would run in parallel with what is proposed here in order to ensure that we are creating the maximum amount of available spaces in our acute hospitals and not having people unnecessarily delayed in those hospitals, particularly as they do not want to be there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900037#PP00500"><p>I echo the sentiments of previous speakers who referred to the benefit of the scheme to which the Bill relates.  My council in Kilkenny has been very proactive in ensuring that the scheme is delivered across County Kilkenny.  A staffing review of local authorities will commence this summer.  Some of the issues to which Deputies referred focused on increasing levels of staffing in different authorities in order to ensure that applications are processed.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, indicated, the Government is not opposing the Bill.  While we support the objective of a timely decision on applications, some of the provisions require further consideration to ensure that ease of access for applicants to the scheme continues.</p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to address an administrative issue by means of primary legislation.  The existing legislative base, namely, the Housing Acts and the regulations made under those Acts, already provides for the implementation of the measures called for in the Bill.  On a practical level, it is unclear what real effect the additional documentary requirements proposed in the Bill would have on the processing times relating to the application process.  They run the risk of placing additional burdens on applicants.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, stated earlier, the concern is that the flexibility exercised by local authorities could be reduced by some of the provisions in the Bill.  Under the Bill, the inspection of inspection of properties could potentially be outsourced to privately-recruited engineers, with the applicants having to source and pay for this service.  This work is effectively already being done by local authority technical staff.  A personal visit by a local authority inspector to an applicant is very valuable in delivering a quality service to the people who need it.  Placing the responsibility for this work on the applicant would also result in either the applicant having to be recompensed or bearing the cost himself or herself.</p>  <p>  The Bill could also close down the flexibility for local authorities that already have a panel of occupational therapists available to evaluate applications when received.  This arrangement often provides a local authority with a reliable report on the needs of an applicant and, coupled with the input of the authority's technical staff, helps to ensure that the funding is safeguarded for those most in need.  Colleagues know that local authorities strive in every way to get the right services to the people who need them.  We all know of cases where people with a disability or the elderly apply under the scheme and the local authority goes the extra mile, often prompted by its technical resources and the inspector who has visited the applicant in his or her home.  I do not think any of us wants to lose those advantages of the scheme and that level of flexibility.</p>  <p>  I fully accept that consistency of approach is a critical issue in the administration of these grants.  This is being pursued through the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a clear roadmap to achieve the Government's goal of streamlining the application process and ensuring ease of access for applicants.  The Government is focused on taking concrete action to deal with certain inconsistences which currently exist with regard to the grant application process and administration of the scheme nationwide.  The majority of local authorities have adapted their approach in recent years to ensure that the available resources are targeted at those in most need, including prioritisation on the grounds of medical or financial need.</p><p>The Department seeks to bring together the experience that has been built up since the scheme was introduced and to ensure the shared knowledge is further developed across the 31 local authorities.  I am very conscious of the social benefit accruing from the scheme, in particular facilitating people to remain living independently in their own homes and communities.</p> <p> Significant progress has been made in increasing the reach of the grant scheme.  More than 25,000 households have benefitted from the scheme during the first three years of Rebuilding Ireland, with funding for up to another 11,800 this year.  That means almost 37,000 households will be assisted through the grants under Rebuilding Ireland by the end of 2019.  The best way to ensure the State fully meets its obligations to those who need assistance is through improved delivery and the development and implementation of improved policies and measures, where required.</p> <p> Notwithstanding improvements to the grants process, Members will agree on how critical it has been that we have increased the funding that has been made available for the scheme in recent years.  The level of funding has increased year-on-year from 2014 when the figure was &euro;43 million to an allocation of &euro;71 million this year.  The commitment of the Government to continue support for the scheme was reinforced again recently when we published the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population - Policy Statement, with the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Jim Daly.</p> <p> As well as the increased funding in recent years the Department also works closely with local authorities to monitor spend over the year and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding.  As the year progresses, any underspend is redistributed to those authorities with high levels of grant activity who seek additional funding.  Local authorities in turn will always work with qualifying applicants to ensure they get the most beneficial result, in line with their financial circumstances.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, mentioned that the Department is in the middle of a review process on the grants which involves engaging with local authority practitioners that are on the front line.  We have met already with 18 local authorities in the past two months and the focus of this effort is on identifying and addressing inconsistencies between local authorities and making the grants more accessible.  In that work we identified variations in approach by local authorities, such as what ID is required or proof of earnings.  The differences also include processing times for applications, which is the motivation for the Bill.  I acknowledge, therefore, the merit of the Bill's main provision.  The review is a significant process that I believe will improve the operation of the grants and achieve a better application processing arrangement without losing flexibilities that are currently working well for both the authorities and for the people who live in their areas and who avail of the grants.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to adopt the reasoned amendment to the proposed Bill, and that it is deferred for a period of six months to explore further the extent to which the underlying ambition of the Bill can be addressed through the review already under way, and to allow for further consideration of certain legal issues associated with the Bill.  Without that reasoned amendment, it may mean a money message cannot be issued in respect of the proposal and time is not given to accommodate our concerns with the legislation.</p></speech>

The Bill being introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il will require local authorities to make a decision on a person's entitlement to the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability within four weeks of receiving a completed application.  The Bill, if passed, will ensure a decision on entitlement to the grant is made in a timely manner, thereby improving outcomes and increasing efficiency.</p>  <p>  Many families are unable to carry out the necessary works until their applications are approved because they simply do not have the money.  While they are forced to wait, their loved ones are living in a home and some of them are still in hospital.  We heard last year that 136,000 bed days were lost through delayed discharges, which equates to approximately 500 a day, which equates to the number of people on trolleys.  The delays and the fact that people have to stay in hospital longer due to the fact that the correct adaptations have not been carried out in their homes have a significant knock-on effect.  Affording people the opportunity to live in their own homes is a central plank of Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  In many instances, that is only possible through the installation of stairlifts, grab rails, showers, wet rooms or ramps, all of which are covered by the housing adaptation grant.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to funding.  A total of &euro;71.25 million was available nationally in 2019.  However, a problem arises with the allocation available, especially in Waterford.  There are 5,000 local authority houses in Waterford but the budget for adaptations to them is only &euro;300,000, whereas the budget for adaptations to private houses is &euro;2 million.  The waiting list for tenants of Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council for adaptations, for example, to remove a bath and put in a shower, or for a stairlift is now in excess of two to three years.  That is a very worrying trend and I wish to draw the attention of the officials to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900038#QQ00500"><p>I thank everybody who contributed to the debate.  I thank the Opposition and non-Government Deputies who have expressed their support for the legislation.  A number of points were made by various Members which I wish to address briefly.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, Deputy Munster and others made the point that many of the delays are due to funding.  In my opening statement, I outlined that &euro;71.25 million was allocated last year for housing adaptation grants, but that is woefully inadequate.  Let us face it; the population is ageing and the population is growing and, therefore, we will have more people with disabilities and more elderly people who want to live in the comfort and security of their own homes.  The question of funding is paramount and it must be taken on board.  We deliberately left out any reference to funding because, first, we could not put extra funding in the Bill for obvious constitutional reasons concerning money messages.  We are concentrating on the process so that the Government will not have any excuse to refuse to accept the legislation.</p>  <p>  My constituency colleague from Limerick City, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, spoked about housing adaptation funding for local authority houses.  I am sure the situation is mirrored around the country, but the situation in Limerick is beyond contemptible.  I dealt with an elderly woman last week who is unable to walk and has to crawl up the stairs because it is a local authority house and Limerick City and County Council does not have money to fund a stairlift.  The council cannot say when it will have the money and it cannot accept application forms.  I have come across that situation again and again.  I could give more graphic examples to the House but I will spare Members from those.  I am sure the situation is mirrored around the country.  We are conscious of the situation regarding funding both for private accommodation and for local authority accommodation.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed with the Government's response to the Bill.  I often listened to Ministers and could not believe what I was hearing, but it is the opposite this evening; I cannot believe what I am not hearing, which is that the Government is going to withdraw this ridiculous, absurd amendment and allow the Bill proceed to the next Stage.  What in the name of heaven is the purpose of an amendment that delays further consideration of the Bill for six months?  As I said in my opening statement, occasionally, we get the opportunity in this House to do something that will tangibly benefit people who need to be helped - a vulnerable section of society.  The Government was presented with that very opportunity when Deputy O'Rourke and I introduced the Bill and it deliberately, callously, calculatedly and with malice and forethought decided it would not do any good for those people, that it would let the current, unsatisfactory, bureaucratic-ridden situation continue unabated.</p><p>If those people are suffering as a result it is too bad.  It is too bad if they are suffering from anxiety and distress while waiting to know whether they will get a grant and, if so, how much it will be.  That does not seem to matter.  It is kicked into the Bermuda Triangle and will not be discussed for six months.  Who knows what will have happened by then, or what this House will look like then.  This is basically telling us to sod off, if I may use that expression in Parliament.  The Government is not interested.  It pretends it is doing studies and that it is concerned, but it is not really interested.  It has been given the opportunity to do something important but instead kicks it off into the Bermuda Triangle.  </p> <p> Given the reasons for the postponement, it is no surprise the Minister of State did not issue a script.  He was the sole possessor of the script, which we are all supposed to get a copy of, and he raced through it at a rate of knots.  He speaks quickly at the best of times, but he really excelled today.  I suspect the reason the script was not circulated was that the reasons and excuses given are so ridiculous, threadbare and tenuous that the Government was afraid it would be released to the media.  It will be available, and we will release it.  He said that in 2017 - some two years ago - the Government decided this had to be dealt with and the system had to be streamlined.  He now says the Government is beginning to consider how to streamline the system.  We are two years down the road.  People are suffering.  They are waiting, and the numbers in the queues are growing, and the Government is only now beginning to consider the process of streamlining.  As the Minister of State's speech went on, the situation became even more risible.  We were told that some people approached local authorities with incomplete submissions.  Under the system Deputy O'Rourke and I are proposing, if one's submission is incomplete, due to an error in the form or a missing document, he or she will be met at the counter by the relevant official, who will tell the person to come back with the correct documents.  The Government is scratching around for excuses.  </p> <p> We are told that different local authorities need different types of documentation.  We are proposing a standard system in which everything will be set out.  I want to assure Deputy Pringle that it will not increase the burden on the applicant in any way.  That is not our intention.  We intend to put the minimum burden on the applicant, and we are open to any changes to the Bill which will ensure that is the case.  We were also told this may not be a subject for primary legislation but could be appropriately dealt with via secondary legislation.  The people who are waiting for their grants to be processed do not give a flying fig whether this is done via primary or secondary legislation, or subordinate legislation, or whether it is done via European law or Irish law.  They simply want the job done and for a more efficient system to be created.  </p> <p> Another excuse was given; this one is a beauty.  The Minister of State said that older people were not mentioned in the title.  Older people are among those who apply for housing adaptation grants.  I am very sorry - mea culpa - that the word "older" was not mentioned in the title.  Needless to say we will accept an amendment to that effect.  </p> <p> We were also told that some local authorities do not need two quotes whereas others do.  This will be a standardised system.  The time of Civil Servants in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is being wasted in the search for excuses.  Any excuse to fill out the time will do.  They are tasked with making what looks like a reasoned argument for why this will be delayed by six months before the Government even begins to consider it.  I believe Shakespeare said that a guilty conscious is the mother of invention.  These are all invented, contrived, ridiculous, nonsensical, threadbare arguments.  We want to help these people.  If it is the intention of the Government not to help those people then shame on it.  We are giving it a chance to do something tangible and practical for people who need help, and the Government is deliberately turning it down.  </p></speech>

I am chair of the Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and this Bill has come before our committee on several occasions.  Citizens are indebted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its courageous and heroic acts.  Garda&iacute; put themselves in the line of fire while policing communities on a daily basis.  They keep us safe from harm.  This Bill will enable members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to access the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court to help resolve industrial disputes.  This is very welcome.  Services extended would include mediation, conciliation and adjudication from the Workplace Relations Commission, and the use of the Labour Court, if necessary.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the Euopean Committee of Social Rights, ECSR, in the Council of Europe found that Ireland was in breach of several articles of the European Social Charter, including article 5, the right to organise, article 6(2), the right to bargain collectively, and article 6(4), the right to strike.  My party believes that associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be extended to Garda representative bodies to enhance their negotiation position regarding pay and conditions.  Garda&iacute; should be allowed to join and to take an active part in negotiations.  This policy was supported by the ECSR in its 2014 determination.  </p>  <p>  The Government has constantly denied there is a problem with rural crime, saying that the statistics are down.  However, that is not the experience of families living in rural Ireland.  My party has successfully campaigned in recent budget negotiations to increase the number of garda&iacute;, but greater investment is required for the force and for the communities it protects.  This is a key piece of legislation, and I hope it passes through the remaining stages swiftly and is enacted as soon as possible.  </p></speech>

This is a positive Bill.  I regret, however, that the amendment tabled by Deputy Quinlivan has not been allowed.  We have heard over a long period of time of the difficulties members of the Defence Forces face, given that they have no mechanism with which to address their issues.  The amendment was ruled out of order so I cannot speak on it, but I express the regret of the Labour Party that this has not been decided by the Government or made possible for the opposition to include the members of the Defence Forces and the many issues that face them, not least in terms of the amount of pay they receive.</p><p>Will this be taken into account?  Will consideration be given to members of the Defence Forces and the fantastic work they do for the country for little monetary reward and with no access to the organs of the State to have their case heard?  While the measures in the Bill are positive, it could have done much more.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill in April 2017 which would have allowed the representative associations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to reconstitute themselves as trade unions if they wished.  The Bill would also have given garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces full access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations mechanisms while making it illegal for reasons of public safety and national security for them to engage strike action.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister agrees with Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard but it is a shame that members of the Defence Forces will be excluded from the scope of the measure.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Report Stage amendment, which was, unfortunately, ruled out of order in the past couple of hours, aimed to change the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; contained in section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 by deleting the words &ldquo;but not including a member of the Defence Forces and of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.  We believe members of the Garda and the Defence Forces should be treated as employees when it comes to industrial relations issues.  They should have access to the Workplace Relations Commission to ensure they have a venue to bring employment related complaints.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel are the worst paid workers in the public service, with many of them relying on working family payments to make ends meet.  Members see a long-term career in the Defence Forces as unsustainable and unviable.  In order to provide for their families, they are leaving the forces in droves.  The Government must start listening to their concerns.  It must recognise members of the Defence Forces are employees and entitled to the same protections as every other worker.  This move would be particularly important as we have heard just this week from a retired general officer of the Defence Forces that the Government is treating them with contempt and disdain.  This is simply not good enough.  This is particularly relevant to many people in my constituency who are based Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick city.</p>  <p>  Although this move to provide greater workers' rights to garda&iacute; is welcome, members of the Defence Forces must not be left behind.  We believe members of the Defence Forces, as employees, should also have access to the Workplace Relations Commission where employment grievances can be mediated and resolved.  It was a shame, therefore, that the amendment was ruled out of order, as were other amendments put down on Committee Stage by Sinn F&eacute;in and Solidarity&ndash;People Before Profit.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister review and support Sinn F&eacute;in's Trade Union (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) Bill 2017 which seeks to give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces greater rights as workers?</p></speech>

As part of the resolution, the Government committed to provide the Garda representative associations with access to services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court as a mechanism to resolve industrial relations disputes future.  In decision S180/20/10 2018, the Government approved the drafting of the heads of the Bill to provide the Garda representative associations with access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  In addition to agreeing that legislation to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1990 should be put in place to provide access to the Garda representative associations to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, the Government in its decision noted other significant issues to be considered.  These included issues such as to the status of the Garda representative associations, whether they should become trade unions, the right to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take industrial action and the process of determining Garda pay.</p>  <p>  The amendment also puts the Garda representative associations on a par with trade unions only insofar as it is required to provide access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  However, it remains the case that the Trade Union Acts will not apply to the Garda representative associations or the sections of the Industrial Relations Act which confer protections on registered trade unions which engage in legitimate trade union action.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are not just simply workers.  They protect the State.  One can imagine that the right to strike in this context could have broad consequences.</p>  <p>  On the Sinn Fein concerns, the Defence Forces have a range of parallel complaint and adjudication mechanisms in law to compensate for the limitations on their access to normal industrial relations machinery which applies to wider society.</p></speech>

There has been much talk about rural Ireland since I was first elected.  At the same time, with my hand on my heart, matters are not improving for rural Ireland.  In fact, it is worse they are getting.  The most effective way to help rural Ireland is jobs.  Sadly, very few jobs are being directed to Kerry through Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.  If established industries like Liebherr Cranes, Munster Joinery, Michael Cronin&rsquo;s Readymix and Fexco in Killorglin were taken out of the heart of Kerry, one could put up a gate at the county bounds with a &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; sign on it.</p>  <p>  There is tourism in Kerry but that has been hurt badly by the Government with the increase of the VAT rate by 4.5% in one foul twist.  Kerry has a Minister of State but this is what he allowed to happen.  There are jobs coming into Dublin city, day in and day out.  Only the other day, 660 jobs were announced for Dublin.  However, the Government is not able to house them or police them.  They are killing each other in ones, twos and threes in the city.  There is no attempt to direct some of these jobs to Kerry or the west.  There are places being starved and deprived of jobs.</p>  <p>  On top of that, the Government, along with Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, were bound to the drink-driving laws of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  The social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens.  People are isolated in their homes now because they are not allowed to have a pint or two going home from work.  They can hardly come out the following morning to go to mass.  I have said here before that the Government has the churches closed, along with the Garda stations and many of the schools.</p>  <p>  Many people ask me why the Government fired my good friend and neighbour, Pat Spillane.  He was doing great work on behalf of rural communities.  The Government got rid of him because he was telling it what it did not want to hear.  He did much good work but he is now left behind.</p>  <p>  Young people are disappearing from of south Kerry at an alarming rate.</p><p>To take last year, one national school in Iveragh enrolled only two children.  That is a fact.  At an IFA meeting in Sneem three or four weeks ago, eight people were in attendance and all of them were septuagenarians aged over 73 years.  That is what is happening.</p> <p> I highlighted the issue of home help yesterday and between interruptions and one thing and another, I do not know if I was heard properly.  I will give the Minister of State an example of two elderly ladies who are trying to stay in their homes as long as possible.  The home help of one of the elderly women has been cut to 20 minutes in the evening.  When the home help arrives, the lady asks her if she could make a dinner for her but the home help tells her she cannot do that in 20 minutes but will make her a sandwich and shower her.  The lady told me she is sick to the teeth of showers and she is hungry.  She told me she asked the home help if her husband would live on sandwiches when he comes home from work every evening and if he would be happy if she told him she would give him a sandwich instead of dinner.  That elderly lady is trying to stay living in a rural place.  She cannot get the meals on wheels service because she lives too far from Killarney.  She is not being provided for, which is a sad reflection of what is happening in rural Ireland.</p> <p> The other lady is well into her 80s but she is in good shape.  Sadly, her family believe she would be better off in a home but she does not want to go into a home.  Between paying for private home help and what she is getting from the HSE, she is left with only &euro;57 a week on which to live.  That is what the Minister of State and his Government is presiding over.  I could take the Minister of State down to those two houses in Kerry to see what is happening.  It is a shame and a disgrace that this is happening in Kerry.  I am sad that I have to highlight an issue as personal as this one but what I have said is the God's gospel truth in terms of what is happening in Kerry at the present time.</p> <p> There is much talk about schemes for towns and villages.  I admire the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring.  He is a good man but he goes on a bit.  Some of the things he  should be providing for are not being provided.  He gave us funding for the local improvement schemes but I remind the Minister of State that we have 800 applications on hand.  At the rate we are going, it  will be 20 years before the last of those applications is seen to if more funding is not provided.</p> <p> Houses in towns and villages are falling down because many people have abandoned houses.  Rathmore on the N72 is the first town one comes to on the road into Kerry.  I am amazed at the number of unoccupied buildings in the town, many of which are not fit to live in.  It would be helpful to have a scheme to help address the state of such buildings in towns like Cahirciveen or even Kilgarvan.  There are many empty houses in Kilgarvan and it appears there is no future for them.  In a very short space of time, the roofs of these houses will fall in.  Caherciveen is a very a popular tourist spot on the Ring of Kerry but if something is not done sooner rather later to address the state of some of the buildings in the town, many of the roofs will collapse and the town will look terrible.  In spite of the great work done all over the county by Tidy Towns committees, which I praise on high for the great work they do, they will not be able to camouflage the damage that will be done to villages and towns in the next seven to ten years.  The roofs of most of those unoccupied buildings will collapse if a scheme is not initiated to address them.  The Minister of State is a member of the Government that is delegated with the power to address these matters.</p> <p> Many villages are practically closing down.  In Lauragh, the post office and shop have closed, in Currow, the pub and shop have closed and in Gneevgullia, the shop and post office have closed.  Scartaglin has been waiting for the past 30 to 40 years for a treatment plant.  Castleisland has been waiting for a sewerage extension scheme since 1986.  Rathmore and Kilgarvan post offices have closed.  I could go on and on.</p> <p> Another serious issue that I raised in recent days concerns people who wish to build their own homes.  They will pay for that to be done and they apply for planning permission to Kerry County Council.  However, we have one serial objector who appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la when Kerry County Council decides to grant planning permission.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then refuses planning and overrules decisions even when an inspector has called to the site and said the application should be granted.  We do not know what is going on but this would not happen in any other country.  These people would not get away with that in any other country and I am asking the Minister of State not to let them get away with it in this country or in County Kerry.</p> <p> Other factors are preventing locals from getting planning permission.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, issued a direction to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in 2012 not to allow people to open an entrance to a new dwelling on a national secondary road or have access to a new dwelling from existing entrances.  This rule applies on a road that is miles long and where it would safe to have such access.  Kerry County Council granted planning but this rule that was signed into law by the then Minister deprived five families from getting planning permission.  That is what is happening in rural Ireland.  I could go on.  The Government needs to wake up.  There are things that can and should be done.  I advise the Minister of State that the Government is letting the people down and that is the Gospel truth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900041#TT00200"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the important issues of rural and community development.  It is not an exaggeration to say that rural communities are struggling with stripped down services, bank, post office and Garda station closures and the ever present threat of rural crime.  Many of our rural villages and communities are being decimated as a result of people being unable to get planning permission for a home close to where their parents live.  Having different generations of families living close to one another is an important way to provide supports.  Grandparents can help with their grandchildren and, as grandparents get older, they have an opportunity to get the support they need from their families.  Some of our smaller schools are losing out in terms of enrolment numbers as a result.</p><p>Fine Gael&rsquo;s eight-year record has been one of stripping away rural Ireland&rsquo;s existence, leaving massive deficits in service provision, substandard infrastructure and supports.  Meanwhile, farm incomes have been hit by severe price volatility across all sectors.  This is jeopardising the family farm sector, which is the very basis of Irish agriculture, while Brexit also presents an existential threat to the sector.</p><p>There is no doubt that a two-tier recovery has been allowed to fester and growth has been concentrated on certain areas.  Government decisions are damaging the attraction of living and working in rural areas.  The European Commission has confirmed that regional imbalances across the country remain in investment, economic growth, competitiveness and innovation.  More than 40% of Irish GDP is concentrated in Dublin, while the greater Dublin area accounted for more than 70% of total employment gains nationally in the course of 2018.  The recovery is centralised.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development has described Ireland as &quot;imbalanced&rdquo;, which is a <i>de facto</i>acknowledgment that the Government is failing rural Ireland.  More than 50% of IDA Ireland site visits are still in the greater Dublin area.  Family, friends and constituents living in rural Kildare and other rural areas have an aversion to the talk of a national recovery as this Government has stripped away their services and supports.</p><p>Growth and recovery have not occurred in places like Athy, Monasterevin, Carbury, Rathangan and Portarlington.  The regional imbalances that exist have become more pronounced over the past eight years.</p> <p> While we as a party support the national broadband plan, at the same time we are not happy with the Fine Gael-led Government now promising to deliver the plan to a third fewer homes, to take three times as long to do it, and for six times the original price.  Of course, on top of that, the State will not own the network that will be built and paid for by the taxpayer.  No doubt the ballooning cost will impact on the national development plan and projects earmarked, including new bypasses and the construction of primary schools, primary care centres and social homes, as well as flood relief in rural areas.  The lack of high-speed broadband in parts of south Kildare has been hampering the development of many SMEs.  It is a problem in homes where students are unable to access the Internet for study and research.  The updated map has added 537,587 premises to the State intervention area and 13,415 of these are located in Kildare.</p> <p> The LEADER rural enterprise fund had its budget cut by 40%, or &euro;150 million, under the 2014-2020 RDP, and has been a bureaucratic mess.  There has been a significant underspend in the LEADER rural enterprise funding stream, with the alarming statistic that 80% of the total 2014-2020 funding remains unspent.  Kildare was allocated over &euro;5 million in LEADER funding but a mere 10% was spent by the end of 2018.  In Laois, which was allocated over &euro;7 million, only 14% of that was spent by the end of 2018.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, commented in the summer of 2018 that he would undertake a review of the programme and his Department has acknowledged significant underspending in the programme due to the length of time it is taking for projects to be signed off.  From direct experience, it is a bureaucratic nightmare with the Department and the local development organisations disagreeing on criteria and criteria being changed during the time that projects are in place to get funding.  Something radically needs to be done about it.</p> <p> In terms of Garda numbers, the decision of the Fine Gael-led Government to close 139 rural stations has had an adverse impact on crime rates in these communities and it is important that we have some reopened.  The Government has consistently denied that we have a problem with rural crime but this is certainly not the experience of my constituents living in rural areas.  I have been calling for an increase in the Garda force in my constituency for years and although we have seen some increases, the level is still well below the national average.  In 2018, we had 382 garda&iacute;, but that has been reduced to 371 in 2019.  In Kildare, we have two stations that remain closed with no sign of them reopening in the near future.  Both the Ballitore and Ballymore Eustace communities need their Garda stations open and garda&iacute; patrolling these areas to deter crime.  The Government must commit more garda&iacute; to Kildare and commit to ensuring safety in our towns and villages.  Anti-social behaviour and crime are on the rise and Garda numbers are decreasing at the same time.</p> <p> Our post office network must be valued for the role it plays in Irish life and the essential service it provides.  Large-scale post office closures have dealt another cruel blow to rural life in Ireland.  Everything must be done to prevent the loss of post office services in the 159 communities where postmasters or mistresses are retiring by advertising a new contract appropriate to the local area and taking into consideration the potential for co-location to continue the provision of post office services.  Fianna F&aacute;il is calling on the Government to initiate a public service obligation payment to at-risk post offices to keep them viable.</p> <p> Post offices are more than just a place to buy stamps.  They play a major part in life, particularly in rural areas, and perform social as well as practical functions.  I send a special shout out to Fogarty's in Ballymore Eustace.  Se&aacute;n Fogarty, the postmaster there, has done incredible work in attracting new and different services in eGovernment, such as VideoDoc, which greatly enhances the service that can be provided.  The closure of Valentine's in Two Mile House and the closure of the Moone and Ballybrittas post offices have created a void in those communities.  I pay tribute to the community of Moone which has turned the former local post office into a coffee shop.  It is only open at certain times during the week because it is run by volunteers, but they have really risen to the challenge.  In practice, many small towns and villages across Ireland have lost both their post office and bank branches in the past few years.  In Kilcullen, there is still a branch but for any cash services, people need to go to the town of Newbridge or Athy.  Many do not have access to cars and public transport is limited, and it is a problem.  These closures, combined with reductions in local bus services, contribute to the fragmentation of a rural community.</p> <p> Talking about rural crime - I have mentioned the Garda stations that have been closed - a large proportion of crime is being carried out by those on bail for other offences or by people with previous convictions for similar serious offences.  In 2017, 12% of all crimes were committed by persons out on bail for another offence.  We need to look at tougher bail laws and legislation is needed to provide real deterrents against reoffending.</p></speech>

While this is a lovely initiative, I am thinking of the reality.  In my own constituency of Cork South-West which is decreasing in population size, there are no young people joining voluntary groups.  GAA clubs are either disbanding or merging in rural areas because there are no young people there anymore.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is an increase in rural isolation in areas such as west Cork.  Many people living in rural Ireland are isolated and their next-door neighbour could be miles away.  I worry deeply for elderly people living in rural Ireland and the social isolation they face every day.  Many people like to live independently for as long as possible in their own homes and they need to be supported to do that.  Supports, such as the home help system, are vitally important to many people.  Unfortunately, many recipients are getting inadequate hours and this needs to be urgently addressed.  Many elderly people would not survive in their own homes were it not for the help that they get from their neighbours and their community.</p>  <p>  Volunteerism is keeping rural Ireland alive and many people give hours of help and support to their neighbours and their community.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul published a report, entitled "Older People - Experiences and Issues", where it explored the challenges of older people living in Ireland.  The report highlighted that the increased loneliness and isolation that elderly people were experiencing was also attributed to recent social and economic changes, such as the closure of local post offices.  This was described by many as "a significant loss in terms of a central place where older people could congregate for a chat".</p>  <p>  As people get older or suffer from ill-health, they may find it difficult to drive and living in a rural community can be a big problem.</p><p> I welcomed the announcement earlier this year that Local Link would be providing a service connecting Glengarriff with Kenmare and Killarney.  This is a fantastic service that operates 52 weeks a year.  It gets people out of their homes and helps tackle rural isolation.  The problem in rural areas relates to the types of services that are needed, especially for the elderly people who cannot drive for one reason or another.</p> <p> When I was out canvassing, I discovered that people's greatest frustration was with the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, guided through the D&aacute;il.  That legislation has absolutely wrecked rural Ireland.  All Deputies supported that legislation, bar a few of us over here and we were treated as if we were lepers for opposing it.  The fact is that it has had the exact effect on rural Ireland that we predicted.</p> <p> On the other side of the coin, many people in rural areas have to use their cars to commute to work.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has found that 70% of people use their cars to travel to work, 60% as drivers and 10% as passengers.  Traffic gridlock is very common, particularly at peak times.  I have called for a park-and-ride type service from west Cork to the city to be rolled out as pilot project.  This service should specifically run from Clonakilty to Cork, with some buses serving the airport and the railway station.  Each extra bus, which would accommodate 40 passengers, would have the potential to replace approximately 30 cars on the roads.</p> <p> School transport in rural areas is a major issue.  Specific buses have transported children to school for decades.  Some smaller schools have been closed and the children now attend larger, central schools.  Parishes and communities were guaranteed school bus services in the catchment areas of schools that were closed in order that children might be transported to central schools.  This is known as the closed-central school rule.  This rule was discontinued by the previous Government as one of a series of cuts relating to rural Ireland.  Its discontinuation caused great problems for many parents.  During the negotiations to form a Government, rural Deputies raised this and other issues relating to rural areas.  At the time, those who eventually formed the Government gave a commitment to restore the central-closed school rule.  This needs to be fully delivered, particularly in light of the hardship that is being visited upon families.</p> <p> Rural Ireland is deteriorating in front of our eyes.  We need investment in order that rural Ireland might be restored to its former glory.  In order to achieve this goal, we need proper infrastructure.  In the context of the Cork County development plan, Ballinspittle, an area in west Cork, was zoned as an area in which 100 additional houses might be provided.  Those houses which are needed in Ballinspittle but as a result of the failure to expand a local treatment plant, they will not be built.  We are going nowhere in a hurry.  There is no point in putting fancy words into a development plan and not delivering what is promised in reality.  As a result of that to which I refer, the development in Ballinspittle cannot be delivered and this will affect many people who want to build or buy new houses there.</p> <p> In other areas in west Cork, waste treatment plants - I know this is not relevant to the Department of Rural and Community Development but it is a rural issue - are either inadequate or totally absent.  In some coastal villages, including Goleen and Ballydehob, the waste treatment plants are poor and untreated sewage is being discharged into the sea as a result.  According to Irish Water, Castletownbere and Castletownshend are among five towns and villages in County Cork where there are substandard treatment plants and where untreated sewage is being discharged into the water.  I have been informed in writing by Irish Water that it will be some years before wastewater treatment plants will be installed.</p> <p> The Department of Rural and Community Development has responsibility for promoting and facilitating long-term economic and social progress in rural areas.  The Department is responsible for co-ordinating the Action Plan for Rural Development, including the implementation of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  There is no point in discussing LEADER.  The Government has made a hames of LEADER in terms of the way it is foot-printed and implemented all over rural Ireland.  It is only a cod.  It covers parks and benches, knives and forks and funding for simple things rather than getting down to what it was previously good for and capable of delivering.  LEADER did deliver for rural communities in the past because it operated from the ground up.  All that is gone.  Forget about it because people in west Cork do not even consider it any more, which is sad.</p> <p> Schemes catered for under the programme include the rural recreation scheme, the rural walks scheme, the town and village enhancement scheme and CL&Aacute;R.  The oversight of preparations for the timely roll-out of broadband is also covered.  In the context broadband, we all have issues regarding massive amount of money being talked about in recent months.  I will not go into that.  However, someone must talk to the private operators that are rolling out broadband over hills and dales, particularly in the context of the cost of the national broadband plan.  If these providers pull the plug, there will be people who will be without broadband for two or three years before the plan is delivered, that is, if it is ever delivered.  My advice to the Minister is to talk to the private operators and ensure that there is some comfort zone for them going forward.  They are ready to pull the plug and if they do so, there will be serious consequences for people in rural areas.  What is happening with Eir and others is that there are rich pickings for them at present but they are ready to pull the plug.  If they do pull the plug, the boys who live on up on the hills will have no broadband.  The Government will have to talk at that point and it will really know what a problem is.</p> <p> In 2018, just over &euro;21 million in funding was allocated under the town and village renewal scheme.  In my constituency, only Bantry and Dunmanway received funding.  They got &euro;189,000 in total, which represents only 0.8% of the overall amount available.   Does the Government understand what I am saying?  West Cork has been totally forgotten.  It is scandalous that an area of that size is only getting crumbs when it comes to funding under that scheme.</p> <p> We need to see development in rural Ireland on many fronts.  We have to come up with ideas to preserve rural areas not only for the people and businesses who live and operate there but also for the tourism sector.  I am blue in the face from asking this Government to deliver on the promises during the negotiations to form an Administration in 2016.  The rural resettlement scheme has been spoken about because the housing crisis is only getting worse.  There was never a better time to actively promote the concept of rural resettlement.  This scheme has been rolled out in County Clare.  Will the Minister indicate if it can be extended to west Cork?</p> <p> The bottom line is that we need investment in rural Ireland.  Such investment is not being made.  Young people are looking for planning permission to build houses and they are being rejected left, right and centre.  Those seeking planning permission for massive developments have no problem at all in obtaining it.  A young person is being told that he or she has no connection to an area despite the fact that he or she lives only four miles away.  He or she will be informed that where he or she currently lives has no connection at all to the townland to which the application relates.  It is a farce.</p> <p> As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae indicated, what the Government did in the context of Pat Spillane was take a real, honest-to-God voice out of rural Ireland.  This was not to save a pittance, rather it was to shut down the voice of the ordinary people.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ring, should be here to respond rather than the Minister of State, Deputy English.  The way the Government treated Pat Spillane was outrageous and scandalous beyond belief.  Mr. Spillane was a great ambassador for the people.  He was fair to the Government and to the ordinary people out there who are struggling.  He was a voice but that voice had to be and shut down.  If people listened to the Minister earlier, they would be aware that he wants to shut me down.  He will fail in that and he will fail to shut Pat Spillane down.  However, if he is allowed to continue what he is doing, he will succeed in shutting rural Ireland down.</p></speech>

Voters aired their opinions, aspirations and concerns on the assumption that we would assess and take stock of them on returning to the forums to which we were elected, be it local authorities or D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We will seek to influence policy in order to deliver to those who have made representations to us.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to being anxious to hear the views and observations of his colleagues.  I hope and expect that he will take seriously some of what has been stated here and that he will act upon it rather than mouthing the type of platitudes I have heard in recent times.  This is a relatively new Department.  We were promised that it would assist in rural-proofing other Departments in order to ensure that rural Ireland would be at the centre when it comes to the delivery of policies and initiatives by Government.  I am not sure that this is evident when I look at policy implementation in the various Departments.  I have picked a few to speak about and elaborate upon in the hope that the Government might see sense and address some of the deficiencies that are plainly obvious to many of us.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State also referred to the sense of community that exists and that we have inherited.  We hope that sense of community will continue to obtain.  It is undoubtedly challenged in today's environment as transport links and access to our cities improve and many of the major employers see fit to locate their operations in those cities.</p>  <p> The first matter up which I wish to touch is primary level education.  Primary schools are central to many local communities.  There are many small two, three or four-teacher schools in rural areas which are under immense pressure.  There are policies within the Department and from Government which refer to aspiring to adhere to the teacher-pupil ratio.  That is not evident in many rural schools.  As a result of the failure in this regard, many schools are challenged and under pressure.</p><p>The focus is always on the larger towns and urban centres where one sees a greater allegiance to that commitment.  I met it in Clonmacnoise during the course of my canvass trail in recent weeks.  I have been in touch with the Department about it but it is a broader issue that needs to be addressed.  There needs to be a commitment and policy needs to be adhered to and implemented, not merely referred to.  </p> <p> The other issue is health.  Statements are being taken later on primary care.  Our elderly have to be the focus of our efforts to ensure that they can remain their communities and homes as long as is possible.  The home help packages and hours are not sufficient.  We have been hearing about the GP contract in recent weeks and were told it had been lauded by members of the Government.  What is the situation in respect of the rural allowance?  Is it sufficient to ensure that out of hours services are provided by clusters of doctors together with the HSE?  I am conscious of one service in Birr that was closed down.  We were told that it was because the GP contract did not have adequate provisions within the rural allowance to ensure it could provide the service.  The bigger picture is that many doctors are not seeking employment in these towns.  We were told this GP contract was the answer but I have not seen any evidence from GPs or their communities to assure me that we will see the reinstatement of those services.  That is a failure on the part of the Department to ensure that policies and contracts are rural-proofed to address the deficiencies that exist.  I heard many Deputies talking about the disabled persons grant and housing adaptation grants to assist those who wish to remain in their homes but do not have the resources to do so because of physical disability or age deficiency.  The cost associated with subventing care in nursing homes is far greater than would be the case if there was a concerted effort to provide the sort of funding that would meet the demands that exist.  There was no concerted effort, despite the fact that a Department of Rural and Community Development is in place and we were assured it would rural-proof all these issues.  I do not see that and it is not evident.</p> <p> On housing, rural towns and villages of course are under immense pressure.  I hate talking them down but it is quite obvious to us all that the centres of these towns and villages are dilapidated and not populated and have lost retail trade.  What has this Government done to help?  There are town enhancement schemes and public realm improvements, which are welcome, but they are only part of the solution.  Welcome as they are, they are very protracted and slow to deliver, with elongated public consultation processes.  In this week in which the local elections have finished, I ask the Government to trust its councillors, give them their head and allow them to select these projects themselves.  They are at the coalface of their communities and want to improve their communities.  They should be allowed to proceed.  The process is not rural-proofed by the Department if it is allowed to take far too long.  It is all about the announcement, being shovel-ready and having the high-vis jacket.  It is never about the implementation.  That is the problem.</p> <p> Other initiatives to assist in the renovation and regeneration of town centre living have failed, as the Minister of State knows.  The schemes put in place have not been at all adequate.  That must be addressed.  We must allow property owners the opportunity to take advantage of such initiatives in order to encourage people back into towns.  On local authority housing delivery, a total of eight houses in eight years in my own county speaks for itself.  There is no rural-proofing of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, obviously.  I have long said that much of the expertise, commitment and professionalism that we have seen previously in local authorities is, unfortunately, not there any more.  There is a role for the likes of NAMA in taking on board State lands, employing builders, paying healthy profits, putting the houses in place and leasing them to local authorities for 100 years.  It can be done and should be done.  It is outside the box thinking, trying to regenerate activities that used to take place within local authorities where much expertise has now been lost.  Commitments on affordable housing were given by Government Deputies on foot of last year's budget but were not delivered.  Commitments were given on the quadrupling from &euro;2 million to &euro;8 million of local authorities' discretion to provide housing.  Again, there has been no progress on this issue.  We are expected to take this continuously.  We seek improvements and are told they are coming but do not get them.  The people cannot stand for that and we cannot stand for it.  These measures have to be brought forward a lot quicker.</p> <p> On infrastructure, roads and broadband are the issues that have to be addressed.  We have had good progress on the national primary networks in the last years, with projects delivered on budget and on time.  There now needs to be the same focus and attention on the delivery of regional, local and county roads.  The Government has to consider the issues pertaining to different regions.  In my constituency, 40% of the roads are built on peat foundation yet there is no further discretion for us in respect of maintenance of those roads.  We are starting behind the curve all the time.  There is no rural-proofing by the Minister of State's Department of the way in which those funds are delivered.</p> <p> We have spoken about broadband on numerous occasions in the last weeks.  It appears that there was an effort by the Government to rush this process in order to provide something for the local elections.  It has backfired.  I was speaking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday, who assured me he will have a contract, notwithstanding many of the issues pertaining to the procurement process and the excessive cost.  He says there will be safety valves and triple-lock systems in the contract to ensure that if National Broadband Ireland goes bust, the backers will still be liable and will step in if it goes belly-up.  I am not sure that is the case.  He said he would insist it be the case.  However, if he cannot insist and cannot provide a contract that does that, he will not tell us.  Preferred bidder status has been given now and that has a cost associated with it.  It is time the Government came clean with that.  It is something we need to know.  Great cost is associated with all this and with the national development plan, yet there is no commitment from the Government to tell us where the &euro;400 million is being taken from for the overrun in respect of the children's hospital, or where the &euro;400 million overrun in respect of broadband up to 2021 or the &euro;1.5 billion overrun between 2021 and 2027 are coming from.  We are told the money will come from future revenues.  That is fairy stuff.  It either comes from raising taxes, borrowing or current expenditure.  The Government should not treat the people like fools.  It got its answer last week and will get it again if it continues to do that.  It is not a Freddie Mercury job here.  It is not a kind of magic.  The Government has to come clean and lay it out on the table and on this floor.  Then we can get behind it and see if it can work.</p></speech>

We will take five minutes each.  The list of stuff I could talk about in respect of rural Ireland is probably endless.  In the limited time I have, I am going to focus on the rural towns and villages.  From my point of view, they are key to making sure that rural life can be maintained.  I also want to mention the offshore islands, which are vitally important.  I refer particularly to Donegal, Arranmore Island and Tory Island.  This is about maintaining the life of rural Ireland.  We have to make it possible for people to live and make a living on our offshore islands.  That is the only way we can keep them populated.  Donegal County Council tried in the 1970s to depopulate Tory Island and we saw where that got them.  It is the wrong way to go.  We should be making sure people can live and work on the islands and raise their families on them.  We have seen on Twitter that the community on Arranmore Island has secured funding from Eir for broadband on the island.  In a way, it is sad.</p><p>It was necessary to win a competition being run by a private company to secure broadband and then be part of the advertising used by that company.  That is what was necessary to secure a service that people in rural Ireland should have as of right.  It is a sad reflection on the D&aacute;il and the Government that this is the best hope people have of getting services.</p> <p> Towns and villages in County Donegal and across the country are vital.  The Government should be examining ways to open up these towns and villages.  The reason people seek planning permission to build on lands outside towns and villages is that they own the site and developing it can reduce the costs incurred.  If reasonable options were available, I believe people would avail of them rather than developing and building in the countryside.  There is a simple way to do that.  Dunkineely is a small village outside Killybegs where the post office recently closed.  Many people live in the countryside around that village but very few live in the heart of it.  The Government should address that issue but it will not do so because property and property rights are king.  The State, through compulsory purchase orders or some other method, should take ownership of the sites, houses and land in the heart of these villages and make them available to people from the community.  Such a policy would mean that people from parishes around Dunkineely could live in the village.  This would revitalise the shops and pubs, keep the post office open and allow people to live in their own community.  That approach would benefit every village in Donegal.</p> <p> Fewer than 20 people live on the main street of my home town of Killybegs.  The people who own properties in the centre of the town cannot avail of tax benefits.  The State, however, could step in, make these properties liveable and get people back living in the hearts of towns and villages.  While the population of Killybegs has declined in the past 20 years, the population of the surrounding hinterland has rocketed in the same period.  People cannot get sites or land in the towns and villages where they are from, which means they have to build outside the towns and villages if they want to live close to the communities in which they grew up and of which they want to be a part.</p> <p> The State does not do this because of the crazy notion that property is everything and must be protected at all costs.  The Government must do more to protect people and the countryside to ensure we have vibrant, living communities.  I have outlined the way to do that and protect the entire countryside.  Every Member who contributed named different towns suffering the same experience.  People are unable to derive any benefit from the Government's emphasis on the private sector and tax breaks.  The State should get involved by opening up these towns and villages and then we will see people returning to live in them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900045#XX00200"><p>I represent Dublin Central but I want to make a contribution on rural Ireland and the islands in particular.  I am fortunate to have visited and stayed on almost all of the islands, from Rathlin Island off the coast of Antrim to the islands off Donegal and along the coast of counties Mayo and Galway down to Cork.  I will base my contribution on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire in County Cork which is the island I know best.  I have been staying there for many years.  There is a danger that we can romanticise life on the islands and only see it on the sunny day.  There is no doubt about the physical beauty and special atmosphere of the islands.  The reality, however, is that life on the islands can be difficult.  I also have no doubt about the sense of community I have seen on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire over the years and the way islanders support each other and come together as communities in times when things go wrong and in times of stress and distress.</p>  <p>  Life on the islands is dependent on the weather, which makes it crucial that those who live on them keep together.  We see the principle of meitheal in action on the islands.  Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire has probably had more visits from Presidents than Ministers with responsibility for the islands.  I am exaggerating slightly but the islands rarely get a long visit.  I do not call coming in on the ferry at 2 p.m. and leaving again on the ferry at 6 p.m., or possibly having a special ferry to get the Minister out on time, getting a sense of the islands.  Reports are all very well but nothing beats an extensive visit to an island, staying there and getting the lived experience of the community.</p>  <p>  The islands have to be treated differently when policies and plans are being drawn up for rural island.  That is because they are different, principally for reasons of access.  All of us can make a decision to travel at a moment's notice.  That is not possible on an island where it is necessary to work around ferry times.  It can also be difficult to plan ahead because the weather might again intervene.  Islands are much more susceptible to changes in the weather than we are on the mainland.  Gale force winds, storms and rain will not prevent me going from A to B but it can affect islanders.  It can also be problematic to get services to the islands.  Policies and plans for rural Ireland, therefore, need a separate module on islands because of those differences.  </p>  <p>  I found it ironic when the Wild Atlantic Way was being introduced that there was no mention of the islands.  It is an excellent and brilliant initiative.  I know it was linking roads but there was no mention of the islands at that stage and these islands are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.  That issue was eventually addressed.</p>  <p>  Are we really serious about the development and viability of the islands?  We know what happened to the Blasket Islands and what could have happened to Tory Island.  Unless we are serious about doing something, the same thing will happen with the other islands.  That would be a shame because of their uniqueness.  They need people to be viable.  They need to keep the people they have and attract new people, especially families.  We know about the decline in population in rural Ireland but it is particularly affecting the islands.  </p>  <p>  Turning to employment, this is where supports are needed for island initiatives.  I will give an example.  There was an application from Cumann Iascair&iacute; Chl&eacute;ire for an aquaculture licence and foreshore licence.  It was accompanied by an extensive environmental impact survey, EIS, document.  It was sent to the Department last February and there has not yet even been an acknowledgement that the application has been received.  The development of jobs and businesses is severely restricted on the islands.  The information technology industry could be the saving grace for island communities to support sustainability and viability.  Approximately 5% of the population of Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire earn a living from online businesses, including translation, web design and language courses.  There is huge potential to expand with reliable high-speed broadband.  People could then live and work on the islands.  Rural broadband is not just needed for people who have second homes or a holiday home in rural Ireland.  If we can provide broadband to the islands, we can save a way of life and keep people living there.  It would also be possible to have access to online courses and health and medical care online.</p>  <p>  Moving to the arts, one initiative on Cape Clear involved storytelling.  A storytelling festival started by a couple on the island 30 years ago and held in the first week in September is now an international storytelling festival.  I ask that when the Arts Council is developing its plans and policies that it look at the islands in a different way.  There is also a great deal of potential for tourism because of the uniqueness of the islands and the totally different experience of life that it is possible.  The latest campaigns from F&aacute;ilte Ireland are The Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  Why can there not be a similar campaign for the islands?  I see that the Minister announced an allocation of &euro;150 million to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for visitor attractions.  Do the islands feature in some part of that strategy?</p>  <p>  Regarding Gaeltacht courses, the rules for mainland houses are one thing.  Reducing the numbers who can stay in houses on the islands is having a crippling effect.   No new houses are entering the scheme because the regulations mean it is not financially viable to do so.  This is another area where there is a need for flexibility for the islands.  The red tape involved is inhibiting.</p>  <p>  I will highlight one issue.  Planning permission will not be given to build a house on Cape Clear unless it is to be a permanent residence.  That is fine but there is nothing stopping an individual, as is happening, from buying two or three houses as an investment with no notion of living in them.  They are being left empty because this is a way to invest money.  This indicates that the right to private property has gone absolutely mad.  Why did the local authority not buy those houses and give them to people on the housing list?  If it is a Gaeltacht island, Irish speaking families should be given priority.</p>  <p>  During the appalling weather some months ago, the roads on Cape Clear were in an atrocious condition.  I never saw such potholes before.  The county council finally came to repair the roads two weeks ago.  It is better late than never but that is a situation that would not be acceptable on the mainland.</p>  <p>  I will conclude with some words from an islander.  She stated that it might not be the easiest place to live but she could not imagine any place better.  She continued by stating that the people who lived on the island did not believe that they were disadvantaged but they did recognise that they faced challenges unknown to those living on the mainland.  That is why I am requesting that when a development plan is being drawn up for rural Ireland a special module be included on islands because the islands are different.</p></speech>

One need only look at the spatial plan, getting rid of a word here and there that was put in to soften its message.  Fundamentally, that message is that successful cities are the future and rural development is given token consideration down the list because it was known that there would be an outcry in rural Ireland.  The whole lexicon of the current discussion refers to towns and villages as if the 1.5 million people who live in the countryside do not exist.  We are following a geography based on the lecture room not the reality of rural Ireland.  I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, here today.  Even if the Corofin football team in his constituency could depend for players on town of Corofin in Galway, it would still not win the junior B league.</p></speech>

It has nothing to do with religion and is defined in a territorial sense far beyond the little village of Corofin in Clare, which is extraordinarily small.  We must recognise therefore what rural Ireland is and that should be reflected in our planning policies.</p><p>I hear complaints perennially about ribbon development.  If one reads <i>The Irish Times</i>and so on, one sees that.  Most ribbon development, funnily enough, is caused by the huge expansion of the cities which people are forced to live in or near.  They do not want to live physically within the city and build endless houses in the adjacent countryside.  In other words, it is an urban generated problem, not a rural one.  If we move away from the areas influenced by the cities, the countryside could accommodate in visual terms, if we adopted our planning policies, the rural need for permanent housing.  Our planning system is flawed in particular in relation to one-off houses because as far back as the 1990s, there was an obsession with road frontage and linearity.  Thankfully, in some places people have managed to build in the folds of the hills and along the contours of the land in an unobtrusive way.  It is a way that is in keeping with the natural pattern in the countryside previously and that can sustain the population without destroying the countryside visually.  I am not in favour of the <i>status quo</i>in planning and of ribbon development.  I am not in favour of the pull to the centre which means there is overcrowding of houses within a ten-mile radius of every city just as the cities themselves are a total housing nightmare.  These are not rural problems, however.  They are generated by urban areas.</p><p>I believe in rural Ireland.  It is relatively easy to create jobs there.  I have some experience of doing so.  I live in a rural community that is in fact quite healthy in population and structural terms.  I have believed since the first day I got involved in development work as a co-operative manager in 1974 that the most important thing for rural development was basic infrastructure.  It is not a matter of a grant here or there.  It is amazing to think that in 1974 we were trying to get a copper telephone line.  What we urgently need for the 500,000 houses that do not have it now is fibre broadband.  I have made my views on this absolutely clear at the committee.  There is nothing in any known technology or that is likely to be there in the short to medium term to match fibre.  There is no contention and much greater security.  Listening to people talking about this, they do not seem to realise that Eir has already brought fibre to virtually every village in Ireland and a mile out the road in every direction.  To start back at base again to try to construct a parallel system would be ridiculous.  This is not rocket science.  It is very simple.  As the Minister of State knows, but what is important to record, is that Eir comes along and finds poles already in place because at one time 95% of houses had a landline phone.  All the poles are there outside all the houses.  Eir checks the poles to see if they are still up to standard and it replaces them if they are not.  If it did not do it now, it would have to do it at some point in future.  In fact, it is quite a good thing that this audit of all poles nationally is taking place.  It will mean storm damage will be greatly mitigated.  As the Minister of State knows, Eir hangs on the tops of these poles, alongside the copper, a little bit of fibre that is the weight of a feather.  If the line was ducted, they duct it as well.  It is as simple as that.  There is no need for new ducting and it is 100% on the existing system.  We need broadband and we need it now.  There must be no more shillyshallying.</p><p>We need decent roads built to a pre-determined standard of surface, camber, curvature and width.  Any upgrading of roads should be to these standards and the standards should vary according to whether it is a primary, national secondary or regional route or a tertiary road.  We must have a proper long-term roads programme.  We need water in every house.  If those basics are provided, the economy will grow.  We always talk about the IDA when we talk about jobs.  Let us park it for a minute and look at the quick wins.  The first win is decentralisation which is totally within our own control.  The second win is localisation of services and the jobs that go with them instead of constantly drawing all services, including health services, into the centre, which is very unfair to the people who need them.  I hope to speak more about primary care later tonight.</p><p>There are many things to talk about so I will move quickly to public transport.  On buses alone, never mind trains, expenditure <i>per capita</i>in rural Ireland is less than one third of that in urban Ireland.  That needs to be levelled.  We need frequent services along the main routes to our towns and cities where the employment is.  We must end the discrimination in fares.  We have a ridiculous situation whereby if one gets the train to Sallins the fare is half of the fare to get to the next station in Newbridge.  That situation is replicated nationally.  This is simply because one is considered an urban fare while the other is considered to be a rural fare.  We need equality of treatment in rural Ireland and cannot accept less.  It blows my mind that we have not provided frequent rapid rail services on the existing railway lines, open and closed, into the major cities of Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  I know the Minister of State is with me on that.  I acknowledge that a plan has been developed and published for Cork.  People wonder why no one takes the train from Nenagh to Limerick or from Clonmel to Waterford to get to work in the morning.  I ask those who live in Dublin how many of their neighbours would take the DART if the first services to Connolly, Pearse and Grand Canal stations arrived at 10 a.m. and there was only one train in the evening which meant that, if one missed it to go for a pint with friends, one would have to walk home.</p><p>We have created a situation that we then use as an excuse for not providing a service because we say it has no patronage.</p> <p> On jobs, I also wish to say we have huge natural resources, we have tourism and we have home working, which will become one of the boom industries where many people will work where they choose and choose where they go to live.</p> <p> With the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who might give me another 35 seconds, can I say that climate change is normally cited as a reason for not allowing people to settle in rural Ireland.  If that was followed to an extreme we would close down our international tourism industry because people would have to get either a boat or a train and we encourage people to go to the most far parts of our country.  However, the reality is that with the electrification of vehicles, because rural people can generate much more electricity in their homes through solar or wind power, they could become much more carbon neutral and even become carbon contributors in the future, which is not something most urban people will ever be able to say.</p></speech>

There might be some differences of opinions expressed from the various sides of the Chamber but it is clear we all agree that we want the best for rural Ireland and for our local communities.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Ring, I have had the opportunity to witness first hand the vision, commitment and energy which is present in communities across the country, whether they are rural or urban areas.  These communities can do great things when they are given the right opportunities and that is why our Department is trying, through our many programmes, to provide maximum opportunity to communities to deliver their ideas and to realise the potential of their local areas.</p>  <p>  Even since we had the first part of this debate on 10 April, there have been significant developments on issues which were raised by Deputies in the House.  On 7 May, the Government announced its intention to award the contract to a preferred bidder for the roll-out of high speed broadband in areas not covered on a commercial basis.  This project will have a transformative effect on rural Ireland and will facilitate a structural shift in how people live and work in rural areas.  Improved broadband connectivity will help to support job creation and will help to revitalise and re-establish rural Ireland as an attractive place in which to live and work.</p>  <p>  We have also had an announcement of &euro;50 million for a beef support scheme from Europe, which is to be matched by &euro;50 million from Ireland.  This is something else that was discussed and this is important to rural Ireland.  Some Deputies spoke about how the process of applying for schemes can be often daunting for volunteers and small community organisations, and I agree with that.  To help less experienced groups, the Department has been running a series of events around the country called 'helping hands' to make groups more aware of our programmes and to provide guidance on how to make applications.  There are numerous groups and community organisations which are out there but that may not have considered seeking funding and may not have the resources or experience to submit applications.  I hope our initiative will see any barriers that may exist being reduced and ensure that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports.</p>  <p>  The action plan for rural development runs until the end of 2019 and the Department has already begun consultation on a successor to the plan from 2020 onwards.  A series of stakeholder workshops has been taking place around the country in recent weeks.  These workshops included an event day on Inishmore on the Aran Islands.  I know the importance of considering the islands was raised by Deputies Connolly and Maureen O'Sullivan in the course of the debate.  The next phase of rural policy needs to be forward thinking and needs to build resilience in rural communities and rural economies to deal with issues such as Brexit and the adoption of climate change measures.  The policy should also enable communities to grasp the huge potential that exists in rural Ireland, about which many Deputies have spoken.  The contributions which have been made in this House have been noted by my officials and will be considered in the development of this policy.</p>  <p>  On other priorities for the Department for the rest of this year, an implementation plan for the framework policy for local and community development is at an advanced stage of development.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Ring, recently announced an independent review of the community services programme.  This review will seek to ensure the programme continues to provide the best possible support for individuals, communities and organisations across the country.  Following a public call for inputs in December 2018, my Department is working on the national volunteer strategy.  Just today, I have chaired the first meeting of the new national advisory group on volunteering, which will assist in developing the volunteer strategy.  Our Department is also finalising Ireland's first national, social enterprise policy, following a public consultation process which closed recently.</p>  <p>  The debate on rural and community development has been useful and I wish to thank the Members for their contributions.  I, a rural Deputy, along with the Minister, Deputy Ring, will reflect on the many views which have been shared during this debate.  I am proud to be involved in such an important Department.  In the short period since its establishment, the funding supports and programmes delivered have helped communities to become better places in which to live and work.  I am confident our plans and programmes will continue to support rural and economic development and the local and community development sectors and that they will provide valuable services and supports to both urban and rural communities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900047#ZZ00700"><p>I am pleased to be here this evening to update the House on a range of important developments in the area of primary care.  As many Deputies will be aware, the reality is that our primary and community care system, as currently configured, is ill-equipped to play the role we all know it should play, and must play, if we are to respond to the healthcare challenges of the 21st century.</p>  <p>  Our population is not only growing but is becoming older, and we face a growing prevalence of chronic disease.  Our current hospital-centric model of care, which has its roots in responding to accidents and episodic diseases, simply cannot respond efficiently and effectively to meet the health needs of our population.</p>  <p>  It is for this reason the expansion of community and primary care is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, and it is important to recognise the progress that has been made in delivering on that vision.  The provision of modern, well equipped and accessible infrastructure is essential if we are change our model of care which is why we have prioritised investment in primary care centres.  There are now 127 operational primary care centres across the country, up from just 70 at the end of 2012, which represents an increase of some 80% over a six year period.  A further three centres are currently being equipped and will open shortly, while another 16 are under construction.  Just as importantly, there is a pipeline of more than 60 projects at the advanced or early planning stages.  Furthermore, at the beginning of May, the HSE placed an advertisement in the national press seeking expressions of interest from developers with a view to progressing a further 47 centres.</p>  <p>  As well as enabling the delivery of services in high quality modern facilities, primary care centres support the delivery of integrated care by facilitating closer co-ordination and co-operation between health professionals from across different disciplines.  They also provide a single point of access to services for the individual and can serve as a resource more broadly for the community, creating a focal point for local health initiatives or providing community groups with a place to meet.  The delivery of additional primary care centres in the years ahead will support other initiatives as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan to ensure more healthcare services will be available in our communities.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the delivery of primary care infrastructure, there has been a continuing programme of investment in the sector to build capacity.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for this year allocates &euro;897.2 million to primary care.  This headline figure reflects several important funding initiatives that have been introduced since 2016, including the following: ring-fenced funding of &euro;4 million to facilitate the recruitment of 83 posts in speech and language services; dedicated funding of &euro;5 million to recruit 114 assistant psychologists and 20 staff grade psychologists to provide early intervention mental health services for those aged under 18; and provision of a &euro;25 million primary care development fund to enable a range of initiatives to be progressed.</p><p> Primary care was prioritised in this year's budget, with an additional &euro;50 million provided to boost capacity in the sector, which is an increase of 6.1% on 2018.  This will allow the recruitment of additional therapy staff and nurses, alongside further service development.  As well as supporting therapy services, the investment has allowed us to develop such services as paediatric home care packages to allow children with complex needs to be cared for at home while enabling the expansion of community intervention teams, CITs, which prevent unnecessary hospital admission or attendance.  CITs are a prime example of how an expanded primary care setting can help ease the pressure on acute hospitals, with an estimated 11,307 bed days saved in the first four months of this year alone.  We are also working to develop our diagnostic services in the community.  This will be an important achievement if we get it right.  In 2019, 67,000 ultrasound tests and 79,500 X-rays will be delivered via direct GP access to radiology services.</p> <p> This investment in primary care infrastructure and services in recent years provides a solid foundation for developing a much more comprehensive community and primary care system.  We intend to build on this foundation with the development of community healthcare networks.  Under the network model, one identifiable and accountable network manager will be responsible for the delivery of primary care services to a local population of approximately 50,000 people.  Primary care will be positioned at the heart of service delivery and emphasis will be placed on ensuring effective integration of other specialised services such as social care, mental health and access to hospital.  The network model will be central to the development of improved primary and community services.  Implementation will begin this year with the establishment of nine learning sites.</p> <p> April was a significant month in clearly signalling that we are serious about radically changing how the health system works.  The month saw three important achievements, namely, securing agreement on GP contractual reform, publishing the national oral health policy and introducing a series of measures to enable more people to access affordable healthcare.  The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services was always going to be a significant element in facilitating a move to primary-care-centred health services.  The agreement reached with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has the potential to be a landmark moment for health reform and I was delighted to see it win the support of 95% of members of the IMO in a recent ballot.  For the first time, we will see the delivery in a primary care setting of structured care on a large scale for patients with chronic conditions.  More than 400,000 medical card and GP visit card patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease will benefit from new and improved chronic disease management.  In addition, the agreement paves the way for a wide-ranging set of modernisation measures in the areas of e-health, medicines management and multidisciplinary working.</p> <p> For its part, the Government has committed to increasing investment in general practice by &euro;210 million, or approximately 40%, over the next four years.  This will mean significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme, as well as the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services.  There will also be increased support for rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas.  For the first time, there will be a ring-fenced fund for general practice in urban areas, an important development that arises directly from the work of the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  In short, the agreement will allow GPs to care for their patients both in the way they want to and in the way we need them to.  It will help to stabilise general practice after some difficult years.</p> <p> Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the new national oral health policy, was also published in April.  It provides a framework for the dental service to evolve from a diagnose-and-treat model to a locally available, person-centred, proactive and preventative approach.  Under the policy, all children up to 16 years of age will receive eight oral healthcare packages, including examinations, assessments, advice, prevention interventions, emergency care and referrals as appropriate.  Oral healthcare packages will also be provided for medical card holders over 16 years of age.  The packages will be provided in a primary care setting by oral healthcare practitioners contracted by the HSE.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte provides the groundwork to transform oral health services.  It embraces the same ideals as Sl&aacute;intecare, with the needs of people at the core and the provision of services in the local community paramount.</p> <p> The third development delivered in April was the introduction of a series of measures to enable more people to access affordable healthcare, which is also generally in line with the recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare.  First announced as part of budget 2019, the measures included a 10% increase in all GP visit card weekly income thresholds, the benefit of which we have seen through the several thousand additional people accessing free GP care as a result.  There were also reductions in the monthly drugs payment scheme threshold and a reduction in prescription charges for all medical card holders over the age of 70, making it cheaper for people to make a trip to their pharmacy, whether they are on the drugs payment scheme or paying prescription charges.  With a focus on ensuring and supporting care in the community, the measures extend free healthcare to more people and reduce the cost for others.  The Government is committed to widening access to primary health services, which is reflected by our intention to engage with the IMO on the proposal to extend GP care without fees to children aged between six and 12 on a phased basis, something for which I look forward to legislating this year.  I also look forward to sitting down with pharmacists' representative organisation, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, this year to negotiate a new pharmacist contract.  I addressed the IPU conference in Galway in recent weeks.  Deputy Brassil raises this issue with me often.  We will sit down with pharmacists to examine how they can play a greater role in the provision of healthcare, as is their wish, and how the Government can invest in the pharmacy network.</p> <p> It is clear that we are investing in and developing primary and community care.  There has been momentum in that regard this year, as I have outlined.  The momentum needs to gather pace, however, as it will do in the months and years ahead.  We all know there are many grand plans now sitting on shelves and gathering dust but this time will be different, not least because of the unified focus of the House on realising Sl&aacute;intecare and the structures we are putting in place to deliver it, such as the appointment of Laura Magahy as the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare office and the publication of a Sl&aacute;intecare action plan in March.  The action plan sets out milestones against which we will report progress every quarter using the same model as we did in the case of the Action Plan for Jobs, showing exactly where delivery is achieved.</p> <p> The developments I have highlighted are only the beginning and much more needs to be done.  Crucially, we must expand the workforce and infrastructure capacity in the primary and community sector, develop structures that allow for the planning and operation of services on the basis of population need and size and create an enabling environment through e-health and other initiatives.  Nonetheless, I am confident that we are, at last perhaps, moving in the right direction and that we have begun the process of delivering a universal health service that offers people the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900048#AAA00200"><p>As my party's spokesperson on primary care, I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead the debate.  The message from Fianna F&aacute;il is clear: robust and active primary and community care plays an essential role in enhancing health outcomes and limiting costs.  A strong primary and community care system will be invaluable for preventing the development of conditions that could ultimately require acute hospital care.  It will also provide a suitable environment to enable earlier discharges from hospital.  From the patient's perspective, it helps to enhance quality of life and reduce the undue stress of admission to hospital.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Government's record on primary care leaves much to be desired.  While more primary care centres have opened, there have often been significant delays between their announcement and delivery.  In the HSE service plan for 2019, there seem to be no new measures for primary care, while on a like-for-like basis, as a share of the HSE budget, primary care has fallen from 6.9% to 6.6%.  The Minister correctly pointed out that the essential pillar of Sl&aacute;intecare is the improvement of primary care services.  It is a simple concept.  If as many people as possible in the community can be treated, they will naturally be prevented from entering an already clogged hospital system.  To do that, there must be investment in capital costs to provide primary care centres.  While I accept that progress has been made in this regard, much more is needed and many more structures on the ground need to be delivered.  Without centres, the service cannot be delivered.  Primary care centres also require staff, in the form of GPs, practice nurses, community nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, community dentists, podiatrists and so on.  The full medical team needs to be present in the community to provide the required services.</p>  <p>  The Minister rightly referred to e-health and e-prescribing.  As he knows, I am a practising pharmacist and have an interest in the area but, as I informed him at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health last week, pharmacists are underused.  In countries such as Canada, pharmacists provide a much greater role and are an invaluable addition to primary care services.  As well as the unwinding of measures under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts relating to GPs, which I welcome, I look forward to the same happening for pharmacists and to the Minister engaging with the pharmacy sector to allow it to deliver its full potential on issues such as the minor ailment scheme and the provision of contraception.</p><p>I look forward to a new contract and pharmacists playing a much more progressive role.</p> <p> The staffing of GPs is one issue we must meet head on.  At present, there is a shortfall of 500 general practitioners and under current projections, we will have a shortfall of 1,500 by 2025.  At present, we train 174 GPs per annum.  This figure needs to double and I recommend training up to 300 GPs per annum to meet future requirements.  If we can do this, we will be able to attract and retain new staff and perhaps get back many of those who have emigrated to Australia, Canada and the like.</p> <p> Another issue I ask the Minister to consider is salaried GPs and salaried employees for the health system.  There are rural and urban areas where practices cannot exist viably.  In such circumstances, we must look at the salaried employee model.  It is should be rolled out because it can work.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned e-health and this is critical, as is e-prescribing.  As a pharmacist, I do not know how many times over the years I received phone calls from hospitals looking for patients' medical records and drug records.  Pharmacists in the country receive such calls on a daily basis.  This is a total waste of thousands of man hours every week.  We need integrated patient records to be available at GP practices, pharmacies and hospitals.</p> <p> Universal access to diagnostics in the community is very important.  If we roll out centres and have availability of diagnostics, all our chronic disease management can be done in the community, including the management of arthritis, asthma, COPD, Crohn's disease and Alzheimer's disease.  We are more than capable of dealing with these conditions in the community.  To do this, we must put the services in place.  I will refer specifically to the care of the elderly because the increased prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease is something we have to come to grips with.  Many people would be more than happy to keep their loved ones in their homes if they were provided with a backup service.  As I have said to the Minister and to Mr. Paul Reid and Ms Laura Magahy at committee meetings, putting the fair deal budget and the home care budget into one package would make huge financial sense.  At present, the incentive is to refer anybody going to the community nurse looking for home care hours for a fair deal package instead because the money is not available in the home care budget.</p> <p> In the course of canvassing two weeks ago, I came across a couple aged in their mid-90s.  The woman of the house has Alzheimer's disease and she is being cared for by her 93 year old husband who has multiple medical conditions.  They are getting the sum total of one and a half hours of home care per day, five days a week and nothing at the weekend.  This is just not acceptable.  Despite pleading as much as I could with the community nurse, she told me she does not have the money or the hours to give but that if I got an increased allocation, she would help the couple more.  This issue has to be addressed as otherwise the ageing population will cause demand on our hospital system to go through the roof.</p> <p> Another area of equal importance is mental health care in the community.  GPs tell us they will be able to cater for 90% of mental health issues if they were given the resources in the community.  This area of growing need has clogged up our hospital facilities.  We need to expand primary care to deal with mental health issues.  If we do so, we will go a long way towards resolving what is now an ongoing crisis.</p> <p> I will work with the Minister or anybody else to try to resolve the current healthcare crisis.  The key to doing so is in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Minister has full buy-in from all of the political parties.  Deputy O'Reilly was a member of the relevant committee, as were Deputy Harty and I.  We have an opportunity, perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity, to improve the healthcare of our country and give our citizens the health system they deserve.  I look forward to working with the Minister to bring it about but I will hold him to account if it does not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900049#BBB00200"><p>The health service is our most important public service.  It is there for us when we are born, throughout our lives and at the end.  The health of our nation is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s number one priority.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a very simple vision and commitment that healthcare should be free at the point of delivery and available to those who need it based on their clinical and medical needs and not on their ability to pay.  Unfortunately, time and again we see that those who have a few extra bob in their back pocket can skip the queue.  Children in my constituency will wait 30 months to access a diagnosis.  We often say that diagnosis is the key to getting into the system but if people have to wait on that diagnosis and wait three years for what is called early intervention, they find it very hard to see neighbours who might be in a better financial position skipping the queue.  For this reason, Sinn F&eacute;in believes healthcare should be available based on need and never on ability to pay.</p>  <p>  Key to this delivery is the development of primary care services and the delivery of GP and community-led care.  General practitioners and those who work with them are the cornerstone of our primary care services.  We must ensure that we have a supply of GPs for the whole of the State.  Primary care is very much the absolute front of the front line.  It should be the coalface for dealing with the bulk of the health needs of the population.  We know it is cheaper than acute care and can deliver better quality preventative care faster and closer to home.  People end up in hospital when primary care has failed, they have been unable to access primary care or the State has failed to provide accessible primary care for them.  This means not only that we must train more GPs but also that we must make the profession more accessible and attractive through lifting the burden of uncertainty created by self-employment and creating directly employed GPs.  I have been calling for this since long before I came into the House.  We need a mix of self-employed and directly employed GPs.  This would allow doctors to be doctors and not have to worry about renting a building, paying the electricity bill, employing a practice nurse and a secretary and all that goes with running a small business.  It would mean directly employed GPs with a yearly HSE salary and all of the rights that accompany direct employment, such as maternity, paternity and annual leave and a pension.  I believe this would make the profession significantly more attractive.</p>  <p>  We also need to ensure that primary care centres are properly staffed and have a full complement of staff.  The Minister has heard me say this before, but in case he was not listening on the million other occasions although I know he does listen, I will raise the issue of Balbriggan primary care centre, a lovely primary care centre in my constituency, just up the road from my house.</p><p>No additional staff were provided for this centre.  I have raised this issue many times and on each occasion the response was that services will be provided from within existing resources, which is code for there will be no additional staff.  Despite the rapidly growing population in Balbriggan, there is no diagnostic equipment in Balbriggan primary care centre.  When I raised this issue recently via a parliamentary question the response was that there are no plans to provide additional diagnostic equipment.  We have not  yet had sight of the capital plan as we approach the end of May.  I sincerely hope that not much more time will pass before we see it and that when we do, there will be something in it for people in Balbriggan.  As recently as last week, as per the response to my parliamentary question, there were no plans to install diagnostic equipment or provide additional staff.  I understand that this is a local issue but this situation is replicated in many primary care centres, making it a national issue.</p> <p> Another response to a parliamentary question indicated that one in five primary care centres around the country has failed to attract a general practitioner.  The Minister has pledged to deliver primary care.  The Minister is not a doctor and nor am I but there is a doctor in the Chamber.  Primary care is not possible without general practitioners.  It is startling that approximately 26 of the 126 operational primary care centres, which are supposed to be a one-stop-shop for people's basic health needs outside of hospital, do not have a general practitioner.  Without general practitioners these centres cannot deliver care.  The lack of staff to deliver primary care calls into question the Government's commitment to primary care.</p> <p> The newly built primary care centres have each cost millions of euro but they are not being properly utilised.  For example, Boyle primary care centre in Roscommon cost approximately &euro;6 million to build.  It opened last August and it still has no general practitioner.  These centres are supposed to be staffed by a general practitioner and other health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and counsellors.  According to the figures provided to me, 15 primary care centres were without psychologists and 19 did not have a single social worker.  This seriously undermines the Government's claim that it is committed to Sl&aacute;intecare.  We all know that we need to shift to primary and community care.  That argument has been won.  There were many battles in that regard years ago but, as I said, that argument has been won.  Sl&aacute;intecare has gone a long way towards ensuring that argument was won.  The move to primary care is essential.  It will take the pressure off acute services but we will never deliver free GP care without general practitioners and the facilities from which they can operate.</p> <p> The Minister told us he would introduce a new contract for GPs.  I understand there is a commitment to unwind FEMPI, which, I know, is extremely important, but where stands the delivery of a new contract?  A revision of the existing contract will not suffice.  We need a detailed contract which is fit for the 21st century.  As I said previously, the issue of salaried GPs needs to be examined.  Directly employed GPs means doctors can be doctors.  We need to examine how the dual model might work.  The self-employed model has worked well in some but not all circumstances so we need to examine how the dual model might work.  There is definitely a space for it. </p> <p> Any party that is serious about delivering healthcare to communities and the people who need it must be serious about primary care.  As I have said, that argument has been won.  We no longer hear people arguing about the need to increase staff numbers in acute care, which is already overstretched as the Minister will know.  The argument has been won in regard to primary care.  What is lacking is the vital investment to ensure our primary care centres are one-stop-shops.  I refer again to the primary care centre in Balbriggan.  While it is not the most beautiful building, the inside is lovely and practically laid out but it lacks staff.  The population of Balbriggan is growing and there are no plans for additional staff or diagnostic equipment at this centre.  People who live in Balbriggan still have to travel to the Mater Hospital in the city centre for a diagnostic test.  This makes no sense.  This service could and should be accessible in Balbriggan or north County Dublin.  The test in terms of the Government's commitment to the delivery of primary care will be its capacity to deliver fully staffed, equipped and functioning primary care centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900050#CCC00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, although I wish that rather than statements on primary care, we were getting an update from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on the 2001 report, Primary Care - A New Direction, and what parts of it have and have not been rolled out.  Primary Care - A New Direction was produced 18 years ago.  We were told at that point that primary care is the appropriate setting to meet between 90% and 95% of all health and personal social services need; that primary care needs to become the central focus of the health system; that primary care has to be rolled out; and that we need an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team based approach and so on.  As Governments of various persuasions are inclined to produce a report and not follow it up, we were told a national primary care task force would be established.  Does the Minister recall A Vision for Change and the implementation body?  It did such a good job over two to three years the Government dismantled it.</p>  <p>  In regard to primary care, a task force was to be established.  There were to be 20 actions, including a community based diagnostic centre pilot and an implementation plan.  An implementation plan for primary care is outlined in the 2001 document.  The Minister might consider reading it.  On physical infrastructure, it states that modern, well equipped, accessible premises will be central to the effective functioning of the primary care team, a national primary care task force will be established and evaluation is absolutely essential to implementation.  That is plan number one.  There are many other plans, including one from the Adelaide Health Foundation.  There are many recommendations in it tangential to the 2001 report.  It refers to the need to future-proof the health system, to borrow ideas from abroad and, interestingly, to promote parity between physical and mental health in practice, not just in rhetoric, to recognise and plan for the co-existence of physical and mental health morbidity in patients and to provide services that are in a position to respond to this type of complexity.</p>  <p>  Then came the Sl&aacute;intecare document, which was brought about by the range of voices in the new D&aacute;il calling on the Government to do something about our health services.  Ireland distinguishes itself among its European colleagues by not providing universal equitable access to either primary or acute hospital care.  The Minister opened this debate with a statement, which I will try to balance that with what is happening in Galway city and county.  There is a health centre in Connemara.  I will spare the doctors' blushes but I will refer to a sign therein which states that private patients must pay &euro;20 for blood tests and medical cardholders must pay &euro;10 for blood tests.  This sign features in various doctors' surgeries throughout Connemara.  The health service response is that it is provided in the contract that blood tests should be provided free of charge.</p><p>There was obviously a disagreement but that is the result for people on the ground.</p> <p> I recently asked a question about social workers in Connemara, the waiting list and the number of vacancies.  In the response I eventually got, I was told that there was no waiting list for social workers in Connemara because there were no social workers in Connemara.  I appreciate the sense of irony and honesty of the man who responded to me, in that there is no waiting list because there are no social workers in Connemara.  There are no physiotherapy services in south Connemara so potentially vulnerable people of all ages are brought from Connemara to Galway.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh seirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, ach n&iacute;l s&eacute; le f&aacute;il san &aacute;it ina bhfuil siad ag dul.  T&aacute; orthu teacht tr&iacute;d an tranglam tr&aacute;chta i l&aacute;r na cathrach chun seirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla a fh&aacute;il i gCaisle&aacute;n Nua, agus ansin t&aacute; orthu filleadh ar Chonamara.  They have to come in from Connemara to get physiotherapy in places where services are provided in English, not in Irish, adding to the traffic congestion and all sorts of problems.  I sometimes cannot put words to what I feel when I hear speeches in the House about primary care, mental health and new ways of doing things when all of these problems were foreseen and solutions were given.  We went forward to build primary care centres.  In Galway, in Doughiska, we are paying over &euro;250,000 in taxpayers' money on rent for a private building every year.  On the west side of the city of Galway, we have no primary care building.</p> <p> In the bad 1980s, I had the privilege of working in what was then called community care, in a multidisciplinary team, where somebody could walk in and see a psychologist, speech therapist or social worker.  We thought things were improving.  We now have all these beautiful reports and all this lovely language but things have actually gone backwards.  In addition, we are paying high rent for buildings that should be publicly owned.  If we were seriously interested in primary care and taking the pressure off acute hospitals, we would roll out public buildings throughout the country where we would locate essential services and take account of the regional balance.  We would certainly take account of the needs of those living in the Gaeltacht agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar uathu.</p> <p> The Department of Health's report, Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015, stated that primary care teams must form part of the dedicated facilities and no one must pay GP fees.  GPs must work with other primary care professionals.  Staffing and resourcing of primary care must be allocated rationally, and there is a great absence of rationality, to meet regularly assessed needs.  Structurally, primary care in Ireland remains highly fragmented.  It involves a mixture of public and private patients, which is not an efficient or equitable way of arranging healthcare.  Despite this, we are subjected to this speech all over again.  I have said a number of times that whoever writes these speeches should perhaps read the reports first and look at the recommendations.  One can look at any period one likes, which is 18 years in this case, and work from the original report.</p> <p> I will finish with a review of primary care island services.  I know it is difficult and that the Minister is busy.  We are all busy.  I find it increasingly difficult to keep up with all the reports but we have a duty to read them.  There is certainly a duty on whomever writes the speeches to read them.  A review was carried out on all our islands in April 2017, including the Irish-speaking islands.  It was a very good report but it was not published until earlier this year with no explanation given for the delay.  It tells us, among many things, of the essential need for primary care services on the islands where we do not have hospitals.  It then looks at Galway, Inishbofin and &Aacute;rann, where we have health centres that are not fit for purpose.  These are simple practical matters.  There are health centres which are not fit for purpose on the islands of Inishbofin and &Aacute;rann.  N&iacute;l siad cu&iacute;.  There are many other recommendations in the report relating to the Irish language and so on which I will not go into.  I accept the Minister's bona fides on many subjects he has spoken on in the D&aacute;il but at the end of the day, the proof of that lies in what was on the ground in these reports and was not on the ground.  He should tell us what has happened and why we cannot roll out public buildings for primary care if we are seriously interested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900051#DDD00200"><p>I am happy to speak on this important matter this evening.  Some 12 months ago, we in the Rural Independent Group tabled a motion on healthcare, in which we said that there was a failure of Government to fully implement A Vision for Change.  Indeed, A Vision for Change has been very unkind to us in Tipperary with regard to mental health services.  I remember when it was introduced by the then Minister of State, former Teachta Moloney.  We know that A Vision for Change is well out of date.  It has lived up to very few of the expectations and promises made in it.  A Vision for Change included building capacity in child and mental health services, CAMHS, provision of counselling and psychological services in primary care, and fully populating community psychiatric teams.  We asked Government to ensure a coherent implementation plan which would be immediately acted on to address the increasing lack of capacity and unmet need in our health services, especially at primary care and local level.  We cannot deal with that on the ground.  We have the result in Tipperary.  The hospitals that serve us, South Tipperary General Hospital and Limerick University Hospital, are jammed daily.  The numbers attending are shocking and increasing by the month.</p>  <p>  There needs to be consistent work towards expanding the availability of diagnostic services to seven-day access, to speed up patient diagnosis and indeed treatment in a timely manner at primary care level.  I thank the Minister for joining me two years ago to visit two wonderful healthcare facilities in Clonmel, Mary Street Medical Centre and Western House Medical Centre.  The first one is a wonderful service.  I have to declare an interest in this, since it is my family's medical centre.  It had fabulous diagnostic equipment which the Minister saw.  It dealt with all the ups and downs and ins and outs of the HSE to try to offer a diagnostic service.  Several months after the Minister's visit and intervention, which I acknowledge, it got a contract one Friday evening and it was delighted to get a two-week service.  There were substantial waiting lists in South Tipperary General Hospital and the centre was offering this service.  It got the contract that Friday to start on Monday morning.  There was no time to roll it out to all the GPs in south Tipperary.  It did it and there was good take-up, which relieved the pressure on the hospital.  After eight days, as I discussed both in the Chamber and privately with the Minister, the service was withdrawn.  After two and a half years and high level meetings, including with the Minister, it was removed after eight days because there was no money to fund it.</p>  <p>  It was a no-brainer because it was relieving the queues for ultrasound in South Tipperary General Hospital and people were being seen almost immediately.  There was connectivity with University Hospital Limerick to read X-rays and such.  Much work went into this but the service fell before it got to the second fence.  That is a shame.  It has the equipment and there are several doctors there whom the Minister met.  Between the complement of doctors, they have hundreds of years of experience.</p><p>A person has to wait several months to get into South Tipperary General Hospital, meet a locum or junior doctor who is falling asleep with fatigue and they have others to call on to deal with it.  The entire situation is akin to putting the cart before the horse.  It is frightening.  Progress with the development of primary care has been appalling.  That is not a new problem.  In 2017 the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, described primary care budget provision as deeply disappointing and regressive from a health perspective.  They are not my words, I am quoting the IMO in 2017.</p></speech>

That is a staggering statement by the IMO.</p>  <p>  The same is true two years later in 2019.  Everyone knows the primary care budget will not keep pace with the health demands and the various crises affecting the health services.  The new CEO seems to have been brought in because he is a whizz kid at keeping within budget.  That seems to be his main credentials for the job, and his career to date, although I accept he has other qualities also.  This will not be good.  It will not be fair.  It is not decent.  I accept that it is primarily a management issue but it is something we need to tackle once and for all.  We must work to change this or else GP services will continue to be even more overwhelmed and will only be able to deliver the most acute of services due to the lack of resources and unsustainable costs.</p>  <p>  An additional problem has also emerged due to the lack of focus on primary care delivery, namely, that doctors have continued to emigrate in droves rather than work in a service which is increasingly not fit for purpose.  I know a doctor, Paddy Davern, from Tipperary Town.  He is an exceptional doctor who is known far and wide and he went to Dubai two years ago.  He told a public meeting in Horse and Jockey that he had to leave and he reduced people to tears.  He is sorely missed in Tipperary Town and surrounding areas.  That is happening in every county.  When will the Minister deal with it?  There is a serious lack of ambition.</p>  <p>  Two years ago the Minister spoke about the much heralded transformation of the delivery of the health service and the move to GP-led primary care.  Dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin.  Has that happened?  No, it has not.  Does the Minister ever replay the clips of speeches?  I do not blame him personally for everything but he is the man in charge.  Does he ever look back and say he spoke those words with good intent, honesty and passion but it has not happened?  The failures are heaped on failures that are heaped on failures, not only by the Minister but by successive Ministers and Governments.  That is so disappointing given that primary care is one of the measures that has been shown to be successful in addressing the problems of chronic overcrowding and long delays in accident and emergency departments.  That is shown to be the case in particular where ultrasound diagnostics have been introduced in local primary care centres.  I am aware that it was implemented in CHO 5, where GPs could directly refer adult medical card and GP visit card holders for X-ray and ultrasound to a number of identified providers.  That was supposedly a short-term emergency measure designed to relieve pressure on hospitals in the immediate post-Christmas period.  We need such measures to be rolled out on a more consistent and long-term basis.  The Mary Street Medical Centre in Clonmel is an excellent example of a primary care centre that has been attempting to implement the use of ultrasound in diagnostics in order to help patients receive quicker treatment.  The Minister visited the centre.</p>  <p>  In February 2017 it was awarded a contract by the HSE to carry out such diagnostics.  Astonishingly, the contract was only for the duration of 14 days and was subsequently withdrawn after just seven days.  That was after all the effort, work and high level meetings, in addition to the associated cost and the passionate and desperate efforts of the Mary Street Medical Centre to provide the service.  It had the equipment and expertise but the contract was ended.  That is incomprehensible.  That is despite the fact that it carried out 35 scans in seven days, making earlier diagnosis possible, thereby benefitting patients and preventing referrals to a chronically overcrowded accident and emergency department in South Tipperary General Hospital.  Patients and doctors alike praised the service yet the HSE refused to extend the contract.  What is wrong?  How can there be such a blockage and chronic administration issue that a tried and tested service was halted seven days after its introduction?</p>  <p>  One patient who was helped by the ultrasound service was a lady who was diagnosed with a tumour in her womb.  Thankfully, she has since had surgery to treat it.  She might no longer be with us if the tumour was not diagnosed.  That is simply bizarre and unbelievable.  If she had experienced a 12-month delay waiting for an ultrasound in the public system her outcome would undoubtedly be far worse.  She is a GMS patient and would otherwise have had to pay for her scan.  The case clearly demonstrates the benefits primary care can deliver, not just for patients and their families but also for the entire health service where the bottleneck situation in accident and emergency departments can be reduced.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister, who is probably in the dying months if not weeks of the Government, to please make his mark and provide services in the Mary Street Medical Centre in Clonmel in Tipperary, which has the capacity, willingness and foresight to deliver a service which benefits everyone, gets rid of the queues and saves people's lives.  Could he please cut out the dead wood in the HSE and allow this badly-needed service to continue and to deliver for sick patients who are waiting with anxiety.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Government's policy, which seeks to provide robust and active primary and community care.  We all agree that it could and should enhance outcomes and limit costs.  Sl&aacute;intecare reaffirms the commitment, which is representative of all parties and none.  In the absence of that being delivered in a timely manner, the responsibility for the provision of primary care and the advancement and its delivery rests with the Government.</p>  <p>  It is opportune to speak on the topic at this time considering the level of engagement and conversation we have had with constituents, let alone the information that comes into our offices on a daily basis on the difficulties with the Government's implementation of the policy.  At a time when there is grave difficultly in seeking to meet the demands of the policy and match the rhetoric with action on its implementation, parallel to that the Government is engaged in turmoil in terms of the overspend of &euro;400 million on the national children's hospital.  Likewise, in spite of the great delays that existed heretofore, regarding the provision of a national broadband plan and the vast and mammoth cost associated with that and the lack of clarity on a contract, there is no lack of clarity on the cost associated with such a mammoth project, amounting to an additional &euro;1.9 billion, which is new money that must be found.  That is despite the commitments made by the Government on current expenditure and the national development plan.  The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform said the moneys will come from future revenues, despite the fact that he made commitments on future expenditure based on Estimates.  He now says there will be no impact on taxation.  There will be no new taxes.  There will be no new borrowings and there will be no cuts or projects forgone within the national development plan.  It is magic money.  It is Freddie Mercury stuff &ndash; A Kind of Magic, but it is not real.  Then there are the difficulties we all witness with housing, health and Army pay, among others.  There is no magic money to resolve those issues.  It is my duty and that of anybody in this House to highlight the lack of delivery and action to match the rhetoric on the delivery of primary care.</p><p>Home help packages and hours are not available, or are being turned down in my constituency.  Some progress was made at the beginning of the year but it would appear that this was because of the extra funding made available to the HSE to manage the winter crisis in hospitals.  </p> <p> There is a crisis in the area of housing aid for the elderly and disabled.  Local authorities, which administer some of the funding in this area, have waiting lists of two to three years.  We all want our elderly to remain in their communities and remain with their families, but they are being forced to look at the fair deal scheme in the absence of adequate funding being available to them to make their homes compatible with their needs in relation to community help and assistance and home help from the primary care sector.  The costs associated with the fair deal scheme and nursing home care are far greater than what would be expended on these areas.  </p> <p> There are also astronomical waiting lists for psychological assessments for children.  My constituency of Laois-Offaly now has the longest waiting list, having taken over from Cork.  Other speakers have raised the lack of available and meaningful services in the mental health sectors.  Communities are unable to meet the demands of their inhabitants.  The time has come to take on board the suggestion made by Deputy Brassil and others to the effect that the funds within the fair deal scheme should be permitted to be directed towards home help packages and be used to adapt homes for the elderly, meeting the demand.  The fair deal funding should also cater for specialist care for dementia and Alzheimer's patients, which has been neglected by the Government, despite its rhetoric.  </p> <p> I acknowledge the progress that has been made, albeit slowly, in terms of primary care centres and the professionalism that will bring.  However, the provision of a primary care centre in the absence of GPs is a square that must be, but has not been, circled.  I have had first-hand experience of the loss of the Midoc services and the loss of out-of-hours services from GPs.  We were told by the HSE and members of the profession that such losses were caused by an inadequate GP contract and an inadequate rural allowance.  We now hear that the new GP contract, which has been lauded and heralded by members of the Government, is a panacea for these issues.  However, it has not resulted in the reinstatement of those services in places like Birr.  Someone must ask whether the GP contract is adequate to meet the demands of a rural town like that.  If it is not, that should be acknowledged and admitted and such a contract should be put in place to adequately provide for such demands.   </p> <p> We had statements on rural development earlier.  A Minister for Rural and Community Development was appointed to the Cabinet in this Government.  We were assured that all Departments would be rural-proofed and that no policy would emanate from any Department without adequate provision being made for rural areas.  The provision of primary care, home help, adequate facilities and GPs and out-of-hours services is lacking in many parts of rural Ireland, including in my constituency.  This speaks of a failing not just of the Department of Health but also the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The Government should insist on facilities to meet the demands of such communities.  I have outlined some hard facts about the issues we face on a continuous basis which are not being addressed despite utterings to the contrary.  The GP contract is a case in point but I could give many other examples if I had more time.  We will have ample opportunity to examine this further in the coming weeks and months as we prepare for a budget, notwithstanding the difficulties with that in its own right, considering the promises on the delivery of services during negotiations for the last budget that have not materialised.  That, however, is a discussion for another day and for future negotiations.  We will see where they will take us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900053#FFF00200"><p>Primary care has really been a pipe dream since its conception.  It is true that a new primary care centre has been approved in Donegal town and in Buncrana.  However, the primary care project has been largely private sector-led, delivered by private developers offering up sites for primary care centres, which says a lot about healthcare in Ireland.  The Government justified this by arguing that it is better for the delivery of healthcare and costs less as it pays a lease over 20 years instead of all at once upfront.  However, the direct consequence of this Fine Gael way of thinking is there will be large gaps in the provision of primary healthcare.  This is the case in my home town of Killybegs.  We are unfortunate because we do not have a private developer.  We have GPs but no private developer is willing to develop a primary care centre, meaning that one will not be provided.  This Government, supported by the Independent Alliance, makes sure that this is the case.</p>  <p>  The consequences are that the existing GPs are working out of a small health centre and cannot adequately meet the demands of the community.  The closest primary care centre is Ballybofey or Ballyshannon, approximately 50 km or 60 km away.  GP surgeries are available intermittently, but the idea is that health services are only based on a private sector model.  Once again, we are at the mercy of the will of private developers and of course, by default, Donegal will lose out by virtue of the fact there are fewer private developers there.  My colleague, Deputy Connolly, mentioned the islands off Galway which are crying out for primary care centres.  If they had private developers there they would be tripping over themselves to build brand spanking new primary care centres.  </p>  <p>  We need State-run community healthcare with State-owned facilities.  This will meet the needs of local  communities upfront and into the future, as the asset remains State-owned.  Tailoring health services according to what the private sector is offering, instead of deciding what we need, means that the facilities provided are entirely at the discretion of the private sector.  There should be integrated settings that provide a range of ongoing services for common illnesses and conditions to which much of our population is or will be exposed as people age.   For example, the Donegal branch of Diabetes Ireland has done much to raise awareness of the chronic lack of diabetes services across the county, despite ever-increasing demand for health services for people with this condition.  It is a condition that does not discriminate against age or gender and is even increasing in school-age children, yet services still have not caught up.  Diabetes can cause other health conditions affecting the kidneys, eyes and heart, and can cause blood pressure problems.  Constant care is needed to ensure that persons with diabetes do not see their health worsen.  This could be dealt with in primary care settings.  </p>  <p>  There is a significant lack of staff in clinics across Donegal, threatening the expansion of the primary care project.  While cancer care is largely hospital-based, we still face the same problems.  I have worked closely with Donegal Action for Cancer Care on this issue and have constantly pursued both the HSE and Letterkenny University Hospital on increasing access to services in Donegal.  We still do not have adequate access to certain healthcare through our own hospital, let alone services being provided in a primary care setting.  For example, men from Donegal must travel to the prostate rapid access clinic at Galway University Hospital.  Some travel six or seven hours for treatment and must have their follow-up treatment there, if required.  Better access would mean providing a prostrate rapid access clinic through Letterkenny University Hospital.  Donegal women should not have to travel to the centre in Galway after having their BreastCheck mammogram if there is a query or concern.   Donegal women should be able to be seen at Letterkenny University Hospital and, if required, have their surgery there.</p><p>With radiotherapy services at the north-west cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital, in which the Government has invested, has a memorandum of understanding for 25 years, both the rapid access clinic and BreastCheck follow-up should be at Letterkenny University Hospital.  All Donegal patients who need radiotherapy which can be treated at the north-west cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital should have their treatment there and not be forced to travel to Galway and Dublin.</p> <p> Importantly, we need investment in mental health services more than ever and placed within a primary care setting particularly in the area of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Findings from a national survey revealed that over 40% of service users indicated they had a poor experience of HSE mental health services.  Almost 40% indicated they were not involved as much as they would like in decisions about the medication they take, while two thirds reported they did not have a written recovery or care plan developed with their community mental health team.  Over 70% of family, friends, carers and supporters were dissatisfied with the extent to which HSE mental health services had considered their support needs.  Almost half indicated none of their views had been incorporated into the recovery or care plan of the person they support.  If a survey was done of the private developers who provided the primary care centres, I am sure it would find they would be happy with the service.  That is probably where the service will be heading.</p> <p> In a reply to my query recently, the HSE acknowledged one vacant consultant psychiatrist position within CAMHS, with numerous vacancies in nursing, health and social care professional categories, including one senior occupational therapist, one clinical nurse specialist as well as one principal social worker.  The constant vacancies and issues retaining staff are at crisis levels and will severely hamper any effort to roll out effective primary care.  It is time we move away from a private sector model and towards State-owned, State-run local community health care.  It is a human right not a commodity.  The Minister of State will claim that the private model is cheaper in the long run when it is not.  It just provides fewer outcomes at the start.  I would rather have fewer proper ones than more defective ones.</p></speech>

I am also sure he is familiar with the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Sl&aacute;intecare strategy and implementation plan, published in March, is an extremely important document which provides a beacon of hope for developing primary care services.  It is a once-in-a-generation reform programme which must be pursued by the Government and its successors because it is a ten-year vision for change in the health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare is predicated on building our health services around primary care and re-orientating our services away from a hospital-centric model.  Primary care will deliver not only general practice but primary care delivery of nursing services, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and mental health services.</p>  <p>  The main issue regarding primary care and general practice is the recruitment and retention of GPs.  We have a new primary care deal &ndash; it is not a contract - which returns investment to primary care and general practice which was removed during the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts from 2009 to 2013.  It was absolutely essential that those cuts were reversed.  The deal involves stabilising general practice by returning funding which was taken from general practice.  This was funding for running general practice, not income for it.  An important aspect of the new deal is stabilisation.</p>  <p>  A second aspect of the deal is to provide chronic care delivery through general practice.  A basic tenet of Sl&aacute;intecare is that chronic care management is delivered through general practice in primary care.  A third pillar of the new deal is to expand eligibility to patients, initially to those under 12 but also to those who have chronic illnesses.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we will have to wait another four years before we have a GP contract and this new deal goes through the system between now and 2022.  It is essential we have a new chief GP contract because if we are to address the medical manpower requirements of expanding services and eligibility, we need sufficient numbers of GPs to deliver that service.  We are short 500 GPs.  If we are to expand eligibility and chronic care, we will need more GPs.  If one offers citizens services and eligibility without putting in place the capacity in general practice, then we will have similar waiting lists to those in the UK&rsquo;s NHS where patients can wait up to a week or ten days before they see a GP for a routine appointment.  That is unheard of in Irish general practice.  However, one can have great difficulty seeing one&rsquo;s GP on the day one wants because 70% of GPs have closed their lists to new patients as it is the only way they can control their workloads.  One has to address the medical manpower issue in general practice.  The only way to do that is through a new GP contract.  Talks on a new GP contract need to start in parallel with rolling out this deal and it has to involve the Irish College of General Practitioners in developing the framework.</p>  <p>  We have an ageing GP workforce.  Up to 700 GPs are due to retire in the next five to ten years but only 100 GPs under the age of 40 years hold a GP contract.  We need to increase our training places but also to attract GPs back to the country who have emigrated over the past several years.  We must give them a career structure which they can value and will give them the sustainability they require within the profession.</p>  <p>  Community intervention teams are an extremely important part of primary care.  They are not rolled out nationwide.  In Clare we are lucky to have an excellent community intervention team manned by dedicated nurses who receive people back out of hospital on early discharge, provide them with transitional care, intravenous antibiotics, look after the various equipment patients may have to use and provide an intensive level of care to allow them to return to their communities as soon as possible.  We need to recruit more public health nurses.  The public health nurse system is struggling to meet the demands placed on it by the early transfer of patients from hospitals back into the community.  These nurses are stretched by the number of patients they have to deal with and services they have to provide.  It is extremely important that public health nurses are supported and more are recruited to deliver the primary care services for which we all wish.</p>  <p>  We need to reorient the health service away from the hospital-centric model to primary care.  That requires integration of primary care and secondary care.  I had the pleasure of spending the afternoon with Ms Laura Magahy from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office during which we presented to her an analysis of reforms which have taken place in other jurisdictions, particularly in the Veterans Health Administration in the United States and NHS Scotland which has similar problems to ours trying to provide health services for a geographically dispersed population.  We also discussed reforms in the Canterbury area of New Zealand which has also experienced similar problems.  The most important aspect of those reform programmes was the integration of primary and secondary care.  There was a free and seamless movement of patients from primary care to a timely service within secondary care service.  It involved the delivery of investigations and treatments in an ambulatory setting which do not require admission to hospital.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>However, that requires access to diagnostics and expert consultant opinion in a timely manner through medical assessment units, acute medical assessment units and ambulatory services to prevent patients from entering hospital to deliver hospital avoidance measures.  That is extremely important.  When the Minister develops primary care, it cannot be done in isolation.  He must do so in conjunction with integrating care in our secondary services.</p> <p> We had representatives from Mental Health Reform and from the Mental Health Commission before the health committee this morning.  Their problem was the delivery of mental health services in primary care and the lack of staff and team members within community psychiatric services.  There is a shortage of community psychiatric consultants, community psychiatric nurses, psychologists and occupational therapists and of the provision of cognitive behaviour therapy to provide mental health services within the community.  An important aspect of primary care is that we deliver mental health services within the community.</p> <p> Because of the gaps that have developed within primary care and the shortage of GPs, private enterprise is entering general practice, buying up general practices and putting GPs into work on a salaried basis within a primary care service, which is not in the best interests of patients.  We also have pop-up primary care surgeries, which provide one-off consultations but no continuity of care.  What people need in general practice is to meet the right doctor in the right place who can make the right decision and continuity of care is critical to primary care.  We need to have a dedicated GP service, a dedicated primary care service, where people have continuity of care which is critical for making the right decisions because many decisions are made by inexperienced doctors which lead to unnecessary referrals and investigations.  It is critical we have a coherent integrated primary care service.</p></speech>

This is an important aspect of Irish life and it is important that we get it right.  It is said, and I can only conclude it is correct, that we should seek to meet 90% to 95% of all health and personal social service needs within a primary care setting.  That is something towards which we should aim.</p>  <p>  Robust and active primary and community care is essential in terms of enhancing health outcomes and limiting costs to the State.  A strong primary and community care system will be invaluable in preventing the development of conditions that could ultimately require acute hospital care and it would also provide the right environment for early discharges from hospital.  It helps to enhance quality of life and reduce the undue stress of admission to hospital from a patient&rsquo;s perspective.  The Government's record on primary care leaves a lot to be desired.  There have often been significant delays between announcement and delivery of primary care centres.  We have been waiting quite some time for a primary care centre in Athy.  There were a number of photo opportunities on the site.  When it is developed it will be good and will have many specialised services, but there has been a long gap between announcement and delivery. </p>  <p>  There are no new measures for primary care in the HSE service plan for 2019.  On a like-for-like basis, as a share of the HSE budget, the allocation will fall from 6.9% to 6.6%.  That shows us where primary care is ranked.  When we compare the figures, 6.6% of the total HSE budget is to be spent on primary care when it should be looking after 90% of people's needs.  There is something wrong.</p>  <p>  I want to mention a few areas I highlighted recently by tabling parliamentary questions and raising matters for Topical Issue debate.  I spoke about the lack of GPs in Kildare, particularly in Kildare town where, following the retirement of a GP, people were told that they had to go to Monasterevin, which is a number of miles away.  We are talking about many elderly people in their 70s who might find it difficult to access public transport or to drive themselves there.  That has been difficult for them.  There is a significant capacity issue, certainly within Kildare and across the country.</p>  <p>  I doubt this is the case only in Kildare but there is a large number of issues in terms of the parents of children under the age of age who are having difficulty enrolling their children into a GP practice.  Kildare is in the lowest 20% nationally for the number of GPs per head of population.  A total of 15% of GPs in Kildare are set to retire in the next ten years and succession planning cannot take place due to the fact that there is no established feeder scheme into the county.  That is a major problem.</p>  <p>  Another issue I raised is the lack of resources to provide a replacement for the primary care psychologist for the Kildare area while she is on maternity leave.  A replacement was not sought to cover maternity leave for the Kildare and Wicklow area.  Many children are waiting for assessments and to think that they have to wait for at least another six months is shocking.  I was contacted by one family who is paying more than &euro;1,000 for a private assessment having waited many months for any type of assessment.  In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, I was advised that the reason a temporary replacement has not been found is due to a lack of resources.  They did not advertise due to a lack of resources, which is shocking.  How can resources be so low that they cannot look for a replacement to continue a service across the Kildare area?  It is scandalous that parents are being left in limbo while awaiting an assessment for their children. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, with the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on providing a fair deal on home care.  It is a valuable Bill.  I keep in touch on an ongoing basis with the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society in Kildare.  I attended a meeting not too long ago at which I met many wonderful men and women who, with the right supports, have remained in their own homes and the familiar environment which is best for them and with their children and spouses caring for them.  However, they face many challenges, as all families do, in dealing with dementia care.  Thousands of them across the country are selflessly caring for older relatives with very little help from the Government.  Staying at home with appropriate assistance from the State and appropriate primary centre healthcare is, without doubt, the preferred option for most of the people I have met and spoken to in my constituency week after week.  They deserve dignity, respect and the choice as to where they want to live the final years of their lives.  Not only is that the most humane solution but it is the best value for money for the State coffers.  It is important that we examine that.  We as a party believe that funding allocated to enable older people to remain at home with the support of primary health centres provides the best value for money and the fairest and most dignified result for older people.  Progress needs to be made in that regard.</p>  <p>  A strong primary care system would be invaluable for preventing the development of conditions that ultimately require acute hospital care.  We need occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychiatric nurses, speech therapists and many more to help plug the gaps in primary care.  Continuity of care is crucial for everybody.</p><p>The 2018 service capacity review states that if reforms are to be implemented, there would be a requirement for a 50% increase in the primary care workforce, including approximately 1,000 extra GPs, 1,200 extra practice nurses, and 1,100 extra public health nurses.  The Government's 2019 primary care plans do not match its supposed commitment to the sector.  Certainly, the programme for Government commitment of a so-called decisive shift in health service practice to primary care is not supported in the HSE service plan.  This is not good enough.  An increase of 0.5% in the allocation for new developments in primary care was held back by the Department of Health last year.  We had a similar situation in 2017 and 2018.  In late 2017, the then director general of the HSE stated that the health service required an additional &euro;500 million a year of transitional funding over ten years to move to a properly functioning primary care GP-based system.  This should be a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Department of Health.</p> <p> In a contribution to A Future Together: Building a Better GP and Primary Care Service, the former HSE director general stated, "We need a ... substantial transitional investment ... to move from the overly hospital-centric system we have now".  Part of the problem is that doctors are incredibly cautious.  That is my experience.  They are afraid to make judgments and are sending many of their patients into accident and emergency.  That is wrong.  It is no wonder that we have a choked-up system.  In Naas, we have people on trolleys every night.  In Naas, one of the medical assessments is closed because they cannot get a doctor.  That is adding to the problems there.</p> <p> On behalf of the people I represent in south Kildare, I appeal for increased investment in primary care for the people whom we serve in this House.</p></speech>

We need to look at ways of achieving a more balanced health service by ensuring the majority of patients who require urgent or planned care are managed within primary and community-based settings.  This will achieve a more accessible and cost-effective health service for the benefit of everyone who uses it.</p>  <p>  The document, Primary Care: A Framework for the Future, which issued in April 2016 when the Government took office, sought to outline the challenges that healthcare in urban and rural Ireland presented, and outlined possible solutions to these problems.  Primary care teams in both urban and rural Ireland are undoubtedly dealing with a raft of challenges, and my main concern in our discussion is how primary care can function better in my large rural constituency of west Cork.  I have spent recent months out on the road canvassing for my brother and from meeting my constituents during that time, I am aware of the following problems we face in west Cork when it comes to primary care such as the ageing population, the lack of available GPs, and diminishing services in rural primary care centres, to name but a few.</p>  <p>  The ageing population needs to be cared for, either in their homes or in nursing homes.  Parts of rural Ireland, however, are facing a bed shortage in nursing homes.  Current projections suggest a shortfall of up to 7,500 beds by 2026.  The HSE home support service, formerly called the home help service or home care package scheme, aims to support older people to remain in their homes for as long as possible and to support formal carers.  From listening to my constituents, however, this vision of the home care service as portrayed by the HSE is a far cry from the reality faced by elderly people longing to stay in their homes.  Many are lucky if they can get an hour a day of home care service.  Most get only a half hour.  Only the other day a lady in Bantry told me that when the family were looking for a home care service for her father, they were told there is an embargo on it.  They will stop it altogether soon.  Of course, we are told time and again that there are no hours available because they cannot find staff.  Those carrying out the home care services are fiercely interested in getting extra hours but they will not be given them.  It is a game.  There appears to be a disconnect between each patient's needs and the services and facilities that are provided.  There is no statutory right to home care in Ireland.  The quality and availability of information about services is poor.  This is difficult for families in trying to navigate the system and access services.  We need to address the shortage of home care staff.  This is a serious concern.</p>  <p>  I commend the public health nurses who do a wonderful job, but there are not enough of them within the HSE to provide the service that is needed.  This staffing issue results in too much responsibility resting on the shoulders of the understaffed public health nurses.  They have too many decisions to make and too much to cope with and they do not have enough time allotted to carry out their jobs.  There needs to be an increase in the number of public health nurses.</p>  <p>  GPs are facing a manpower crisis.  Approximately 55% of GPs are over 55, and many newly trained GPs are leaving Ireland to work abroad where pay and conditions are better.  This shortage is particularly evident in rural areas, especially with many of the GPs close to retirement age with no great prospect of being replaced.  Practising GPs report that they are in a situation of burnout and stress.  This is another serious issue that we need to address.</p>  <p>  Rural GPs are finding it increasingly difficult to run a viable practice in a small town or village, as the number of public patients in rural areas is increasing.  The GP is still expected to maintain a properly equipped, technologically enhanced premises, employ expert staff in sufficient numbers and manage a range of expenses.  It is now becoming impossible for a GP to run a viable practice in a small rural community.</p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the diminishing services in rural primary care centres.  In my constituency, there was a chiropody service in Schull which facilitated a large number of older members of the Mizen Peninsula.  I am saddened to say this service was stopped in December 2018, and patients now must travel to Skibbereen Community Hospital to avail of this service.  The additional patients have put increased pressure on the staff in Skibbereen.  Many of the patients from Schull do not have their own mode of transport and there is no public transport from Schull passing the hospital, which is a few kilometres outside of the town.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that new primary care centres are being built in Bantry and Bandon in west Cork.  Bantry's new primary care centre will be a large building, set beside Bantry General Hospital.  Among other services which will be provided there, this large building would provide an ideal location for a cataract unit.  With considerable waiting lists for cataract surgery in west Cork, a cataract unit is essential to cope with the increasing numbers of patients coming on stream every year.  At present, we have people on waiting lists up to five years for a cataract procedure that takes 15 minutes.  It is a disgrace that they have to travel across the Border to save their sight.  The Government appears to have no problem with allowing people to go slowly blind while waiting for their cataract procedure.  So far, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have carried 33 busloads - the 34th this weekend - to Belfast for cataract procedures.  The Government should be ashamed of how it has let down the people of the country.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week I raised a question in the D&aacute;il about the charity-led air ambulance, which is based in Cork and has the capability of reaching out to most parts of Ireland, including remote areas in west Cork such as the Beara, Sheep's Head and Mizen peninsulas, within ten to 15 minutes.  The development of the charity-led air ambulance has been delayed for months which has led to considerable frustration as this has the capability to save so many lives.  It must be remembered that people have raised tens of thousands of euros and have put this in place.  The effort some of these people put into this is incredible.  It is sad to think that it is lying idle waiting for the HSE to tick the box, which I cannot see happening.  This charity has complied with the required procedures and protocol, but we are faced with the situation that this lifesaving resource is still grounded.  I want to know when the National Ambulance Service will confirm the deployment of this national lifesaving service.  I have asked previously.  Yesterday, I was told by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, it was not on the programme for Government.  It actually was.  The Minister must correct the record and I will be notifying her.  The national air ambulance service was on the programme for Government.  We need to make sure that this service gets off the ground and is used.  It is also not only for west Cork.  It will be used all the way up to Galway, Mayo, etc.  It will provide an excellent opportunity to save lives.</p>  <p>  I cannot stand in front of the Government and talk about primary care services without mentioning how the ambulance staff have been reduced to strike action again.</p><p>The ambulance personnel belonging to the Psychiatric Nurses Association are to escalate their campaign of industrial action by engaging in strike action in six days' time because of the refusal of the HSE to afford its members the right to be members of a union of their choice.  The first of these strikes will take place this Friday and Saturday.  Once again, the HSE is forcing an escalation of this dispute which is entirely of the HSE's making.  I support the ambulance staff 100% and will be standing beside them this weekend during their strike to show them my committed support.</p></speech>

It is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit GPs, who are vitally important when it comes to the delivery of primary care and keeping people out of hospitals.  Rural GPs find it difficult financially, something in the past we never would have thought would happen.  It is simply not as attractive as it might have been in the past for people to operate a rural GP practice because of all the different expenses involved.  We must put more investment into primary care and reverse the cuts to general practice that took place a number of years ago and which have left it difficult for people to run general practices.  The new deal which will enable stabilisation of the service probably will not be fully rolled out until 2021 or 2022.  That is quite simply unacceptable because the primary care promised to the under-12s and patients with chronic illness is needed to keep them out of hospitals services as much as possible.  We need that new GP contract to be rolled out and for it to be financially viable, feasible and sensible for people to operate primary care units in their own areas.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland we are running 500 or 600 GPs short of what we actually should have.  That certainly is not welcome, as we all know how important the local GP is, in the same way we know how important the community welfare nurses are.  Those nurses are a lifeline through their calling to people's homes.  I commend these nurses, and I obviously can only speak of the community nurses I know personally in County Kerry who give 100% commitment, as well as a 100% correct and great service for their patients in communities.  They are the reason people are able to live and stay at home.  The GP who might call to a person's home on a regular basis, if that patient was unable to travel to meet the GP, is probably the lifeline keeping that person living in his or her own home, community and family structure.  </p>  <p>  Everything that can be done should be done to reduce the waiting list at accident and emergency hospital units.  We should redirect patients by giving them the adequate services they need in community hospitals, by their GP service or by availing of the services of community nurses.  Some people, obviously, must go to an emergency department but care can be provided in the community, rather than choking up emergency departments with people waiting for treatment.  It is totally inhumane for people to have to wait for so many hours in an emergency department.  </p>  <p>  I regularly visit the emergency departments in Kerry, Cork and Limerick and usually do so in the middle of the night.  The reason I do that is to see exactly what is happening in the middle of the night, which is what I call the hours from 12 midnight until 6 a.m.  I suggest any Deputy or public representative who has not been in a major emergency department during those hours cannot talk about the service or what is happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900057#KKK00500"><p>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has done it because I have been told about it and it is very important.  It is not that one is going in to stick one's nose into people's business, as all one needs to do is to observe what is happening.  One is there in a helpful way, not to be obstructive or critical or anything like that.  If a person knows what the problems are there on the ground, when he or she is up here, whether it is lobbying with people like the Minister of State or the other Ministers with responsibility for health, the public representative will know what he or she is talking about, which is very important.</p>  <p>  Many GP practices have closed because their waiting lists will not allow them to take on any new patients and have been shut down.  This is not because they do not want to but they quite simply cannot.  The aging GP service is also an issue, as even the baby in the cradle is getting older by the day, and many GPs who are heading towards retirement are not being replaced new young GPs.  </p>  <p>  The community intervention teams are required all over the country.  I have great faith in community intervention teams.  The only problem is there is not enough of them deployed throughout the entire country, particularly in rural areas.  Care is needed with early discharges from a general or even from a community hospital to take such people back into the communities.  It is a welcome development if early discharges can be given, provided the person is sure of having the care he or she needs when they go home.  More public health nurses are required to deliver primary care in their own areas.</p>  <p>  On mental health and delivery of that service, the lack of a community psychiatric service is grave in communities and more services are required, especially where there is an age gap.  If we have young people with psychiatric problems, sometimes they can fall between two stools in that there is no service available for them.  They are neither here nor there.  We have to ensure that whatever the age of a young person, there is a place for him or her.  If the parents or close family of such young people feel, see or know that they are in trouble with psychiatric illness or problems, we must ensure there is at least some place for them to receive the care they need at that critical time.  </p>  <p>  One service that has developed throughout the country is what we might call pop-up private consultation services.  I am not a great fan, quite simply because local GPs always have provided a continuity of care.  If a pop-up service is there and if people can go in for a once-off consultation, where is the continuity of care with the original care provider?  There may be misdiagnoses or different issues that may arise from those consultations.  Nothing will ever beat the good patient-local GP relationship, where a person will have the same GP for many years.  That GP then gets to know his or her patient in a very sound fashion.  They get to know each other and can get a better outcome of healthcare for the person because of it.</p>  <p>  As regards nurses, it is shame that we have a lack of nurses in places such as Dingle, County Kerry.  It must be made more attractive for young nurses.  We have great, intelligent young nurses who have been trained, are excellent and would provide a significant service, were they here in Ireland.  Unfortunately, as they wanted to better themselves, they felt the rate of pay they would get here from the HSE would not be adequate and they left.  They are over in England, in America and in Australia.  I plead with the Minister of State, for the sake of those young people, to make it attractive for them to come home and to work, regardless of whether it is in Kenmare, Cahersiveen or Dingle community hospitals or in general hospitals like University Hospital Kerry or Cork University Hospital, which service the county or Limerick.</p><p>We do not want those jobs to be filled by temporary staff.  We want them to be full-time care providers, nurses, doctors or community welfare nurses.  They are the people on whom we will be relying.</p> <p> I want to use my last bit of time to speak about the ambulance service.  I could not commend ambulance personnel highly enough.  They are the first people who are called out to the home of an elderly person or to the scene of an horrific accident on the side of the road.  They are the backbone of first contact between the patient and the hospital and they should be supported by all of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900058#LLL00200"><p>I am glad to get the opportunity to speak.  We have a duty of care as elected representatives and must ensure all the people who present sick, ill or whatever get a fair and proper assessment and are dealt with in a professional way as soon as possible.  The Government has published the national primary care plan.  I do not give it much credence.  I have listened to too many plans, reports and proposals that never seem to take off.  My brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, rightfully, praised the ambulance crews.  The ambulance crews themselves are fine and do their job as well and as efficiently as ever they can.  In recent times, a 94 year old woman was waiting for two hours for an ambulance in east Kerry.  That is a fact and it is not a joke.  Likewise, another person in mid-Kerry waited for two hours for an ambulance.  That was not happening in Kerry up until a certain thing was done by the HSE, which it called the "reconfiguration" of the ambulance service.  That was the word it used.  What it actually meant was a reduction in ambulance services.  When the ambulance leaves Killarney with a patient for Cork University Hospital, CUH, when it drops off the patient, the ambulance is told to press a button in the ambulance as they are coming out of CUH saying they are available for work.  Instead of going back to Killarney to deal with the Killarney people, that ambulance could finish down in Fermoy, Youghal, Mitchelstown, in any part of Cork or even could be sent to Limerick.  That is what is happening.  That leaves Kerry exposed until some other ambulance comes back to Kerry, which does not happen because the flow of ambulances is to the bigger hospital.  We are left waiting for two hours.  Then we have ambulances with personnel from Cork and other places struggling to find places in Kerry.  When they were asked to go to Lispole they went to Listowel.  Simple things like that.  I imagine the Minister of State does not know the distance between Lispole and Listowel.  Things like that are still happening.</p>  <p>  We are talking about patient care.  None of us knows the hour when we will get sick.  A man rang me yesterday evening about his wife.  She is doubled over with pain.  She got a letter saying she is on a waiting list to be called for an endoscopy assessment.  We went after it and found that if the doctor would say it was serious and urgent, she would be called within eight days but if that did not happen, she would be waiting doubled over for practically three months.  That is not good enough when someone is in pain.  It is the same with people with pain in their hip or knees.  If they are just on a medical card, they will have to wait and stay awake at night with pain.  That is not good enough.  That is the health service as it is operated at the minute.  </p>  <p>  I raised the issue of home help here today.  The Government is all talk about keeping people in their own homes as long as possible.  That is not happening because the home help hours are being cut.  In one instance a woman asked the home help, who had just 20 minutes in the evening, if she could cook a dinner for her.  The home help said, "I cannot.  I can give you a shower and I can give you a sandwich."  The woman said to me, "Danny, to hell with the showers.  I am showered to death.  I am actually hungry."  That is God's gospel truth.  I am not adding one iota to it.  Cutting the home help time to 20 minutes is ridiculous. </p>  <p> I refer to people with disabilities.  I am talking about children who are born to a mother and father who are going to have a disability, mental or physical, for all the days of their life.  This is a terrible cross and a burden on families to which it happens, but that is nature, that is life, that is the cross they have been given.  I feel for those parents when they get elderly.  I know a family where the father is 75 years and the mother is 79.  They are very worried about where their 57 year old disabled son is going to finish up.  They are still taking him in the car to meet the bus to go to day centres.  The biggest worry they have now is not the problem of seeing after him but what is going to happen to him when they are gone.  That is their worry.  That is replicated right around the county of Kerry which I represent.  I know so many people in that position.  The Government is failing in that regard.  It is failing to do anything about it.  The Minister of State should not shake his head because I know it is and know the people who are involved.  The Government wanted to put some of these disabled people in decongregated settings to put them out into the communities.  I told the Minister of State about some of these people before.  They are not able for it and will never be.  I know one child - I still call her a child but she is 46 years of age - who is blind and is balled up in a little ball.  She does not know anything but they have her kept alive in St. Mary of the Angels and the Government wanted to take her out of it.  That is very wrong.  The Government has some people taken out of it and is paying &euro;600,000 and &euro;700,000 a year to keep them in a decongregated setting.  That is where the Government is spending the money wrong.  </p>  <p>  People in pain are not being seen after and I just do not give credence to these primary care plans and all other plans.  There are so many little things the Government could do to ensure that when people are in pain and need help, they should be seen to, no matter if they just have a medical card.  The only way we can get some of those people seen to is to send them into the accident and emergency department and tell them not to come out until they are seen.  Otherwise they would remain in pain for weeks or probably until they died.  </p>  <p>  My father fought hard to get a new community hospital for Kenmare.  Only half of it is open still, 80 years on.  There is only one respite bed and families trying to care for elderly people and doing their best to keep them in their homes for as long as possible.  They need a break.  The hospital in Kenmare services from Poulgorm Bridge all the way to Caherdaniel, practically as far as Waterford, and back the other end of the peninsula as far as Lauragh.  To think that hospital can only cater for 26 patients in a year.</p><p>That is what is going on.  The lucky patients get two weeks.  That is what we get when we divide 26 patients over 52 weeks.  That is all that is being catered for, while there are still 18 or 20 beds to be opened in that hospital.  There is talk about the difficulty of getting nurses.  There would be no problem if they were paid properly.  It is the same story in Dingle Community Hospital.   There were between 22 and 24 patients on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry, Tralee, in the middle of the roasting summer.  That is wrong.  I do not think the Government understands this.  We have five Ministers responsible for health in the Government and we still do not have a proper health service for people who are sick.  I am sorry.  I have nothing personal against the Minister of State but I have to point out what the people we represent are telling us.</p></speech>

In all my time in politics there has been a great tension between expenditure in hospitals and expenditure devoted to preventive and primary care medicine.  It always seemed to me that the hospitals won out.  It is a more high-profile area and much more likely to attract public attention in the main national media.  Primary and preventative care is less spectacular but, when analysed, gives much better results.  I remember suggesting at one stage that we really need two Departments of Health.  Having one Minister means that person is always conflicted between putting money into the hospitals for exciting new medicine and putting it into the much more mundane area of primary and preventative care.  That might deliver better results for many more people.</p>  <p>  There is definitely this tension.  My feeling was that if we had two Ministers, one with responsibility for children and primary care and the other with responsibility for hospital care, at least there would be balance in the debate at the Cabinet table.  The reality is that if we look at many of the illnesses causing so many challenges to us as a society, we see how much prevention is actually better than cure.  I refer to diabetes or regular testing for cancers as examples.  It is noteworthy that we are having this debate on the issue of primary care.  I believe a much greater share of resources should be focused in that direction.  </p>  <p>   If we had properly funded and located primary care teams, I am convinced that many treatments now provided in hospitals could be brought out into the community.  These issues date back when we were in government. No matter how often we talk about this, unfortunately, it is always stated that this is the way of the future.  It never seems to happen, however.  I believe in centres of excellence for high-powered medicine.  That makes absolute sense.  There has to be critical mass for diagnoses and operations when treating cancers, etc.  It does not hold true, however, for subsequent treatments.  We need to have a positive policy that everything that can be done more appropriately at the local level will be done there.  </p>  <p>  We also have to understand that for many people, throughout their lives, the mundane issues of medicine are very important.  I will address some related issues in the short time that I have.  As I stated in the debate on rural development earlier, there is a huge impetus towards centralisation now.  When pressure comes on systems, the first places to lose out are on the periphery.  It also seems that when the pressure comes on we do not do the simple things well.  I will give some examples.  There is an issue in respect of a lack of physiotherapy resources in the west of Ireland.  The money has been provided but there seems to be some delay in hiring physiotherapists.  The existing resources were not spread equally across the regions to ensure that any reduction in services would be borne evenly between urban and rural communities.  A decision was made by the HSE instead to withdraw physiotherapy services from Connemara and to tell people to travel more than 100 km to Galway city for physiotherapy.  It is absolute nonsense to be recommending that older people who need these services be brought such distances on bad roads.  I recall the old saying about bringing the person to the mountain or the mountain to the person.  It seems that in this case we are bringing all of the people to the city instead of bringing the services to the people.</p>  <p>   This is a major reversal all of the promises made regarding primary care.  I have an example in which the Minister of State may be particularly interested.  Someone recently approached me in respect of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  That person lives seven miles west of Clifden, County Galway.  Clifden is about 100 km from Galway city.  The suggestion was there be a CAMHS service in Clifden once a month.  I asked a parliamentary question on this issue.  It was, as usual, referred to the HSE.  That agency responded that that was its policy and the patients would have to go to Galway.  Is that a humane way to treat a family under stress and the young person with mental health issues?  Is it fair for that young person and his or her family to have to spend half a day travelling to avail of a service?  Is this what we call progress?  We are centralising everything and putting great impositions on people on the edge.  We wonder sometimes why the emergency services are jam-packed.  We wonder why ambulances are held up in the acute hospitals waiting to disgorge patients.  The patients can be brought into the hospital but they cannot be handed over to the staff.  The lack of a local primary care service is forcing people who could have been treated in those services into the acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  In the time left to me, I want to raise a subject that might not be the exact topic of this debate but I am sure the Minister of State will forgive me.   It is his specific area of competence.  I am gravely concerned about the dearth of funding for disabilities services in recent years.  I am criticising the Minister of State and the Government but I am not doing it in a personal way.  I am doing it because a great many parents are coming to me looking for respite care.  Some are looking for full-time residential care.</p></speech>

Those providing services to people with intellectual disabilities are telling me that they do not have adequate resources to provide the services required.  I understand the challenge.  It is, again, not the high-profile part of medicine.  There was much more talk about disability issues in the 1990s and 2000s than there is now.  I understand that as a consequence, the Minister of State might be fighting an uphill battle.  The reality, however, is that the families of the people with intellectual disabilities are living with this every day of every year and can expect a lifetime of looking after a young person.  Most people who end up caring for the elderly will be in that situation for a finite time.  People who wind up looking after young people with a disability will be doing that for a long lifetime.  That is because, thankfully, survival rates are much better nowadays.</p><p>I have been trying to table questions to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the means-testing of disability allowance for those who have never had and never will have the chance to find a job.  If parents leave to their children out of what they have saved in a lifetime &euro;100,000, the Department disregards the first &euro;50,000.  If they leave them a house, it means that they are ruling their children out of receiving support from the State.  That issue must be addressed also.</p> <p> In summary, we need a greater proportion of the budget to be spent on primary care services.  We must ensure the regions and areas on the edge of the country receive the same services as those areas at the centre.  We must put a great deal more money into disability services than we have been in recent years.</p></speech>

The meeting included families from as far away as County Louth.  The title of the meeting was "Carers in Crisis", which is an indication of how carers feel about the support the system provides.  The meeting was attended by parents, siblings and people in their later years who continue to have complete responsibility for adult children with physical and intellectual disabilities.  They remain the primary carers and try to provide care within the environs of their own home.  They made the point that they did so against the backdrop of many challenges, obstacles and a significant lack of support for them in doing the good they did.  They want no more platitudes and do not want to be told that they are the heroes of society.  They want action, not words.</p>  <p>  Family Carers Ireland provides a huge amount of support for families, but it is done on a shoestring and with limited resources.  It provides some financial, emotional and mental health support far beyond what could be expected of an organisation of its type.  A number of issues were raised at the meeting.  For the information of the Minister of State, I note that tomorrow in Buswells Hotel, Family Carers Ireland is launching a report entitled, Paying the Price for the Physical, Mental and Psychological Impact of Caring.  The meeting in Monaghan was two hours long and included families at the coalface of the vocation of caring for loved ones.  A number of issues recurred with families sitting around the tables.  For them, those two hours were a precious chance to step out of family life and the 24/7 care they provided.  It was heart wrenching to hear some of the stories and personal accounts of the challenges carers willingly faced on a daily basis.  I wish to raise those issues with the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Minister of State privately and on the floor of the House about the recently introduced transport charges for those with disabilities who attend day care centres for lunch.  While it might only be &euro;5 per day or &euro;20 per week, it amounts to a significant sum at the end of the year for people who have a very small social welfare payment in the first place.  Parents, families and the clients of day services feel aggrieved about the charges.  Not only are they aggrieved at the actual payment, they are also aggrieved at the lack of consistency around it.  Some centres charge the transport fee, while others do not.  Those who refuse to pay are never forced to do so, while some people pay it anyway.  It is not regularised and there is nothing consistent about it.  There has been a flood of parents coming to me at my constituency offices across counties Cavan and Monaghan who are deeply upset at seeing some of the most vulnerable in communities being encumbered with this extra charge for transport and lunches.</p>  <p>  People at the meeting spoke to me about an issue I had not come across before.  We all know about the difficulty in getting carer's allowance and the protracted bureaucratic process involved.  However, a matter which I do not fully understand was explained to me.  It is that a certain number of people find that the allowance precludes or in some way inhibits their pension entitlements after a lifetime of caring.  The chairperson of the meeting said that across Ireland a number of adults and parents providing care and in receipt of the allowance saw their pension entitlements affected and that something needed to be done about that issue.  They assured me that there was a very small number of people in Ireland who fell into that bracket.  They say it is something that should be very simple to address.  While it is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I am sure the Minister of State is in constant touch with the Minister owing to his passion for the area.  I ask him to ensure the Department of Health will consider the matter with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Also raised at the meeting was the lack of ancillary supports.  I refer to occupational therapy, physiotherapy and something I had never thought about before, namely, mental health supports for families and carers providing care.  Providing care is draining and difficult.  It is the constant nature of the job.  It is another element of the frustration carers face when they take on the job.  There is frustration in seeking occupational therapy and physiotherapy, but there is also frustration in seeking services for carers.  We talk a great deal here about mental health and well-being, but carers who are doing a very difficult job, with no clocking out time, need emotional and mental health support.  The Minister of State knows well from personal experience that the job is 24/7.  I ask him if it is something at which he could look in his Department to see what can be done to provide that support.</p>  <p>  People at the meeting discussed regular and emergency respite care services.  As the Minister of State knows, the Annalee respite care service in Cavan-Monaghan has been a fiasco for months.  The most recent reply from the HSE states that, after the service has been closed for months on end, there is an oil leak which, again, is preventing access.  Families racross Cavan-Monaghan have been shut out from receiving any respite care service.  It is a major loss to families and parents.  In recent weeks the parents' action group in Cootehill held a public meeting to voice their frustration.  They must go to great lengths to hold a public meeting, given the pressures on their time and the dependence of their loved ones.  Taking the time to come to a public meeting says a great deal about their frustration.  The subject of regular and emergency respite care services was also raised at the meeting on carers in crisis.  The answer is providing more hours and greater access to respite care.  Families say that when they have asked for emergency respite care, the Department has said it fears such a service would be abused.  It is a terrible answer to give parents and carers seeking an emergency respite care service.  It was explained to me that families could not pick up the phone and rely on any service to provide respite care cover in the case of a family emergency.  The feedback I received at the meeting was that there was no way an emergency respite care service could or would ever be abused.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Therefore, they will be using that service in a limited way and only when it is most necessary.  That is, again, something that the Minister of State could delve into and examine.  I know there would be significant appreciation for that from carers.</p> <p> I refer to the home care packages and know that the Minister of State has heard a number of my colleagues across the House raise this issue tonight.  In Cavan-Monaghan, we do not seem to be any different from any other area.  Somebody has to die before a client who has been allocated a home care package, who has been recognised as being in need of home care and who has qualified for a home care package can get staff in to provide that home care service.  The point being made by parents yesterday was that more home care packages are needed, hours and staff are needed and that skilled staff are needed, rather than just lobbing somebody in to do the job.  It must be somebody who is appropriate to the clients they are visiting.  That is important for these parents and for carers at large.</p> <p> I have raised the vast bulk of the points that came up yesterday at the public meeting.  I encourage the Minister of State again to take time out if he can and go to the launch of their report on  the physical, mental and psychological impact of caring.  It would be much appreciated and I look forward to working further with him on the issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900061#OOO00200"><p>I am delighted to be able to contribute to this debate.  I know how earnestly Deputy Finian McGrath views this topic as the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for disabilities.  The Department has a budget and he has to try to shoehorn as many things as he can into that budget but our job as Opposition spokespeople is to hold him to account in this particular position.</p>  <p>  I will make a number of general points on primary care.  One of the major health insurers operates what is known as Swiftcare, which has turned out to be a successful model in saving emergency departments in a number of Dublin hospitals in particular, and perhaps in other parts of the country, from even more overcrowding than they have because they are able to deal with injuries and issues that people often attend emergency departments with.  There was a cost for people who attended that but one could essentially be dealt with pretty expeditiously and certainly within an hour in most cases, which would be unheard of in an emergency department or emergency room, ER, setting.  The problem is that the health insurer has confined that facility to its policyholders.</p>  <p>  In the context of locating primary care centres in as many areas as possible, which I know is the ambition under the primary care strategy, there should be a Swiftcare dimension to this where minor traumas such as ankle twists could be treated.  VHI policyholders can go to Swiftcare in Dundrum if their kids have been injured in a football game on Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon and it is full with them at those times.  They do not end up waiting long periods in emergency departments dealing with minor traumas that could be dealt with in the community.  That is a model that needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  I refer to my experience as a public representative that goes back 20 years.  In the original local authority area that I represented for many years, which covered Rathfarnham, Templeogue and Knocklyon, the HSE made five or six valiant efforts by  to deliver primary care facilities.  It turned out that the least difficult challenge was securing planning from the local authority.  Some of the difficulties arose with attracting GPs to serve in the primary care centre when it was built.</p>  <p>  There was to be one in a particular locality close to me in Rathfarnham village.  Planning permission was granted and a lot of work had been done by the HSE to secure the medical personnel who were key to the success of that primary care centre if it took off.  When planning permission was granted and the project started to move forward apace, it is my understanding that the GPs withdrew for various different reasons.  I am sure they were some good reasons and the building became a preschool Montessori building and, therefore, Rathfarnham has no primary care centre.  There is a site at St. Augustine's in Ballyboden.  The primary care centre project has been going on there for eight or nine years at this stage and according to the latest parliamentary question responses I have received, it looks like we are looking at a public private partnership, PPP, leaseback arrangement between the HSE and some developer if it can get developers interested in the project because the HSE cannot afford to build the primary care centre.</p>  <p>  Elections are a good way of testing the pulse of people.  I often tell colleagues that in 2009 two issues simply were not emerging on the doors when I was canvassing in the local elections but by 2014 they had begun to spring up and have been growing exponentially.  One was autism, which featured to some degree on the doors in 2009 but since the 2014 local election campaign and up to now, one cannot go through a housing estate without meeting multiple examples of families concerned about autism and the spectrum of children with special needs and the need for their diagnosis.  This simply did not feature a decade ago.  The other issue is dementia.  Dementia did not feature as a need ten years ago when I knocked on doors.  Professor R&oacute;n&aacute;n Collins in University Hospital Tallaght has stated we need to prepare for a 20% dementia society.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State gets this but I must hold him to account for this and there is nothing more heartbreaking than meeting parents of children, whom they suspect have a special need, who need an assessment, who are going through the most vital development needs of their lives, physically, mentally and psychologically and who are on waiting lists for psychological assessment.  Some of the local centres are full and the lists are full but let us use the NTPF and give these parents a voucher in order that they can have the psychological assessment done privately by an approved HSE psychologist.  This would mean that they could begin to make preparations for their children and do what is necessary to ensure their children get the help that they need at the earliest stage possible and the interventions that could make that critical difference to their development, educational development and, ultimately, educational attainment.</p>  <p>  The same can be said for speech and language therapy and the Minister of State will have heard about if he was out and about during the recent local election campaign.  These vital interventions are required at the most vital developmental stages of a child's life.  The Minister of State will come back and say he has addressed this but I need to hold him to account on behalf of my constituents.  He is in government and in charge of the spread of resources.  There is nothing more heartbreaking than meeting parents at clinics who know that their child has a need, whose teachers have concerns, even in preschool stages, and they cannot get access to speech and language assessments or services because there simply are none.  The cost to the State of providing something such as a voucher system for these parents that would enable them to secure speech and language assistance privately would be minuscule because a large number of speech and language therapy professionals are available in the private sector.  As we speak the clock is ticking on so many of these children.</p>  <p>  Home care packages make such a difference, which colleagues which pointed out earlier.  Deputy O'Dea introduced a Bill last year in that regard.  It essentially provided for a fair deal at home scheme and, according to his costings, it would save the State 66% on each package.  Most families I encounter want to mind and care for their loved ones in the family home for as long as they can.  He estimated that the cost of a fair deal at home scheme would be one third of the cost of the existing fair deal scheme with all its complications where properties are left unoccupied in Dublin, in particular because of the sensitivities associated with selling a family property where a loved one is still alive who probably cherishes the possibility of returning home at some stage.</p><p> There is much to consider in respect of primary care.  I welcome the centres that have been rolled out in Tallaght and that form part of a campus in close proximity to the university hospital.  In burgeoning areas such as CityWest, however, where a massive amount of development has been undertaken, or Ballycullen, Knocklyon, Firhouse or Old Bawn, where much development has been planned, there is not a primary care centre to be seen, despite a population of thousands.  The population feeds into the university hospital in Tallaght and, as a result, the hospital is bursting at the seams.</p> <p> My statement on the issue mirrors those of some of my colleagues.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is doing his best.  The debate provides him with an opportunity to return to his Cabinet colleagues and say that Deputies raised many important issues in the House.  The Minister of State referred to money.  It is his responsibility to secure that money, while it is mine to hold him to account if he does not do so or if he does not provide the facilities my constituents need.  That is why I was elected.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900062#PPP00200"><p>I thank Deputies Smyth and Lahart for remaining until the end of the debate and their statements.  It is obvious we agree on the importance of primary and community care services and that we wish to see more care provided at home in local communities.  I accept there are gaps in the service delivery and that long waiting times for access to primary care therapy services are unacceptable.  We can and must do better.  We must develop a more comprehensive community and primary care system, while the vast bulk of health and social care services must be provided as locally as possible.  This will not only reduce the pressure on the hospital system but greatly improve patients' experience.  While implementing the change required to shift the focus of care from an acute community setting will not be easy and will take time, we must be careful to ensure the correct balance between the depth of service provision and the breadth of access, and must be realistic about the pressure that ever-increasing demand and the increased complexity of cases place on primary care services.</p>  <p>  Despite these challenges, the Government and I remain committed to the further development of services in the community.  In that regard, it is important to recognise what has been achieved.  In my constituency, there is an excellent primary care service in Cromcastle Road, Coolock.  I had the honour of opening that service last year and, therefore, thought it important to mention it in the debate.  Primary care centres are being delivered throughout the country, while increased investment supports service delivery and will allow for 170 primary care therapists and community nurses to be recruited in the second half of the year.  The strong focus of the interdisciplinary work of community health networks represents the next stage in the development of the sector.  I am confident that patients and clinicians will benefit from this improved model of working. </p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the issue of disability and I am delighted they did.  The HSE service plan for 2019 provides for &euro;1.904 billion in spending, or an increase of 7.5%.  To listen to some of the comments in the debate, one would believe that nothing has happened on the ground.  In the past three budgets, however, there has been an increase in the disability allowance of &euro;15 and the restoration of the respite care grant, which is now called the carer's grant, to 108,000 families, while 11,000 children in domiciliary care have been given medical cards.  I have been involved in the opening of 12 respite houses in 2018 and 2019.  With the support of the House, we have allocated an extra &euro;10 million for respite services.  I do not suggest we have everything we want but we have started the investment and reforms.  As I outlined, in recent weeks we have seen agreement on the revised GP contract , the publication of a new oral health policy and the implementation of measures to ease the burden of healthcare costs.  These are important developments for the health service, clearly signalling a direction of travel towards a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective system.  My focus is to build on the achievements to date in providing improved, faster and earlier access to services, as the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan sets out.  This will mean the following: reconfiguring health structures to deliver care based on the population size; expanding the workforce and infrastructure capacity to provide a comprehensive community based service, including prevention and well-being initiatives, diagnostic services and chronic disease management; and developing resources for primary care professionals, including the full utilisation of technology and e-health systems and the development of new funding models.</p>  <p>  I listened to the points made by Deputies Lahart and Smyth on the assessment of need and respite, an issue we have tried to resolve in recent weeks.  We are providing extra staff and resources but I accept the argument we must do something about the matter.  I ask for the Deputies' support as the next Estimates approach to deal with the issue.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say the journey of reform is truly under way.  Investment in primary care infrastructure and services represents the first step in creating a modern and improved health service to which we all aspire.  I emphasise that it is the first step but we have started with the reform and investment.  We need to do more and will do so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-05-29a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052900062#PPP00400"><p>We are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history.  The number of plants, insects, mammals and birds that are threatened or endangered grows every year, while the land, ocean and atmosphere are being altered to an unparalleled degree.  A few weeks ago, the United Nations' platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services published its global assessment report and advised that unless action is taken to reduce the intensity of drivers of biodiversity loss, there will be a further acceleration in the global rate of species' extinction, which is already at least tens or hundreds of times higher than it has averaged in the past 10 million years.</p>  <p>  It is not just over there in the Amazon basin or Borneo.  Although we cut down our forests centuries ago, biodiversity in Ireland still demonstrates worrying and ongoing declines.  There are five main drivers of biodiversity loss in Ireland, namely, intensive agricultural and forestry practices, overfishing, invasive species, changes in land use and the over-exploitation of resources such as peatland.  My Department reports every six years to the EU on the status of habitats and species protected by the EU habitats directive.  We recently submitted the draft report for the past six years and it shows that Irish habitats, especially the peatlands, grasslands and some of the marine habitats, remain under enormous pressure.</p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the decline of certain species such as birds including the curlew which used to breed in thousands throughout the bogs and wet grasslands of Ireland but is now reduced to perhaps 150 pairs.</p><p>I have also seen reports that insects are declining on a massive scale throughout Europe.  Insects are the most abundant terrestrial organisms on the planet and of paramount importance to the ecosystem services that sustain life on earth.  These are services such as pollination, natural pest control, nutrient recycling and decomposition services.  Of course, insects are also the main food for many fish, birds and mammals.  The occurrence and spread of invasive and non-native species in Ireland are also increasing for all environments.  All of this makes for very sobering and worrying reading.  To stop this decline we will need to increase our efforts significantly at all levels of society.  This is all the more pressing in the face of climate change.  A healthy, resilient environment is necessary to help us mitigate and adapt to its effects.  There are many positives and the national efforts the Government has led to conserve biodiversity are bearing fruit.  The Government is responding to the biodiversity emergency and the drivers of its loss and is making progress.</p> <p> The Department is working hard and achieving real results on a number of fronts, with the National Parks and Wildlife Service leading this work.  We have committed in Project Ireland 2040 to investing &euro;60 million to protect Ireland's natural heritage and biodiversity.  We are on our third national biodiversity action plan.  This speaks to the long running commitment the Government attaches to this issue.  The current plan runs from 2017 to 2021 and is the key national overarching policy for our work.  It sets out actions that a range of Government, civil and private sectors will undertake to achieve Ireland's vision for biodiversity, which is that biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society, and that Ireland contributes to efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems in the EU and globally.</p> <p> The Department has also initiated a round of consultations with all relevant Departments, agencies and State-owned companies, as well as farmers, landowners, other sectors and NGOs, to set out our priorities for action from 2021 to 2027.  We will be focusing on the habitats and species protected under EU directives and in the special areas of conservation, SACs, and the special protection areas, SPAs, designated under those directives.  The Department is also engaged in a very wide public consultation process on Heritage 2030, the strategy for all strands of heritage in the coming ten years.</p> <p> We have also undertaken a comprehensive range of meaningful and productive actions in recent years.  These actions are resulting in real progress to protect and restore the country&rsquo;s biodiversity.  Approximately 17% of the terrestrial area of Ireland now lies within the protected area network and we have accelerated the designation process.  We have invested a significant &euro;50 million since 2011 on a major restoration effort on raised bogs.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service's farm plan scheme has contributed to the conservation of protected species on agricultural land, for example, for the chough, corncrake, hen harrier, breeding and wintering geese and waders, and the natterjack toad.  We established the national curlew task force and an NPWS curlew conservation programme.  We are again recruiting specialist ecology staff and rangers for parks and reserves.</p> <p> The EU LIFE programme has been a major source of support that Ireland has accessed for the conservation, management and restoration of habitats.  These habitats, in turn, support threatened and protected species.  There are too many such projects to list them all but I will mention a few.  KerryLIFE is conserving the critically endangered freshwater pearl mussel through catchment-scale measures.  AranLlFE, which has just concluded, works closely with the farming community of the Aran Islands to improve the conservation status of more than 1,000 ha of farmland, comprising limestone pavement, orchid rich grasslands and machair.  The RaptorLIFE project is working to connect and restore habitats for the hen harrier, merlin, Atlantic salmon and brook lamprey.  The great benefit of these LIFE projects is that they provide some space in which to develop and strengthen working relationships with key stakeholders, including farmers and local communities, as well as academic or research institutions and other governmental bodies.</p> <p> We are developing the biodiversity sectoral climate change adaptation plan that places biodiversity at the heart of climate change solutions.  I am proud to say the Department held the inaugural national biodiversity conference in February.  It is a signifier of our leadership in the protection of biodiversity and collaborative work with the relevant stakeholders.  In the lead-up to the conference I encouraged sectors to contribute towards the seeds for nature campaign in an effort to step up and accelerate progress towards achieving the objectives of the national biodiversity action plan.  More than 40 notable advancements have been achieved through this campaign, including Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na making substantial commitments on restoring biodiversity in their landholdings.  This will achieve the rehabilitation of 20,000 ha of cutaway bog and 1,000 ha of raised bog by 2025 and the restoration of Hazelwood Forest, a 130 ha woodland in an SAC on the banks of Lough Gill.</p> <p> I am doubling the funding provided for local authorities in order that, with local communities, they can take local biodiversity action, including clearing invasive species.  We are establishing a business and biodiversity platform with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and a range of Irish businesses, including Gas Networks Ireland, EirGrid, Kepak, Dawn Meats, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p> The Government is creating a legal onus, or a biodiversity duty, on public bodies to have regard to policies, guidelines, and objectives to promote the conservation of biodiversity and the national biodiversity action plan.  We are funding research into the impact of climate change on biodiversity.  The Government is taking a co-ordinated approach and working with Departments to protect our biodiversity.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has achieved a great deal through work in that Department.  Through the GLAS scheme, he has improved habitat management and water quality on lands of conservation value on 50,000 Irish farms.  He has restored, preserved and enhanced biodiversity through 22 European innovation partnerships.  He is also restoring native woodland and converting conifers into native woodland through the native woodland scheme.  He is helping the recovery of commercial fish and shellfish stocks in the Celtic Sea.  He is also helping sea life nursery grounds through a ban on inshore trawling by large boats.</p> <p> Through the ObSERVE programme, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, is working with my Department to improve our knowledge of protected species, especially whales, dolphins and seabirds, and sensitive habitats.  I will continue to work closely with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as we prepare to implement the whole-of-Government climate action plan.  Many of the initiatives we will take on climate change will be of clear long-term benefit to biodiversity, and we must take great care to ensure there are no unintended negative effects on nature in the process.</p> <p> Even with all this good work, we will need to raise our game.  We need to ensure that we do not erode natural capital stock on which our well-being and the economy rely.  Some of the actions that need to be considered and resourced include management plans for all protected sites and their habitats and species, a conservation programme, particularly for grasslands, meadows, and in the uplands, building on the success of the Burren and Aran programmes-----</p></speech>

This will also contribute to our climate mitigation and adaptation targets, as will other conservation and restoration work on peatlands.  It would be good if we could have a rebooted programme to remove invasive species, in particular rhododendron and laurel, to improve the quality of woodland.  There is also a national native wildflower initiative, especially along transport corridors and in public spaces.  A transformational change is required to ensure our consumption patterns are truly sustainable.</p>  <p>  The Government acknowledges and understands the importance of Ireland's biodiversity and nature.  That is why we have invested significant resources in its protection.  It is why we have taken, and will continue to take, co-ordinated action throughout Departments to care for our habitats and species.  We have made meaningful progress and this should be recognised.  I will continue to work hard with my colleagues in government.</p></speech>

It was a Fianna F&aacute;il amendment that provided for the declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  Fianna F&aacute;il also called for the biodiversity crisis to be examined by the Citizens' Assembly.  We are committed to ensuring Ireland will do its collective fair share and meet legally binding environmental commitments at EU and UN level.  One could say this debate is timely, given the emergency in which the country finds itself and, perhaps, also given some of the results of last week's elections.  We should be honest.  There can be no backslapping.  This House should have addressed the issue much sooner and should regularly return to it, given that it affects so many aspects of our society and economy.</p><p>On biodiversity loss in Ireland, thanks to the tireless work of particular State agencies and environmental organisations, we have a clear picture of just how bleak is the situation.  Over one third of Ireland's wild bee species are threatened with extinction; over 90% of listed habitats in Ireland have a poor conservation status; two thirds of native birds are of conservation concern, with several threatened with extinction; water contamination caused by fertiliser and effluent is a regular occurrence, while fish stocks are over-exploited and marine mammals threatened.  I could go on.  It is obvious that there is a major mismatch between the Fine Gael Government marketing campaign of some green island dedicated to sustainability and the sad reality.  It is evident that the Government is leaving the country in a worse state for the next generation.  It is also evident that biodiversity protection is not prioritised in relevant Departments.</p><p>I appreciate that warnings of major biodiversity loss are nothing new in Ireland, but we are seeing a much greater focus on the crisis in the media, with Sir David Attenborough being the prime example.  This is welcome and must continue in the Irish media, but there are several NGOs and community groups across the country which have been sounding the alarm bells for years and are to be commended for their dedication and determination.  I am conscious that issues concerning biodiversity and species loss are often framed as niche, secondary concerns, perhaps matched, incorrectly, by the idea that wildlife may be declining is some isolated rural areas, but what does that have to do with me?  Many of us, especially those living in cities, only catch fleeting glimpses of the ecological breakdown such as fewer bees in our garden or the poor state of streams or beaches in our vicinity.  However, destruction of biodiversity does not only mean loss of species.  The public will suffer significant environmental, economic and health impacts of biodiversity loss and destruction of natural habitats.  Nature provides important services such as pollination, healthy soils for farming and reduced carbon emissions, all of which have real and tangible benefits for society and the economy.</p><p>The climate and biodiversity emergency has other negative impacts.  For example, plants and animals are becoming more susceptible to pests and diseases.  Air pollution has a health-related cost in Ireland of over &euro;2 billion per annum.  I am glad that we will have the opportunity to discuss the global assessment report tomorrow as it sets out necessary responses at international level.  It also notes that the main drivers of biodiversity loss stemming from human activities are over-expansion and intensification on land and in the seas; over-exploitation of organisms; the climate crisis; increasing pollution; and invasive alien species.  The landmark 2030 agenda for sustainable development agreed in 2015, thanks to successful negotiations led by Ireland, provides many of the solutions to combat these five drivers.  However, there is a complete mismatch between Ireland&rsquo;s foreign and domestic policies.  The Government, unlike many of our EU neighbours, has largely ignored the 17 sustainable development goals and the 169 targets which underpin the 2030 agenda.  We have a sustainable development goal implementation plan, but where are the departmental strategies?  Where are they included in the budget?  Where are they in policies on fisheries, forestry, agriculture and peatlands?  We have seen the tired approach of Departments which merely references and lists these goals and targets, including in the Government&rsquo;s national development plan and the national biodiversity action plan.  We have also heard that the commitments of Departments and State agencies in the national biodiversity action plan might look good on paper but that they go nowhere near far enough.  </p><p>The message for this House is that the Fine Gael Government has actively de-prioritised environmental protection and reduced investment where it is most needed.  State agencies responsible for biodiversity protection and conservation have suffered repeated budget cuts.  Funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Heritage Council has decreased by approximately 70% since the recession.  Much greater resources are needed in the National Biodiversity Data Centre which takes the lead in biodiversity monitoring.  I would like to able to say our problems are confined to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, but there is a dangerous situation at ministerial level in that environmental issues are of concern to no one and everyone; environmental policies and responsibilities are spread across several Departments, making it extremely challenging to track progress and ensure accountability.  Ultimately, there is a complete lack of coherence and no real sign of a concerted attempt to integrate biodiversity objectives into policy-making and planning.</p><p>When it comes to biodiversity concerns, the tagline of the Fine Gael Government looks like, &quot;Doing Nothing Is Still An Option&quot;.  Simply protecting the <i>status quo</i>does not align with the achievement of the sustainable development goals or the Paris Climate Agreement.  We cannot accept a business-as-usual approach that allows businesses and particular Departments to use sustainability as a buzzword and fail to prioritise or even track progress against the sustainable development goals.  Last but not least, when it comes to the climate and pollution, the Government's 2017 climate strategy was widely criticised by national and international authorities as lacking substantive measures and also any real commitment to implementation.  We have been waiting for years for the Government's clean air strategy to tackle air pollution.  What does a fair and improved response look like?  The Government must ensure enforcement of existing environmental laws and align policy implementation and planning with necessary progress in reaching the sustainable development goals.  It is also essential that we see significantly increased investment in habitat restoration.  The Government must restore budgetary allocations to relevant State agencies to pre-recession levels.  Where possible, we should increase conservation areas onshore and offshore.  There is also a need for consultation with communities from the get-go when all options are still open.  At departmental level, there is a need for a co-ordinated strategy which prioritises and integrates biodiversity objectives into policy decisions across relevant Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  This must include early and robust environmental impact assessments, as well as transparent sustainability analyses, with clear metrics.  There is a need for a coherent approach, not the piecemeal response which has been the hallmark of the Fine Gael Government in the past eight years.</p><p>I would like to discuss the link with climate action in a little more detail.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that biodiversity loss is an existential threat which is fundamentally linked with the climate crisis.  We cannot deal with the threats of runaway climate change and the loss of biodiversity in isolation.  We are also clear that when it comes to conserving our biodiversity, the exceptionalist approach of the Fine Gael Government to climate action must not be repeated.  We need to bring biodiversity front and centre in Departments and end the vague promises and window-dressing.  The Taoiseach stated in this House that the declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency was merely a symbolic gesture.  He failed to note that the declaration was part of a motion which endorsed immediate Government action in the form of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We simply cannot allow a short-sighted approach which might allow for business development in the short run but which actively ignores and hides the very real, negative, long-term impacts on our health and the economy, with younger generations bearing the brunt of the damage.  </p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes protecting nature and supporting habitats provide us with the best way of capturing carbon emissions.  It is particularly important that we adopt a radically reformed approach to forest management and peatlands, one of our most impactful and cost-effective measures.  The Government must prioritise the planting of native trees and the restoration and protection of peatlands as these responses can protect biodiversity and yield huge reductions in emissions as they act as carbon sinks.</p><p>The cross-party report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action includes a range of recommendations that will reduce emissions and will encourage a sustainable approach to agriculture, forestry and peatlands.  The Government has committed to the preparation of a national land use plan to set out different options, taking into account climate and environmental obligations, and sustainability for different types of production.</p> <p> While I acknowledge the Minister is concerned about this, I think substantial credit has to go to the youth of the country because it stood up to the Government, institutions and this Parliament to indicate that we are not doing enough and they cannot accept it or there will not be a planet for the next generation.</p></speech>

N&iacute; bheidh m&eacute; in ann fanacht don chuid eile den d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus t&aacute; orm deifir a dh&eacute;anamh leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; agam.  Biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate globally and Ireland is no exception.  I think that we all accept that and it is a pity that we did not accept it earlier.  We have been told that the decline has been more rapid in the last 50 years than ever before in human history.  Human activity is leading to increased extinction rates of both plant and wildlife species and it is imperative that restorative measures are put in place to mitigate the damage.  Ireland is not immune to the extinction rates in both plant and wildlife species.  We are poisoning and destroying many of our ecosystems.  We need to take urgent action and to invest to protect what remains of the ecosystems.  I heard the Minister talk earlier about the woodlands and what happened when the woods were cut down.  The old Irish poem "Caoineadh Cill Chais" comes to mind agus cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan an c&oacute;ras a chosna&iacute;onn muidne agus a chuid&iacute;onn linn bia agus sin a choth&uacute; sa domhain, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in d&uacute;inne ach do no hainmhithe, do no beithigh agus d&uacute;inn at&aacute; ag maireacht&aacute;il linn ar an oile&aacute;n agus sa domhain seo.  The air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat all rely on maintaining a diversity of native plant species and an abundance of native wildlife.  These species have survived, evolved and thrived slowly over thousands of years as species that are specifically adapted to our environment in Ireland.  The same is true of every country in the world.  We have different ecosystems.</p>  <p>  The rapid and unprecedented economic and climate changes ub the past five decades now threaten the resilience of many aquatic bird and plant species on which we rely for clean water, fresh air and food production.  From common or garden variety birds to raptors or birds of prey, from basking sea sharks to tiny plankton, from bumbling bees to annoying insects, we are entirely reliant on these species to aerate our soil, filter toxins from our water courses, pollinate our crops and prevent the spread of disease.  An abundance of native broadleaf forestry and hedgerows is essential to maintaining these habitats, while also being a valuable store for carbon emissions.  Biodiversity loss in Ireland is caused mainly by heavy use of pesticides, plastic ingestion, peat extraction, clearfelling of forestry, intensive agriculture, overfishing, toxic waste disposal and invasive species.  These are all contributing to the decimation of the building blocks upon which our very survival depends and we must bear some responsibility for the solutions.  The Government must take responsibility for implementing a regulatory framework to protect our most at-risk species.  Corporations must be compelled to change their environmentally damaging practices and citizens must be educated on the importance of changing their behaviour and sharing responsibility as custodians of our most fragile ecosystems.  I call on the Government to reorganise the Departments in order that biodiversity is transferred to a portfolio of environment, agriculture or climate change.  That is not a slight on the Minister or her officials but there is a logic in doing that in order that they are all connected.  I know heritage comes under the Minister's portfolio.  That mirrors a conversation that we had with committee members earlier.</p>  <p>  There are immediate steps that can be taken and the Minister has already mentioned some.  I believe they can be added to.  They include amending the Wildlife Act to include legal protections for marine life in line with protections for land-based animals and plants and reinstating Invasive Species Ireland, which was a joint project between the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the National Parks and Wildlife Service which ended in 2013, to the work of which I will come back.  They also include commissioning a completion of the light detection and ranging sensing technology, LiDAR, mapping survey piloted by Teagasc, which recorded partial regions of the country in order to gather the data required for the whole country; as well as directing that all local authority county hedgerow surveys include metrics for the recording of biomass in order to ascertain their carbon sequestration value.  They include updating the forestry blacklist of invasive species to include Sitka spruce, which has been blacklisted in most northern European countries.  For far too long, the burden of safeguarding Ireland's fragile ecosystems has fallen to enthusiastic voluntary bodies and the farmers who have, for generations, understood the need to protect the ecosystems in which they have grown their crops.  They have understood that they share and need to live in harmony.  We have seen a move in some farming practices which are at odds with protecting ecosystems.  We must remember that in many cases in Ireland, the primary protectors of ecosystems are the farmers who work the land.  Those communities and the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which have undertaken much of the work must be commended on it.  We owe a great deal of gratitude to many of the organisations and volunteers in those organisations who have in fact become trustees.  It is time to lift that burden and share responsibility across society.</p>  <p>  I was looking at invasive species earlier because it is one of the five drivers of the loss, which I think we can do much more about more quickly at a relatively small cost.  Invasive Species Ireland published a pamphlet outlining the list of invasive species in Ireland, what they are and what damage they are doing.  Most of the foreign species that come into Ireland, whether North American, from New Zealand or Japanese, have had a major detrimental effect.  We have heard of the rhododendron and how it has choked up must of the national parks.  Outside of that, we have seen what Japanese pondweed has done to some of the lakes.  The red squirrel has been virtually driven out of existence by the grey squirrel.  Giant hogweed and such are non-native species that are choking up our ecosystems.  I saw that the Minister mentioned additional money being given to the local authority but it is not enough.  Kerry County Council ate up that whole budget just trying to tackle the rhododendron in Killarney National Park, with work groups that travel into Killarney to try to help.  It is minuscule in comparison to what is needed for just that park alone.</p><p>We must ensure the invasive species are tackled quickly before they choke the life out of lakes and parks.  They also destroy many of the native species because they cannot grow under the carpet-like cover that is created by some of the plants.<br/><br/>I apologise that I will not be here for the end of the debate.  I will finish with the words of Joni Mitchell.  In a song she said:</p><blockquote>Hey farmer farmer<br /><br />Put away that DDT now<br /><br />Give me spots on my apples<br /><br />But leave me the birds and the bees<br /><br />Please!</blockquote><p>The words are still very true today, probably more so than it was in 1970 when she sang them.  I will not try to sing as I do not have a note in my head.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of all of the young people, but also every citizen.  We need to get real.  We need to invest a lot more money to save our native species but also to allow the planet to grow again, in our case, Ireland to grow again, in order that we can see native species in the future.</p></speech>

I have just come from the Phoenix Park special school where the pupils, teachers and staff have been involved in creating a very special garden, a sensory garden, which will allow the pupils to be in an outdoor classroom when the weather permits, and to be surrounded not just by the trees of the Phoenix Park but also appropriate planting of herbs and other sensory plants which attract the biodiversity we are discussing.</p>  <p>  There are a number of specific threats to biodiversity in Dublin.  The Government must respond to questions in that regard because the Minister, Deputy Madigan, is not responsible in ministerial terms for all of it.  There has been much debate in Dublin about BusConnects.  While the vast majority agree in principle with many of the elements of BusConnects, Dubliners cannot stand by in the face of a proposed Government plan to cut down hundreds of mature trees on some of the most beautiful roads and avenues in Dublin.  Trees are like natural vacuum cleaners in heavily polluted urban streets where there is a lot of traffic.  The Minister must speak to her Government colleagues, including her constituency colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We want better public transport and we want more buses, but we do not want to lose the trees that in many ways are the glory of many different roads in Dublin.</p>  <p>  Unlike in France, Germany and many other countries, when builders develop a site, not just in Dublin but in all the urban regions, they are like foresters, those who cut down the rainforest.  A clear-fell approach is taken on Irish building sites that one does not see in Germany, France or many other European countries.  Birds, insects and bats are targeted by developers to give them a clear-fell site.  That is a cultural change.  Many of my family are builders or are tradesmen in the building industry.  I know everybody wants a clean site to work on, just as a chef might need a clean table to prepare a meal.  I urge the Minister and the Government to get the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to amend the development and planning laws so that we respect the biodiversity and environmental heritage we have inherited in cities and towns and that we do not clear-fell all the trees on a building site.</p>  <p>  I am part of a group, the Fingal Walkers.  For those who do not know north County Dublin, it is a vast agricultural area where, piece by piece, the hedgerows over a short period have been cut down.  In this case the Minister must examine what farmers in effect are being paid to do, which is to make their farming more efficient.  Therefore they cut down or reduce hedgerows rather than having a policy which would acknowledge their critical role in looking after hedgerows which, essentially, in Ireland are vast ribbons of natural wildlife and biodiversity corridors.  Anyone from abroad who visits Ireland regularly remarks that as an aeroplane flies into Dublin Airport or Cork Airport, it can be seen that the blanket of green fields surrounded by hedgerows is gradually being stripped away.  That is because the farmers have been given an unpalatable alternative between reducing hedgerows and making their farming more efficient and the Government policy of supporting the retention of hedgerows.</p>  <p>  We have had a discussion on the disastrous fires that occurred over Easter in the Killarney region where many thousands of acres were destroyed.  The Minister indicated at the time that she had no idea who was responsible, but there is a lot of local knowledge and again it is about working out with the farming community and the landowners a system to provide for a safe approach so that valuable-----</p></speech>

On the Government's recent proposal on the Phoenix Park, which is where I started, because as a child I largely grew up in the park, it is probably bigger than most farms in Ireland.  I lived in an area that had no gardens but it was right beside the Phoenix Park and that was our natural playground.  The Government commissioned a review on the future uses of the Phoenix Park.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>It has acknowledged that the 200-page review cost approximately &euro;400,000.  We want the Phoenix Park, Dublin's green lung, to remain available as a major park for the people of Dublin and the citizens of Ireland.  We resent the idea presented in the report that there should be a development of retail in the park.  There are small artisan-type cafes there with local food producers which already provide for people's needs.  There is a really successful bike scheme in the park, run by a local provider.  Hundreds of young people, many of them visitors to Dublin, cycle through the park and really enjoy it.  The Minister's plans include more retail and the provision of a visitor experience for people from cruise ships.  I ask her to be careful not to destroy the thing that attracts the visitors from home and abroad in the first place.  She should err on the side of caution and consultation.  The report was launched just after St. Patrick's Day, and we were given two weeks to reply to it; it ran to 200 pages.  I raised the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW.  I am happy to say that just as the local elections were about to begin, the Taoiseach announced that the review period would be extended until the end of this week, 31 May.  That is welcome.  I made a modest proposal that the review would be made available in every public library in Dublin.  It would make sense to make it available in every library in Ireland, because the park is such a national treasure.  That was not done, which represents a failure of imagination.  If the Minister wants to save biodiversity, the Government probably needs to imagine what is necessary to do to preserve the variety of species of flora and fauna.  Unfortunately Ireland, like many other countries, is losing those species at a rapid rate.  That applies in towns and in the countryside.  </p> <p> I realise that when somebody like me, coming from Dublin, dares to stand up and speak, the gentlemen opposite find it really difficult.  I respect that they probably love the country as much as I do and they should be honourable in acknowledging this.</p></speech>

It is time to lead, to recognise and to stop the attitude of divide and conquer.  I represent a city and a rural area, and I have spoken repeatedly on the importance of balanced regional development.  I will speak very strongly on this topic and will not apologise for doing so.</p>  <p>  I welcome the speech the Minister made and the fact that she has set out some of the positive initiatives.  However, she states we have made meaningful progress, which should be recognised.  Of course, it should be recognised.  Looking at her first sentence, however, she makes it clear that we are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history.  This means that we must take unprecedented action.  </p>  <p>  I have spoken on the issue of climate change since the day I was elected.  I looked back recently on copies of various speeches I gave.  I spoke on climate change and the loss of biodiversity on 4 May 2016, shortly after I was elected.  I have continued to do so, speaking again on the issues in January 2017, April 2019 and more recently 9 May 2019.  I have picked out only a few of my speeches.  On 4 May 2016, I referred to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, known as the Rio convention, which was held back in 1992.  That is 27 years ago.  More recently we had the Paris Agreement, with its binding obligations, and the various reports and legislation we have introduced.  All the while the crisis has deepened.  We are now in receipt of the report under discussion tonight.  It is the most comprehensive report on the issue ever completed, compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over three years, with inputs from a further 310 contributing authors.  I do not often quote a priest in this Chamber, but I agree with Fr. Enda McDonagh when he said that we should have a requiem for the loss of animal species.</p>  <p>  I have read the summary of the report; the full report has not yet been published.  I ask the sceptical voices in this House to read the report and to come back to me and tell me what they disagree with.  The summary report runs to 39 pages.  It finds that approximately 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades.  This is a greater number than ever before in human history, and has been caused by human activities.  The average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%.  More than 40% of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals, and more than one third of all marine mammals are threatened.  Without drastic action to conserve habitats the rate of species extinction, already ten to hundreds of times higher than the average across the past 10 million years, will only increase.  </p>  <p>  According to the report, agricultural activities have had the largest impact on ecosystems that people depend on for food, clean water and a stable climate.  The loss of species and habitats poses as much of a danger to life on earth as does climate change.  I could go on, but I believe that we owe it to the children who have gone out on the streets in this country and throughout the world to show leadership and hope.  There is hope, but we have to take action.  The report specifically states that the biodiversity crisis can be reversed, but to do so will require proactive environmental policies, the sustainable production of food and other resources, and a concerted effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  It says that without transformative changes to the world's economic, social and political systems to address the crisis, major biodiversity losses will continue to 2050 and beyond.  We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, our livelihoods, food security, health and the quality of life world wide.  That has been reiterated by Social Justice Ireland, Enda McDonagh, who I have already quoted, and many organisations on the ground.  They refer also to policy incoherence.  I have used the phrase "cognitive dissonance" in this Chamber before and I am using it again now.  On the one hand, we have declared a climate emergency - one of only two countries to declare such an emergency - but, on the other, this is one of only two countries which will fail to meet their targets.  There is serious cognitive dissonance at play.  There is also policy incoherence in pursuing policies such as Food Harvest 2020 and Foodwise 2025, and the increase in emissions this will yield.  There is also a policy incoherence in continuing down the road of fossil fuels and issuing more licences for gas development.  We have to deal with that policy incoherence if we are seriously interested in dealing with biodiversity loss.</p><p>In Galway city, we have no biodiversity officer.  We talk about the importance of maintaining biodiversity and have biodiversity plans but we have nobody to implement them.  While I know the Minister is well intentioned, I do not think her response to this report is strong enough.  She quoted a few lines from it.  However, if she reads through it, she will realise we have to take the most serious and immediate action to deal with the loss of biodiversity.  We have to do it, not just for the planet or because it is the right thing to do, but because economically it is the best option.</p> <p> In a speech on 4 May 2016, I quoted Naomi Klein to much amusement.  I will repeat it tonight because it echoes what is said in the report in question.  She stated that if we stay on the road we are on, we face radical changes to our physical world.  We are talking about allowing sea levels to rise in the name of protecting an economic system that is failing the vast majority of the people on this planet, with or without climate change, global warming and the loss of biodiversity.  That warning was echoed in less dramatic language by the former Governor of the Central Bank in February this year when he warned that if the pace of transition to a low-carbon economy was too slow, a sharper adjustment would ultimately be required opposing macroeconomic and financial stability risks.</p> <p> On every single level we have been warned.  However, we are persisting with incoherent and contradictory policies.  The Government has a plan called Project Ireland 2040 with beautiful language in it about sustainable development.  However, if one looks at the detail of it, it refers to more roads which goes diametrically against what the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly called for, namely, a better proportion of investment in public transport, not roads.  I gave the specific example of Galway with its proposed ring road of between 16 km and 18 km at a cost of &euro;30 million per kilometre.  It must be the most expensive piece of road anywhere in the world.  It will only serve to extend linear development and be entirely out of sync with the Government's plans that further development in the cities will be within their footprint.</p> <p> The Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place and tonight she was given a list of the positive matters.  Will she reflect on these issues in the context of the unprecedented loss of biodiversity and unprecedented action that is necessary to tackle it?</p></speech>

Anything renewable or environmentally friendly will always be good but it must be practical for the people affected.  If not, the country will be designated with no place left for people.  Farmers must be compensated for land that is designated as a wild habitat.  Many farmers have no problem with that if they are properly compensated.  However, it must be remembered that lands in the Ballydesmond, Castleisland and Rock Chapel areas were designated for the hen harrier but the farmers and landowners affected have not been properly compensated to date.  I have told the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that there is no problem with the Department designating any lands for wildlife once the farmer or the landowner is properly compensated.</p>  <p>  A farm is a business and it is important ecologists understand this.  Terms like &ldquo;custodians and caretakers of the countryside&rdquo; can seem patronising when someone is running a business, raising a family and paying bills.  Instead, wildlife conservation on the land must make financial sense.</p>  <p>  Proper predator controls are not in place when dealing with grey crows, black crows, magpies, foxes, badgers, rats and hawks which will clean out ground-nesting birds.  As a result, we have lost the curlew and the corncrake.  In England they still have gamekeepers but in Ireland we do not have any.  I have been told that if we had enough gamekeepers, the corncrake and the curlew would still be plentiful in this country.  We know gamekeepers cost money.  It is fine to have all these ideas.  We all love the insects and the bees.  I do as much as anybody else and no one can take that from me.  However, one has to pay the landowners and farmers if their lands are going to be designated.</p></speech>
