The figure for 2020 will be &euro;5 million, or an increase of 6.7% on that of 2019.  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published ten-year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work.  The strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, the impact of the arts on the creative economy and the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.  The additional funding will allow the council to enhance its support for all artists and arts practices, including theatre.  The Abbey Theatre, the Gate Theatre and the Druid Theatre Company receive significant financial support from the Arts Council.</p>  <p>  The allocation to the Arts Council in 2020 should be considered in conjunction with the significant funding in 2020 of more than &euro;7 million from my Department to support the 2020 European City of Culture, Galway.  This is a significant sum to support artistic and creative activities in 2020.</p>  <p>  The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide, thus strengthening Ireland's cultural profile and global reputation.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government's international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant State agencies.</p>  <p>  Total funding for the arts and culture sector will increase by more than 2% in 2020, from &euro;189 million to just under &euro;193 million, comprising &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;39.7 million in capital.  My Department and I will continue to work with all my Government colleagues to deliver on the commitment to increase Government spending on arts and culture and double funding for the sector by 2025.  I am already delivering additional to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment in all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200003#A00800"><p>I appreciate what the Minister stated about the investment and the money spent on theatre.  Nevertheless, I am sure that she, too, read <i>The Irish Times </i>article by Peter Crawley at the weekend, in which he wrote about a crisis in the theatre world and dwindling opportunities for artists, who are being squeezed out of the frame by disappearing venues, rising rents and faltering subsidies.  In March 2019, Theatre Upstairs, a venue committed exclusively to new work, announced its closure after nine years, while at the end of November, the Collapsing Horse theatre company announced it was calling it a day, another great loss to Irish theatre.  In announcing its closure, Theatre Upstairs succinctly highlighted the importance of protecting theatre.  It stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It is unquantifiable to know what Irish Theatre would look like now without this seedbed for rising artists...  More artistic seedbeds need to exist in Ireland and they need to be supported.  Failure has to be allowed if success is to be achieved and it is not for audiences to tell us what they want to see, it is for us to create something that they can&rsquo;t even imagine.  </blockquote>  <p>The point is that we are losing our venues for new work.</p></speech>

There have been a number of initiatives over the past two years since I have been Minister to strengthen the sector, attempting in some way to bring forward new proposals and ideas.  Some examples include the launch of gender policies for ten of Ireland's most important theatre companies and an &euro;80 million redevelopment programme for the Abbey Theatre, for which I announced preliminary appraisal in September.  Importantly, in March 2018, I held an event with the theatre sector at the Irish Theatre Institute to launch Speak Up &amp;amp; Call it Out, which sought to establish a code of conduct to address the abuse of power in the Irish and international theatre sectors.  Furthermore, I spoke at the Youth at the Centre seminar on theatre, which was held in Blanchardstown.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200003#A01000"><p>It is not enough to support established theatre, that is, plays that we know will have commercial success and actors who we know will draw audiences because they are well known.  My point is about new works, and venues that provide new works and allow artists to investigate, explore and interrogate themes relevant to the Irish psyche and culture, and that allow experimental works to happen.  In the first instance, we must recognise the improvements of the financial circumstances of the Abbey Theatre.  Nevertheless, Irish artists should not be sidelined by our national theatre.  The Minister is acutely aware of the issues raised by theatre professionals in their open letter of 7 January 2019, in which the signatories criticised the production model of the Abbey Theatre and the over-reliance on staging co-productions, which has led to fewer actors being directly employed by the theatre and fewer in-house productions.  They stated that this had a knock-on effect throughout the theatre sector.  The issue was discussed at length at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but I hasten to add that, unfortunately, it seems the commitments made by the Abbey Theatre at the time to employ actors directly and to produce new works have not come to fruition.</p></speech>

The Arts Council supports and develops theatre in Ireland through grant funding, project awards and supports to individual artists, venues, publications and resource organisations.  This year, for the very first time, we have provided &euro;250,000 to amateur theatre, drama and musical societies in the budget.  Such funding has not been provided for more than ten years.  It will help new productions that have a gap in their Arts Council funding.  The capital culture scheme that has been launched is a capital scheme for arts venues.  It will enable them to expand and facilitate better projects into the future.  I have closely monitored the situation at the Abbey Theatre since the letter was originally sent to me in January.  I have been updated on all the discussions.  Considerable progress has been made, but some issues still need to be sorted out.  I will write to the Abbey Theatre, to the theatre practitioners and to the Writers Guild of Ireland to see if we can find a solution that is palatable for everybody.</p></speech>

Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is a statutory body under the aegis of my Department.  As such, it is obliged to observe the 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which requires such bodies to "serve the interests of Government as shareholder, the taxpayer, and all other stakeholders, and pursue value for money in their endeavours".  The council's obligations under the code of governance are encapsulated in an annual oversight agreement and an annual programme delivery agreement with the Department.  The oversight agreement and the delivery agreement are signed each year by the chair and the director, respectively.</p>  <p>  All of the Arts Council's expenditure is subject to value for money concerns.  This includes the cost of the premises occupied by the council.  It is incumbent on the council to keep expenditure on all outgoings under constant review to ensure best value for taxpayers' money.  If the business case for any decision on the Arts Council's accommodation has been properly prepared by the time it reaches the board, it will include at least three options.  It would be unrealistic and simplistic to assume that the decision revolves around the annual rent only.  A proper business case should cover all the costs arising over an extended period of up to several decades.  It would properly incorporate all costs including but not confined to rent, energy, insurance, repairs and maintenance, changes in regulations and service charges.  In addition, every State agency should have due regard to sustainability and accessibility.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council is a body corporate under section 8 of the Arts Act 2003.  It has the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and property with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance.  To date, the council has not applied for such consent.  I am confident that the Arts Council will comply with all requirements in appraising available options for its future accommodation needs.  If the council does not examine options for alternative accommodation when the opportunity presents itself, it will not meet its obligations under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p></speech>

According to the whistleblower in this instance, a business case has not been made.  Has a business case been presented to the Minister, or to officials in the Department, with regard to the Arts Council's move?  I have been told, subsequent to the protected disclosure being sent to the Minister, that this move is imminent.  I understand that the negotiations on the new property are at such a heightened stage that the leases are being drawn up.  Given that the new property seems to involve an increase of more than 30% in the annual rent, I suggest that this move is not as appropriate as it has been presented to the board of the Arts Council.  Has a business case been made?  If not, have the Minister and the Department instructed the Arts Council to prepare such a case before the attempt to move the council's head office goes any further?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200004#B00700"><p>I understand that a business case was presented to the Arts Council in September, following a discussion with the Department in August.  I think that answers the Deputy's question about the business case.  It is important to say that the Arts Council considers itself to be fully compliant with its governance procedures and statutory obligations under sections 8 and 9 of the Arts Act 2003, which relate to property acquisition and disposal.  When a decision to enter any new lease or purchase is agreed, the council will proceed to seek the consent of the Minister in accordance with section 8(3) of the 2003 Act before any new lease is signed or any future purchase options are proceeded with.  As I said, that consent has not yet been sought.  The Department has been aware of this matter for several months.  The Arts Council is required to examine its accommodation options to ensure the best value for money is obtained.  There are many complex issues to consider when such a decision is being made.  This decision will have an impact on the council for decades to come.  As I said earlier, it is not sufficient to compare annual rents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200004#B00800"><p>Basically, the Minister is saying that a business case to allow the Arts Council to purchase or lease another building has not come before her or before the Department in the appropriate format.  The council will not be fully compliant until a decision is made.  The Minister might decide in the future that the business case and the proposal are not fully compliant.  I ask her to look at the protected disclosure when she is considering this matter.  She should ask the Arts Council to make a full case that deals with the fact that it is in negotiations with the existing landlord on a further extension to the leasehold on No. 69 at the same time as it is negotiating the purchase of a new building.  As part of the negotiations with the landlord, consideration is being given to major alterations to the building to make it fully accessible.  That would be a much cheaper option for now and into the future.  Given the state of the finances, it would be better to spend money on the arts than on buying a building to house the Arts Council.</p></speech>

This issue was the subject of detailed discussions at five recent meetings of the council.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has been informed of these discussions.  Arts Council staff were briefed on them last week.  The Arts Council has been undertaking significant property searches since 2013.  It has viewed several options over the intervening years.  This process has identified four property options for the council.  First, it can extend the leases on Nos. 69 and 70 and the mews without taking any extra space.  As the Deputy will be aware, these properties are the subject of a rent review at present.  Second, it can extend the leases on Nos. 69 and 70 while taking the full building in the case of No. 69.  Third, it can lease a new building in a city centre location.  Fourth, it can purchase a new building in a city centre location.  As I have said, the Arts Council is in protracted lease renewal discussions with its current landlord.  The timing of this process has coincided with the recent identification of a new property option.  Unlike other options that have been explored in the past, this option substantially meets the existing and evolving needs of the Arts Council, particularly with regard to new policy areas that have been identified and prioritised by the council.  In June 2019, it was agreed that the Arts Council needs a public-facing, accessible, greener and more modern work environment.</p></speech>

This is a significant sum to support artistic and creative activities in 2020.</p> <p> The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide, thus strengthening Ireland's cultural profile and global reputation.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government's international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government agencies.</p> <p> Total funding for the arts and culture sector will increase by over 2% in 2020 from &euro;189 million to just under &euro;193 million composed of &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;39.7 million in capital.  My Department and I will continue to work with all my Government colleagues to deliver on the commitment to increase Government spending on arts and culture and double funding for the sector by 2025.  I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that only &euro;1.25 million of the increase is a new injection of money in that &euro;3.75 million, or three quarters of it, has been rejigged from one corner of the Department to another, in this case the Arts Council?  It is a sham, therefore, to speak of &euro;5 million in extra funding.</p>  <p>  Culture Ireland had funding of &euro;4.6 million last year.  Is it not the case that funding this year is &euro;4.1 million and has, therefore, been cut?  My question referred to the doubling of arts funding by 2025.  The Minister referred to a 2% increase this year.  Can she show us the roadmap for moving from funding of &euro;158 million in 2017, when the commitment was made, to &euro;316 million by 2025?  If she increases spending by 2% every year, it will fall a long way short.</p></speech>

That should be acknowledged.  The budget for the Arts Council increased by &euro;5 million to &euro;80 million, or 6.7%, in the budget and has increased by 23% since 2017.</p>  <p>  On Culture Ireland, we are still finalising figures for the Revised Estimates but I am confident funding for Culture Ireland will remain the same as it has been.</p>  <p>  On the trajectory for doubling funding to the arts sector, we are fully committed to doing this.  Funding for the arts stood at &euro;303 million in 2018, so doubling that figure by 2025 would mean increasing arts funding to &euro;606 million.  We increased funding to &euro;339 million and it will be &euro;354 million next year.  We are, therefore, consistently increasing funding.  There are still a few years to go to acknowledge and implement the commitment.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that is a stain on the record of her Department?  Last year, 75% of arts workers had an income of less than &euro;30,000, 64% or nearly two thirds had an income of less than &euro;20,000, and 39% or nearly two in five had an income of less than &euro;10,000.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that the Government is fully committed to doubling arts spending by 2025.  Does she accept that if she continues to increase arts spending at the current rate, she will come nowhere near doubling it by 2025?  Does she accept that substantial annual increases are needed to come anywhere close to the target?</p></speech>

The approach by Solidarity-People Before Profit to arts funding does not make sense because it wants to increase funding for the arts by &euro;100 million in 2020, while also seeking to abolish the universal social charge and local property tax.  That does not add up.  I am acutely aware of the decades long difficulties faced by those who wish to engage in artistic pursuits.  For this reason, I brought in new initiatives this year.  For example, I extended the jobseeker's allowance under the social welfare scheme for artists and others who were previously unable to avail of it.  This will allow them to continue with their work without being penalised or subject to the normal labour activation measures.  I also expanded the bands that apply under the percent for art scheme to give more work to artists.  Spending on artists has never been as high.  We are, however, conscious of the issues facing artists and we are always trying to find new ways to support them.</p></speech>

My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare.  While the regulation of hare coursing is not under my statutory control, licences are required by the Irish Coursing Club under the terms of the Wildlife Acts on behalf of its affiliated clubs to facilitate the netting and tagging of hares for closed park meetings.  The annual licence to capture and tag hares for the 2019-20 coursing season was issued by my Department on 9 August this year.  The licences granted by my Department in such instances include a range of conditions in relation to coursing hares which are designed to provide as much protection as possible to the conservation status of the hare.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that the RHD2 virus, which affects both rabbits and hares, was discovered in a number of rabbits and hares around the country during the summer.  Based on these results RHD2 appeared at the time to be widespread in Ireland.  The scientific advice available to me following the issuing of the annual licences indicated at that point that the virus was highly contagious and easily spread.  In these circumstances, given my responsibility in relation to the conservation status of the Irish hare, I decided to suspend the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club on 9 August until we had a clearer understanding of the extent, spread and implications of the RHD2 virus.  In mid-October, I issued revised and restricted licences to the Irish Coursing Club last month to allow the netting and tagging of hares but there are specific limitations and strict conditions attached to the issue of those licences.  The Deputy tabled a Topical Issue matter on this subject and in my response, I reiterated the details regarding those trials and how we are conducting them. </p></speech>

The RHD2 virus was not considered enough of a threat to ban live hare coursing, although it should have been, as should the well documented injuries to hares that occur before and during coursing.</p> <p>The practice is banned in almost every advanced country in the world, with only three allowing it.  All of that should have been enough to ensure a ban on live hare coursing, yet it continues to be permitted.</p> <p> My question relates to the finding in a recent RED C poll that 77% of Irish citizens want to see an end to live hare coursing, with only 9% supporting its continuation.  In addition, there has been extensive correspondence to the Minister's office, which was released via a freedom of information request, indicating overwhelming support for a ban on live hare coursing.  Coursing involves the blooding of the greyhound.  Otherwise, why would such a gentle animal chase a hare with such ferocity?  There have been convictions for illegal hunting of hares, including two in Offaly some months ago, and we know what happened on Whiddy Island.  It is time up to stand up to the 9% minority on this matter.  If no licences are issued by the Minister, then there can be no live hare coursing.</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that polls commissioned by an organisation usually reflect the views of that organisation.  I appreciate the Deputy's concerns.  I must ensure that there is a balanced response from the Government to this issue, but the protection and conservation of the hare is my primary concern.  The strict conditions we have set down should assuage the Deputy's concerns somewhat.  The Irish Coursing Club vet has to certify in writing that all the captured hares are healthy.  The number of courses will be reduced proportionately, as will the numbers of hares that can be coursed.  The ongoing trials and field tests should give us a clearer picture as to the status and condition of hares and rabbits.  It is important to note that no new hares have tested positive for RHD2 since the beginning of October.</p></speech>

We are told that live hare coursing is important for the rural economy, but I do not accept that.  Before the American Civil War, the southern states argued that ending the slave trade would affect their rural economy.  Banning live hare coursing will not damage the rural economy in this country because there is a viable alternative available in drag coursing.  If the greyhounds will pursue a mechanical lure in racing, why cannot the same be tried in coursing, instead of causing pain and harm to timid wild hares?  My late colleague, former Deputy Tony Gregory, observed in March 1996, "The only way to eliminate the cruelty is to have drag coursing where there is no live bait used."  We must take a responsible attitude to the sensitivity of animals.  This is a debate about cruelty versus compassion and I am asking the Minister to consider setting up a working group to look at the alternatives.  Those alternatives are being used in other countries and are proving viable and lucrative for local economies.</p></speech>

In addition to the 29 conditions that are associated with the licence in general terms, we now have the other conditions which I set out.  Field tests are ongoing in Limerick, Tipperary, Cork and Cavan town and will take some ten weeks to conclude.  It was important to have the involvement of the Irish Coursing Club and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in those trials.  I am satisfied with the procedures for swabbing, tagging and microchipping and that the certification is done in writing.  We are constantly monitoring the situation and my door is always open to people on both sides of the argument with a view to finding a solution.</p></speech>

Under project Ireland 2040, &euro;1.188 million in capital expenditure has been allocated to my Department.  Of this, &euro;460 million has been allocated to the redevelopment of our national cultural institutions.  Progress has been made in delivery of this ambitious investment programme.  Already this year my Department has supported the completion of the first phase of the redevelopment of the National Library of Ireland.  The second phase will continue in 2020.  In partnership with the Office of Public Works, OPW, the planning phase of the National Archives of Ireland project has also been completed.  This will see the capacity of the institution increase significantly as well as meeting modern archival standards.  In 2020 the tender will be awarded for the construction elements of this project.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing with the other national cultural institutions and the Office of Public Works to progress the other projects included in the investment programme.  These are currently being appraised and planned in accordance with the requirements of the public spending code.  In 2019 I approved several preliminary appraisals for these projects and it is my intention to see these projects complete the business case phase in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department is also investing &euro;265 million in culture and creativity.  September 2019 saw the launch of a significant programme of events under our Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture programme.  Another flagship project within this investment strand is the Beyond 2022 project, which I launched with An Taoiseach last week and which will see the important records of the 1922 Public Records Office digitally recreated.  My Department is also delivering several regionally-focused investment schemes to enhance cultural facilities across the country. </p>  <p>  As part of our &euro;285 million heritage investment programme, 2019 has seen my Department support a wide range of important built heritage restoration and maintenance projects across the country under both the historic structures fund and the built heritage investment scheme.  We will continue these vital supports in 2020.  Just last month I announced total funding of up to &euro;4.3 million for the coming year. </p>  <p>  Regarding natural heritage, my Department is progressing a broad range of projects and programmes which protect our unique landscapes and enhance all our well-being through our national parks and nature reserves.  This year saw a significant programme of trails upgrades across this network.  We will continue and expand this programme to further enhance our visitor facilities in 2020.  In line with this Government's commitment to climate action, my Department is also working towards a major expansion of our peatlands restoration programme in 2020 and beyond.  We are also working with the Heritage Council, Waterways Ireland, Screen Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities on a broad range of projects, programmes and schemes to enhance our culture and heritage.</p></speech>

By way of a supplementary question I would like to ask the extent to which she and her Department monitor the various projects with a view to maximising their impact and appeal from the points of view of tourism, education, school tours and instilling in the new generation the importance of relating to their history and heritage.</p></speech>

They are constantly monitored to ensure that we are providing adequate facilities, that we are ahead of our game and that we are in touch with what tourists want to see and enjoy.  There have been some interesting projects in Kildare in the last several years as part of the built heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund.  Applications can be made under the new schemes for Kildare no later than 31 January in the case of the built heritage investment scheme and 14 February 2020 in the case of the historic structures fund.</p></speech>

The local authorities are closely involved with the Department's work and receive funding for heritage and cultural projects which can be applied for under various schemes.  We will be funding up to 500 projects under the built heritage investment scheme, which is currently open for applications through the local authorities.  We are also funding heritage-led regeneration projects, which will benefit six other towns under the historic towns initiative.  This will be done in collaboration with the Heritage Council.  That is also currently open for applications.</p><p>Next year we will publish the new national heritage plan.  We will hold a heritage forum in Dublin Castle in May 2020.  We will run a public consultation process for a new national policy on architecture in early 2020 and progress the drafting of this policy by the year's end.  We will also progress objectives on the climate change adaptation sectoral plan for built and archaeological heritage.  It is of supreme importance that we protect what is already <i>in situ </i>and under our control for future generations.  We will obviously support the OPW in conservation projects around our national monuments and historic properties.  We will also publish two more surveys as part of the national inventory of architectural heritage, Dublin phase 15 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown phase 4.</p></speech>

On 14 November, I launched the 2020 BHIS and the HSF and announced combined funding of almost &euro;4.3 million.</p>  <p>  Applications under the BHIS are assessed by the local authorities and awarded funding with the approval of my Department.  Kildare County Council has been allocated &euro;79,000 under the 2020 BHIS, the same amount as was allocated and drawn down in 2019.</p>  <p>  There is no specific county allocation for the HSF.  Applications are short-listed by local authorities and then assessed by a panel of experts, including officials of my Department.  In 2019, three projects were put forward to the Department for consideration.  Following assessment, one project, Newbridge College clock tower, Junior House, was approved, to the value of &euro;25,000.  This has been drawn down.</p>  <p>  Both the BHIS and the HSF are administered by the local authorities and are now open for applications until 31 January 2020.  Full details of the schemes are on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  On 28 November, I announced funding of &euro;1 million for the historic towns initiative, which my Department runs in conjunction with the Heritage Council.  The initiative is a fund for the heritage-led regeneration of historic towns with an indicative minimum population of 1,500.  This initiative is now open for applications and would, of course, include many Kildare towns.  Projects under the historic towns initiative vary greatly from town to town but have to date included the upgrading of historic shop fronts as well as the regeneration of built heritage sites.</p></speech>

We are also fund up to 500 projects under the built heritage grant scheme, which will be open through the local authorities in 2020.  In addition, we will publish the national heritage plan and hold a heritage forum in Dublin Castle.  We will continue to support the Office of Public Work, with which we work closely in tandem in respect of conservation projects at our national monuments and historical properties.  Blueways are of great interest in County Kildare, in particular the Barrow blueway, which will be funded and will bring significant economic and social benefits to the county.  There is much support in Kildare for the project and we are very pleased to bring it forward under the remit of Waterways Ireland.</p></speech>

This figure does not include the social media costs for the promotion of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, for which a detailed breakdown is not yet available.  The Creative Ireland programme, with which Deputy Smyth is familiar, is a culture-based programme designed to promote individual, community and national well-being.  The vision of the programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise his or her full creative potential.  As such, a comprehensive and multi-platform information and citizen engagement campaign is in place to build awareness and understanding of the programme's aims and objectives.  These are to enable the creative potential of every child; enable creativity in every community; invest in our creative and cultural infrastructure; and develop Ireland as a centre of creative excellence and as a creative and cultural nation.  We also want to encourage participation in cultural and creative activities, with a particular focus on Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a festival for children and young people, which was held in June this year, as well as to support, enable and achieve maximum citizen engagement.  To do this, it is essential for the programme to use a diverse range of communication channels and platforms to inform, encourage and promote participation in creative activities, as these are vital to our individual and societal well-being.</p>  <p>  Expenditure in 2019 to date included &euro;76,506 for social media content, including research, image sourcing, short films and scheduling of social media posts.  Under Global Ireland 2025, the Government's strategy to increase the impact of Ireland's global footprint, a conference was organised by Culture Ireland on 24 January 2019 to explore how best to promote Ireland's culture worldwide.</p></speech>

I have no doubt the figure for promotion by the Department using social media will exceed &euro;100,000.  It goes without saying that social media has an important role to play in highlighting the cultural, creative and artistic heritage activities taking place throughout the country.  We all know and accept that.  There has, however, been controversy regarding how much the Department is spending on social media, particularly during the first year of the Creative Ireland programme.  I have been at the roadshows, which place great emphasis on media, digital media and filming.  I question that.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to give us a breakdown of the spending and to what exactly what it relates.  I have received information in respect of spending through a request under the Freedom of Information Act, and the table provided to me shows that, from January to July 2019, bigO media provided social media services and was paid an average of more than &euro;6,000 per month.  Thereafter, TWB provided social media services to the Department and was paid an average of more than &euro;8,000 per month.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but these payments seem to be for the operation of the Department's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.  Do these costs include the promotion of social media content?</p></speech>

This is separate from the work undertaken by Creative Ireland and Culture Ireland.  Returning to Deputy Smyth's comment regarding Creative Ireland, more money was spent in the first year to create awareness of Creative Ireland in general.  However, spending has tapered off significantly since then.</p>  <p>  On the Department's social media use, greater use is being made of the Department's Twitter account, which has grown strongly, with 8,346 followers at the end of November.  A Facebook account was launched in mid-May of this year and has 2,368 followers.  The Department also has an Instagram account, which was launched in mid-May and now has 1,521 followers.  These accounts have been developed at no cost.  The social media presence and its management are undertaken by the Department's in-house communications and press office team, which has five staff who also look after the traditional press office duties.  Content is also supplied by staff across the Department who are engaged in the day-to-day work of the culture, heritage and Gaeltacht divisions.</p></speech>

If we look at the social media output of the Department in November, Instagram had four posts, Twitter had 15 tweets, 11 retweets and one comment, six replies to tweets and seven retweets.  There were five posts on Facebook from original content and two posts highlighting articles.  That is a small number of posts and a low level of activity for one month.  I have no doubt that a professional level of skill is needed for creating online content.  I have my own Twitter and Facebook accounts.  The Department should undertake these activities in-house and should not need outside companies.  I ask the Minister to comment.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, these accounts have been developed at no cost.  The social media presence and its management are undertaken by the Department's in-house communications and press office team of five staff.  They also look after the traditional press office duties.  Regarding social media, I am not an expert, although I have someone separately in my own sphere who does my social media, but the issue is quality not quantity.  Stating how many posts there have been is not relevant to engagement or reach.  It is always about quality and not just constantly putting up different posts.</p>  <p>  The use of social media, however, is of importance to the Department given the nature of its work.  The mission of the Department is to promote, nurture and develop Ireland's arts, culture and heritage, to support and promote the use of the Irish language and to facilitate the development of the Gaeltacht and the islands.  Social media gives us an opportunity to offer a unique window into the richness and variety of our culture and gives easy access to information on galleries, museums and events taking place locally.  On heritage, social media helps to give the public knowledge and opportunities to experience our nature parks and our nature resources and waterways.  It also builds awareness and knowledge of our national heritage and biodiversity and raises the appreciation of the Irish language. </p></speech>

In 1996, the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Michael D. Higgins, signed into law the designation of bogs which led to the ban on turf cutting.  Some 23 years later, only 9% of those who sought to be relocated have been relocated.  A massive 70% of those turf cutters who sought relocation are still without any plan to provide them with an alternative turf bank.</p></reply>

It was extended in 2014 to include natural heritage areas.  This scheme is applicable to turf cutters who have been affected by the designation of raised bogs as special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas and who fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme.  It comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a legal agreement payment of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  Up to 2,569 applicants are regularly receiving compensation under the scheme.  Of these, 263 have applied for and are awaiting relocation to a non-designated bog.  The relocation of turf cutters to a non-designated bog is not always straightforward.  Notwithstanding this, progress in relocation has been achieved in several cases.  Some 72 turf cutters from 11 different raised bog designated areas have been relocated to non-designated bogs.  A further four relocation sites in counties Galway, Roscommon and Westmeath which could accommodate up to 55 turf cutters have been developed by the Department.  These are due to be operational from 2020.  Relocation sites for a further six special areas of conservation have been identified by the Department and are at various stages of development.  These could accommodate a further 50 turf cutters.  All of these sites together could accommodate almost 180 of the 263 cutters who expressed a relocation interest.  The Department is still investigating suitable relocation sites for seven raised bog special areas of conservation.</p>  <p>  In addition, within the framework of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, the Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the habitats directive to provide for turf cutting in certain areas of raised bog special areas of conservation.  Some 14 sites are under consideration for the possible application of Article 6 of the directive.</p></speech>

This is the first test of the just transition programme.  At the formation of the Government in May 2016, 68 turf cutters were being accommodated with alternative sites.  To date, 72 have been relocated.  That is one turf cutter for every year since the Government was formed.  Does the Minister believe it is good enough that only four additional families have been relocated over the past four years?</p></speech>

He is familiar with it from his former ministerial portfolio.  As part of this programme, on Monday, 11 November, I visited the midlands and met stakeholders, together with the Deputy and the Acting Chairman.</p>  <p>  Under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, 150 qualifying applicants from counties Galway and Roscommon have applied for relocation to a non-designated bog within medium range.  Up to 37 applicants from designated sites in these two counties have been relocated.  One of the designated sites straddles counties Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon.  In addition, a further three relocation sites for qualified applications from designated sites in counties Galway and Roscommon, which would accommodate up to 35 turf cutters, have been developed by the Department and are scheduled to be operational from next year.</p></speech>

That is because of the failure to deliver on relocation alternatives for people.  The result for those people is that they are now being penalised by the State.  The State has failed to provide an alternative site.  Now, it deducts from their compensation payment the cost of the turf delivered to them already.  I believe that is wrong.  Will the Minister treat these people fairly and pay them their just and fair compensation without any deductions?  It might take some of the pressure off the relocation needed across this country.</p></speech>

Of the 2,569 applicants regularly receiving annual payments under the scheme, 263 have applied for relocation to a non-designated bog.  There are other affected turf cutters who may qualify under the scheme but have not yet applied.

The national restoration programme for Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is contained within this plan.  It was intended to restore all designated raised bogs within three cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.</p>  <p>  This programme can now be accelerated due to the announcement in budget 2020 of &euro;5 million for peatlands restoration.  This funding will allow for restoration measures to be undertaken on approximately 1,800 ha in 2020 on up to nine raised bog designated sites across seven counties and the installation of an eddy covariance flux tower on a representative bog to directly observe the exchanges of gas, energy, and momentum between the ecosystem and the atmosphere.  The flux tower will directly measure the carbon, water, and heat flows between plant communities and the atmosphere.</p>  <p>  Some 23 other raised bog designated sites have been identified for restoration works over the next number of years under the programme.  Restoration plans for each of the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation have been drafted to be developed further in partnership with stakeholders including landowners and local communities.  Site-specific restorations plans for the raised bog natural heritage areas are currently being developed by the Department using the most up-to-date scientific methodologies available and best practice models gained from other restoration projects.</p>  <p>  I was in the midlands on 11 November, as was said earlier.  We hope there will be 100 jobs created there.  This has gone out to tender.  There will be jobs like tree felling and scrub clearance, as well as for machine operators, engineers, hydrologists, ecologists and dam installers.  Some of these are non-technical jobs for people who are not trained in those areas.</p></speech>

Jack Downey, Johnny's son, was 19.  He was an accounting student.  His father said he loved GAA and he loved life.  He was not a drug taker; indeed, his father said he would not even take an Anadin.  One day last August he left home at 10.30 a.m. and at 9 p.m. Johnny and Elaine received a phone call that Jack had been admitted to Cork University Hospital.</p>  <p>  When Jack was leaving that morning, his father told him to be careful and he responded, "Ah sure, I was there last year.  I'll be fine."  It was only his second concert.  He made one mistake and the consequences were absolutely catastrophic.  His death has had a profound effect on his family and his community.  Johnny spoke this morning about something we need to ask people to do this Christmas: parents need have the conversation about drugs with their teenage children.  I know it will be a very difficult conversation for some parents to have.  It would be much more difficult to get the phone call that Johnny and Elaine got on that Friday evening about their beloved Jack.</p>  <p>  Taking a chance cost Jack his life.  What Johnny and Elaine want - what we all want - is that there be no more Jacks and that nobody else has to walk the walk that they are walking at the moment.  It must have taken enormous courage for Johnny to do that interview with Tommy Meskill this morning.  He is not looking for attention or glory; he just wants parents to have that conversation.  It has never been as important to have that conversation.</p>  <p>  Health Research Board, HRB, figures for drug-related deaths in Ireland in 2017 show that more than one person a day is dying related to drugs.  Deputy Curran has highlighted this issue for many years and the position is getting worse.  The availability and potency of drugs is getting worse.  It is no longer just a city issue; it is in every community.  The Government is not responding and there is legislative inaction.</p>  <p>  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that we need to review the licensing of concerts to ensure that those who promote concerts are made to take responsibility for illegal drug availability at those concerts?  Just as they must take responsibility for security and alcohol, is it not time to clamp down on drug availability at concerts?</p>  <p>  Given those HRB figures, the increasing availability of drugs in our communities and the involvement of children as young as ten selling drugs, is the Government losing the fight against drugs?</p></speech>

I did not hear this morning's interview, but I am sure it was heartbreaking.  Any parent's worst nightmare is for a child not to come home in those circumstances.  The Government absolutely recognises that we have a major challenge, as so many other countries have, to respond in a substantive way to drug use.  The number of deaths linked to cocaine use and poisoning has increased, as has the number linked to the use of heroin and other drugs, sometimes prescription drugs.  Alcohol is also a significant killer.</p>  <p>  We have a comprehensive national drugs strategy.  It is broken into various elements, including promoting health and well-being.  The Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE are involved.  From a policing perspective the issues the Deputy has raised are pertinent.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is active in this area.  We have increased its capacity in terms of drugs response and we have increased garda numbers.</p>  <p>  Having said that, particularly those of us living outside Dublin will have seen an increase in the availability of illegal drugs on the streets of our cities and towns.  The Government is constantly looking to improve the response on that.  </p>  <p>  I can speak to the Minister responsible and come back to the Deputy on concert licensing.  That can be looked at if the Deputy believes it would be helpful.  We need to give a very clear message to parents and families that the Government wants to support them.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, we need to be tough on crime and also tough on the causes of crime in terms of the illegal drugs trade.  We also need to raise awareness more effectively than we have been able to do among young people of the dangers of illegal drug use, given the tragedy that so many families have faced not just in 2017, but also in 2018, for which we do not yet have figures.</p></speech>

A total of 786 people died from drug related deaths in 2017.  Those are the ones that are registered and that we know about.  It is essential for the Government to strengthen the legislation on the availability of drugs at concerts and large gatherings.  Promoters are making considerable money on these concerts and it is time for them to know there are consequences and to accept responsibility for those consequences.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned those of us living outside Dublin.  Senior garda&iacute; are saying we risk losing an entire generation unless we get to grips with the drugs problem.  The slogans are all very welcome, but we need action on the ground, including extra garda&iacute; in the drugs units.  Mayo, one of the biggest counties in the country, has only five garda&iacute; in the drugs unit.  More resources need to be put in there.  The Government is diminishing the incredibly important work of our regional drugs and alcohol task forces.  They have not been given sufficient budgets.  The proposal on the table is that they be recentralised, meaning that their reach into communities will be weakened.  We never needed them more in communities than we do now.  They need to be properly resourced and given the powers to do what the T&aacute;naiste mentioned: building awareness and giving warnings in communities.</p>  <p>  It is time for the Government to get serious about drugs.  It is time for the Government to take it on and give it the attention it needs, and not lose a generation.</p></speech>

These are difficult challenges the Government is determined to take on.  We are also providing extra healthcare drug-treatment opportunities for people trying to wean themselves off addiction.  That is what we are doing at that end of the spectrum.</p>  <p>  On the recreational side, which in some ways is an inappropriate description of drug use in night clubs, parties, concerts and so on, we have put many extra resources into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area.  The Garda has implemented the national drugs strategy training programme for members of the force working in drug units within communities.</p> <p>They have trained 60 extra Garda members since the programme commenced, which only commenced last year.  From a policing perspective and from an awareness, health and addiction management perspective we are putting significant resources into the different elements of this problem, which are complex.</p></speech>

Two of these scratch card games, each called "Congratulations" and sold at &euro;5 per card, were missing three of the top prizes, each worth &euro;50,000.  The other game was missing a top prize worth &euro;30,000.  This is a total of four jackpot prizes missing in three games, games that have resulted in scratch card sales of more than &euro;20 million for that company.  It has also emerged that one of these games was left on sale for six weeks after the issue became known to the operator and the company.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear that I have nothing against the lottery.  I play the lottery in the knowledge that many of the proceeds go into charitable causes and community projects, which is very welcome.  I also do it in the knowledge that the lottery is a form of gambling that requires proper regulation and robust legislation to underpin it.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that it is very hard to believe that three games operated by Premier Lotteries Ireland had four jackpot prizes missing and that this was due to human error or some improbable misfortune.  In one of these games, the number of prizes was designed to be no less than 976,500.  The probability that out of all those prizes it was the jackpot prize that would be missing is nearly one in one million.  The probability that out of all the prizes four jackpot prizes across three games would be missing, involves a lot of zeros.  The probability is one in 25 million billion.  The numbers simply do not stack up and serious questions need to be answered by Premier Lotteries Ireland, by the Regulator of the National Lottery and by the Government.</p>  <p>  The national lottery was privatised in 2014 by Fine Gael and the Labour Party at a price of &euro;400 million.  We were told that the licence was sold to pay for the national children's hospital among many other capital projects, some of which we still wait to see.  We now know that this price will not even cover a fraction of the cost of the national children's hospital.  Since the private operator was given the license, the number of retail outlets where games are sold has escalated beyond any expected proportions.   There are now more than 2,000 further retail outlets, which is an increase of 56% since it was privatised.  Unclaimed prizes are pumped into advertising and promotion instead of going to charitable causes where they should be going.  We can see this in relation to the numbers of shops and games.</p>  <p>  Those who buy a scratch card or lottery ticket do not do so in the hope of winning the &euro;3 or &euro;5 prizes.   They do it to win the biggest prize.  A private operator, however, that deals in odds every day, managed to leave out the four top prizes, against astronomical odds.  The legislation around this is completely flawed.  This private operator writes its own code of conduct and sends it to the regulator for approval.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty is not the only Member to raise it.  Deputy Michael McGrath has also raised the matter.</p>  <p>  For the record I will outline how this works.  The operator of the national lottery, Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, has found that four top prizes were not included for players to win in three of the 178 scratch card games it has offered since taking over the licence in 2014.  The four prizes together are worth &euro;180,000 and represent some 1.36% of total prize funds of those three scratch card games.  These omissions were discovered through an internal review of all national lottery products over the last six weeks, and we are told they were cause by human error.  Lotto, Euro Millions, Daily Millions, digital games and all other national lottery products were unaffected by these errors.  The Regulator of the National Lottery was promptly notified of the review and has been updated regularly since.</p>  <p>  There are real questions to answer here and the Deputy has pointed to some of them.  At a minimum, the regulator and the operator should come before an Oireachtas committee to explain what has happened.  I am certainly not against the idea of an independent investigation with regard to how this could have happened.  The integrity of the lottery system is hugely important given how valuable it is to the many good causes it funds.</p>  <p>  The Government has an open mind around getting to the bottom of what actually happened in this case.  I do not believe it is acceptable to simply dismiss this as human error at some point in the management chain.  We are certainly open to what the Deputy has called for.  The Government, however, needs to have a fuller understanding of the appropriate course of action to get to the detail of what went wrong to ensure the public can have full confidence in the lottery system that so many people play on a daily and weekly basis. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200013#L01300"><p>There absolutely must be serious questions asked and answers given.  We have written to the Oireachtas committee.  It is not a case of whether the representatives should appear.  The operator and the regulator must attend before the committee.  They have a legal responsibility and a legal obligation to appear when they are requested to do so.</p>  <p>  This situation seriously dents confidence in the lottery.  For every approval sought from the regulator for a scratch card game, the national lottery produces the odds at which a person can win a &euro;3, &euro;5, &euro;20 or a top prize.  This is what their game is; it is about the odds.  We are asked to believe that human error resulted in something that has odds of happening of one in 25 million billion.  It is unbelievable for us to be able to accept that.  Moreover, when this was found out the operator continued to sell these tickets.</p>  <p>  The private company that operates the national lottery has made enormous profits off the back of these three games, sales of which were in excess of &euro;20 million.  Yet, there is no talk from the operator of actually refunding any of those profits back to consumers or to good causes.</p>  <p>  There is also a serious issue with regard to the regulator.  The Regulator of the National Lottery has a team of ten people.  Yes, the regulation is flawed and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to look at that, but the regulator only has one responsibility-----</p></speech>

It was calculated using the three categories of health, education and income.  The statistics were life expectancy of 82 years, 18.79 expected years of schooling and gross national income of &euro;55,659.68.  There has been growth in the quality of life in Ireland since 2012.  Then we come to the statistics we get in reply to questions.  I will take housing as an example.  We have statistics such as 64,000 new homes being delivered, 26,000 on site, a further 30,000 with planning permission and 75,000 families removed from consistent poverty.  This brings to mind the clich&eacute;d phrase regarding statistics of lies, damned lies and statistics.  I came across an interesting definition of statistics that is quite relevant to my question today.  The definition is that statistics are like a bikini as what they reveal is interesting but what they hide is vital.  Statistics reveal interesting information to answer questions but what they hide is the reality.  Understanding this reality is vital to direct policies and strategies.  What is hidden is the reality of life and the impact of not having a home, whether people are in emergency accommodation, sleeping rough, in overcrowded unsuitable accommodation or in direct provision.  What is also hidden is the impact and reality of inequality.</p>  <p>  I refer to two reports and I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to have heard of them.  They were done by All Together in Dignity.  These are The Hidden Dimensions of Poverty and a study on living in the shadows of socioeconomic deprivation.  They came from conversations with people who are living with the reality of poverty.  They speak about suffering mentally, emotionally and physically.  They speak about institutional and social maltreatment, discrimination and disempowerment.  This should not be happening in Ireland, a country that has wealth, a relatively small population, resources, investment and employment.  It is great to celebrate coming third but it is nothing to celebrate for those whom I have mentioned.  Coming third cannot allow us to be complacent and we have to be driven to ensure all can enjoy the quality of life that has Ireland in third place.  It is vital that we consider a different ideology, different principles and a different philosophy and that we are driven by the values that direct our overseas development aid so that coming third applies to everybody.  There is a need for a radical shift.  Quality of life begins with a home.</p></speech>

It is also worth saying that statistics do not lie.  We have made extraordinary progress in this country since 2012.  It is important to recognise this.  Of course we need to focus on things we have not done yet but if we look at the CSO figures in the survey on income and living conditions and the statistics from 2013 to 2018, inclusive, we see genuine progress in reducing poverty levels, reducing deprivation levels, increasing nominal income and a reduced number of people at risk of poverty.  This is true.  It is progress and it should be recognised.</p>  <p>  We have seen huge numbers of people being taken out of the risks and pressures of being unemployed.  The figure has fallen from 15% unemployment to below 5% unemployment.  During that period, the Government continued to increase the rates of minimum wage to try to make sure that as the country can afford it everybody benefits from a rising tide.  This is what we have been trying to do.</p>  <p>  This does not suggest we do not still have significant challenges and housing is at the heart of this, in terms of ensuring we facilitate enough homes being built at affordable prices for people to be able to access them, and for those who cannot afford to buy their own homes or rent their own properties that the State can intervene to support them in having a home of their own.  We are doing this.  We are not where we need to be yet.  We need to complete approximately 35,000 housing units a year in Ireland.  This year, the figure will be approximately 22,000.  We are still increasing our output by more than 25% a year, which is significant.  This year, as we have said over again, we will add an extra 10,000 social housing units to the social housing stock.</p>  <p>  If we take my city as an example, in Cork in 2014 there was one social house under construction for Cork City Council.  There are currently 1,000 on site under construction.  This is the change we are making and this is the pace that needs to continue for the next few years to make sure we get up to providing at least 12,000 extra social housing units a year and we provide thousands of affordable houses and cost rental and increase the housing output so the people to whom the Deputy referred who are, at the moment, in very pressurised and difficult conditions, with some of them in emergency accommodation, can get into homes of their own.</p></speech>

I will give a particular example.  We all know Brother Kevin Crowley of the Capuchin day centre.  Last Saturday night, he was out on O'Connell Street at the GPO with a group singing carols from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.  At 10 p.m. on Saturday he made his way to a fundraising event for the Capuchin day centre organised by the Oireachtas ushers.  A man in his 80s should not be in a position of having to do this.  We know the number of people he feeds every day, with approximately 600 or 700 people coming in and approximately 1,500 food parcels going out.  This should not be happening in a country that is wealthy.  This is my point.  Yes, progress is being made but it comes from a philosophy and ideology that does not take everybody into account.  Yes, we have quality of life.  All of us here have quality of life and we are looking forward to a good Christmas but we must be directed, and our policies and strategies have to be directed, towards those who are most in need and this is not happening.</p></speech>

This is why we work with people such as Brother Kevin, who is a great person and there are many others like him, who are working for people who are very vulnerable.  We spend more than &euro;160 million a year working with organisations to provide homeless services in better emergency accommodation while we help people transition back into a home of their own.  There are far too many people homeless in Ireland.  We know this.  The way to solve it is to continue to improve the quality of the supports available in emergency accommodation.  The core way in which this will be solved is to increase significantly the supply of social housing, affordable housing and affordable rental.  All of these are happening.  They cannot happen quickly enough but they are happening at a pace that the Government will continue to prioritise.</p></speech>

The Government said it was committed to delivering a school capital investment programme for extensions and refurbishment to cater for additional school places.  It also stated significant funding has been secured as part of the capital plan.  To the people of Bandon and its surrounds these promises were false and misleading.</p>  <p>  On 22 February 2018, in answer to my question, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, stated he was pleased to be able to respond positively to my request and that the Department of Education and Skills approved permanent accommodation for St. Brogan's college in Bandon comprising four mainstream classrooms and two resource teaching rooms.  He stated it had been given the green light with funding from the Department of Education and Skills and the Government.  He said he was very pleased this was the case.  It is now two years on and not a shovel has been turned on this project.  The parents of secondary school going children in Bandon and its surrounds are furious as 220 pupils applied for entry in 2020 to the excellent St. Brogan's college, which will be pushed to the extreme to take 118 children.  This will leave more than 100 children without a place.</p>  <p>The only co-educational secondary school in Bandon is Hamilton high school which is full to capacity and has refused dozens of children entry in September 2020.  Parents who live next to the schools and parents who are within walking distance of either school have had their children refused entry as the schools are already operating at over-capacity.  These parents are not taking this sitting down.  At a meeting on Monday night last they told me they are being advised to educate their children at home or to take them to a secondary school in Cork.  These parents will not accept this.  They have had their children in schools in Bandon from preschool through to national school and for dozens to be told there is no second level school place for their child is unacceptable.  They are angry, and rightly so.</p> <p> We need a short-term solution and a long-term solution.  The population in Bandon is expected to grow out to 2025.  The Department of Education and Skills has been caught napping as there is no long-term plan for Bandon and, shockingly, no short-term plan either, with promise after promise having been broken, leaving people in an unprecedented crisis.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to carry out an immediate assessment of educational needs for a fast-growing Bandon.  It needs to consult urgently with second level schools in Bandon and to consult with the community and parents, and to do so urgently.  The long-term plan must be a new, standalone community-type college for Bandon, similar to that which exists in Kinsale and Skibbereen.  Bandon needs this school and it needs it urgently.  This is the long-term plan.  The short-term plan to cater for the children excluded to date in Bandon is temporary classrooms at St. Brogan's college and Hamilton high school.  This is by no means a perfect solution as St Brogan's college, which was built to cater for 400 children, is now catering for over 600 students and it may have to cater for more than 700 in light of the crisis unfolding for so many families.</p> <p> Hamilton high school is at over-capacity and there has been no future vision for educational need for Bandon school-going children for decades.  I have been raising this issue in the D&aacute;il since I was elected in 2016.  I have raised every year at every opportunity, including twice in the past three weeks.  I know of the pain parents are suffering.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me today that every child who has been refused entry to St. Brogan's college or Hamilton high school, Bandon will be educated, as they have been all their lives, in Bandon from September 2020?</p></speech>

This is an issue that has been raised this week by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and Senator Tim Lombard as well.  The vast majority of post-primary school capacity is not an issue and schools can enrol all pupils that are seeking a school place.  Where issues exist, Department of Education and Skills officials actively engage with all the relevant parties to resolve them and will do so in regard to Bandon.  The Department is aware that enrolment issues have arisen in a number of areas in regard to post-primary school places for September 2020, including in west and east Cork.  To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses the geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country is likely to arise.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  As part of its demographic exercises, the Department engages with local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential developments.  This is necessary to ensure that school infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planning for new residential accommodation.</p>  <p>  On Bandon, as the Deputy will be aware, there are three post-primary schools servicing the Bandon school planning area, Bandon grammar school, which is fee-paying, an all-girls secondary school and, as mentioned by the Deputy, St. Brogan's  college, which is coeducational.  The Department has approved capital funding for St. Brogan's college, Bandon to expand school capacity significantly.  This permanent extension of four classrooms and other support rooms, has been delayed as planning permission has been appealed.  It is now envisaged that construction will commence on site in quarter 2 of 2020, with the school accommodation becoming available in 2021.  In the interim, the Department has provided grant aid for the rental of four prefabricated units and these are currently in use.  Officials from the Department are continuing to actively liaise with the school principals in Bandon to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place in 2020.</p>  <p>  Anyone who is giving the advice that parents should be home schooling or sending their children to Cork city for a school place is not giving good advice.  This is a problem that should be, and will be, sorted between the Department of Education and Skills and the school principals involved to ensure that every child in Bandon has a school place to go to.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the people of Bandon are rightly angry.  Year after year there has been under-investment in their town.  The flood relief scheme is now under way, long after the destruction of business properties and many hard working people having been put out of business.  The southern by-pass remains unfinished despite Government promises that it will be finished.  If the plan for the proposed northern relief road goes ahead it will bring chaos to Bandon businesses and motorists.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned in his reply that the lack of school places may be resolved in 2021.  School enrolment for September 2020 is the focus of parents in Bandon.  The parents have been told to educate their children at home or to take them to Cork to be educated.  I have met the parents, who have told me that is what they are being told.  This is not acceptable.  The anger among parents is palpable, as they know promises made are not being delivered at huge cost to their children's education.  The four prefabs already provided are not sufficient to cater for the children that need places in September 2020.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister for Education and Skills to visit Bandon and meet the parents, allay their fears and assure them that the problem will be sorted by September.  On behalf of the worried parents in Bandon, will they be able to have their children educated in a Bandon secondary school in September 2020?</p></speech>

I know Bandon well.  It is a great town and we should not be talking it down.  The Government is investing in Bandon and will continue to do so.  There is a particular problem in regard to post-primary school places.  The Government has committed to investing in a permanent solution but it will not provide significant accommodation until 2021.  I reiterate that officials from the Department continue to actively liaise with school principals in Bandon to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place in 2020, which is the issue raised by the Deputy.  As stated earlier, we will resolve the issue through the use of temporary accommodation while the permanent building project proceed and is, hopefully, completed in 2021.  In the meantime, we need to ensure that parents can get the answers that they need for September 2020.  The Department is committed to doing that.</p></speech>

He has been highlighting a number of issues for some months now.  This issue was highlighted to the Minister for Health in October.  This is an incredibly important service.  Every year more than 75 new children access the service to the manage the most unimaginable pain.  How has the Government allowed this situation to get to the point where parents are being left in the dark about treatment plans for their children and where Children's Health Ireland is saying it will try to fill the position next year?  What will be done for parents whose children are in chronic pain now and why was this situation allowed to develop?</p></speech>

Many of us in this House know some of these families.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that vulture funds swooped into this country, the banks and the Government having rolled out the red carpet to them.</p> <p>They have bought up tens of thousand of distressed loans from banks.  My legislation, the No Consent, No Sale Bill, which was passed with the approval of the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, is being blocked by the Government and indeed by Fianna F&aacute;il on Committee Stage.  This Bill would prevent the sale of mortgages to vulture funds without the consent of the homeowner.</p> <p> We have been told that all of the protections go with the sale of the loan.  That was never the issue.  The issue is that these vulture funds only have a short-term interest.  This morning we learned how one of the funds, Cerberus, has hiked up interest rates on these distressed borrowers.  Their interest rates are now over 5%.  The interest rate for new customers in this State is just over 3% while in Europe, the average is below 2%.  It  is absolutely scandalous that vulture funds can do this.  The reality is that if these funds want to increase it by another 1% or 2%, there is nothing that this House can do.  We need to prevent the sale of these loans to vulture funds in the first place.</p> <p> What response does the T&aacute;naiste have to the fact that the vulture funds that his Government welcomed so much into the country are now punishing the same families by hiking up their interest rates?  Can he reconsider his Government's opposition to my legislation, which would prevent these sales in the first place?</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy to the detailed parliamentary question that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe answered on this issue last week which is a useful piece of information.  I repeat the point that whether one is a financing agency which has purchased a distressed loan book, or a bank in Ireland, one is subject to the same codes and rules, enforced by the Central Bank, that are there to protect consumers in both circumstances.</p></speech>

In the case of something like this, it is important that one gives an informed response.  If one does not have the information, it is difficult to do that.</p>  <p>  Clearly, where families have children under the care of an individual who is stepping down, there will be a need for a proper transition plan for them to ensure, in particular in the area of pain management, that they are getting appropriate and professional care.

As people will know, I have a lot of interest in this issue.  I was in Israel and Palestine last week and met all the of the key political players there, from the Israeli Prime Minister to the Palestinian President.  I subsequently asked for and got a debate at the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, this week on how the European Union can collectively protect our own stated position in the Middle East peace process, which is to promote and protect the capacity to negotiate and deliver the two-state solution that is fair to both Israelis and Palestinians.  We have also agreed that there will be a more comprehensive debate at the January FAC meeting on 17 January, specifically on the Middle East peace process and the role of the European Union, in the context of trying to protect a two-state solution as a viable option.  This is in the face of what many people would regard as the creeping annexation of the West Bank due to expanding settlements, as well as on the back of the risk of annexation directly of parts of the West Bank, in particular the Jordan Valley, which Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken of on more than one occasion.  That, for the European Union, and certainly for Ireland would be a totally unacceptable and illegal course of action.  There needs to be a significant deterrent from the European Union to ensure that that does not happen because that would effectively end the capacity for a Middle East peace process to deliver an acceptable outcome to both sides.</p></speech>

The Road Safety Authority, RSA needs be we reined in somewhat.  I know of a contractor in west Tipperary who has been pulled in by the RSA and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na twice and has been asked to have his trailer tested.  He went to different test centres but the people there had never heard of such a test.  He drove last week to Waterford city to a test centre, only to be told that it could not test his trailer because it was not covered under statute or any regulation.  This is happening on a widespread basis.  There was no equipment to test the trailer at the test centre in Waterford.  This is unfair to a contractor trying to keep jobs and to carry on his business and not to be obliged to travel to the city of Waterford only to be told that no such test exists.  It is unfair that people are being victimised and intimidated.</p></speech>

As he is aware, his Government did not give an increase this year.  There are many groups of workers who are facing into Christmas in dire stress while living on the minimum wage.  There is one group that is working in community centres, and he may have seen their plight highlighted.  They have a real difficulty as they have no pay scale, so their pay never goes up.  If the Government does not give an increase, they are living at a deficit to the previous year because of the cost of living.  They are told that their employer is the local community centre but Pobal and Fingal County Council actually pay the wages.  Where do they go?  Is the T&aacute;naiste going to look into this situation whereby the whole community sector actually will get the increase that it needs to pay the full rate of the minimum wage?  All workers should be paid the same but the community employment, CE, workers with whom these workers work are getting paid more.  Can the T&aacute;naiste sort out this inequality and low pay?</p></speech>

The Minister is failing to provide a basic human right, namely, that to access one's personal information, which is set out in human rights declarations and has been available in most common law countries for more than 50 years.</p>  <p>  Was this a general Government decision or a personal initiative of the Minister?

Many farmers have rung my office, and I am sure the offices of many other Deputies, in a distressed state, waiting on their payments that were due in September.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment that the moneys will be paid before Christmas?  Farmers in County Louth were assured by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that under a new pilot satellite scheme launched this year, they would not be victimised as a result of their involvement in it, but that is what is happening.  It is unacceptable.

I raise the issue of the cohort of undocumented people who live in Ireland.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has stated that up to 26,000 people have been living undocumented for many years in the country.  They are rooted in their communities, they contribute to the economy and the vast majority work, yet they are undocumented.  We make a big case every year for the undocumented Irish in the US and I have raised the issue with the T&aacute;naiste on many occasions.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who I am glad to see is here and will be able to respond, launched a scheme but it was narrow and provided only for student visa overstayers from the years 2005 to 2010, inclusive.  Only 2,153 people have achieved a pathway to regularisation through the scheme.  Has the Minister any plans to introduce a scheme that will broadly address the large cohort of 26,000 people, including their family members, who are in the country, and give them a pathway to regularisation?  There was recently a public meeting in Limerick on the issue and approximately 250 people turned up.  They came from throughout the country to speak about it and we owe them an obligation to address it.</p></speech>

This is now a possibility because EU climate policy does not reflect scientific evidence.  We must dramatically reduce CO<sub>2</sub>but we need a different approach from the CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent concept, particularly for methane from cattle.  I ask that Ireland urgently take the lead at EU level to ensure there will be a robust, science-based green deal to replace the current, flawed policy, which is a political rather than scientific solution to climate change.</p></speech>

It will require a response from every EU member state that is more ambitious than anything we have planned for, but that is the way the world is going and we need to follow that.  Having said that, rural Ireland and agriculture need to transition in the context of the climate challenge, but can do so and grow and expand at the same time.  That is our current agricultural policy and it will continue to be.  Ireland has an obligation to be a leader in this area in the EU, given the size of the agricultural sector versus other sectors from an emissions perspective in our economy, as the Deputy will know better than most, in light of the Ministry he previously held.  We need to bring about change but we need to work with farmers to do so.  That will be a big part of the next round of the CAP negotiation.</p></speech>

According to leaked documents from the supermarket industry, which contain startling information, supermarket chains are taking up to half of the retail price in profit.  They have average profit margins of between 20% and 45% on fresh meat and fresh beef, of between 30% and 33% on round roast beef and of 34% on a leg of lamb.  Three supermarket chains are in a dominant position because they control 75% of the market.  We have spoken previously about processors.  The T&aacute;naiste will know from his former role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that one big player, in particular, is dominating the processing end of things.  The three leading supermarket chains that control 75% of the market are making profits.  Meanwhile, the farmer who has the animal for two or three years makes a loss of up to 60 cent per kilogram.  The supermarkets are making up to 50% profit.  This is a ludicrous situation.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that we need legislation on price transparency.  I would be happy if the Government and other Opposition parties would support the Bill I have tabled in this regard.  It would bring the supermarkets into the price transparency loop.  The retailers need to be brought into the beef task force immediately.  There needs to be transparency about the prices and the margins they are getting for their produce.</p></speech>

That must be brought about through the beef forum or the beef task force.  It would be very helpful if all players were involved in contributing to the beef task force as a way of ensuring this country's beef sector has a sustainable future.  Dealing with retailers is not as straightforward as the Deputy might suggest.  Retailers purchase for multiple markets and not just for the Irish market.  Some 90% of Irish beef has to find a consumer and a buyer outside of Ireland.  Many of these things need to be done at EU level, or else at a level that is agreed between retailers, producers and processors.  It is a complex discussion.  Given the scale of the beef sector in Ireland, we need all players to contribute constructively to a beef forum that is looking to restructure this industry in a way that will allow primary producers of beef to gain a fair margin for the work they do.</p></speech>

It is obvious that the provision of home help services is of assistance in this regard.  The ongoing problems with such services have been raised with me all the time since I was elected.  This is becoming a significant problem as we approach Christmas.  People have come into my office in tears because they have been told they will not get any home help from Christmas Eve until 3 January.

People are coming into my office - I am sure they are coming into every office around the country - to say that they are on waiting lists to get home help.

I acknowledge that work has commenced on the new section of the route between Ballaghaderreen and Scramogue.  That is welcome because it will improve safety.  We still have a significant issue with safety along the N5.  Recently, an articulated lorry ended up in the back windscreen of the car of a lady who had just picked up her four children from school in the village of Tulsk.  That is how close it was.  Luckily, nobody was hurt.  I can show the T&aacute;naiste photographs of this incident if he wishes.  I appreciate that this is not his area of responsibility.  He and his staff have been helpful with these issues in the past.  As this road will be so busy over the next week, I would like the T&aacute;naiste to ask the TII to consider the installation of temporary lights over the next couple of days to avoid injury or death.  The safety issue along there is absolutely outrageous.</p></speech>

One gentleman of my acquaintance presented himself at the hospital at 3 p.m. yesterday with signs of a stroke, but he was not seen until 9.30 a.m. today, or more than 18 hours later.  This is an absolute disgrace.  In May, I highlighted the fact that the admissions unit at the hospital is closed, which is adding to these problems.  How many of the 190 beds that were announced yesterday will be in Naas?  What will happen the elderly people who are having to stay on trolleys for over 18 hours?

This effort is being made against a difficult political backdrop at present.  Many people in County Donegal and every other part of the country have loved ones who have been abroad for many years and are unable to come home.  This problem becomes particularly acute when Irish people who are living overseas lose close family relatives in Ireland.  I know it is a difficult situation at the moment.

I am sure the Deputy is familiar with this facility, which is available to Australian nationals.  It enables them to get visas to work and live in the United States.</p> <p>There is an allocation each year.  We are working with friends in Congress and the Senate to try to allow Irish people to use unused visas, of which there are between 3,000 and 4,000 and sometimes more each year.  We are trying to progress legislation that would give Irish people who want to travel to the United States the opportunity to be able to do so with the new visa entitlement, with reciprocal arrangements for US citizens who want to come to Ireland.  That is the area where we can make progress in the short term but there is a broader challenge of the thousands of undocumented across the US who are concerned about their future.  We continue to raise the issue but immigration is a hugely divisive issue on Capitol Hill.  It is, therefore, difficult to get the legislative change that we would like to see in the short term.</p></speech>

This legislation is in response to the blacklisting of journalists by Communicorp Media.  In October, Deputies from all parties signed a joint letter to Communicorp Media urging an immediate end to the ban from its radio stations of certain journalists, including the highly respected and award-winning journalists, Tom Lyons and Ian Kehoe.  The initiative had the support of all party leaders, including the Taoiseach.  Three months on, however, nothing has changed.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has not made any significant move to address the issue and it is clear that only a change in law will change anything.</p><p>The Bill proposes to make it an offence to ban a journalist who is a member of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, from the airwaves for reason of occupation, employer, company or employment status.  We limited its scope to members of the NUJ for a number of reasons.  As we do not have a legal definition of &quot;journalist&quot; in law, to apply the legislation to journalists more broadly could open broadcasters to the possibility of court cases being taken by any person who uses the label &quot;journalist&quot;.  This could result in frivolous cases being taken that are designed to punish broadcasters for what might be a genuine reason for not including a person on a show.  Limiting the scope of the Bill to NUJ members creates a certain standard or threshold as to who can or cannot avail of the legislation, if passed.</p><p>The second reasons is that we believe in trade unions and that all journalists should be in the NUJ and trade unions.  People are stronger for being members of unions and the legislation supports this.  </p><p>It is very important that this Bill passes.  We cannot have certain media outlets banning journalists because they do not like what they have to say or because of who they work for.  That is not how journalism or broadcasters should work.  Every broadcaster has a responsibility to be fair and impartial, even if it is privately owned.  That is not the case in this scenario.  We hope to move the Bill during Private Members' time.  </p></speech>

The Bill amends the Broadcasting Act 2009 to make it a breach of contract or licence under the Act to prohibit a member of the National Union of Journalists from communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer, company or employment status.  It is a timely Bill as we have seen increased attacks on the rights and freedoms of journalists worldwide.  In the past five years, the Council of Europe's platform to promote the protection of journalism has reported 256 serious violations of press freedom in the member states of European Union, including the murder of 14 journalists.  The murders of Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta in 2017, the rape and murder of Viktoria Marinova in Bulgaria in 2018, and the murder of J&aacute;n Kuciak and his fianc&eacute;e in Slovakia in 2018 dramatically raised public awareness in the European Union of the twin crisis of journalist safety and impunity for the murders of journalists.  </p>  <p>  All of us here can remember the murder of Veronica Guerin in 1996.  Her killing reverberated around the country, led to convictions and the creation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Ireland needs to be a global leader in protecting media freedoms.  We need to stand up for media freedom and the rights of journalists at this crucial time for independent reporting.   We can start with this Bill and ensuring that broadcasting organisations cannot discriminate against journalists simply because of their professional affiliation.    We cannot sit back and allow the current situation, where journalists from certain newspapers and media companies are banned from appearing on the radio stations of one of the biggest media organisations in the country simply because their multimillionaire owner is angry and upset at the coverage he receives from these newspaper and media companies.  This is positive and proactive legislation to address discrimination and I call on all Deputies to support it when it comes before the D&aacute;il.  </p></speech>

It is said that the toughest, harshest anti-trade union laws in Europe are those in the UK.  This is a legacy of the Thatcher era and the anti-union legislation from the 1980s, which was copper-fastened by the Blair Governments of the 1990s.  Last summer, however, when the courts here blocked Ryanair pilots from striking, the courts in the UK did not block strike action by Ryanair pilots there.  The anti-union laws in Ireland would give those in the UK a run for their money.  The Industrial Relations Act was introduced under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government by the then Minister for Labour, Bertie Ahern, in 1990.  It was opposed by the left but supported by the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and sold to it on the ground that it avoided the worst excesses of the anti-union legislation being introduced at the time in the UK.  That legislation now puts up obstacle after obstacle to workers and trade unions in standing up and fighting for their rights and conditions.</p><p>Anti-union legislation has been used in recent times not only against Ryanair pilots but also against National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, ambulance paramedics, Tesco workers and many others.  The Bill seeks to amend the legislation to restore rights to workers and trade unionists and to reduce the power imbalance between capital and labour.  Trade union legislation in Ireland effectively bans political strikes.  Would the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike of the mid-1980s or the PAYE tax protests of the 1980s be possible under the current trade union legislation?  I think not.  There are current issues on which trade unionists and workers are hampered from campaigning by this legislation.</p> <p>Strikes against sexism and racism and strikes for action on the climate and housing emergencies would all run smack bang into the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Injunctions are regularly taken out and granted by the courts against workers fighting for their rights.  The idea of solidarity action, as pioneered by Connolly and Larkin, that an injury to one is an injury to all and that workers should take action where necessary in support of other workers, is illegal under the current legislation.  For instance, Tesco workers were pressurised not to picket outside their places of employment but, instead, to stand outside the shopping centres where the shops are located.  I could give many other examples.  This Bill seeks to restrict the grounds upon which an employer may obtain an injunction against workers or trade unions fighting for their rights.</p> <p> The Bill also aims to cut out State interference in trade union affairs.  Under the 1990 Act, a secret ballot must be held before industrial action can be taken and one week's notice of such action must be given to the employer.  During the summer, we saw how this provision was interpreted by the courts in the Ryanair case, where the judge refused to accept a sworn affidavit by a trade union official that the ballot had been conducted in the proper fashion.  In effect, the union was asked to give over the names of its members, in a public fashion, to a notorious anti-union employer which granted trade union recognition only when it came under pressure to do so in a previous case.  That is completely unacceptable.  Unions should be permitted by law to organise their own ballots.  Whether those ballots are held in secret or openly is a matter for the union.  This is the spirit of the Bill, namely, that workers and unions should decide such matters, not the State.</p></speech>

My party will be abstaining on the motion.  Fine Gael likes to tell itself and the country that it is responsible in its management of the public finances, but the facts are clear and they tell a much different story.  This year, the Government has gone over budget to the tune of nearly &euro;634 million.  Since 2012, Fine Gael has overspent on budgets by a total of some &euro;6.9 billion.  In 2018, the Department of Health alone needed an extra &euro;654; this year, it has gone over budget by &euro;330 million.  The Fiscal Advisory Council gave a stark warning recently regarding the Government's handling of the public finances, observing that without the temporary element of corporation tax receipts, Ireland would potentially be in breach of the fiscal rules.  The council's report further states that the Government has allowed spending to drift upwards in recent years, especially in 2018.</p>  <p>  All of this overspending is being paid for by an explosion in corporation tax, which we all know is temporary in nature.  Of the &euro;11 billion or so taken in corporation tax, 45% comes from just ten multinational groups.  If those companies leave the State, there will be a massive hole in the public finances.  The Taoiseach has told us that this hole would be filled by property-related taxes such as stamp duty.  Have we learned nothing from the past?  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach seems to be suggesting that a house construction boom may be necessary to plug the hole in the public finances that a fall-off in corporation tax would leave.  The Government does not seem to understand that making permanent expenditure commitments on the back of receipts that may prove temporary leaves us extremely exposed.  That applies to stamp duty receipts as it does to corporation tax from multinationals.  In addition, we have seen massive overspends on projects such as the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael is adept at throwing accusations at Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is past time that Members opposite had a good luck in the mirror and recognised that they must investigate the risks they are taking as a consequence of their approach to managing the public finances.  The Government must address the sorry slide that has continued over the past eight to nine years.</p></speech>

The Revised Estimates Volume 2019 sets out total net voted expenditure for the year of &euro;53.9 billion.  On budget day, the requirements for a number of Supplementary Estimates for 2019 were set out in the 2020 expenditure report.  The total amount proposed in respect of substantive Supplementary Estimates amounts to &euro;634 million.  This is below the &euro;660 million estimated requirement set out on budget day and reflects certain minor expenditure developments in the intervening period.  In total, 13 substantive Supplementary Estimates and technical Supplementary Estimates are required in 2019.</p>  <p>  As set out in the 2020 expenditure report, there will be a 100% Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients in 2019.  Approximately &euro;17 million of that amount will be paid from the Social Insurance Fund and this element will not require a Supplementary Estimate.  However, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million is required by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to meet the Exchequer element of the bonus.</p>  <p>  The justice Vote group requires Supplementary Estimates of &euro;51 million in total.  Of this, &euro;17.5 million is required for the Garda Vote as a result of security costs associated with the visits of President Trump and Vice President Pence.  Further to this, just over &euro;33 million is required for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote due to pressures relating to the provision of asylum seekers accommodation.</p>  <p>  The 2020 expenditure report set out the requirement for an additional &euro;335 million for health services in 2019.  In addition, the amount being provided today includes a further &euro;3 million in respect of Brexit-related health infrastructural costs.  The additional funding being provided for today accounts for 2% of the original overall net health allocation for 2019.  In comparison, a 4.4% increase above the original overall net allocation was provided to the health sector last year by way of a Supplementary Estimate.</p>  <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4 million is being provided to Revenue to meet costs related to Brexit infrastructure at the ports and Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will receive a Supplementary Estimate of just under &euro;20 million primarily in respect of Brexit infrastructure.  In addition, the reallocation of resources in the Vote will ensure that provision is made for all expenditure pressures, inclusive of the rural development programme.  It is expected that this amount will be offset by higher than anticipated EU receipts.</p>  <p>  As set out in the 2020 expenditure report, there are various pressures on the education Vote, necessitating a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;68 million for 2019.  This relates primarily to pay and pensions pressures, as well as school transport costs.</p>  <p>  As in previous years, the increase in the defence Vote group ceiling, required to accommodate the Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions, is expected to be offset by underspends elsewhere in the Vote group.</p>  <p>  There are several other substantive Supplementary Estimates required, including &euro;21 million for the Department of Finance in regard to the settlement of aviation-related legal cases, as well as &euro;10 million of additional funding for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor's Office requires a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million due to higher than anticipated legal fees arising from a number of long-running court cases.  There are also pressures arising in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in respect of the Child and Family Agency, requiring a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;15 million.</p> <p>Due to pressures on both pay and non-pay administrative costs, an additional &euro;470,000 is required by the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p> Finally, several technical Supplementary Estimates are required this year, including for Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances.  This is required to provide for &euro;5 million of potential additional costs relating to public service pensions that will be offset by additional receipts.  Other technical Supplementary Estimates were required by the Votes for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As is usual, it is expected that there will be savings in some areas across the system which will partially offset the Supplementary Estimates.</p> <p> The additional expenditure provided by way of Supplementary Estimates amounts to 1.2% of the net voted expenditure allocation for the year.  This represents a responsible approach towards ensuring that public services are adequately funded to meet Government's key social and economic objectives of protecting the vulnerable in society and creating the conditions to support growth in employment.</p></speech>

Today, in less than 45 minutes, the House is deciding to allocate an additional &euro;634 million of expenditure which was not accounted for in the Government's budget.  That is the equivalent of the unallocated amount in any of the budgets we have dealt with in the last several years.  When we do that there is a lead-up process, with three days of discussion before budget day.  This really clarifies that this Government is completely out of its depth when managing the public finances.  Deputy Cowen asked if the Government had learned anything from the mistakes and disasters of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It appears that it has not.  We still have budgets that run way beyond what is projected.  This underlines the fact that the Government is not budgeting adequately in some areas.  It is not just me who has said this.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has repeatedly criticised the Government, saying its projections for expenditure in certain Departments lack credibility and are unrealistic.  Here we are again today, looking at a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health which totals &euro;338 million.  This is akin to what happened last year.  The Department has seen an average overrun of &euro;500 million in each of the last five years.  We were told that one of the measures introduced in the bright new dawn of the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would be credible budgeting for health.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il has supported every single budget here and has kept the Minister for Health in office.  Unfortunately he only exists as Minister for Health because of the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.</p>  <p>  The Government is treating the public finances in an inappropriate manner.  It expects to come before this House and ask us to approve, in less than an hour, expenditure of almost &euro;750 million which was not budgeted for.  Where does that money come from?  It comes from unsustainable medium-term and short-term resources represented by corporation tax booms.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has highlighted the folly of depending on this type of tax to pay for recurring current expenditure, which Sinn F&eacute;in has warned of for many years.  Our view is that the current boom in corporation tax windfalls must be invested in the long-term security of our State by meeting our needs in housing, telecommunications, roads and physical infrastructure.  The Government is using these resources, which are unsustainable in the long term, to fill holes in the health budget.  Users of the service do not see any benefit or enhancement as a result of the additional resources the Government puts in.</p>  <p>  The reality behind these figures is the dysfunction in how the Government deals with funding the HSE and the health service.  As a result of not funding this service properly, we now have a situation where people who can be cared for at home at a fraction of the cost are in acute hospitals.  Well-paid and well-educated consultants cannot carry out operations and procedures because there are no recovery beds for their patients.  Professionals are not able to carry out their work because of a lack of hospital capacity.  Consultants are being paid astronomical figures as locum staff because hospitals are not allowed to employ full-time HSE consultants.  The same applies for nurses.  The result of this lack of prudent financing and proper budgeting and the failure to allocate proper resources to the Department is huge underinvestment.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government has learned nothing from the past and the mistakes of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The only difference is that Fine Gael is not taking dodgy donations from a Galway tent.  When it comes to relying on unsustainable tax revenues to fund repeating expenditure, the Government has learned nothing. </p></speech>

It is really shocking to read the figures in relation to the Department of Health where yet again the Government has introduced a Supplementary Estimate plus other funding of almost &euro;500 million.  The Minister for Health has failed to fulfil his responsibility.  Despite the fact that the total expenditure on health is now around &euro;17 billion, the Government seems to lack the competence to address the services in our crowded hospitals, the children without pain relief and the multiple other problems that afflict the health service.  The vast overruns entertained by the Government in its management of the national children's hospital project have caused complete dysfunction in other areas of the health sector which now lack vital funding.</p>  <p>  Incredibly, despite the spending listed in this year's budget there will be no increase in pensioners' incomes next year.  There will be no increase in retirement pensions, the invalidity pension or the blind welfare allowance.  I could name 28 social welfare payments which have seen no increase.  There were four or five small changes to social welfare and other weekly payments.  It is an astonishing failure of performance.  The Government should not think that pensioners and other social welfare recipients will forget it, particularly when the Government constantly talks in stellar terms about statistics showing we are the third richest nation in the world or the European country with the most money.  Despite this, we cannot increase social welfare payments by &euro;5 a week.  That is really distressing.  This is the first time this has happened since 2014, when there was a very clear resumption of social welfare increases, including the restoration of the Christmas bonus which Fianna F&aacute;il had abolished.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has come here with the Government accounts.  We still have not received any serious explanation in accounting terms of how &euro;24 million paid in taxes by airlines was refunded and recorded as consultancy fees.  Could the Minister please explain how such a misstatement of accounting information was included in the Supplementary Estimates?</p> <p>I still have not heard an explanation that satisfies me.  As somebody who has worked in the accounting field, I must confess that I no longer believe the health accounts.  IFAC did not disagree with me when we discussed that a week ago.</p> <p> What I will say next provides a stark contrast.  I was in the Phoenix Park last night with the OPW which, with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, spent &euro;400,000 on a consultancy exercise on the park that repeated one that had been done previously and added nothing new to what we know about the Phoenix Park, its protection and significance.  Up the road in Mulhuddart community centre, a group of workers are paid salaries with a contribution of funds from Pobal.  Pobal will not pay them the minimum wage.  We have no explanation as to why Pobal as an entity is not funded to ensure that community workers who are working hard in local communities are not paid at least the minimum wage.  Could the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, give me an answer to that question?</p> <p> Further up the road in Huntstown and Hartstown, a sum of approximately &euro;300,000 would enable essential fire safety repair works to be carried out.  Instead, the OPW and F&aacute;ilte Ireland were able to spend &euro;400,000 on consultancy - we do not know the reason for that - on the Phoenix Park, while up the road vital community centres and cr&egrave;ches may be closed because the Government cannot find a way to fund Pobal to carry out the necessary works for fire safety purposes in two community centres.  That is due to the incompetence of this Government.  To be perfectly honest, people cannot understand the sums, yet the Government fails to deliver.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200022#U00200"><p>Fourteen months ago, in the run-in to budget 2019, I advocated additional new net policy spending, including new revenues, especially for the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Justice and Equality, and Children and Youth Affairs.  However, the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il austerity Governments since 2008 have resolutely refused to fund essential services for people across all those and other sectors of government.  Once again, we need large Supplementary Estimates, in this case of &euro;634 million, just to fund the crucial day-to-day operations of hard-pressed Departments and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in early October that he thought the HSE could break even this year because he had instructed HSE managers to limit overspends by curbing staff levels, overtime and the spend on agency staff.  Members know that for the past nine or ten months Mr. Reid and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, have imposed an embargo on the recruitment of additional staff to provide desperately needed therapies and hospital operations.  Despite those measures, we now see in the Supplementary Estimates that Vote 38 needs an additional &euro;338 million for 2019.  The bulk of this funding seems to be needed for HSE health and social care services and primary care reimbursement services.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, Mr. Reid said the overrun at the end of September was almost half that of the same period in 2018 and that the HSE workforce of 138,080 represented 119,473 whole-time equivalent staff.  The question we must ask is why Mr. Reid and the HSE board only recently submitted a service plan for 2020.  How can we allocate budgets in this House if the HSE and its chief executive do not give us a service plan for the next calendar year?  That seems to be an incredible anomaly.</p>  <p>  The key problem with supplementary budgets and overruns in the health area is that we know there are horrendous waiting lists for acute hospital treatment.  Yesterday, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred to there being 200,000 children on waiting lists health services.  It appears that the 2019, 2018 budgets and previous austerity budgets did not realistically allocate the necessary funding for health, social care and disability services.  Does the 2020 HSE service plan, which the Minister and the Cabinet now have, remotely meet the delivery costs of those services or will this D&aacute;il or probably the next D&aacute;il have to revisit Vote 38 for a Supplementary Estimate in autumn 2020, or perhaps much earlier due to Brexit?</p>  <p>  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has been raising anomalies in Vote 38 for the past three years.  Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy of Social Justice Ireland, in a presentation, drew attention to what we all know are the predictable shortfalls in health expenditure.  Two or three years ago, the shortfall was more than &euro;800 million.  This means the health service had almost &euro;1 billion less than was needed to operate.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, have both drawn attention to the same situation.  IFAC defines a prudent fiscal policy as one "where net policy spending growth does not exceed sustainable growth in revenues", but that does not preclude ensuring we have sufficient revenue in our budgets in this House to run a modern, universal and quickly accessible health service.</p>  <p>  As colleagues have said, budget 2020 was a regressive, standstill budget for citizens on social protection benefits, assistance and pensions.  We might as well not have had a budget, especially for lower paid workers generally.  The payment of a Christmas bonus, which I understand amounts to &euro;100 million net in the books, cannot erase the cynical failure by this "Varadkar" Government and its imposition of possible disorderly Brexit costs entirely on the most vulnerable citizens.  In terms of transparent management of the public finances, we should decide on Christmas bonuses for the following year and provide for them in the main budget.  We should stop this messing and pretending year after year.</p>  <p>  In education, an additional &euro;68 million has been provided.  The PBO has drawn attention to the demographic bulge, which is moving on from primary to post-primary level.  It will possibly peak in 2025 and then move on to third level.  I advocated at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that the additional teachers who may be released by the changes in the demographic bulge should be used to dramatically reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  I welcome that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has been engaging with larger Departments and that the focus of the committee early next year, prior to the general election, will be on accurate forecasting and management of demographic factors.  That is the key point.  The committee is rightly concerned about the use of outdated demographic projections in budget 2020 and the need for budgetary allocations to accurately reflect demographic pressures.  I hope we will have that and the additional spending that is essential.  Perhaps this will be one of the last years we have this kind of charade and we can consign the annual Supplementary Estimates to history and instead have realistic annual budgets year in and year out.</p></speech>

I regularly attend Question Time with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I read all of the parliamentary questions that come in from other areas.  Every day, a new demand for spending is made in the House.  In one day, the demands made in just one group of parliamentary questions clocked up hundreds of millions of euro.  On the one hand, I understand that people question the process.  Some people might oppose a Revised Estimate even if they sat at a Cabinet table where that was the norm.  The reality is that demographic changes and pressures arise across sectors every year.  That is nothing new.  It is also not new that a Government would enter into pay agreements with sectors that must be realised, as happened in health and education.</p>  <p>  I have sat in the House beside the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, when he was repeatedly asked if we would guarantee the Christmas bonus.  The Christmas bonus costs &euro;279 million.  Deputy Broughan is correct and I share his view that we should pay it.  That is why it is in the Supplementary Estimate today.  On the one hand, there is opposition to a Supplementary Estimate being presented and, on the other hand, Members present a litany of demands for additional expenditure.  Previously, we were not able to introduce a &euro;5 increase in social welfare payments across the board.  Deputy Burton will be aware that this would cost &euro;300 million.  If we were to do that today, we would have a Revised Estimate of upwards of &euro;1 billion.  We simply did not have the money to do so this year but we hope to be able to introduce such an increase in the future.</p>  <p>  Every single day we come into the D&aacute;il we hear about demands across the health spectrum, in particular in acute care.  We have changing demographics.  Thankfully, people are living longer.  We have burgeoning problems in health.  We are trying to recruit additional staff.  Even in my area in Limerick we see the opening of additional beds.  That cannot happen unless money is available to do it.  Sometimes money is not available.  At the start of the year, the Minister said there would probably be a need for &euro;660 million and the total requested today is &euro;634 million.  This format is nothing new.  The Deputies who have questioned the Supplementary Estimate have been around this House much longer than I have.  They know that when one is setting out a budget, one does not have a telescopic view to the end of December as to the potential pressures that will arise.</p> <p>Those pressures have to be paid for, however.  Is anybody really suggesting we should not pay the increases factored in by way of pay agreements and that may not have been envisaged at the start of the budgetary cycle?  Is anybody really saying the &euro;335 million to go into the healthcare system should not be invested because of the pressures?  Is anybody really suggesting an additional &euro;68 million should not be invested in the education system to address a range of demographic issues, such as the recruitment of additional teachers, changes in pay for teachers, the recruitment of additional special needs assistants and the changing of school transport.  Those of us from rural areas know how difficult it is to get transport for children.  Changes were made this year in this regard.  It all costs money.  </p> <p> At the same time, Deputy Broughan is right about the future reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio.  I hope that will continue.  That costs money also.</p> <p> This is nothing new.  It is to be noted that the funding, &euro;634 million, is less than that for 2018 and about at the level for 2017.  It is really a little disingenuous to say this is something new and that it suggests the Government is not in command of its brief.  This is the Government responding to pressures that have arisen throughout the year that have to be paid for.  We have to pay for these things.  We cannot just ignore the fact that there are pressures concerning various elements of expenditure.  We are not ignoring the fact that there are areas of under-expenditure.  There is under-expenditure that can be factored back in.</p> <p> There are greater levels of detail.  I cannot really comment on the constituency issues raised but I am sure the relevant Ministers will be more capable of answering the questions.  I can guarantee, however, that if the State agencies referred to a while ago did not respond positively in engaging with the communities being engaged with, we would have something else to say.  Every day I come in here, I listen to questions for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Sometimes Members' make demands as if there were an out&ndash;of&ndash;control taxi meter while, at the same time, they criticise the fact that we are today looking for an additional &euro;634 million.  In the round, everybody accepts that these things have to be paid for.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200024#BB00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  On 3 December last, the Government approved the publication of this Bill.  I believe strongly that this legislation heralds a new era for the health service.  This House will be familiar with some of the issues that have arisen within our health service in recent years that have, quite rightly, led to demands for improvements in patient safety.  Any patient safety incident significantly affects patients' lives and impacts on their families.  Quite often, that pain is compounded by poor communication.  </p>  <p>  I think today of people like Ro&iacute;s&iacute;n and Mark Molloy, incredible patient advocates who lost their baby, Mark, in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  They advocated so much for open disclosure.  I also think of the incredible Vicky Phelan.  These are people who have been kept in the dark about their own healthcare or that of a loved one.  They have led us on the road to today and I formally thank them here on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today.  I also want to send a message to our doctors, clinicians and all those working in the health service.  This legislation is not about a blame culture or finger pointing.  It is about supporting those people in doing their jobs and about creating a culture in the health service where open disclosure and transparency are the norm.  I know there are concerns and I can understand why.</p>  <p>  When it comes to open disclosure, we must all become better at responding when things go wrong.  Let us be honest.  In every health service the world over, things will go wrong.  What matters is how the health service responds and deals with situations when those mistakes and errors happen.  We have now seen several good examples of responding when things go wrong, but this House and the media must also reflect on our reactions once the news of such incidents breaks.  I believe we will succeed in creating the kind of culture we desire, but it will, inevitably, mean that more incidents will be discovered and disclosed.  This means a more balanced analysis will be required in future.  If mandatory open disclosure becomes the norm, and it will under this legislation, that will mean that, quite rightly, we will be hearing about more patient safety incidents.  We need to debate that as an Oireachtas, a country and a health service in a balanced way and in a way that recognises that identifying errors and putting up one's hand and saying "I made a mistake, I got it wrong, I am sorry and here is the learning" is actually a good culture to embed in our health service.</p>  <p>  The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 is part of a programme of legislative changes and policy initiatives being taken by my Department to improve the ability of our health service to anticipate, identify, respond to and manage patient safety issues.  I hope the Bill will also change the culture within the health service.  This Bill provides for a number of patient safety priorities, including mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  It also provides for the notification of those reportable incidents to the relevant regulator, and it is an important point that the regulator has to be notified, the use of clinical audit to improve patient care and outcomes and, importantly, the extension of the remit of HIQA to private hospitals.  That is something for which there have been calls for many years and it will now happen in this legislation.</p>  <p>  This Bill is divided into eight Parts, with 54 sections and two Schedules.  The first Part, preliminary and general provisions, covers sections 1 to 4, inclusive.  Section 1 contains standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill and arrangements for its commencement on a phased basis.  Section 2 deals with the interpretation of the Bill.  It defines the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill, including "apology", "health practitioner", "health service", "notifiable incident", "open disclosure of a notifiable incident", "patient" and "relevant person".  Section 3 provides the definition of a "health service provider", which encompasses a wide range of providers of health services, public and private.  Section 4 deals with expenses.</p>  <p>  Part 2 sets out the framework for mandatory open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident.  Section 5 places an obligation on the health service provider to make an open disclosure when satisfied that a notifiable patient safety incident has occurred.  Section 6 places an obligation on a health practitioner, when he or she has formed the opinion that a notifiable incident has occurred, to inform the health services provider of the incident.  Section 7 is a key section in that it establishes the obligation of mandatory open disclosure.  This section requires that a health service provider must make an open disclosure to the patient concerned where a notifiable patient safety incident has occurred.  If the patient has died or there are concerns regarding the capacity of the patient, however, this section also recognises that it may be more appropriate to make the disclosure to another relevant person.  Section 8 is also a key provision of the Bill and provides for the Minister for Health to make regulations prescribing additional patient safety incidents as notifiable incidents.  This is an important function.  We do not want to have to come back to primary legislation every time we need to add to the Schedule of what is a patient safety incident.  Having that flexibility through regulation to be able to revise that list is a practical way of ensuring we can keep this legislation relevant and up to date as our health service continues to evolve.</p>  <p>  All notifiable patient safety incidents, whether listed in the Bill or prescribed in regulations, are subject to mandatory open disclosure and must be notified by the health services provider to the appropriate regulator.  This section is intended to ensure that the list of notifiable patient safety incidents subject to mandatory open disclosure can, as I have said, be kept up to date on an ongoing basis.  The section gives the Minister wide scope to prescribe further patient safety incidents as notifiable incidents, bearing in mind the learning from incidents that have occurred in the Irish health service or internationally, as well as learning from advances in clinical practice.</p>  <p>  In prescribing new patient safety incidents as notifiable incidents, the Minister of the day must have regard to a number of matters, including: the nature of the incident; the consequences for the patient; and the need to obtain and disseminate information regarding an incident so as to prevent or lessen reoccurrence.  Section 9 provides that when a health services provider engages in open disclosure in accordance with the Act, the disclosure, including an apology, shall be treated as an open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident.</p>  <p>  Section 10 sets out that the information and apology given at an open disclosure notifiable patient safety incident meeting shall not: constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability; be admissible as evidence of fault; invalidate insurance; constitute an express or implied admission, by a health practitioner of fault, professional misconduct, poor professional performance, unfitness to practise a health service, or other failure or omission in relation to notifying a notifiable patient safety incident.</p> <p>The purpose of these legislative protections, which are very much in line with international experience and best international practice, is to encourage an environment of open disclosure by ensuring that information relating to notifiable patient safety incidents can be disclosed by health practitioners and health service providers without fear of liability.  It is a shame that, on many occasions, in the health service and in many other walks of life when something goes wrong, the first place the public service can run to is a lawyer.  That is the culture we are trying to change.  We are trying to create a safe space in which somebody can come forward and admit an error happened.  As Dr. Scally said in his report, we must acknowledge the error, apologise for it, mean it and learn from it.  That is at the core of what mandatory open disclosure has to be about.  That is why these protections are in the legislation.  The following terms are also defined in this section: "clinical negligence"; "clinical negligence action"; "medical defence organisation"; and "professional indemnity insurance".</p> <p> Section 11 provides that a health service provider must set out in writing its procedures for making open disclosures of notifiable patient safety incidents to patients.  Section 12 addresses openness and transparency and sets out that both health service providers and health practitioners, when making an open disclosure under this Bill, must provide all relevant information to the patient, or his or her relevant person, and, where appropriate, any other health service to address the consequences of that incident.</p> <p> Part 3 addresses the procedure for making an open disclosure of a notifiable incident.  It is one matter to do open disclosure.  How open disclosure happens is equally important.  I have met patients who have been openly disclosed to but in a less than satisfactory manner.  Section 13 requires that an open disclosure must be made on behalf of the health services provider by the principal health practitioner.  If the principal health practitioner is not available, or not in a position to make the open disclosure, the health services provider will identify an appropriate health practitioner to make the disclosure.</p> <p> Section 14 requires the health services provider to take all reasonable steps to make the disclosure to the patient and-or his or her relevant person as soon as practicable, having regard to the circumstances of the notifiable patient safety incident.  Section 15 details matters to be addressed by the health services provider before making the open disclosure of the notifiable patient safety incident.  These matters include the appropriate time, given an assessment of the circumstances; to whom the disclosure should be made; the making of an apology; the complexity of the information; the assignment of a designated person to liaise with the patient; and preparing a statement in writing about the incident.</p> <p> Section 16 provides for the designation by health services providers of a person to act as a designated contact person for the patient or family in relation to the open disclosure.  Section 17 requires that the open disclosure meeting will be held in person, unless the patient and-or his or her relevant person requests that it be held by telephone or other method of communication.  Again, this shows the patient-centred approach.</p> <p> Section 18 requires the health services provider to make arrangements for the open disclosure meeting with the patient and-or his or her relevant person.  This includes the information that must be given orally at the meeting and in writing within five days of it.  This is important as somebody could be at a vulnerable stage of his or her life.  The person would be going into a meeting with much information coming at him or her.  This measure of a recap of that information in writing is important.  This information must include names of the persons present at the meeting; a description of the incident concerned; the manner in which the incident came to the notice of the health services provider; the physical and psychological consequences of the incident for the patient; the treatment and care plan for the patient relating to any of the consequences arising out of the incident; actions, policies or procedures proposed or that have been taken by the health services provider to address the incident; and any apology to be made to the patient.</p> <p> Section 19 makes it clear that a patient may choose not to participate in the open disclosure of a notifiable incident or may decline to accept written information regarding the incident.  However, the patient may change his or her mind within five years from the day of refusal and request the health services provider to make the open disclosure.  The provider is also required to keep a record of the refusal.</p> <p> Section 20 requires a health services provider to take all necessary steps to contact a patient to arrange an open disclosure meeting.  If a health services provider is unable to make contact with a patient, it must set out in writing the steps taken to establish contact.  If the patient is later contacted, the health services provider must proceed to hold an open disclosure meeting.</p> <p> Sections 21 and 22 contain provisions relating to a health services provider holding additional meetings with the patient and-or his or her relevant person to provide information that may not have been available originally.  Section 23 provides that a patient, or relevant person, who attended an open disclosure meeting may, at any time, make a request to the designated person for clarification about the information provided.  The clarification should be provided orally at a meeting and in writing as soon as practicable, either by the health practitioner who previously made the open disclosure or an appropriate alternative person, if necessary.</p> <p> Section 24 sets out that a provider must provide the patient with a written statement on the incident either at the relevant meeting and not later than five days from the day on which the meeting was held.  Section 25 details the records that must be maintained by the health services provider about a notifiable patient safety incident.  The Minister may also prescribe in regulations the format of records to be kept and maintained.</p> <p> Part 4 addresses the notification to certain regulatory bodies of notifiable incidents.  Section 26 is the interpretation section for Part 4.  Sections 27 to 29, inclusive, set out that a health services provider under the remit of HIQA, the Chief Inspector of Social Services or the Mental Health Commission, as appropriate, will make a notification as soon as practicable and not later than seven days from when the provider is satisfied that an incident has occurred.  The notifiable incidents are those specified in Schedule 1 and those specified in regulations to be made under section 8.  The notification must include the name of the health services provider; the type of incident that has occurred; the date the notifiable incident came to the notice of the health services provider; any action that is being taken, or is proposed to be taken, to prevent a reoccurrence, or mitigate the consequences of any similar incident and for the purposes of sharing the knowledge and learning arising from it.</p> <p> Section 30 provides that the method for making notifications to the bodies will be by means of the National Treasury Management Agency incident management system.  Section 31 provides where a notifiable patient safety incident is reported to the relevant regulatory body, the regulator may request further information from the health services provider.  Again, we are trying to learn from more than just individual incidents.  If HIQA or the Mental Health Commission has to be notified of these incidents, it will create a wealth of information about patient safety standards across our health and social services.</p> <p> Section 32 provides that the regulatory bodies may share information on these incidents with other health regulatory bodies, as well as with coroners, for the purposes of the safety of patients and if the information relates to the function of the relevant body.  Section 33 clarifies information relating to these notifications, including further information or sharing information, will not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability; be admissible as evidence of fault; invalidate insurance; or constitute an express or implied admission by a health practitioner of fault, professional misconduct, poor professional performance, unfitness to practise a health service, or other failure or omission relating to notifying a notifiable patient safety incident.</p> <p> Section 34 provides, in respect of a notification made under Part 4 to a regulator, that the Freedom of Information Act 2014 will not apply to a record of or relating to that notification.  Again, the purpose of these legislative protections, in line with international experience, is to encourage health services providers and health practitioners to comply with this requirement to notify the regulators of notifiable patient safety incidents without fear.</p> <p> Part 5 addresses clinical audit.  Section 35 deals with the interpretation for Part 5 and contains definitions of the terms "clinical audit", "clinical standard", "clinical guideline", "aggregated data" and "clinically-led".  Section 36 provides detailed definitions of the terms &ldquo;clinical audit&rdquo; and &ldquo;clinical guideline&rdquo;.  The definitions of &ldquo;clinical audit&rdquo;, &ldquo;clinical standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;clinical guideline&rdquo; are key to this Part in that a health services provider or a health practitioner who undertakes and publishes an audit may only seek protection from the Freedom of Information Act 2014 in respect of a clinical audit that has been conducted in accordance with the definitions in this Bill.</p> <p> Section 37 details how a clinical audit to which this Part applies should be carried out.  It should be collected solely for the purpose of improving patient safety and quality improvement, and published as aggregated information.  Section 38 provides that a record of a clinical audit, a component of or information provided in respect of a clinical audit, to which this Part applies, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  Section 39 contains legislative protections on clinical audits, in similar terms to sections 10 and 33.</p> <p> Part 6 deals with the amendment of the Act of 2007 in order to extend HIQA's remit to the private hospital sector, a long overdue measure.  Section 40 amends the definitions section of the Health Act 2007 to reflect the requirements of this Bill.  Section 41 amends section 8 of the Health Act 2007 to allow for HIQA standards to apply to both public and private healthcare services.  Section 42 deals with investigations by HIQA where the agency believes there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of people receiving a particular service.  Investigations may be carried out by HIQA on its own initiative or where required by the Minister for Health or Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, as the case may be.  This section amends section 9 of the 2007 Act to take account of the investigations into services provided by private healthcare providers.</p> <p> Section 43 amends section 10 of the Health Act 2007 to enable HIQA to set standards for the private healthcare sector.  Section 44 amends section 12 of the Health Act 2007 to include private healthcare providers as being among the bodies which HIQA may require to provide information or statistics in order to determine the level of compliance by these organisations with standards set by HIQA.  Section 45 amends section 73 of the Health Act 2007 to also apply to premises owned, used or proposed to be used by a private hospital or a  prescribed private health service.  Section 46 amends section 78 of the Health Act 2007 so that HIQA may publish a report relating  to the monitoring of compliance with standards by private hospitals.  Section 47 provides that the Minister may prescribe, by regulation, a health service to be a prescribed private health service for the purposes of this legislation.</p> <p>Section 48 repeals section 100 of the Health Act 2007, an aspect of the Act that has not proven to be necessary during the period of the Act's operation.</p> <p> Part 7 addresses the offences and penalties.  Section 49 sets out that a health services provider who fails to comply with the obligation to make an open disclosure of a notifiable patient safety incident, without reasonable excuse, shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  A health services provider who fails to comply with the obligation to report a notifiable patient safety incident externally to the appropriate body will be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.  In many situations where patients are harmed, the error or mistake occurred because systems were not in place to support the healthcare practitioner or team in identifying and avoiding that error.  For this reason, in this section the consequences for failing to comply with mandatory open disclosure and notification are placed on health services providers. </p> <p> Part 8 deals with miscellaneous and general matters.  Section 50 provides that the Minister for Health may publish guidelines on the operation of, and compliance with the Bill and regulations made under it.  Section 51 provides that the Minister has the power to make regulations for any matters prescribed or to be prescribed in the Bill.  Section 52 amends section 11 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 so the National Treasury Management Agency may provide the incident management system as the means of making the notification regarding a notifiable incident to the regulatory bodies.</p> <p> Section 53 provides for the amendment of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 in the manner specified in Schedule 2.  Section 54 contains the savings and transitional provisions.  Where a health services provider makes an open disclosure in accordance with Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 of an incident which would be a notifiable incident under this Bill before coming into operation of this legislation, Part 4 of the Act of 2017 shall continue to apply to that open disclosure. </p> <p> In Schedule 1, Part 1 includes a list of 12 unintended or unanticipated notifiable patient safety incidents that are of a very serious nature and which mostly fall into the category of preventable incidents.  In Schedule 1, Part 2 includes a notifiable incident for situations in which a baby is referred for therapeutic hypothermia.  This is included as an indicator for neonatal conditions, for example.  As outlined, under section 8, the Minister through regulations will have the power to designate, on an ongoing basis, additional incidents as notifiable patient safety incidents for which mandatory open disclosure is required.  Schedule 2 deals with amendments to the Act of 2017.  This Schedule details the amendments to the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, in order to align with this Bill.</p> <p> In the time available I have endeavoured to take Members through as much of this very comprehensive Bill as I could.  It deals with a number of important aspects of patient safety priorities, including mandatory open disclosure of serious notifiable patient safety incidents, external notification to the regulator, provisions regarding clinical audit, and for the first time the extension of HIQA's remit to the private healthcare system.</p> <p> I am confident that the Bill will bring significant improvement in patient safety and quality.  I commend the legislation to the House and I look forward to a detailed and robust scrutiny of the Bill, and hopefully its swift passage in coming weeks as we try to finally get this much-needed legislation on the Statute Book.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-12a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121200026#DD00200"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this long-overdue legislation which underwent scrutiny at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last year.  Patients must be able to trust that they are getting from their doctors the full facts about their own medical tests and conditions, including any adverse events and errors that have happened.  Those doctors and healthcare professionals must feel free to be able to share this information with patients and to do so without fear of legal consequences.</p><p>The Bill represents a serious, healthy and necessary legal change for the environment in which our healthcare professionals will be working.  However, it has taken far too long for the legislation to come before the House and does so in the final few months of this D&aacute;il.  In 2016 when the Taoiseach was Minister for Health he said he would not introduce mandatory reporting.  This was in spite of his promising in 2015 that he would introduce mandatory reporting.  Until the CervicalCheck crisis arose, the Minister, Deputy Harris, had decided to introduce voluntary open disclosure rather than the mandatory scheme outlined in the Bill.  The HSE published its disclosure guidelines in 2012 and its national healthcare charter from that year states: &quot;Patients can expect open and appropriate communication throughout their care, especially when plans change or if something goes wrong.&quot;</p><p>We are finally debating this Bill four years after the then Minister and now Taoiseach boasted about preparing a wide-ranging package of patient safety measures when it came to disclosure and eight years after the then Minister, Senator Reilly, promised a patient safety authority that was never established.  There has been a complete lack of urgency from successive Fine Gael-led Governments when it comes to open disclosure and patient safety.</p><p>It is critical that patients know the full facts and we all know this did not happen in the case of CervicalCheck.  We have all pointed criticism at CervicalCheck, some of which is very necessary.  It is worth acknowledging that no other country even tried to do what CervicalCheck tried to do with its historical audit in looking back at every case and telling the women affected.  Ireland is the only country where an attempt was even made to communicate with the women.  There was some limited implementation of this in the British National Health Service, NHS, but it does not exist anywhere else.</p><p>However, it did not reach the bar it set for itself and as we all know many women were very badly let down.  In most cases the information was communicated to the doctors, but for a variety of reasons outlined in the Scally report and through debate over the last year and a half, we know that much of this critical information was not communicated to women or their families.  It should have happened and this legislation will help ensure it happens in the future.</p><p>We know about the cases from the 221+ group.  However, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, review has revealed many more women who did not know.  With her permission the case of Ms Bernadette Kiely has been referenced openly in this Chamber previously.  In this case a CervicalCheck audit had found discordance.  None of this was communicated to Ms Kiely.  She was not included in the 221+ group as she should have been.  Just as worryingly, when she got her RCOG review results which found the discordance and referenced the CervicalCheck audit, she then approached the HSE and asked to join the 221+ group but was told she could not.  She only got her patient files when her solicitor acted on her behalf.  Even now they have not been provided with all the relevant files.</p><p>I have read through the file in detail and believe she is unambiguously entitled to the <i>ex gratia</i>payment of &euro;20,000.  However, when Ms Kiely and her solicitor asked that she be eligible to the payment, she was told by the HSE that she was not entitled to it.  She was then told to find whatever receipts she could from her previous medical care, including drugs and that if she could pull these together the HSE would reimburse her.  We have a long way to go in full open disclosure and in reacting properly to women who have not received disclosure.</p><p>Three days ago, in a clinic in Wicklow I met a lady who was part of the RCOG review and where discordance was found.  She came to me because she is still completely at sea.  She does not know if she is entitled to the &euro;2,000, which I think she should be.  I believe they all should be entitled to that even though we read in the newspapers that they are not.  Although she has not been told about any previous CervicalCheck audit, the discordance was found from a 2014 smear test, which indicates to me there probably was an audit.  She said she is now required to fill out sheaves of paper and forms and has not got the support she needs.</p><p>I am not making any political points here; we all want what is best.  However, we need to do much better in supporting these women in open disclosure and critically in supporting them after open disclosure.  Over many years we have all dealt with heartbreaking cases of people who have fought the system and, in many cases, lost because the State wields the threat of legal action and legal costs like a weapon against largely defenceless citizens.  In denying them access - I have met, as the Minister may have done, parents whose baby died during childbirth.  Audits were conducted and there was a thorough look-back at what happened.  Errors were found but all of this was hidden and kept from the parents.</p></speech>
