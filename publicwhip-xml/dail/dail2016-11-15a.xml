    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500003#A00200"><p>Going back to 1962 in that seminal document, Investment in Education, and the opening of the first regional technical colleges in 1970, our institutes of technology, ITs, have been a linchpin of Ireland's economic and social development.  They have provided thousands of graduates to industries across the regions and in Dublin in the life sciences, med tech, pharma, retail management, culinary skills, tourism, technology and the professions.  A recent comprehensive and substantive report by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, into the financial capacity of the institutes provides very stark reading.  The report highlights the necessity and imperative of investing in third level education, a critical aspect of our infrastructure which is key to future jobs and, especially, attracting inward investment and creating raw material in graduates for our indigenous enterprises.  The HEA is saying the sector is on its knees financially.</p>  <p>  Since 2008, there has been a 34% reduction in State funding and a 24% increase in the number of students.  Since 2012, capital funding has decreased by 49%.  These are extraordinary figures.  Staffing levels are down 12%.  There is an immediate cashflow crisis.  Ten out of the 14 colleges are experiencing particular challenges, according to the report.  In aggregate, the sector is in deficit and will remain in deficit for the next five years.  There is a continuing ongoing major deficit in capital maintenance and renewal.  What is striking is that, by the HEA's own admission, science and engineering, the STEM subjects in the institutes, have been disincentivised by the funding model.  This has been going on for years and people have been asleep at the wheel regarding the sector and its capacity to contribute to our economy.</p>  <p>  The report states that substantial capital investment is required immediately to meet the additional quality physical space needs.  It particularly identified ICT and science as areas where inroads could be made if the necessary funding were provided, and it would reinforce the technological mission of the colleges.  The budget was a missed opportunity.  Peter Cassells spelled out the university and IT sector.  For the future of the country, it is crucial that the Government gets to grips with it.</p>  <p>  What is the Government's plan to deal with the crippling financial situation in which our ITs find themselves?  How does the Taoiseach propose to create a new pathway for these institutes in the months ahead?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500003#A00300"><p>The third level sector has been a central plank of all Governments over the years.  We have always prided ourselves on the quality of the young people who emerge from universities and ITs.  This is in the context of the case Ireland continually makes for continued foreign direct investment.  ITs have always been a little more flexible than universities in how they can lead and react to changing demographics and the need for new kinds of skills.</p><p>However, the Deputy has put his finger on a question that is broader than this particular problem because the need for capital investment spreads across a series of sectors and, given the perilous states of the finances for a number of years and the fact that we are now in a somewhat better place than previously but face a whole series of challenges, including the need for capital expenditure to build infrastructure across the country, the House will have to face this and discuss it in the period ahead.</p> <p> There will be an investment of &euro;36.5 million in the third level sector next year and &euro;160 million over the next three years.  That is the first significant investment in the sector in nine years, a period in which State investment in higher education fell by &euro;463 million or 33%.  The allocation being made by the Minister for Education and Skills will allow us for the first time to keep pace with demographic increases and to introduce targeted initiatives, in particular, in disadvantaged areas, skills research and flexible learning with thousands of students benefitting under each heading.</p> <p> Second, to build on that initial investment, work has started on a new mechanism aimed at allowing Government to put in place a comprehensive multi-annual spending plan for the sector.  The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills are working on putting in place an appropriate multi-annual funding model for higher education and further education from 2018, in respect of which all the beneficiaries of the third-level sector can play a role.  I expect the Minster for Education and Skills to bring that proposition to Government by the middle of next year.</p> <p> Third, proposals need to be examined that can add to those two elements and put in place a sustainable plan for funding that can deliver a third-level system that can be world class for both the medium and long term.  Earlier this year, the Minister published the Cassells report - I have said that we need to debate it in the House - and, as committed to the in the programme for Government, that report is now currently with the Oireachtas committee.  Broad consensus is needed on the future direction and the Minister is working to build that consensus.</p> <p> It is accepted, of course, that there is a need for investment in capital infrastructure.  Some IoTs have managed, even with the difficulties they have had while others have not, and the deficit is there for all to see in the reports they have published.  I can give the Deputy the details of how it is proposed to spend the &euro;36.5 million in 2017.  I reiterate that is the first significant investment in the third-level sector in nine years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500004#B00200"><p>I am not convinced at all by the Taoiseach's reply.  This is about strategic direction and how we should take the country back.  In the 1960s, the likes of Donogh O'Malley, Paddy Hillery and Se&aacute;n Lemass had a vision about how to take the country forward and that is why they set up the regional technical colleges.  Their impact was extraordinary for the time.  I attended an event last week hosted by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and Cork Chamber of Commerce at which they were honouring Dick Lehane, who was one of the first employees of EMC in Cork.  He invited personnel from the old Cork Regional Technical College, including Larry Poland, and Professor Noel Mulcahy from the University of Limerick as his guests, underlining their central importance in the growth of EMC, which now employs thousands of people in the country and has done for many years.</p>  <p>  Strategic direction in respect of this sector is lacking and it was lacking in the budget as well.  The reports are there.  It is quite extraordinary that the HEA in its own report would state, "STEM provision has effectively been disincentivised in the IoT sector".  That is the technology sector and it is not incentivised to provide courses in information and communications technology, engineering and science.   That is an extraordinary position and a terrible indictment on the respective Ministers in charge of education in recent years to allow it to continue.  It is clear that, according to the report,  six of the IoTs face immediate sustainability challenges and four more are potentially at risk due to limited reserves.  The HEA, a State agency, is saying that the sector is in a critical crisis situation and I get no sense that the Government grasps this or will deal with it in a comprehensive and substantive way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500005#C00100"><p>The Government does get it and it understands what needs to be done here.  I point out to the Deputy, as I have done before, that he was an esteemed Minister for Education and Science.  The fact of the matter is that the taxpayers of this country were left with a &euro;64 billion debt to pay back for banks after the catastrophic management of the economy.  That is fact.  We are emerging from that.  The IoT review was based on an expectation of a static Exchequer contribution.  That is not what the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, intends to follow through with.</p><p>I refer Deputy Martin to what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, said in his speech on the budget:</p><blockquote>Ensuring education remains the linchpin of our economic success requires an intensified focus on a sustainable long-term [funding] model for higher and further education.  I am committed to this goal and building on the significant investment in education announced now.  </blockquote><p>He went on to say:</p><blockquote>The Minister for Education and Skills and I are, therefore, initiating a consultation process on the design and operation of an Exchequer-employer investment mechanism to operate from 2018 onwards.  This is also intended to drive continued reform, quality and performance across the sector, in line with the action plan for education.  </blockquote><p>The Government is not in a position to do everything one would like.  There is almost &euro;40 million investment this year for the first time in nine years and both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Education and Skills have a clear plan about how this should be dealt with.  We have to discuss the outcome of the Cassells report.  The Minister expects to bring his proposition for longer term, sustainable funding of the entire third level sector to Government by mid-2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500005#C00200"><p>Front-line workers in health, education, justice and transport have had to deal with a system that has had its budget cut to the bone.  The workload and work environment has gotten worse.  Pay has decreased and conditions have deteriorated.  Public sector workers have had &euro;12 billion taken from their pay while they work an additional 15 million hours a week.  New entrants since January 2011 start on a pay scale that is on average 10% less than their workmates.  The Government has no plan to address these issues.  There is no commitment to equal pay for equal work.  The mantra that the Lansdowne Road agreement is the only game in town just does not hold.  There is now a clear need for a new pay deal built upon fairness and equality for workers.  What the vast majority of workers want and deserve is the fair and timely unwinding of pay cuts, and pay restoration.  We know that cannot be achieved overnight but it can be timelined, which needs effective dialogue and the formation of a new pay agreement which lays out a clear, sensible path to the provision of full pay restoration.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, this must also be a process that prioritises those on low and middle incomes.  It must ensure pay equality for post-2011 entrants, beginning with the restoration of certain allowances for nurses, non-consultant doctors, teachers and garda&iacute;.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in our alternative budget, allowed for this.  The Government and Fianna F&aacute;il did not.  Any new agreement must also ensure the right to access the State's industrial relations machinery to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  It must also deliver a reduction in agency work and replace it with permanent public sector contracts.</p>  <p>  There is a notion, peddled by their detractors, that public sector workers are a protected species.  This may be so for some high earners but the vast majority of public sector workers are on low and middle incomes and they are absolutely crucial for the development of our public services.  These ongoing cynical efforts to divide public and private sector workers must be repudiated.  We need a strong, properly funded, resourced public sector because it is crucial to genuine economic and social progress.  An integral step to achieving that, if the Taoiseach believes in it, which I doubt, is to ensure that those working in the public sector enjoy equitable pay, conditions and certainty.  Private sector workers deserve this also.  Despite the Taoiseach's resistance thus far and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's attempts to appear more hard line than the Taoiseach, will the Taoiseach accept the very real need for urgent dialogue with the public sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500006#D00200"><p>Deputy Adams says we need a strong and properly resourced public sector.  Everyone can agree with that.  However, we need to have fairness across the board for every worker in the country.</p>  <p>  We have come through difficult times, as Deputy Adams is well aware.  He should understand that the Government, made up of its different elements, will not sacrifice the hard-won gains that have been achieved by the people in recent years.  We require a well-managed process that can look at the broader context of where the country is now and where we think it can be in five or ten years time.  That means not only looking at individual public services but at the public service in general as well as looking throughout the country for public and private workers.  There is a need to be fair in what we do.</p>  <p>  The Government has said that we stand by the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Estimates and the associated ceilings are set.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has acknowledged that the Labour Court recommendation brings added pressure to the responsibilities he must discharge.</p>  <p>  The Government will respond in this way.  It will set out a process that can be well managed, that will be in the interests of every worker in the country and that will provide for the betterment of public services generally, which is something that people need.</p>  <p>  I put it to Deputy Adams that the public service pay demands have to be balanced against the constraints upon the Minister and the Government.  There will be a collective whole-of-Government response.  This has to take into account the question of productivity gains in the delivery of better public services for everyone.  There must be fairness as part of this as well.</p>  <p>  The Government will respond collectively in setting out an agenda, structure and a strategy by which we can best manage the circumstances in which we now find ourselves as a country.  We must not have a situation whereby it becomes sector versus sector.  There should be fairness right across the board for public and private workers.  The Minister has asked his officials to deal with the relevant committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I think that meeting takes place this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500006#D00300"><p>I asked the Taoiseach about starting talks.  The Taoiseach ignored that question.  It was a simple proposition.  I asked him to start talks to try to find a pathway through these difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has said there needs to be fairness for all workers.  That is the exact opposite of what the Government is doing.  The Government stance is untenable and I believe the Taoiseach knows it.  He knows that, as we face into the winter, citizens will be alarmed at the potential for doctors and nurses to be on picket lines when we face into an accident and emergency department crisis.  We know that the largest public sector unions are either balloting for industrial action or indicating that is what they will do in future.  The Taoiseach has offered no solutions in any of his utterances so far.  He has not even suggested a process to find a solution, which is what I was asking him to do.  The Taoiseach might think of a different solution from what we might think up, but the process to find that has to begin.</p>  <p>  It is also clear that the Lansdowne Road agreement has run out of road.  I am saying to the Taoiseach that the process of reaching a new agreement must start.  Facing down workers and their unions will not work.  The Taoiseach should leave the macho posturing to the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.  Let him do all that strutting his stuff.  The Taoiseach is the Head of Government.  He should start the talking now and set the example.  We need a conversation and a negotiation.  Will the Taoiseach accept the need for dialogue without delay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500006#D00400"><p>I have said to Deputy Adams that the Government will respond to this collectively and set in place its strategy for a best managed way of dealing with the many challenges facing the Government, the economy and, in particular, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>A low was reached in 2013 of 260,700 public servants.  The corresponding figure was 285,400 in 2008.</p><p>The end of 2016 figure for public service employment is likely to be more than 279,000.  Given the requirement for additional public services and investment in them, possibly 8,000 to 9,000 recruits will be required every year.  The replacements for that reduction of more than 25,000 were mainly in the priority areas of nurses, garda&iacute;, teachers and so on.  In the interest of everybody, and to be fair to everyone, the Government is saying that we need a collective response.  The Lansdowne Road agreement has proved to be a central tenet of public pay in this country.  We stand by it.  The ceilings have been set out.  The Minister does not have the moneys being demanded, so there is a need, in everybody's interests, for a well-managed process and strategy by which these matters can be discussed in detail and a pathway forward negotiated.</p></speech>

It is in the interest of fairness across the board because we face external challenges as well arising from the decision of the UK and other international events that may have an impact upon the world economy and upon ours as an exporting nation.

As the Taoiseach knows, the construction of the hospital is a key part of the programme for Government, which we all support, and is something we all recognise as vitally important.  What we fundamentally disagree with is the suitability of the location.  The Connolly for Kids campaign, which is composed of paediatric health care professionals, parents of critically ill children and many organisations, such as the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, feels - we know this to be the case - it has been treated with contempt by successive Governments when it has tried to raise its concerns about this issue.  This is despite the fact that the Connolly for Kids group has over 100 years of professional health care and paediatric experience, which is a lot of experience that neither the Taoiseach nor I has in health care.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise with the Taoiseach the concerns about the runaway train of the hospital's construction costs.  The original estimate was &euro;480 million, but several newspaper reports and independent observers have now quoted the Government as admitting that it has exceeded &euro;1 billion, which more than double the cost.  What is staggering about this number is that it excludes the cost of any fit-out or IT equipment, and we all know the cost of fit-out and equipment for hospitals is millions and millions.  The &euro;500 million overrun costs for a single project represents almost half of the &euro;1.2 billion fiscal space the Government told us it had before the budget last year for spending the following year.  That &euro;500 million could have covered the cost of the Garda pay claims 12 times over; it could have allowed young teachers equal pay; it could have sorted out all the issues of the child care workers outside the D&aacute;il today, who littered us with details of their claims as we came in, and public servants; and it could have funded the many crisis points in our front-line health services, such as in Clonmel Hospital in south Tipperary.</p>  <p>  While we all accept that the original budgets are liable to be exceeded, this is phenomenal and staggering and must be reined in, or does the Taoiseach want to be remembered in 25 or 30 years' time for a report into this waste and these absurd costs?  This is the kind of runaway cost that not only threatens to deliver a disastrously located hospital that will put children's lives in danger - I do not say that lightly - but also substantially increases the likelihood of future costs to other areas of Government spending.  We know the impact that will have and the problems related to budgets and how tight they are.</p><p> The Minister for Health has said he came with no baggage to the Department.  His career is depending on this and I wish him well with his career.  Will he be remembered for this failure and abject overrun?  Will the Taoiseach deal with organisations such as the Connolly for Kids hospital campaign group and the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, which looks after the sickest of children?  They have been locked out of the hearings and even last week they were locked out and denied access.  Will the Taoiseach please give me a direct answer on how he will curtail costs and ensure that the money is better spent?  Will he try to rein in this runaway train?</p></speech>

Everybody should take pride in the fact that at long last we were in a position to make a decision that there would be a national children's hospital.  It was followed by a decision in respect of the location of the national children's hospital and the agreement from the planning process and An Bord Plean&aacute;la that it should go ahead.  Any of the associated costs will be for the single biggest construction project in this country for very many years, to look after all the children of the island, North and South, and it will be a magnificent achievement for a country that prides itself on family and children.  At long last they will have a world class facility for the next 50 years or beyond.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raises an important point regarding costs but these are all subject to being tendered in a competitive process.  I can inform the Deputy that what he raised will be the subject of a formal Government memo shortly, which will be brought by the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Health to the Government.  The issues raised in general about the range and costs will be central to that memo.  Specifically, there will be a focus on the value-for-money process involved.  The matter will be the subject of a formal memo very shortly and, arising from that, I hope everybody will understand the scale, nature and requirement of this particular project, which is in the interests of all the children of this island for the next two generations at least.</p></speech>

If the new national children's hospital were located at the Connolly site, as has been sought by the vast majority of parents of sick children, there would be access to the Rotunda for maternity services.  It is crazy.  There cannot be a hospital for sick children without having access to or co-location with a maternity hospital.  Many of us know that and I know it from my own experience with a grandchild.  It is absolutely vital that the national children's hospital and maternity services are co-located.  It is not rocket science and all experts will say that, even those with European and international experience.</p>  <p>  There is something rotten here and the Taoiseach mentioned runaway trains.  This is a runaway train of costs and a memo from any Minister is not going to stop it.  There will be a need for serious oversight on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General and perhaps an inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts.  No tendering process can account from the cost more than doubling from &euro;480 million to over a &euro;1 billion without any fit-out costs.</p><p>The Taoiseach should think about the staggering figures, pinch himself and ask the new Minister about them.  This cannot be allowed to continue because we will end up having inquiries about it in here in years to come.</p></speech>

Money is on the table for that.

It is now up to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and presumably the Cabinet, to accept or reject this acquisition.  Earlier this year, a report authored by Dr. Roddy Flynn of Dublin City University identified the concentration of media ownership in Ireland as a &quot;high risk&quot;.  That was echoed earlier this year in a European Commission report, which found that the position in Ireland was the subject of the highest level of concern and identified a lack of legal barriers as an issue.  Nessa Childers MEP held a conference earlier this year at which Dr. Flynn's findings were reported.  More recently, Lynn Boylan, MEP, commissioned an EU Parliament report, the findings of which expressed similarly grave concerns regarding the media landscape in Ireland.</p><p>It is difficult to understand how an agency involved in consumer protection could approve the proposed acquisition, particularly in a sector that has the potential to undermine our democracy.  INM publishes the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, the <i>Evening Herald</i>, the <i>Sunday World</i>and the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  It has a 50% stake in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>and controls 13 paid-for regional weekly newspapers.  If INM's acquisition of the Celtic Media group goes ahead, it will control 28 regional titles across the country in addition to the national titles I have mentioned.  The radio sector is also relevant in this context.  Communicorp, which is owned by the same majority shareholder as INM, controls Newstalk, Today FM, 98FM, Spin 103 and Spin South West, or approximately 20% of the entire radio market.  Although I appreciate that print and broadcast media are different, it is essential for the cross-ownership of INM and Communicorp to be considered in tandem.</p><p>As the Taoiseach knows, the Competition Act 2002 does not allow competition restrictions on media ownership to be retrospective.  This raises further questions about the permitting of the proposed acquisition.  If there is already a problem with the over-concentration of media ownership, why would the Government make that situation worse?  That is the obvious question.  While media concentration is an issue in its own right, the ownership of such a large proportion of our print broadcasting and digital media by someone who has consistently used the courts to create a chilling effect on journalists and other media outlets has to be questioned in the most serious terms.  The person to whom I refer, Denis O'Brien, was the subject of adverse findings in the Moriarty tribunal, as the Taoiseach is aware.  This media acquisition is clearly against the public interest.  It is essential that vested interests are not once again placed ahead of the public interest.  Will the Taoiseach oppose this acquisition?  Given the changing nature of media, does he support the National Union of Journalists' call to initiate a public commission on the future of the media to examine ownership, editorial control, employment standards including pension rights and measures to protect editorial independence?  Does he believe State supports may be appropriate to ensure there is diversity of media ownership across all platforms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500009#G01100"><p>No, I do not support the call mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p><p>This report was commissioned by Lynn Boylan MEP and was based on a legal opinion from two firms based in London and Belfast, both of which primarily work in the field of human rights.  The report seems to have been prompted in part by the 2015 report of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, a centre based in Florida and funded by the European Commission, which was published in March 2016.</p> <p> I think everybody can agree that a free and pluralistic media is an essential component of a modern democracy.  The report mentioned by the Deputy is being examined by the Minster for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the basis of his responsibility for media plurality.  I understand he is to answer questions in the House tomorrow on that.  In addition to operating the media mergers regime provided for in the revised Competition (Amendment) Act 2012, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment engages with the European Commission and the Council of Europe on all issues relating to media freedom and plurality.</p> <p> It is also important to say that many of the issues and conclusions raised in the report were debated in the House during the passage of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, which revised the Competition Act 2002.  As the Deputy is aware, the 2014 Act gives the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment the power to block any media merger that is deemed likely to be contrary to the public interest in maintaining the plurality of media in the State.  Therefore, I do not see any reason for the setting up of a commission of inquiry into the matter.  The Act did not give the Minister the power to act retrospectively or to assess a media business in the absence of a proposed merger, as to do so would be to interfere with the property rights enshrined in Article 43 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which would raise a myriad of legal complexities.  Simply stating that it is legally possible to do so does not address any of the legal complexities involved and does not recognise the effect such a move could have on freedom of expression and investment in the sector.  In fact, the report itself recognises this is an extremely difficult area that would raise issues regarding property rights, market effects, procedural fairness and freedom of expression considerations.</p></speech>

The Constitution certainly does include a section on property rights but all rights have to be balanced and, indeed, the section in the Constitution is balanced by a second section which deals with the common good.  Essentially, the point I am making is that there is no reason for the Government to make matters worse where there is already a demonstrated difficulty with the excessive concentration of media ownership.  Why would it do that when retrospection is not permitted, according to the Taoiseach, although I believe that is open to challenge in the courts?</p>  <p>  To take the position in rural areas, which I do not need to describe to the Taoiseach, the more concentrated media ownership gets in rural areas, the less informed people are going to become.  What is proposed is that the current CEO of Celtic Media would become the managing director of all 28 INM regional titles.  This would mean the possibility of cross-selling of advertising and the possibility that people in rural areas will not be able to go into Eason's, for example, and pick up alternative newspapers.  The retrospection aspect is one that must be taken very seriously.  What is the Taoiseach's view of this acquisition of the Celtic Media group?</p></speech>

A report published today makes it clear that certain parts of rural Ireland have broadband speeds 36 times lower than those available in the capital.  That is a further illustration of the two-tiered nature of economic activity in the country and the degree to which the last Government dropped the ball in respect of rural connectivity.  Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Leitrim are counties that have been forced to accept speeds of 2 Mbps when users in Dublin are accessing broadband at well in excess of 30 or 40 Mbps.  The Taoiseach can take it that is having a negative impact on small to medium-sized businesses.  There is a long way to go to connect rural communities effectively.  I recall talking to officials at the time of the formation of the Government with Independents and all of the public tender issues and so on.  The timeline keeps being postponed.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has the capacity and will he indicate to us when he sees the programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment in place?</p>  <p>  I am delighted that Deputy Moran is alongside the Taoiseach.  I am not sure whether I missed something or did he get promoted?  I know he tossed a coin with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Canney, who might be away now.</p></speech>

Everybody appreciates the potential value of broadband.  There are many areas in the country in which it is grossly inadequate.  Over &euro;2 billion has been invested by the industry in upgrading telecoms, networks and services over the past four years.  About 1.3 million homes and businesses can access high-speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps.  This is not confined to urban areas and towns.  Many areas throughout the country have that consistency of speed.  However, it is clearly inadequate.  As Deputy Martin is aware, the Government changed the legislation that allowed for a service provider to work with another entity.  In this case, Vodafone and ESB amalgamated to form SIRO.  It is now in the business of providing 56,000 homes with high-speed broadband.  Eir itself has invested heavily over the last period.  The Government has done a very extensive amount of work in preparation for a most complex tender to allow for a roll-out of a competition to supply all of those other areas that are beyond the commercial capacity of the industry providers.  That is going to involve very extensive trenching to bring fibre directly to the home, consisting of fibre to the cabinet, which a distance from every home.  It will be next year before it is completed and before the tender can be issued.  Whoever wins that will commence a roll-out.  It is not legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has been quite detailed on this.  He can send the Deputy the up-to-date provisions if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

I commend Safe Ireland on organising a summit on domestic violence.  The issue of domestic violence is one which has not received the priority it requires from this or previous Governments.  Research published by Safe Ireland shows that one in three women experience severe psychological violence while one in four experience sexual or physical violence at the hands of their partners.  The absence of any firm commitment by the Government to increase funding for domestic violence refuges, step-down accommodation and other support services is also causing great concern and putting real pressure on the victims.  A consolidated domestic violence Bill is an essential part of ratifying the Istanbul convention.  When will it be published and when will the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill, which is linked to this issue, be published?</p></speech>

What they are doing is insisting that families sign up to the fair deal scheme before they allow them to stay in the general hospitals or before they are transferred to the step-down district and community hospitals.  What are the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach going to do about this?  Are they in charge of health or not?</p></speech>

My question is whether similar amendments can be introduced into the Defence Forces legislation in light of the case that is being taken to the European Committee of Social Rights by the armed forces' organisations, namely, PDFORRA and RACO.  I had occasion last week to raise the matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, and on foot of doing so my office received a flood of responses from soldiers as well as Naval Service and Air Corps personnel who told me in confidence of the wretched and illegal working conditions they are forced into.  They feel an unjustifiable advantage is being taken of armed forces personnel by the Government.  Does the Government intend to introduce a similar amendment to grant the same rights to soldiers?</p></speech>

In my view, that would raise rents further and put money into the pockets of landlords rather than address the issue of rent control.  Is another piece of legislation planned to deal with the issue or will it come in the form of an amendment to the legislation that is going before the Seanad?

I asked him if he would act on the Kerr report, and I also asked him if there was a need to introduce legislation to give a new lease of life to post offices.  The Taoiseach gave me an assurance on the day but from reading the print press in recent days, it is now clear that the post office network is collapsing and it is disgraceful that the Government is sitting on its hands, as it were, and doing nothing.  When we speak about the post office service, the reality is that old people and those with a disability use the post office more than any other people.

I point out to the Deputy that the Government already committed to the basic bank account for post offices to be delivered through the Department of Social Protection.  I point out to him also that many people are now doing their business online.  As the Deputy well knows, a service will only survive if it is being used by people.  I have evidence of a number of postmasters and postmistresses retiring but nobody in the community wanting to continue to provide a service.  We cannot do anything about that.  The Government is very open to giving every opportunity to post offices but the Deputy will have to bear in mind that times are changing and that people are the only ones who can keep a post office open by using the services it provides.  The debate will take place this evening.</p></speech>

Given that commitment to both local government and a regional jobs spread, will the Smiddy plan to merge Cork County Council and Cork City Council, which has been torn apart by the independent UCC report, be abandoned now and instead will an enhanced and strengthened Cork city and a strengthened local government be pursued to create that economic counterbalance to Dublin?</p></speech>

It is a matter for the elected representatives in Cork.  I point out to the Deputy that there has been significant investment in Cork in recent years.  It is a city that is progressing strongly and favourably when we look at the investment in roads and infrastructure, the foreign direct investment in terms of the many major firms in Cork, and the improvement in public facilities in Cork.  The city has changed radically over ten years and will again over the next ten.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs is now divided into eight regions.  The requirement upon the Minister is to deliver 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of those to go to the regions.  Cork city in particular and the greater Cork city area have been a very strong magnet in recent years for serious job investment and I am quite sure people would like to see that spread out.  I commend the dimension in Skibbereen, which proves that where a community pulls together and attracts investment for broadband, for instance, the opportunities are greatly strengthened<i>.</i></p></speech>

We have a case only this week in Globe House in Sligo where a Kurdish man, Mr. Amjad Rosstami, has spent 35 days on hunger strike.  That particular case may be dealt with but it certainly highlights the fact there are 5,000 people in this country in direct provision centres, many of them for many years.  I am sure, as was stated in the Calais debate here, everyone on all sides of the House recognises we have an obligation to help these people who come from repressive regimes and war-torn places around the world, and to throw them into these inappropriate positions and leave them there for time on end is wrong.  I am asking the Taoiseach if he will make a commitment that this Government will end the direct provision system and treat our refugees with humanity in an efficient matter so that they can be sorted out quickly.</p></speech>

The Government today considered a report in respect of child care from the rapporteur, Dr. Shannon, that contained 97 recommendations, one of which is that direct provision should be abolished.  I would make the point to the Deputy that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, who has done an extensive amount of work in this area, has been visiting all of the direct provision centres.  Obviously, this requires a strategy and a process by which people who come here as refugees or asylum seekers, who have in the past been sent to direct provision facilities, be given the best level of attention that we can give them, as refugees and asylum seekers.</p></speech>

Cork Airport is the second largest airport in the country and while there is much abhorrence and horror expressed about President-elect Trump's vision of building a wall, the Administration preceding his in America has already built a wall in the skies which has prevented all transatlantic traffic coming into the second largest airport in this country.  It is not for safety reasons.  It is not for commercial reasons.  It is purely on the basis of political reasons that they will not allow this to go ahead.  I have been in contact on numerous occasions with Mr. Dan Katz, chief of staff in the office of the US Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Foxx.  There is a political deadlock.  Now that there is a new regime coming in to America, would the Taoiseach be prepared to lead a delegation to Washington to ask that the politics be taken out of this and Norwegian airlines be allowed to build a route and a connection between Cork and Washington?</p></speech>

The Government supports this opportunity and potential for Norwegian airlines to be able to fly the Atlantic and land in Cork, with benefits for Shannon and, to a lesser extent, Knock.  Obviously, it is something people would very much welcome.</p>  <p>  This matter has been raised by Ministers over the past couple of years on many occasions.  I myself had the opportunity to raise it directly with the President of the United States on two successive St. Patrick's week visits and following that, the American union of airline pilots, which, I understand, was blocking this for some time, lifted that blockage and stated it would be happy to go ahead provided that the pilots to be appointed were paid at European and American rates - there was a fear that it would be pilots from the Far East only who would be employed at lower rates.</p><p>To reply to Deputy Daly, I will be happy to continue to make a case for this as it would be of substantial benefit to the country.</p></speech>

There is no plan or vision from the Government for the third level sector.  The Action Plan for Education was published some months ago and it contains only two lines about third level funding.  There were a further two lines in the budget stating that a funding plan for third level education would be put in place.  Part of the ranking assessments take account of the reputational issues of universities.  Another matter that is taken into account is whether there is a sense that the Government has a vision for third level education and provides support for it.  The perception abroad is that the Government has no interest whatsoever in the third level sector.  We had to fight hard to get the little amount of funding the Government has granted to it.  The Government must get a grip and draft a vision and a plan, because there is nothing in the Action Plan for Education and it affects the future of the country.</p></speech>

This is the first time in nine years that a significant investment has been made in the third level sector.  It is almost &euro;40 million.  Not two sentences but two full paragraphs in the Minister's speech were about third level education.  It is the intention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to bring forward a strategy for long-term sustainable investment in the third level sector by the middle of next year.  The House must discuss the realistic issues involved in capital investment for third level education.  It is a critical issue with regard to the type of opportunities that will arise in the future in the context of the new advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, data analytics and other such areas where Ireland can be a world leader.  That requires a very strong third level sector but, unfortunately, due to lack of investment in the past, that did not happen.  It is starting now with an initial allocation of &euro;39.5 million.</p></speech>

The Bill contains a number of measures including one regarding the amount of compensation made in the compulsory acquisition of land and proposes the implementation of the recommendations in the Kenny report of 1973, following on from the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which examined the proposals in 2004 and found that they did not contravene the Constitution regarding the balance between private property rights and social good.  The Bill contains controls on the amount of profit vulture funds can make when they acquire distressed properties.  It also deals with reference rents for various parts of the country which the PRTB would set based on average rents in different parts of the country.</p><p>One provision which received much discussion was that rents should be controlled in a way that links them to the consumer price index so people who are renting would have some security regarding how much their rents could increase in that they would be directly related to the cost of living.  The Bill has a provision regarding security of tenure whereby if a property is being sold, a person who has a lease cannot be put out in order to provide vacant possession for the purchaser.  This is an important measure relating to security for renters.  The Bill proposes to bring the vacant sites levy forward from 2018, which is in the legislation, to 2017.  The Bill also contains a number of other related matters.</p></speech>

The reports contained 38 recommendations, 18 of which would involve change in the text of the Constitution.  The main recommendations for referendums and the response to them were as follows.</p>  <p>  In its first report, the convention recommended that the age threshold for candidacy in presidential elections be reduced from 35 years.  A referendum on this was defeated on 22 May 2015.  A recommendation to reduce the voting age to 16 was accepted but a referendum was not held on the matter.  There are no proposals to proceed with such a referendum.</p>  <p>  In the convention's second report, the reference in Article 41.2 of the Constitution to "a woman's life within the home" was considered.  The programme for a partnership Government commits the Government to holding a referendum on this issue.</p>  <p>  In its third report, the convention recommended an amendment to the Constitution to provide for same-sex marriage.  A referendum on marriage equality was held on 22 May 2015 and was passed by a majority of 62.1%.</p>  <p>  The convention's fourth report made recommendations on the electoral system.  A recommendation for a referendum to permit the appointment of non-Oireachtas members as Ministers was not accepted, given that the Constitution already allows the Taoiseach to nominate as Ministers two persons who have not been elected to the Oireachtas but have been nominated to the Seanad.  The recommendation that Ministers be required to resign their D&aacute;il seats on appointment to office was not accepted.  The convention did not put forward proposals on how the resultant D&aacute;il vacancies might be filled.</p><p>In respect of the fifth report, on amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, the previous Government indicated that it was necessary to analyse the full range of practical and policy issues that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise before a decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  That analysis is ongoing and will be considered by the Government in due course.</p> <p> As regards the sixth report, on the offence of blasphemy, the programme for Government states that a referendum will be held on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.</p> <p> The seventh report made recommendations relating to D&aacute;il reform, some of which would have involved a referendum.  The House will be aware that Standing Orders were amended in January of this year to provide for the direct election of the Ceann Cornhairle by secret ballot and the selection of Oireachtas committee chairs on a proportional basis using the D&rsquo;Hondt system.  Both these steps were in line with recommendations made by the convention and did not require a  referendum.  The programme of reform in the current D&aacute;il builds on those reforms introduced by the previous Government and reflects many of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  The programme for Government commits the Government to a referendum on enhancing the reference to the Ceann Comhairle in the Constitution.  The Ceann Comhairle will be glad of that.</p> <p> As regards the convention&rsquo;s eighth report, the programme for Government states this report, on economic, social and cultural rights, will be referred to the new Oireachtas Committee on Housing for consideration of the substantial questions it raises on the balance of rights, proper governance and resources.</p> <p> The convention's ninth report did not make recommendations for constitutional change.  There are no plans otherwise to implement convention recommendations for referenda that were not accepted by the last Government other than as set out in the programme for Government.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500018#Q00200"><p>When the convention was established in 2012, we said at the time it was too general, it involved many non-urgent issues, it was unfocused and some of those issues should have been dealt with upfront at the time rather than being put to a constitutional convention.  It is important, as the Taoiseach has noted, that recommendations that have yet to be voted on in this D&aacute;il include popular nomination for the presidency, a full franchise for 16 year olds, gender neutral terminology in the Constitution, presidential votes for emigrants, decriminalisation of blasphemy and inclusion of justiciable economic and social rights.  The hype with which the convention was established was always going to end with recommendations gathering dust in Government Buildings and relatively minor amendments to the Constitution.</p>  <p>  In the case of marriage equality, it is arguable that the convention was a means of delaying the proposal for two years because all political parties bar the Taoiseach's had two years earlier committed to holding such a referendum.  What, if anything, will be done on recommendations to which there has been no proper response and for which there is no clear public demand, for example, the extension of voting in presidential election to Irish citizens abroad?  Every party in the previous D&aacute;il supported this.  Prior to the general election in October 2015, former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, informed the House that work was under way on designing a proposal that could be brought to the House.  Where has that gone?  The former Minister of State indicated that a great deal of work was being done to design such a proposal.  The next presidential election will take place in less than two years.  If the complex job of creating an electoral register and a polling scheme is to be completed, work needs to begin soon.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to fulfil the promise of an emigrant vote for the 2018 presidential election or is that too close for anything realistically to be done?  What is the Government's exact position on that specific proposal and the other issues I have raised?</p>  <p>  My second question in this group is quite separate in a way but I accept it has to be taken because it is in the context of the convention.  It relates to justiciable economic and social rights.  The convention recommended that these be inserted in the Constitution but be subject to a resources limit.  That would be the only example of such an approach in a common law system if that was enacted.  The Government put this on the agenda first when it referred these issues to the convention and now it is quietly running away from that particular idea.  A demand for justiciable rights in the Constitution is commonly heard but the work has not been done on what it would mean in practice.  The recommendation includes a provision that would set a limit on available resources.  What that would mean in practice is unclear.  What work has been done on defining the impact of this proposal?</p>  <p>  As we have witnessed frequently in past referenda, failing to produce detailed studies of the consequences of a proposal can cause a destructive and negative debate during the ensuing campaign.  Will the Taoiseach outline what provision has been made for holding referenda in the next 12 months given all these recommendations?  Since the budget has been published, any referendum would surely be included in the Estimates.  What is the up-to-date estimate of the cost of a referendum?  Does the Taoiseach have plans for one over the next 12 months?  Everybody is in favour of justiciable economic rights on the one hand but, on the other, no one has gone through the detail of it.  I recently highlighted the EPSEN Act in the House.  This Act gives legislative rights to children with special needs.  Despite that being passed into law in 2005, the sections of that Act that confer rights on children with disabilities have never been commenced.  There is always a challenge and a balance between having the language right and having the various provisions meet all the idealistic viewpoints and perspectives of people but when it comes to the practical implementation on the ground of issues that make a difference to those who are very often the subject of the proposals, very little gets done.  The debate is between pragmatists and those who want to implement on the ground versus those who are happy once the conventions are signed, ratified and inserted in the Constitution.  If they are never enacted, it does not seem bother some people.  That might be a bit unfair but that tends to be what happens.  I recall the debate on the special needs rights strongly.  More than a decade has passed and key sections of that Act have not been commenced.  It is arguable that, as a result, the child is no longer at the centre of advocacy within our schools in terms of special needs and so on.  The NCSE has had to work away as best it can in the absence of such a legislative framework.</p>  <p>  I ask these questions in good faith.  What work is being done on defining the impact of the proposal to insert economic and social rights in the Constitution, be they related to housing or health?  I have an open mind on health, for example, but we need the preparatory work and the ground work to be done and the detail to be outlined for a proper debate.</p></speech>

There is a great sense that this, like a lot of other stuff, has been long-fingered.  There will not be another consultative process in respect of the various decisions of the Constitutional Convention.  We should salute its members.  They completed their work but it is clear that their work just lies there.  With regard to the proposal to reduce the voting age, does the Taoiseach have any intention of affording to younger people the opportunity to vote subject to the referendum?  Does he have wording for that proposal?</p>  <p>  Second, there was also a proposal relating to the issue of blasphemy and the Constitution.  A number of people have suggested that this would give us an opportunity as a society to examine issues around incitement to hatred.  These are technical issues.  We are also aware of the article in respect of what was then perceived in the 1930s to the role of women in Irish society.</p><p>The Constitution proclaimed that a woman's role was particularly related to being in the home.  Almost everybody here would agree that these are three issues over and beyond what Deputy Martin raised that require to be addressed.  We are witnessing at the moment, not least as a result of the election in America last week, very profound changes, some of which constitute potentially enormous threats to democracy.  We have seen passions running wild in the American election in a way we probably have not seen since the 1930s in Europe.  Our Constitution comes out of the 1930s and its social values reflect some of the values of that era.  In Ireland, because we had a strong constitutional democracy, we did not fall prey in the way other societies did.  It is important, given what has been happening around the world in recent times, in particular the re-emergence in politics of the strong-man syndrome.  We have strong men in many different parts of the world, from the Philippines to Russia and various other areas.  We have somebody now coming into the presidency of the United States who, certainly during the election, cast himself as an archetypal strong man.  Is now not the time for us in Ireland, as we have done on previous occasions, to have a genuine look at the Constitution, address the question of younger people having access to voting to encourage their involvement in democracy and address the issue of how women are addressed in the Constitution and modernise it?</p> <p> The Constitutional Convention has a number of very valuable suggestions on that which recognised that both genders have at different times in their lives, if not for all their lives, and under different circumstances had caring roles.  It also address the issues of differences in society to approaches to people of different genders, different sexual orientations, different religions and people of different colours and origins under the general issue of incitement to hatred rather than debate.  During the recent election in the United States, we heard a great deal of that kind of hateful language.  We have seen a lot of it on Twitter as well.  Many people have been victims of that in a very nasty way.  This is an opportunity to address some of the issues that are outstanding in Irish society.  Is the Taoiseach's Government prepared to address any of this or, as a result of the lack of stability and agreement in Government, has he just decided to take a pass on it for the remainder of the life of the Government?</p></speech>

Beidh m&eacute; go han-sciobtha.  I want to deal with one issue.  In September 2013, the Constitutional Convention voted to extend voting rights to citizens living outside the State.  In November 2015, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs made a recommendation to extend these rights following criticism by the European Commission.  More than 120 states have provisions for their citizens abroad to cast their ballot in the elections of their home places.  The European Commission has made it clear it would be possible to bring a case against this State to the European Court of Justice.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Joe McHugh, said there will be a referendum in early 2017.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that this referendum will include extending the same rights to Irish citizens living in the North as supported by the Constitutional Convention?  Previously the Taoiseach said he was waiting for an analysis.  Has this been considered?  When will it be concluded?  If it is concluded, when will it be published?</p></speech>

I am a bit concerned that because a Constitutional Convention recommends something, it should be implemented without reference to the House.  We have a structure and everybody in here was elected by the people.  While we welcome recommendations from the Constitutional Convention, they should be debated in the House, either through the committee system or on the floor of this House, before they are implemented.  We cannot pass over those who are elected directly by the people into this House.</p></speech>

I commit to holding a referendum on the elections for the presidency.  I had a meeting with the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Joe McHugh, quite recently and asked that the officials dealing with this in the Department expedite and bring together all the work they have been doing in respect of the range of problems and difficulties this deals with.  There are 3.5 million Irish citizens resident outside the State, including those in Northern Ireland.  The diaspora internationally is estimated at about 70 million.  There is a need to be aware, therefore, that if we consider this, we need to look at the scale of what is involved, the number of citizens to whom the franchise might be extended and what the impact might be on the electorate and the administrative and cost implications that could arise.  Issues that need to be considered are whether all citizens outside the State have the right to vote in presidential elections, if they should be limited to a particular category, or if it should be citizens who have been absent from the State for a set period.  If so, what would be appropriate?  Should it be citizens born on the island of Ireland only?  Should it be passport holders only?  The intention is that Northern Ireland citizens would be included here.  It is a matter that would have to be looked at in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  In reply to Deputy Martin, I do not think it will be possible to do it in time for the next presidential election.  In respect of the 2018 election, the time would be very short to go through all of these considerable challenges, set it out and have it implemented.  I might be wrong but my feeling is that it would not be possible.  That should not preclude committing to the principle, having a referendum on it and putting in place the structure and facilities to do it.  It is an issue people would need to speak on.  It is important and I would like to see it happen.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to come back at an early date to look at the concentrated issues that have been raised there.</p>  <p>  We had a referendum on children's rights to enshrine them in our Constitution.  From a children's rights point of view, I have to treat all children equally.  Those who have a challenge or disability have the same rights in our Constitution and are recognised in our Constitution as any other child.  The question of the signing of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an issue that was referred to already.  We need to have legislation put in place-----</p></speech>

I will come back to him on it, if I may.</p><p>The Constitutional Convention recommended that the social, cultural and economic rights be progressively realised.  The programme for Government says this should be referred to the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for consideration.</p><p>However, it did make specific reference to the fact that if we put such provisions into the Constitution and made them recognisable by the courts, it would create very particular and complicated problems.</p> <p> I will come back to Deputy Martin on the EPSEN Act.  In fairness, he has raised the matter previously.</p> <p> The point made by Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett is interesting.  The fact is that this House is elected by all the people, irrespective of who they vote for.  The Constitutional Convention, however, was never a decision-making body.  It was an opportunity for people from throughout the country to make recommendations.  Those recommendations might be accepted by the House or they might not.  It was not the case that those involved decided we should hold a referendum on a particular subject.  Many of the recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention were not accepted.  It did not necessarily follow that there would be a referendum.  There was a referendum in the case of marriage equality and in a number of other instances where it was accepted by the Government of the day.  On those occasions, the relevant matter was debated and a referendum followed.  Obviously, a citizens' convention does not take over from the primacy of the elected representatives of the House.</p> <p> There is no wording for a proposal to have a referendum on the right to vote for those over 16 years of age.  There is a commitment to hold a referendum on blasphemy, but the question is rather technical.</p> <p> The question of women was raised as well.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality set out the position on her Department's website on 27 October last.  Article 41.2 was examined by the Convention.  The second report of the Convention refers to how 41.2 relates to carers in the home and not just mothers.  There is also reference to carers beyond the home and reference to how the State should be able to offer a reasonable level of support to ensure carers would not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour.  An amendment to the Constitution to include an explicit provision on gender equality is referenced, as is an amendment to the Constitution to include gender-inclusive language throughout the text.</p> <p> These points were subsequently examined by a task force of officials under the Department of Justice and Equality and the group produced a report.  The report is on the website.  No timing has been decided on as of yet in respect of a referendum on this matter.  The T&aacute;naiste will bring forward propositions for the Government to consider regarding the proposed approach to be adopted.  Once the matter has been approved by the Government, the T&aacute;naiste will follow through with the general scheme of a referendum Bill, which will set out the arrangements for the referendum and the wording.</p> <p> The Citizens' Assembly is under way at the moment to consider a particular issue in respect of the eighth amendment.  It will also examine a number of other matters that have been delegated to it.</p> <p> Deputy Adams raised the question of Northern Ireland.  I have answered it.  We have to consider anything in this regard in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, with which Deputy Adams is familiar.</p></speech>

Following the appointment of Ministers of State, a set of policy priorities was agreed between myself, Ministers and Ministers of State.  On the establishment of the Government, I met each Minister along with his or her Ministers of State on a bilateral basis to discuss their short-term, medium-term and long-term policy priorities.  Since then, I have met regularly with Ministers of State to receive updates on the progress they have made in implementing their programme for Government policy priorities.  It is a case of some people having statutory responsibilities designated to them and some having responsibilities assigned to them without a statutory declaration.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500020#S00600"><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to supporting an enhanced approach to Government by Ministers of State and outlined the way in which they would play a more substantive role in decision-making.  I am asking for a progress report on this issue.  The Taoiseach has outlined how things were always done in the case of either appointing Ministers of State with statutory responsibility or appointing those without specific statutory remit but, perhaps, with a broader policy remit.  The comments of the Taoiseach add nothing to what is contained in the programme for Government.  The programme for Government suggests that something different would be done; that something of a more enhanced role would be put in play for Ministers of State.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that this got off to a bad start when Deputies Canney and Moran tossed a coin to decide who would become Minister of State.  I recall asking Deputy Moran in the corridors whether the appointments would be for two-and-a-half years each, to which he replied that I must have been joking because the whole thing would not last at all and that the arrangements were for one year at a time.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that this does not represent an enhanced role for Ministers of State.  I take it the Taoiseach disapproves of this behaviour by the two Deputies, albeit, they are new to the House.  This has shone a bad light on the question of Ministers of State and their appointment.  All of this happened and was widely reported.  Both Deputies have told many journalists about it without any hint of embarrassment.  They poured forth their views on how tossing a coin to decide who would become the Minister of State for one year was acceptable.  Apparently, at committees the Minister of State is shadowed by the Deputy who will become the Minister of State for the next year in order that the future Minister of State can read himself into the job.  I think all of this is degrading to the office of Minister of State.  The practice undermines the office.</p>  <p>  I have considerable sympathy for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Halligan, because of the way he was treated in respect of University Hospital Waterford and the recommendation in respect of the catheterisation laboratory.  In previous times, other reports were compiled.  For example, a clinical report was compiled in respect of the formation of the hospital group system.  The clinicians involved were adamant that University Hospital Waterford should have been the regional centre for cardiac care as well as emergency cardiac care.  The hospital was designated for that purpose in a separate report.  In other words, two separate reports, prior to that commissioned by the Minister for Health, identified Waterford hospital as a key centre for cardiac care.  The Minister would have been within his rights to expect that the matter would be followed through and that the second catheterisation laboratory would be provided.  Indeed, the HSE had made a business case for it regionally, although the decision was made nationally.</p>  <p>  In any event, at no stage did anyone say that the hospital could not or should not go ahead with it until the aftermath of the election and the discussions and negotiations around the formation of Government.  Then, hey presto, it was decided to undertake another review.  The result is that the second catheterisation laboratory has not been approved.  This put the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, in a difficult position.  He was caricatured and, to some extent, parodied by others as not being effective enough in pursuing the issue.  I would have thought the decision-making processes in Government would have been refined in the context of the composition of Government to help better decision-making on the issue, especially since decisions apply to particular Ministers of State.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm the number of delegation orders in respect of statutory responsibilities that have been issued at this stage?  Can the Taoiseach outline whether other delegation orders have yet to be made or whether others are in the process of being made but have not yet been executed?  Can the Taoiseach indicate the position?</p></speech>

As I pointed out to Deputy Martin, all Ministers of State have responsibility.  Some have been assigned by statutory delegation order and others have been allocated with responsibilities for particular areas.  For example, there are two Ministers of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputies McHugh and Dara Murphy.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, has special responsibility for the diaspora and international development.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has responsibility for European affairs and data protection.  He works at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach.</p><p>The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1977 provides for the delegation of statutory ministerial powers and duties to Ministers of State.  This may be done at the request of the Minister concerned by Government order.  The responsibilities allocated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs relate to consular, passport and technical matters, and it is not the practice, nor is it considered necessary, to delegate those functions he has held for himself as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  For instance, the Minister for Public Expenditure, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, interpreted a question from Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is a Minister of State, as referring to a delegation of ministerial functions order.  He allocated the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, functions and responsibilities to carry out on his behalf but he did not do so by statutory authority under the Act.  Deputy Murphy deals with financial services, as Deputy Martin is aware, in the IFSC and so on.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, decided not to allocate by statutory delegation of ministerial function responsibilities in the areas of sports, local authority programmes, engagement with sporting bodies and partnerships regarding other matters to the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan.</p></speech>

It seems to me, particularly given recent events such as the election of Mr. Trump in the US and what many people are calling the rise of extreme populism, that the question of tackling inequality is central to addressing inequality.  The political establishment, in all its wailing, hand-wringing and gnashing of teeth, laments what it calls the rise of the extremes at the expense of what I think the Minister, Deputy Coveney, called the sensible centre.  The political establishment should recognise that the lesson of what has happened in the United States and much of Europe with the rise of the extreme right is that it is a response precisely to the extremities of inequality that are growing across the globe, which are the responsibility of the so-called sensible centre.  It has been under the sensible centre, so-called, that the extremes of inequality that are destabilising our society have grown.  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a remarkable and alarming symmetry between the levels of inequality that form the backdrop to the rise of Mr. Trump and those that exist in this country.  That is the real lesson, if we are to take seriously the danger that Mr. Trump and his like represent and if we do not want to see a repeat of it in this country.  The levels of inequality in this country have grown shockingly under the Government's watch and under the watch of the Labour Party previously.  The number of children suffering deprivation has doubled, we have one of the highest proportion of people working on low pay almost anywhere in the OECD - we are in second place - and the gap between the rich and poor has grown exponentially.  All of these factors are witnessed in the United States as well.</p></speech>

One of the big injustices on our watch is the incarceration of people in so-called direct provision centres.  The Government has failed to implement any of the 173 recommendations of the McMahon report, which was published a year and a half ago.  An tUachatar&aacute;n, Michael D. Higgins, described the proposals as reasonable and practical.  He went on to say that the refusal to allow asylum seekers the right to work is heartbreaking and immoral.  He said their treatment was narrow and mean and he urged an amnesty for those who have been here for longer than five years.  There are 4,301 people in direct provision centres.  Some have been there for one and a half years.  A total of 604 have lived in these centres for more than five years.  They are not allowed to cook for themselves, they are not allowed to work and there is a limit on how far their children can progress through our education system.</p>  <p>  Christmas is only seven weeks away.  I have visited the direct provision centre in Mosney several times.  It is like Long Kesh without the watchtowers, the barbed wire and the armed guards.  I know we are short of time and I do not want to be greedy.  Will the Taoiseach tell us when the recommendations of the McMahon report will be implemented?  Will he update us on the status of the immigration and residency reform Bill?  Will he tell us when the International Protection Act 2015 will come into being?</p></speech>

Should efforts be made to engage various social partners, employers, trade unionists, farmers, community and voluntary bodies?  Will the Taoiseach consider that in the context of the challenges we now face?  If the Taoiseach has a different approach in mind, will he indicate how he and his Government intend reconciling all the emerging competing demands for resources and how, as a country, he proposes we might navigate the challenges we face?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1245" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500022#U00200"><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raises an interesting position that if the centre forgets the extremities, it causes friction, anxiety, rage, street violence and a growth of the hard right and left.  I agree with the sentiment and in many cases it is what has happened.  As the Deputy indicated, the so-called sensible centre has forgotten the extremities.  It has not happened here.  The north inner city is a case in point, because people were neglected and things were left behind.  It is critical that Government is not just listening but is engaging and going to act.</p>  <p>  The committee deals with a range of social issues, such as discussing the expansion of preschool provision under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, the publication of the Government's action plan for educational inclusion, developing the new national disability inclusion strategy, implementing the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, establishing a task for on personalised budgeting for people with disabilities, and developing a new national drugs strategy.  It also deals with initiatives to address the problems in the north inner city and the establishment of a youth mental health task force.  The Cabinet committee is committed to progressing strategies and some of them have happened.  There has been the publication of the Action Plan for Education and an increase in the number of special needs assistants to 12,600 to the end of 2016, an increase of 2,235 since September 2011.</p>  <p>  There has been the establishment of the Irish refugee programme to take up to 4,000 refugees here in Ireland.  With regard to the McMahon report, the vast majority of those who have been here for more than four years have been dealt with, except those in judicial review.  New legislation takes effect early in January and we will fast-track applications.  Self-catering has been introduced to Mosney and it will be replicated in other places.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is looking hard at what can happen here.</p>  <p>  There has been the introduction of two weeks of paternity leave and an associated social welfare payment, the expansion of the preschool provision under the ECCE programme and the implementation of the McMahon report findings on direct provision, including the upgrading of facilities in direct provision centres.  We have seen the establishment and ongoing work under the north inner city task force, as well as the establishment of the youth mental health task force.  They have been done.  There has been progress in including key new national strategies relating to disability inclusion, Traveller and Roma inclusion, the national women's strategy, integration and the new national drugs strategy.  Additionally, budget 2017 provided for a new single affordable child care scheme, with universal subsidy for children aged between six months and three years available for all families.  There was also the increase of &euro;5 per week in the State pension and all social welfare payments, a cut in the universal social charge for middle and lower income earners, an increase of &euro;100 in the tax credit for home carers and an increase of &euro;36.5 million in funding for higher and further education.  These are important issues.</p>  <p>  The best example is the fall in unemployment to 7.7% and an increase in the number of people working to more than 2 million.  It is the best route from poverty.  We have not done all that we would like to do, and that is why Deputy Burton's point is so important.  We must have a managed process to deal with everybody in a fair way so as not to destroy the economic gains made both by the Deputy when she was part of the Government and for the future.  Nobody wants to wreck this now.</p></speech>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of approximately &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the service over the next 12 months through an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500, bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017, the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary, with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017, and the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by garda&iacute; and other recommendations.  The Government has made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course.  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, officials of both Departments have had an initial discussion on the issues.  The Deputy will agree that what is most important at this juncture is that members of the AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p></speech>

That Labour Court recommendation, as we know, has been accepted by the Government and we agree it should have been accepted by the Government.  It is now being voted upon by the representatives organisations and I agree with the Minister that they should be given time to deliver their verdicts on the proposed deal.</p>  <p>  However, we should be aware that at the previous election the people voted in favour of improving services.  That was the one message we got from the previous general election.  This message was translated into a physical format in the agreement reached between my party and that of the T&aacute;naiste in our confidence and supply agreement.  It was recognised that people in the country wanted services improved, as opposed to taxes being cut.</p><p>I know many Members of the House share my concern about whether the Labour Court recommendation will result in a reduction in the services provided by the Department of Justice and Equality.  When my colleague, Deputy Calleary, asked the Minister a question about the cost of the Labour Court recommendation a few days ago, she said that "depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost."  I want the Minister to give the House an assurance that the Labour Court recommendation will not have an impact on the services provided by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

We have to await the outcome of the ballots.  When that is known, if the proposals are accepted the cost of the proposed settlement will be addressed in discussions between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy will agree that as Minister for Justice and Equality in this and the last Government, I have demonstrated my commitment and that of both Governments to investing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to ensuring that we develop the very best policing service we can for the people of Ireland.  As the Deputy knows, that has included reopening the Garda College and making a substantial investment in Garda vehicles.  As he rightly mentioned, the programme for Government includes a commitment to ensure we have a police force of 15,000.  A number of recruits will be passing out in Templemore on Thursday of this week.  An advertisement was placed recently to begin the process of recruiting more garda&iacute; next year.  It is intended to have 800 garda&iacute; recruited during the course of next year.</p></speech>

The Minister has already indicated that this will cost approximately &euro;50 million.  Regardless of whether the proposal is going to be accepted, we need to know where the money will come from.  I presume the Department is making plans for where it will come from.  As a result of the Minister's response, I do not know where the &euro;50 million is going to come from.  Will it be taken from other sections within the Department?  Will the Minister ask the Cabinet for further funding for the Department in response to the Labour Court recommendation?  I urge her to ensure the policing services that the people of this country are anxious to see improved are not threatened as a result of the requirement to increase Garda wage payments.</p></speech>

I believe that is the priority right now.  I want to ensure every member of the Garda is aware of the details of the recommendations that have been made by the Labour Court.  The associations will make sure of this.  It is very important that those details are circulated so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have an opportunity to look at the recommendations, assess the impact they will have on each of them and consider very carefully their response.  That is really where we have to keep the main focus.  The Department of Justice and Equality, which has a budget of over &euro;2 billion, will examine the outcome of that ballot.  If it is accepted, I will discuss its budgetary implications with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The question of how public pay will be determined next year is a whole-of-government issue.</p></speech>

Considerable progress has been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which was signed into law on 30 December 2015, is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Second Stage debate on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced in the D&aacute;il on 5 October last.  When it is enacted, it will reform section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of people with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  It is crucial that we achieve the necessary balance between safeguarding those rights and ensuring appropriate protection.  Work is under way on drawing up the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and making progress with the miscellaneous legislative amendments that are necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the convention's requirements with regard to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty and will remove archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The general scheme of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting.  While I am not in a position to give an exact date for its publication, I expect to publish the Bill very shortly to facilitate the ratification of the convention by the end of 2016.</p></speech>

The Bill has not been published yet, and the Minister does not have a definitive date for when it will be published.  Is there a particular reason there is a delay in publishing it?  Article 33 of the convention recommends that an independent monitoring body should be put in place to monitor progress.  In the Irish context, there is no single umbrella body that enables us to have such a monitoring process in place.  Have we made any progress in that regard?  One of the other key recommendations was that disabled persons bodies - they are referred to as "DPOs" in the rapporteur's report - should be involved in the consultation process and in the drafting of the legislation.  I wonder what organisations the Minister of State has been consulting as part of the process of drafting this legislation.  Have all the other recommendations set out in the rapporteur's report been met?  I know the end of 2016 is a very tight timeframe.  I hope the Minister of State will meet it, but he will understand my scepticism in this regard.</p></speech>

Many people have asked this question.  I have set the end of this year - Christmas 2016 - as a clear target.  Of course there are delays with legislation in the Department of Health.  The issues are more bureaucratic than anything else.  Over the past six months, I have consulted all groups working in the disability sector.  I will continue to do this.  I have just come from a meeting in my office with a group of parents of disabled children.  I have met more than 3,000 people - parents, disabled people and service providers - over the past six months.  They have made their views on many of the services and on the UN convention very clear to me.  The background to this is that Ireland signed the convention in 2007 with the intention of being able to ratify it subsequently.  Many people have asked why this has taken so long.</p></speech>

This issue goes back as far as 2010, when the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, published a scheme for a judicial council Bill.  When will the current Minister's Bill in respect of a judicial council be published and when is it likely to be available?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500024#W00500"><p>The Government and I continue to be committed to progressing that legislation as speedily as possible.  While it has been regarded by Governments, including the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, as a priority, over time it gave way to other pressing and urgent legislative requirements, some of which arose from our troika commitments and some of which concerned important social and societal issues, such as the establishment of the Court of Appeal and last year's marriage referendum, as well as the other 15 pieces of legislation I introduced during the course of the last Government.   I assure the Deputy that work on the Bill is very advanced and I look forward to its contents being debated by the Oireachtas.  I hope it will be possible to begin that debate early in 2017 and that we will be in a position to publish the legislation before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the current legislative programme includes the judicial council Bill on the A list.  Work on the drafting of the Bill is continuing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  My Department is working closely with that office and I had a meeting a few days ago on the continuation of that drafting work.</p>  <p>  The Government is firmly of the view that it is necessary to provide a platform for the promotion of excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.  I believe we in Ireland have been particularly well served by the Judiciary down through the decades, and this has been recognised internationally.  As the Deputy is aware, the Judiciary supports the establishment of the judicial council, which is also a priority for me.  We are very close to completion of the draft and will hopefully be in a position to undertake further consultation and then publish the Bill.</p></speech>

Yesterday we had the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the national airwaves, giving a rolling interview not in respect of CIE or Irish Rail, but in respect of his call for a judicial council.  Everyone is in favour of the establishment of a judicial council yet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport made it sound like this was some great new reforming idea he had come up with.  The judges are looking for it, Fianna F&aacute;il is looking for it and everyone in this House is looking for it.</p>  <p>  What we should not allow to pass is that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, on behalf of the Government, goes out into the public domain and tells the public at large that some judges may need to be reminded of their oath.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to clarify for the Irish public that it is not the view of the Government that members of the Judiciary need to be reminded of their oath.  They take their oath very seriously.  The hidden message from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was that we cannot trust a lot of these people and that is why we need to regulate them on a statutory basis.</p></speech>

I have already said I believe this country has been very well served by the Judiciary and that has been recognised internationally in GRECO report after GRECO report.  It is my own belief and it is certainly the belief of the Government that we have been well served by the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  Clearly, there are developments that need to be put in place and that is recognised in the programme for Government, in which a central element relates to reforms in the appointment of judges.  Every system needs a review and needs reform, which is precisely what we are saying needs to be done.  Some changes are necessary and I believe they will be welcomed by everyone when we get down to the detail.  As the Deputy said, there is and has been widespread support from the Judiciary, from the members of the Government and from the Deputy's party in regard to bringing forward the legislation on the judicial council.  It is a widely shared goal and one I hope we will be in a position to deal with very shortly by publishing the legislation.</p></speech>

The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government published back in 2011 contained a commitment to establish a judicial council but, five years on, it has not been established.</p>  <p>  The important message to be put out is that while, of course, there will be a requirement for judges at times to be disciplined and situations where judges step beyond the mark and need to be told they have stepped beyond it, that is a function that needs to be performed outside this House by the judges themselves.  This is why we need the establishment of a judicial council.  The establishment of such a council will be for the benefit of the Judiciary and it will also be for the benefit of the Irish public.  If we allow a situation to persist where the Government is drifting on the establishment of a judicial council, while at the same time some members of the Government are in the public domain saying that these guys need to be regulated and presenting it as if they do not want to be regulated, it is a dangerous combination for our judicial system.  That is why we need immediate action in this respect.</p></speech>

This legislation will be published shortly.  The Government is committed to it and, as the Deputy said, the Judiciary wants to see a judicial council.  There are issues that can be dealt with in terms of the performance of judges and continuing the work judges do to make sure they have a judicial council that will be a support to that work.  As I said, we have made it clear we are committed to publishing this legislation.  There are reasons it was delayed, primarily due to other priorities and the scale of the work that is done within the Department of Justice and Equality and the various priorities which emerged in the course of the last year or so.  We are committed to it and it is certainly an important part of the architecture in regard to the Judiciary that needs to be brought forward.</p></speech>

Since then, 1,200 trainee garda&iacute; have passed through the college and it is envisaged, as the Deputy said, that 800 new recruits will enter in 2017.  Since the college re-opened, 534 recruits have been attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, and another 150 trainee garda&iacute; will be attested this Thursday, 17 November.  Taking account of projected retirements, this will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of new facilities were built at the college in the early 2000s, including new administration, catering and recreation facilities.</p><p>It is accepted that the college infrastructure is in need of further modernisation and I support that.</p> <p> Indeed, a major Office of Public Works, OPW, programme of works to improve fire safety at the accommodation blocks at the college is well advanced and I understand that work on some five of the seven blocks requiring upgrades has been completed.</p> <p> However, due to the increased recruitment under the Government&rsquo;s accelerated recruitment programme, the enhanced training and development strategy that forms part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's five-year modernisation and renewal programme and a move away from lecture hall-type courses, a requirement for additional classrooms has been identified.  This will be progressed by the Garda authorities in conjunction with the Office of Public Works to examine what precisely is needed in the college and we will move to initial design stage as soon as possible.</p> <p> The Garda authorities are also working to establish the long-term needs with a view to identifying improvements within the existing campus boundary as well as the potential need to develop facilities and spaces outside the boundary.  We are committed to ensuring that not only are garda&iacute; recruited and trained but that we have the appropriate setting for them in Templemore to do their training.</p></speech>

Does she have within her budget the necessary resources to complete the work under way and to deliver an expansion and development, in-house and on the campus, of more bedroom accommodation, lecture rooms and classroom space, which is urgently required, and to address the parking issues that have arisen around the college and in the town?  Will the Minister ensure that when the Office of Public Works is considering this expansion programme for the college, it does not interfere with or interrupt in any way the local golf club, which is adjacent to and part of the college?  The golf club has 300 members who use the facility regularly.  They value and appreciate it and we do not want that to be interfered with.  The accelerated and expanded recruitment is very welcome for Templemore and it helps to address the deficit in Garda numbers nationally.  The college makes an enormous contribution to the town and hinterland of Templemore.  I am happy that the Minister says there will be development works within the college and that this work will not be farmed out to other areas or other countries outside Tipperary.</p></speech>

In respect of the long-term training needs and the improvements that need to be made within the existing campus boundary, in the first instance we must work with the OPW to provide an initial design scheme.

The Policing Authority is also examining the question of allocating appropriate resources to different areas.</p>  <p>  I am advised that some 125 Garda stations operate on a 24-hour basis throughout the State, with 439 not operating on that basis.  Certain stations operate up to 14 hours per day, while the opening hours of others depend on the availability of resources.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the restructured station network continues to provide the necessary levels of policing services through a centralisation of services which in turn has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  As we recruit more garda&iacute; there will be more visibility, which is important, and more community-oriented police services.  There are several benefits which unfortunately I do not have time to detail.  We have the funding for 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians and the capital plan provides &euro;205 million for investment in the information and telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify six stations for reopening on a pilot basis in line with the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government.  This pilot scheme is intended to feed into the wider review being overseen by the Policing Authority into, among other things, the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  The Authority has formally requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the dispersal and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations.</p></reply>

That is one of the criticisms I hear constantly.  It will be important that the Policing Authority will consider the policing plans.  I have never found and I have looked at them each year that they really do what the Minister says they should do in other words the demographic shifts and crime levels determine the level of cover.  That does not seem to correlate.  I have looked at them every year and made the same criticism every year.  What is positive this year is that the Policing Authority will consider it.  Presumably it will have a role in respect of the service level agreements for the opening of these six stations.  Is it intended then to open further stations or will the evaluation be carried out in respect of those that are opened on a pilot basis?</p></speech>

It will be in a position to inform the broader review.  I agree with the Deputy and think it is extremely important that the Garda Inspectorate is examining in detail the dispersal and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and will make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service.  The needs vary quite considerably throughout the country.  If the Deputy examines the statistics for crime, there are huge variations and there are trends at different times where one type of crime may replace another or comes to the surface and needs to be dealt with.  That does need resources to be used in a flexible way.  The Deputy made a point about a certain inflexibility in that regard in the past.  It is really important that the Garda Commissioner is in a position to respond in a flexible way and move the resources to where they are needed and that is certainly the intention in the context of the examination taking place.</p></speech>

When we, the Deputies of Kildare, met the assistant commissioner on a number of occasions, we were pretty much told that what one has one holds, and that was the approach.  That flies in the face of policing plans being what they are supposed to be, which is a dynamic and responsive approach to change.  One issue that might come up in the choice of the potential opening of police stations is the availability of stations.  Obviously, some of them were closed with the intention of being sold or being used for something else.  If there is going to be a change in that approach, it is very important that there is the scope not to have to rebuy premises, if there are good premises in a location and there is a rethink on a Garda station for that area.  It is important that is reviewed as a matter of urgency.  Obviously, it will limit the scope of opening stations on the basis of need.</p></speech>

There are 564 Garda stations in the State.  This compares very favourably with comparable jurisdictions.  For example, in Northern Ireland in 2012, there were 86 police stations providing policing services to a population of &euro;1.5 million.  In Scotland, the ratio is approximately 340 stations to 5.2 million people.  We have to bear that in mind and ask the question: what is the best type of police force and police response that we need to see in order to deal with emerging crime trends?  What does twenty-first century policing look like?  It is very important that we have a mobile and visible force responding to crime in various areas.  I take the point the Deputy is making that people feel a reassurance from local Garda stations, but we have to examine precisely what works best.  That is what we are trying to do in looking at the police strategy and the role of the Policing Authority and in overseeing the priority areas that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified for the coming year and the future.</p></speech>

The statistics for the Galway Garda division reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that county.  The Deputy will be aware that in the most recent CSO figures, for the second quarter of 2016, there were decreases in many crime categories.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  In<b></b>Galway Garda division, the figures show a reduction in burglary of 17%.</p><p>The quality of crime statistics is an international and national issue.  When the Garda Inspectorate reported on it, I met with the CSO and I asked it to do some work on the quality of crime statistics.  I know it is an independent body but I was very happy to see them do that work.  They have produced two reports.  The first was in June 2015 and there was another one more recently.  That showed that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than in the first review.  Progress has been made in relation to the quality of crime statistics.  We need to continue to examine it and keep a strong focus on it.  The CSO will continue to monitor it, but it is going in the right direction.</p><p>I wish to pick up the second part of the Deputy's question, which is very important.  Most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda information services centre, GISC, which is located in Castlebar.  It is an around-the-clock service that enables garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident to specifically-trained staff to facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  The lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authority is that 92% of all crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.  It is very important that I am clear with Deputies who raise this issue as a number of Deputies have raised it.  A total of 92% of the recording is done via the 24-hour services in Castlebar.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality, including a new incident recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the crime statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intends to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been.</p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the record of this debate.</p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.  However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.</p></reply>

The report was very positive, except that domestic violence was up by 16%.  In the Galway division, there are 20 Garda stations that do not have immediate access to the computerised system.  When are we looking at upgrading the system?  Are there plans in the programme for Government or in the future to upgrade all Garda stations in order that when a garda returns to his base, he or she has the opportunity to access the system?  When we look through the CSO report, it is not very complimentary of the service.  In actual fact, it is quite the opposite.  It shows that 17% of all offences were logged on calls but are not up on PULSE.  In another example, 40% of public order incidents also go through on the call system but are not on the PULSE system.  It is contradictory.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments as to the progress in the future.</p></speech>

The CSO's analysis concluded that, notwithstanding the issues identified by the inspectorate, the data available on PULSE was of sufficient quality to allow publication.  That is really important and came from the CSO itself.  On the question of PULSE access for Garda stations, quite a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties.  I am providing those Deputies with a table with information to be included in the record of this debate.  Deputy Rabbitte will have access to that.  The question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the modernisation programme.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions and to enable operational garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.  As well as developing the PULSE system in the various Garda stations, it is the development of mobile technology that is the future in terms of garda&iacute; both accessing and recording information on the PULSE system, as we see in other jurisdictions such as in New York or other countries.</p></speech>

That money will also be used to make sure that we have interoperability of databases, for example, in security and terrorism, and that we can work effectively with other countries.  The money will also be used on mobile technology and on upgrading the PULSE system.  I make the point again: the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.

I do not have the time to go through the detail of that in the House, but it will be supplied to the Deputies who ask the question about the number of stations with the PULSE system.  Crime statistics are compiled by the CSO, based on PULSE data.  The statistics for Westmeath Garda division reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that area.  The Deputy will be aware that in the most recent crime figures that were released, there were decreases in many crime categories.</p><p>There were a few increases as well.  Following Operation Thor and the other targeted projects and operations in which the Garda has been involved, we clearly see results.  For example, in the Westmeath Garda division the figures show a reduction in burglary of 36%.  As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, the quality of crime statistics is a national and international issue.  Work is under way in this regard.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has done two reports on crime statistics already.  The second report showed a further improvement in crime recording and classification.  It is an ongoing project.  The CSO will continue to monitor the statistics that are being gathered.</p> <p> The inspectorate first identified the issue and then the CSO followed on at my request in terms of looking at the quality of the data.  The second review, which was published in September 2016, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate report in regard to recorded crime is substantially less than was the case in the first review.  A strong focus must be kept on the issue.  The more resources and training we can give to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue the better.  Many steps have been taken by the Garda in terms of promoting the importance of the issue, sending out information to garda&iacute; and making sure statistics are properly recorded.</p> <p> Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concern the need to maximise procedures to ensure the recording of crimes through GISC, which is in Castlebar.  New measures are now in place to improve data quality, including a new incident recording process.  We have the upgrades to the system and we have new procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the combination of those will mean there can be more confidence in the crime statistics being recorded throughout the country.</p></reply>

People at those meetings asked what the point is of reporting a burglary because there is no positive outcome from doing so.</p>  <p>  I specifically asked about the number of Garda stations in County Westmeath that are not connected to the PULSE system.  The Minister said she would supply a table outlining the information.  Are all of the Garda stations in Westmeath PULSE-enabled?

If all the stations are not PULSE-enabled, how can the Minister have confidence in the figures she has supplied today?</p></speech>

It is very important to note that.  Not having access to PULSE in the local Garda station does not mean that a crime incident will not be recorded because before garda&iacute; finish their shift every evening, they deal directly with the 24-hour service that is based in Castlebar to record incidents of crime.</p>  <p>  As I said to Deputy Rabbitte earlier, the advent of mobile technology is probably the direction in which we will go in terms of the recording of crime, but extra money is also available for the PULSE system.  The reality is that there was not investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for several years and money was not made available to address issues such as PULSE, which I am sure were identified by previous Governments.  Thankfully, with the improvement in the economic situation, the previous Government was in a position to begin the investment in ICT again, which is so essential.  Crime statistics are dependent on investment in ICT and there was a lack of such investment for several years due to the economic situation, but that has started again.  I again reassure Deputy Troy that the lack of the PULSE system in the local Garda station does not mean that incidents of crime in his area are not being recorded, as they are being recorded through the system in Castlebar.</p></speech>

However, the Minister did not respond to the point I made about some people not having confidence in making reports to the Garda about burglary incidents and that may be a reason for the number of burglaries being down by 36%.</p>  <p>  In Westmeath, kidnapping is up by 400%, controlled drug offences are up by 100% and there has been a double-digit increase in the incidence of dangerous acts.  There is an ongoing level of criminal behaviour in the region although I accept that the number of burglaries is down.  Without question the Garda is doing a good job in certain areas, but there are problems in some communities because new garda&iacute; have not been appointed.  During the previous Question Time with the Minister I referred to the fact that areas such as Kinnegad and Killucan do not have the full complement of garda&iacute; and that people do not feel confident in coming forward to report burglaries.  I am curious to hear whether the Minister is confident that all burglaries or criminal activity is being reported to the local Garda station and that it is being fed into the system in Castlebar.</p></speech>

That is the reality, but I wish to reference something else which is relevant to what the Deputy said in terms of victims of crime in this country.  The CSO first carried out a survey in 2010 on crime and victimisation and the most recent survey was published on 19 October 2016.  People were surveyed directly rather than relying on reports to Garda stations by individuals on crime.  It is encouraging that the overall trends show that crime levels have broadly remained stable or have reduced slightly in some areas since the previous such survey in 2010.  When one looks at both the official CSO statistics and the crime and victimisation survey, one sees a reflection of the fact that there is a reduction in crime, but that is not to denigrate the suffering, distress and upset of an individual who has been the victim of a crime and how we need to work continually to reduce crime levels.</p></speech>

In depositing the evidence and documents with the specified Minister in this case, there was no question of my having authority to access that evidence or those documents.  The purpose of depositing documentation with the relevant Minister is for safeguarding it.  It would be unthinkable that any Minister with whom such documentation is deposited would be free to examine details of proceedings heard in private.  To do so would be to set at naught the confidentiality surrounding the commission's proceedings and would be to contravene section 11(3) of the 2004 Act which specifically provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person, including a member of the commission, shall not disclose or publish any evidence given in private except in certain restricted circumstances, including as directed by a court.</p><p>The act of depositing documents has to be seen as consistent with that obligation and therefore it would not be proper for a Minister or Department to access commission papers except in accordance with the very specific provisions set out in the Act.  It is clear too from section 11 that it would be an offence for a Minister to disclose material covered by that section except, again, in the limited circumstances set out in that section.</p><p>Section 43 allows for the deposition of evidence and documents in circumstances where a commission is no longer in existence as obviously papers belonging to a commission must be held somewhere.</p><p>However, it is clear from the use of the word &quot;deposit&quot; that what is at issue here is the safekeeping of the files pending their ultimate disposal to the National Archives, if appropriate; their production before a tribunal of inquiry, if that becomes relevant; or, similarly, on foot of a court order if one were to be made in the course of judicial proceedings.  For that reason I can confirm for the Deputy that I have not examined the transcripts of the O'Higgins commission.<br/><br/><i>Information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The Deputy may also be aware that, following the referral by me to GSOC of certain allegations which arose following the publication of the O'Higgins commission report, the chairperson of GSOC wrote to me seeking access to certain records of the commission.  Having received the Attorney General's advice, I informed the chairperson of GSOC of the necessity to secure a court order directing that the material be provided.  While the granting of any such order is a matter for the courts, I will of course comply with any such order, if it is made.<br/><br/>For the reasons set out above, I can confirm for the Deputy that I have not examined the transcripts of the O'Higgins commission of investigation.</p></speech>

The Commissioner asked the Minister to refer the matter to GSOC.  GSOC then asked the Commissioner for the transcript.  The Commissioner said that under the 2004 Act she cannot give it to GSOC.  GSOC then asked the Department of Justice and Equality for it.  It used the same reason, namely, that under the 2004 Act and citing legal restrictions on disclosure it cannot give it to GSOC.  What was the point of the Commissioner asking the Minister to ask GSOC to look into something if it could not get the transcript?  There is no logic to that.  Is the Minister telling me that under no circumstances could she, the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is the only person in this country who can hold the Garda Commissioner to account, possibly get the right to look at the transcript?  If we want to know the truth about what happened, and we have been told by other sources what was in the transcript, surely she could get access to it if she sought the legal powers to so do.</p></speech>

The legal team for Maurice McCabe asked the legal team for the Commissioner to go outside the room and check with the Commissioner if she wanted to stick to that story.  He came back into the room and said, "Right the way through."  What happened then?  Maurice McCabe produced the tape and the whole thing was dropped.  If the Commissioner had nothing to do with the fabrication of the contents of what was said at the Mullingar meeting, why did she not act against the two garda&iacute; in question?  The Minister might be interested to know that when the superintendent in question, Noel Cunningham, heard that the Commissioner had referred the issue to GSOC, he said, "N&oacute;ir&iacute;n has thrown me under the bus."  It is plain as black and white.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot of detail in that and I will be forwarding that to the Deputy today.  When the extra garda&iacute; are recruited it is an operational matter as to where they will serve.  That operational decision is made by the Garda Commissioner and as I said in reply to an earlier question from Deputy Murphy and Deputy Lahart's other colleagues, we want to see garda&iacute; being assigned to the areas that need them most and that has to be assessed looking at population trends, crime levels and so on.</p>  <p>  We are committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  As I said, there were decreases in many crime categories, and that was also reflected in the victimisation study that was done.  It is important to look at both sets of data.  There was a 26% reduction nationwide in burglaries but a huge effort was made and a dedicated operation put in place, which involved high visibility and extra Garda presence, and money was allocated in order to make sure this was successful.</p>  <p>  We are attempting to put in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.  That is 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  That recruitment will begin next year after the survey has been done and the work has been done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of next year, I assure the Deputy that funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and civilians to support that plan.</p></reply>

Having lived there all my life, I acknowledge that my constituency has seen unprecedented spikes in crime, particularly from mid-2014 to the end of 2014.  The Minister might pass on to the Garda Commissioner and the garda&iacute; in Rathfarnham and Tallaght in particular that I commend them on their work, particularly in effecting change in the burglary statistics, which is very welcome.  That is evident on the ground anecdotally in terms of the reality of people's lives.  However, there are still areas of serious concern.  The rise in sexual offences seems to be continuing.  Those offences are not categorised, and I do not know if the Minister is in a position to comment on them.  Assaults, theft and related offences are still higher than in 2014.  When I look at the figures for Rathfarnham Garda station in my constituency and in Tallaght Garda station, there has been a huge spike in theft from persons.  Those figures are under street crimes, which I will comment on further shortly.</p></speech>

We are also seeing increased levels of cyber crime, and garda&iacute; are having to put more resources into dealing with that.  A national conference was held on that today.</p><p>That is a significant threat, both in Ireland and internationally, and we have to increase the resources and provide the technical staff that are needed to deal with the issue.  There is a number of other disturbing trends, as the Deputy said, in respect of sexual crime and the incidence of domestic violence, and we all have to be alert to interrupting that.  Tomorrow I will launch a new awareness strategy with regard to domestic violence to ensure that people act when they see incidents of domestic violence.</p> <p> In the context of Deputy Lahart's area, of the officers who have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 40 and 45 have been assigned to the DMR south division and the DMR south-central division, respectively, and we have another 150 trainee garda&iacute; coming out on Thursday next.</p></speech>

The number of garda&iacute; serving in Limerick city and county is almost twice that of those serving in Tallaght and Rathfarnham.  I appreciate that there is a great deal of investment in cars, and certainly they are visible around the constituency, but the garda on the beat is still not visible.  I think of two instances.  In one, there was repeated anti-social behaviour two weeks ago in the vicinity of a community centre in Jobstown.  Said behaviour is causing havoc and I have written to the Garda Commissioner in respect of it.  People who contacted the Garda were informed that there was only one car available and that it was dealing with another crime.  This is giving rise to much concern locally.  I do not want to stigmatise Jobstown.  In Rathfarnham, according to the figures I possess, burglaries are down but robberies from the person are up 57% year on year.  The latter are on-street crimes and it is in respect of these that garda&iacute; on the beat and a visible garda presence, including, potentially, that of members of the Garda Reserve, would make a considerable difference to communities.</p></speech>

That report is almost ready.  Recruitment will begin next year for the Garda Reserve.  I agree with Deputy Lahart that they certainly have a role to play as well.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point in respect of anti-social behaviour and the devastating impact it can have on a local community.  Clearly, ongoing recruitment, focused activity and community policing are important in order to deal with that.

As I said, we have over 150 coming out on Thursday next.  It is important that they have proper supervision to begin with.  The O'Higgins report identified that when garda&iacute; are being trained, it is really important that they are properly supervised when they go out into the community.  We want to ensure that will be the case.</p>  <p>  I have provided to the Deputy details on the Clare division, in October 2010 and 2016, respectively.  The number of garda&iacute; in the Clare Garda division, as of 31 October 2010, was 331 and in 2016, it was 292.  The number of officers at stations throughout the country is building back up to the level it was at when the boom was at its height.  Of course, that proved not to be sustainable and recruitment stopped.  This resulted in the difficulties the Deputy has been referencing.  As of now, there are 292 garda&iacute; in the 17 stations in the Clare division.</p>  <p>  As already stated, we plan further recruitment for the reserve, which will help, and ongoing recruitment this year.  I have given the Deputy the breakdown in respect of the number of Garda stations in the Clare division.</p></speech>

If it is not available to her, perhaps she might at least recognise the need to deploy additional garda&iacute; in Clare.  The figures the T&aacute;naiste provided show a significant drop of 39 in the number of garda&iacute; serving in Clare between 2010 and 2016.  While I accept that the crime figures have improved in some categories, many categories have shown increases.  Sexual offences, theft and assault all are up in 2016 relative to 2014.  </p>  <p>  It is vital that Clare gets its fair share of any additional recruitment coming on stream, not only over the lifetime of the Government but right from the start.  As recruits become available in 2017, I will be making a strong case that Clare be included in the context of their deployment.  We need to see Garda levels back to what they once were.  I accept and recognise the reasons why numbers have fallen.  There is no point talking about the historical aspect of it.  Let us look to the future.  Over the period to which I refer, nine stations in Care were closed.  One aspect difficult for me to have to accept is that the number of community garda&iacute; was halved during the period in question.  There is demand and there is a need.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give consideration to the dispersal of the new recruits.</p></speech>

Thankfully, we are now recovering.  In the context of policing, that recovery has given rise to the new recruitment I have outlined.</p>  <p>  It is worthwhile noting, in terms of the deployment of probationary garda&iacute;, that the Garda Commissioner has deployed garda&iacute; right across the country to almost every division so that every area has benefited from the recruitment.  Clearly, every Deputy wants to see it accelerated in his or her area and to have more community police in place.</p>  <p>  The recruitment drive next year will ensure that there will be more garda&iacute; available.  However, I believe that we have to look carefully - this is what the Garda Inspectorate is examining - at the deployment of such resources.  It has to be based on the reality of situations on the ground and the crime figures and population trends have to be analysed.  I repeat, as Deputy Dooley will be well aware, that it is the Garda Commissioner who makes these decisions.  I can be responsible for policy, budget and recruitment, but it is the Garda Commissioner who will make the detailed decisions about where garda&iacute; should be deployed throughout the country.  That is as it should be.</p></speech>

I recognise that the T&aacute;naiste's role is at a policy level.  It was her predecessor who introduced the policy of smart policing that led to the closure of Garda stations - I recognise that there was a necessity to do that in some instances.  His idea at the time was that garda&iacute; driving around in rural areas was an adequate policing system.  I disagree fundamentally with that because I do not believe that it either gave confidence to local communities or that it was appropriate to address the risk associated with mobile criminal gangs.  Nothing substitutes for garda&iacute; remaining in an area, being close to the people and having a connection with them.  Smart policing, as I see it, based on the way the previous Minister defined it as garda&iacute; driving through rural areas and making something like one visit per week, is not the appropriate model.  I hope that, through the T&aacute;naiste's good offices and her different approach to the Department of Justice and Equality, she would impress upon the Commissioner the necessity to have a much greater link between the Garda and the community.  That speaks to the necessity to have community policing front and centre in the context of the overall policing strategy, a matter in respect of which the T&aacute;naiste does, in consultation with the Commission, have an input.</p></speech>

We see some good models throughout the country where they are working, for example, with the local taxi-drivers, businesses, community text alert groups, community alert and neighbourhood watch.  We have increased the funding for the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes this year in order that they can be even more effective.  It is built on voluntary efforts, and that is really important.  That is part of protecting rural communities.</p>  <p>  The protection of rural communities was a key consideration for me in the broad review of the response to burglary and related crimes that I initiated in early 2015 and also in the new legislation I introduced, which means that the courts have the opportunity to impose concurrent sentences on those repeat offenders.</p><p>It was a huge concern to people in both urban and rural communities to see repeat offenders not serving the length of sentences they believed they ought to serve, given the number of offences in which they were involved.  We brought in the new legislation with the support of everybody in the House and that has been very important.</p></speech>

In the most recent CSO figures, for the second quarter of 2016, there were decreases in many crime categories.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  In Mayo Garda division<b>, </b>the figures show a reduction in burglary of 22%.  That will be welcomed by everybody.</p><p>We have had the two reviews of the statistics and the Deputy will have heard the points I made earlier in that regard, so I will not repeat them.  When looking at the CSO statistics and raising questions about them, it is important that people also look at the victimisation survey, which reflected decreases as well.  That is carried out directly by the CSO with victims.  It is a community survey and it is important to reflect on that.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda information services centre, GISC, based in Castlebar.  This provides a round-the-clock service which enables garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.</p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate regarding crime statistics concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised, because obviously there are issues in that regard as well.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has introduced new measures in recent times to improve data quality, including a new incident recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.  The supervision of investigations is an important element in ensuring that crimes are recorded properly and that new recruits are supervised.</p></reply>

She will be aware that the Garda Inspectorate was quite scathing in its analysis of how crime was recorded.  The latest figures show that one fifth of all crime is not properly recorded on PULSE.  The Garda Inspectorate has published 11 reports in the past nine years.  There were almost 600 recommendations.  Most of them were accepted but many were not implemented.  The question was posed to the Minister as to why the changes were not made sooner and why the 2014 report had to be so scathing.  The Garda Inspectorate says it found serious failures in recording classification and reclassification of crimes.  I asked if the people of Mayo can rely on the CSO figures.  The T&aacute;naiste says they are the figures as recorded, and I accept that, but the difficulty or concern people have is whether crimes are being recorded properly and thoroughly.  The T&aacute;naiste says new measures have been put in place.  Are those measures effective and has the T&aacute;naiste carried out an analysis or conducted an investigation of their effectiveness?  The Garda Commissioner gave a commitment to reform how officers record crime.  Has the T&aacute;naiste spoken to her about this?  What efforts has the Garda Commissioner made to do this and has she reported back to the T&aacute;naiste on same?</p></speech>

After the first Garda Inspectorate report relating to crime statistics was published, I met with the CSO and discussed this issue because I was concerned about it.  The good news is that it did it again the following year and reported that there were improvements.  On the Deputy's question about monitoring, this is being monitored by the CSO and it has been able to say that the crime statistics should be published.  That is important because their publication was suspended for a number of months while the CSO did its survey and carried out the work in this regard.  When the Garda Inspectorate reported, it made many recommendations.  Over 1,000 recommendations have come from the Garda Inspectorate and clearly the Garda Commissioner must respond to them.</p>  <p>  However, we also have an independent Policing Authority and it has an oversight role regarding the implementation of the various recommendations.  It meets with the Garda on a regular basis about the recommendations relating to improving the work the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does and to ensure various issues are identified in terms of the resources it needs.  That work is now being done by an independent body outside of the Government, which is what this House wanted.  It is important that we respect the work being done there as well.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that new measures are being implemented to ensure that the Garda information services centre operates effectively.  I asked what those measures were and if that is being monitored.  It might be of interest to the T&aacute;naiste and her Department that there was a meeting in September of the Castlebar municipal district council which was attended by the local superintendent and chief superintendent.  While they said that overall crime was down, they were concerned that the incidence of drug possession was up by 106% in the constituency.  Interestingly, the meeting was told by the superintendent and chief superintendent that the number of drug searches had increased in that period.  The increase in the number of searches had led to an increase in detection and, therefore, the increase of 106% in possession offences.  This shows that increased policing leads to increased detection and prosecutions.  There is a direct correlation, so if there is less policing and fewer resources there will be less detection.</p>  <p>  I also wish to highlight my serious concern about the increase in the number of sexual offences recorded in the constituency.  It has increased by 46% over a two year period, which is a worrying figure.  What will the T&aacute;naiste and her Department do to tackle this increasing incidence of sexual offences not just in County Mayo but at national level?</p></speech>

They are being implemented and that is being correlated by the work of the CSO.  That is my point.  Initiatives were taken to improve the statistics and it is clear from the CSO report that there are improvements.  There is still work to be done.  It will not happen overnight.  However, we have an independent body, the CSO, monitoring the statistics and continuing to report on their reliability.  I reiterate that the reliability of crime statistics is an international and complex issue.  We must do all we can to ensure and enhance the integrity of crime statistics because it is an important public confidence measure.  I totally accept that point.</p></speech>

Continued recruitment is key and there is an agreement in the programme for Government that we will have a police force of 15,000 over the coming years.  Increased civilianisation is very important as is recruiting more members of the Garda Reserve.  We have improved procedures.  There is work to be done on confidence in the statistics and it is ongoing.  I have already said it is an international issue and that 92% of crimes that are reported by the Garda come in through the GISC in Castlebar.  I hope to see a move to more mobile technology being used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We need to recognise that the fear of crime can be an issue for people and can, sometimes, be greater than what is happening in an area.  I do not for a moment underestimate the impact one crime has on one person.  One crime is one too many.  We must recognise that there have been successes by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding various categories of crime.

Some 92% to 93% will go through the GISC in Castlebar, and this applies to the Deputy's area as well as others.  I have given the breakdown in the Deputy's area.  Regarding the point he made about crime statistics, the Garda Inspectorate noted the CSO's report on the review of the quality of crime statistics.  The report reiterated issues that were found in the report of the Garda Inspectorate on crime investigation and there were various issues, including the non-recording of crime, misclassification of crime, unjustified downgrading of crime to a less serious offence and the incorrect recording of detections.  We cannot tolerate poor recording practices and we must work continuously to ensure they are improved.</p>  <p>  Since November 2015, there has been a new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na crime management system in place, and it was introduced to address many of the issues which the Garda Inspectorate report identified.  We have a variety of initiatives such as the changes in Garda management in terms of the recording of statistics.  We have the new procedures, which have been circulated to all members to use, so the recording of crime is more accurate.  There is an increased awareness of the importance of the issue.  At the request of the House, the Policing Authority is providing independent oversight of the police.  The CSO recorded crime statistics for the second quarter of 2016 show important reductions in property crime over the 12 months ending in June 2016, confirming the success of the Garda strategy under Operation Thor, with burglary reduced by 26%, robbery 11%, theft 12%, homicide 3.2%, weapons offences 11.7% and public order 5.1%.  This has been confirmed in the crime and victimisation survey.  Significant challenges remain in various areas.  There is an ongoing effort by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime.  We want to give the Garda the resources to do it, and this and the previous Government have been doing it.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, recently met the parents of Ava Barry and called for a review of cannabis-based medicines.  Sativex is a cannabis-based product which was approved in 2014 but is still not available to multiple sclerosis sufferers.  I understand the Minister's hands are tied, up to a point, by the existing law.  The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 will deal with the long-term effects of the grey area of cannabis-based products.  In the short term, I will try to untie the Minister's hands by asking him to facilitate compassionate access under the exempt medicinal products statutory instruments and any other means at his disposal, particularly in the cases of Ava Barry and Ronan Gaynor.</p>  <p>  Ava is a beautiful six year old child who has Dravet syndrome, which involves intractable epilepsy, often with dozens of seizures a day.  The condition is known to respond well to cannabis-based products.  Ronan Gaynor is a four year old boy with a very rare form of brain tumour called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.  It is a very rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer, involving severe pain and distress.  It responds to cannabis-based products.  If a recognised doctor writes to the Minister on behalf of Ava and Ronan to apply for permission to prescribe cannabis-based medicines, will the Minister consider the doctor's application and ensure these children gain access to the cannabis-based medicines which they medically need?</p>  <p>  I note the report by Professor Michael Barnes.</p><p>It was the unanimous view that medical cannabis has huge medical benefits for a range of illnesses.  We need to step into the 21st century in this country.  Children like Ava and Ronan are at an extremely difficult point in their short lives, as are their parents.  These products can help.  The research and data are available and we need to import these products under the guidance of a doctor to help these children.  I plead with the Minister of State because I am the voice of those children and their parents in the House today.  Will he help these children?</p></speech>

I share his concerns and his ideas.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate the difficult situation that Ava and her family are in and how painful it is for any parent to see his or her child suffering with a condition such as this.  Many patients with a variety of medical conditions believe that cannabis should be a treatment option.  However, with the exception of Sativex, cannabis-based preparations are not currently authorised as medicines in Ireland.  Cannabis has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines, which are designed to protect patients and ensure that treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness.  However, the Minister for Health is committed to urgently reviewing policy on medicinal cannabis and I support that position.  He met the parents of Ava Barry last week and updated them on his stance.</p>  <p>  The Minister has requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide him with expert advice on the issue of medicinal cannabis.  The HPRA's statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products.  It has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.  The Minister has asked for a report on recent developments in the use of medicinal cannabis in other countries, including an overview of emerging research.  The HPRA may also propose changes to legislation in respect of the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  Separately, the Minister understands that the Joint Committee on Health will also begin to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis later this month.  He hopes to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the committee early in the new year.  He will then be in a position to consider and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it must be emphasised that treatment options are a matter to be discussed between patients, their carers and their doctors in the first instance.  Cannabis-based preparations intended for treatment of certain types of epilepsy are currently undergoing clinical trials.  It may be possible for patients to access these products on an individual basis, but this is something for discussion with their doctors.  This is one of the options we should examine.  Cannabis-based preparations are strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  However, it is open to the Minister to consider an application from an Irish registered doctor for a licence for such products for a named patient.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor and the Minister has no role, and it would be entirely inappropriate for him to involve himself in this process.  My understanding is that many doctors would be quite cautious about recommending a cannabis-based treatment for a patient in the absence of robust clinical evidence that underpins authorised medicines.  However, it is open to any doctor to make an application.</p></speech>

These children cannot wait and they need these products as soon as  possible.  Hopefully, the Minister will see common sense and that these children need these products as soon as possible.  Under licence, the doctor will prescribe that medication to them with the guidance of their parents and, hopefully, it will have medical benefits for them.  I welcome the Minister of State's reply.  He is saying it is ultimately up to the Minister to grant the licence for these children.  That application will happen over the next week and, hopefully, the Minister will look favourably on it.</p></speech>

That is my priority as well.  Medicinal cannabis is available in countries such as the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Canada, Australia, Malta and Croatia and the medical profession is aware of this.  The key response to the matter raised by the Deputy is that it is possible for the Minister to consider granting a licence to an Irish-registered doctor for a named patient.  No applications have been received from doctors in Ireland and it is understood from contacts with families that doctors are reluctant to get involved.  However, the Deputy has raised these cases and it is open to the Minister to consider granting a licence and that is the road we should go down.</p>  <p>  It is not up to us, as politicians, to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship but there is a great deal of sympathy for the Deputy on this issue.  He published a Private Members' Bill in late July, which provides for the establishment of the medicinal cannabis regulatory authority.  The Bill is being considered by departmental officials.  Some amendments may have to be made but the initial view is that we are seriously considering the legislation.  The door is open for some sort of movement on the cases raised by the Deputy and I wish him well.</p></speech>

There is nothing more important than him examining the issue of speech and language deficits in the county on his next visit, which will not be too far in the future.</p>  <p>  The younger somebody who needs speech and language therapy obtains access to the service, the more influential it will be on their lives.  The huge waiting list in County Louth in unacceptable.  A total of 284 people are on the list and they have been assessed as needing this provision.  They have been waiting less than a year but the number of the waiting list post-assessment in the adjoining county, Meath, some of which is in my constituency, is 27.  There is a significant difference in the service provision in counties Louth and Meath.  This is shocking, discriminatory and entirely unacceptable.  I do not blame the Minister but rather the HSE, which does not examine these issues in the detail it ought to.  For example, nine new speech therapists have been appointed to both counties, six of whom will be deployed in County Meath, which has the shortest waiting list.  This is shocking and disgraceful and I ask the Minister of State to intervene and to act urgently on this matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to draw attention to another waiting list.</p><p>The number of adults deemed to have intellectual disabilities who are on the waiting list for speech and language therapy in County Louth is 400.  They have no service.  They have no dedicated speech therapist.  That is compared with County Meath where there are five people with intellectual disability aged over 18 awaiting speech and language therapy.  I am not pitting one county against another but whether one lives in Mornington in County Meath outside Drogheda or Monasterboice on the other side of Drogheda, one should not have to wait on a geographical basis.  A person should get the service because he or she needs it.  The people in Louth need it now.  I urge the Minister of State to address that huge, unacceptable deficit.  I understand from speaking to Inclusion Ireland that it is a huge issue nationally.  We need to increase very significantly the number of speech and language therapists nationally.  I await the Minister of State's reply on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500033#FF00200"><p>I thank Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for raising this very important issue.  In the Louth area, Deputy O'Dowd is very committed to supporting the rights of people with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, and also pushing for speech and language therapy services.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises, as Deputy O'Dowd has said, that waiting times for speech and language therapy have posed significant difficulties for families and their children.  However, I can advise the Deputy there has been a reduction of almost 8% in the overall numbers waiting for speech and language therapy services over the period December 2015 to September 2016.  Furthermore, there has been a reduction of over 18% in the numbers waiting for more than eight months for speech and language therapy services over the period November 2015 to September 2016.  The enhancement of therapy services for children and adults has been the subject of particular focus in recent years and has benefited from the investment of significant additional resources.  In 2013, additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts.  As part of this initiative, the HSE recruited for more than 260 additional posts for primary care teams.  This included 52 speech and language therapist appointments.  Since 2014, the roll-out of the programme for progressing disability services for children and young people up to 18 years entailed targeted investment of &euro;14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff including 88.5 speech and language therapists.  I am advised that in 2015 four speech and language therapy posts were allocated to Louth under this programme.</p>  <p>  There are currently 21 directly employed whole-time equivalent speech and language therapy posts in Louth covering primary care and social care.  Nationally, the primary care and social care division also indirectly supports a number of voluntary agencies which employ additional speech and language therapists to deal with the lists.  The combined staff see and provide services to approximately 21,000 patients per month.  In addition, in 2016 development funding of &euro;4 million was provided to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care and social care for children up to 18 years old.  This funding represents a long-term increase in speech and language capacity.  This investment is enabling the HSE to fill 83 new recurring posts in primary care to address waiting lists, prioritising the longest waiting children.  I am advised that three posts have been allocated to Louth under this initiative.  Each additional whole-time equivalent will provide capacity, on average, to undertake 800 initial assessments or 1,400 therapy appointments per annum.  When the 83 positions are filled, the number of speech and language therapy staff in the HSE&rsquo;s primary care and social care services will be close to 700.  The HSE aims to ensure the resources available are used to best effect to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many speech and language therapy services.  The HSE has established a national therapy service review group to address therapy waiting lists, including speech and language therapies.  It is anticipated the group will have completed its work by the end of March 2017.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Dowd says, it is not acceptable to have children like that on waiting lists for speech and language therapies.  I will bring the Deputy's message directly back to the Minister and the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500033#FF00300"><p>I welcome the Minister's comments but it is unacceptable that almost 300 people are waiting for speech and language therapy in Louth whereas the adjoining county, Meath, has fewer than 30 people waiting after assessment.  When the allocation of posts was taking place, six went to Meath and three to Louth.  I agree there must be enough therapists for everybody but this discrimination against County Louth is absolutely unacceptable and unforgivable, particularly in light of the fact that 400 adults with intellectual disability have no service whatsoever.  There is no waiting list and no therapist in County Louth, yet the adjoining county of Meath has a waiting list of five.</p>  <p>  The other point I want to make is on the workload of speech and language therapists in County Louth.  It is recommended in primary care for people aged under 18 that there should not be more than 100 people per whole-time equivalent therapist.  In Louth the figure is 180 so the caseload is approaching double the maximum it should be.  If one looks at the adult network figure, the recommendation is 38 to one but the actual figure is 93 to one.  For disability services, the ratio is 50:1 in both the under-six and six to 18 age groups whereas it should not be greater than 38:1.</p>  <p>  There is a huge challenge here.  I rely on the Minister of State's interest to address this matter urgently.  We cannot continue to deny fundamental rights to access to services for everybody but specifically in County Louth, which is being discriminated against.  In that discrimination, the greatest discrimination is visited upon the 400 adults with disability who are on the waiting list in County Louth.  They have no services and I hope it ends now.</p></speech>

We have to ensure there is equality in the distribution of services.  It is a point I will go back to the Minister and HSE with.  We have to deal with the challenges that exist when recruiting for new positions.  In some cases, the successful candidates are HSE staff from elsewhere in the country, so enhancing capacity in one area means a vacancy arising elsewhere.  Nonetheless, as indicated, in net terms overall capacity has already been substantially increased and will be added to further in the coming months.  It is something I am in further talks about at the moment with regard to the HSE service plan.  We have to respond to this.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is important that while we are trying to address this crisis in our speech and language therapies, we look at a new range of approaches.  To keep things on the road, new approaches have been developed and used in many speech and language therapy services.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents and carers in order that they can work to help to improve the individual's speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The issue of speech and language therapy services has to be dealt with.  I will bring back the Deputy's concerns, particularly those on Louth and Meath.</p></speech>

A number of years ago, all Members of the Oireachtas agreed to A Vision for Change.  Wexford was the first county to do so.  It was the first county to support the closure of what was then the old Victorian St. Senan's institution because we wanted to move away from the old way that people in psychiatric services were dealt with.  We believed at that stage that it was the right thing to do.  It was the right thing to do but a number of years later, there is an enormous deficit in the plan because there is no acute psychiatric admission service in County Wexford.</p><p>If there is a psychiatric admission, the patient goes to Wexford General Hospital.  Subsequently, depending on where the patient is from in the county, he or she is transferred to Waterford or to Newcastle Hospital in County Wicklow.  People in difficult circumstances or dire straits are moved from Wexford General Hospital to somewhere else.  This is not good enough.  There is a lacuna in the service and it must be addressed.

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McEntee.</p>  <p>  The current programme for Government continues to prioritise the development of our mental health services by fully implementing the policy of A Vision for Change.  Since 2012, the mental health budget has increased from &euro;711 million to &euro;826 million.  In 2017, an additional &euro;24.7 million will be given to mental health services, thus bringing the HSE budget for this key care programme to &euro;851 million.  Broadly speaking, this represents an increase of &euro;140 million, or 20%, over the period.  It reflects real progress against a continuing overall background of limited resources and competing demands.</p>  <p>  Waterford and Wexford mental health services cater for a population of approximately 278,000.  The extended catchment and geographic area stretches from Gorey in north Wexford to Youghal in County Cork.  Mental health services in Wexford are arranged in accordance with A Vision for Change.  In addition to emergency hospital care and community-based services, the HSE has a comprehensive range of services available to people in Wexford in respect of mental health, suicide prevention and substance misuse.</p>  <p>  Following a closure order in 2010 from the Mental Health Commission, the acute mental health unit in St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy was amalgamated with Waterford mental health services.  The service is now provided at a 44-bed acute inpatient unit in University Hospital Waterford.  It is not planned by the HSE to use St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, for any future provision of mental health services.  In addition, arrangements are in place whereby service users in north Wexford who attend Tara House mental health services in Gorey and who require acute inpatient admission have access to five beds in Newcastle Hospital in Greystones, County Wicklow.  To support the amalgamation of acute mental health services, a comprehensive &euro;18 million capital investment programme was implemented, with the main developments taking place in County Wexford.  These includes additional bed provision or enhancement of facilities such as those in Tara House, Gorey, T&uacute;s Nua, Heavenview and Miliview in Enniscorthy and the Farnogue psychiatry-of-old-age care and Summerhill community mental health units in County Wexford.</p>  <p>  The suicide crisis assessment nurse, SCAN, service in Wexford is a skilled mental health nursing service for primary care.  The service provides an accessible and quick response to GP requests for timely assessments of those in suicide and self-harm distress.  The emergency department at Wexford General Hospital has a seven-day liaison nurse-led service.  In addition, and in line with catchment area criteria recommended in A Vision for Change, a new purpose-built ten-bed crisis respite unit has been opened in Enniscorthy.</p>  <p>  Many of the services I have outlined, as well as others in the area, operate a seven-day service with significant opening hours.  I am satisfied that the significant and comprehensive service developments, which have taken place or are currently planned for the Waterford and Wexford mental health service area as a whole, will ensure that the provision of quality and patient-focused mental health care across the region continues.

I call on the Ceann Comhairle to provide for another response on this issue.  The last line in the response read out to me is the only part of the response that relates to the question I asked.  The Minister of State said, "In light of this, the HSE has no plans at present to provide the type of service suggested by the Deputy."  That is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

I am altogether aggrieved.  The reason I feel aggrieved is because at the time when A Vision for Changed was launched, Oireachtas Members from County Wexford were prepared to take a leap of faith on the policy.  What has happened instead is that our county, one of the largest in the country, now has no acute psychiatric admission unit.</p>  <p>  I have no wish for St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital to reopen under any circumstances.  What is being requested - and what has been requested for some time - is the establishment of a six-bed acute psychiatric admission unit somewhere in the county.  Most likely, it would be attached to Wexford General Hospital.  That is what I am looking for and that is what is required for such a large county.  God knows, we have had too many occasions when too many terrible circumstances have arisen when people have taken their own lives.  If there was a properly-funded acute admissions service, people's lives could be saved.  That is what I am about and that was what I committed to at the last general election.  I am surprised that there is nothing in the HSE plans to implement what I am suggesting, that is to say, a six-bed unit somewhere in the county.</p></speech>

Certainly, I will undertake to go back to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, with the concerns raised by Deputy D'Arcy.  I imagine she would be happy to sit down with him and whatever advocacy group that accompanies him to discuss the matter.  I will do that.  A six-bed acute admission facility is the request from Deputy D'Arcy.  While there have been substantial increases in the budget, perhaps they have not been reflected in the additional resources requires in the case of Wexford, notwithstanding the extra provision which I have set out in the response from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  Certainly, I will go back to her with the concerns raised by Deputy D'Arcy.  I imagine she will be happy to sit down with him to further tease out the issues to which he refers.

The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will be aware that on 23 December 2015 a competition was held for appointment to the rank of chief superintendent.  An interview board was selected and the competition was conducted in accordance with Civil Service appointments guidelines.</p>  <p>  On 25 May 2016, 18 people were notified by letter of their successful selection for appointment to the position of chief superintendent.  The list of successful candidates was published in Garda headquarters on 26 May and 6 July last.  Shortly afterwards, the Government accepted the legitimacy of that panel of 18.  However, it only appointed ten of the successful persons on the panel as chief superintendents.  Although the remaining eight were part of the panel established on foot of the competition, none has been appointed to date.</p>  <p>  I support the fact that future promotions to the positions of superintendent and chief superintendent in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be the responsibility of the Policing Authority.  The House provided for this under section 12 of the Policing Authority Act.  I have called on the Government to expedite that measure.  Nonetheless, that process is not in place at present.  This does not mean, however, that the Government can walk away from its responsibility to appoint chief superintendents to vacant positions.  There are vacancies for chief superintendent in Cork west, the special detective unit, the roads policy unit, the technical bureau, the crime policing administration unit, the central vetting unit, the operational support unit, the Dublin metropolitan regional office, the Garda Reserve and in internal affairs.  All these units need chief superintendents.</p>  <p>  Are we now going to have a situation such as that which exists in the Judiciary, whereby the Government is unprepared to fulfil its duty because it is waiting for a new regime to come into place?  I understand that the policing authority and the Department have prepared recruitment and promotion guidelines which, we are told, will be introduced before the end of the year.  However, it is unfair to the eight individuals who succeeded in the competition if the Government now puts it to them that they will not be promoted.</p><p>They went through a competition, they succeeded and a panel of 18 was established on foot of the competition.  Each of them signed a declaration that any panel established on foot of the competition would cease on 31 December 2016 or on the commencement of section 12.  However, the Government cannot seek now to subdivide the panel.  It was a panel of 18 successful competitors.  It exists as a panel or it falls as a panel.  The eight who have been discarded have a legitimate expectation that they would be appointed.  In short, they were part of the panel, and it is unfair on the eight successful candidates for the Government now to offer its apologies and state that it will only accept part of the panel.  I am sure the eight individuals will apply again if it is the case that the Policing Authority will be given retrospective responsibility for these appointments.  However, if that happens, it will be even more unfair on these eight individuals because unless they are promoted by the Policing Authority, it will be presented as though they were previously appointed but then rejected by the Policing Authority.</p> <p> There are always issues in respect of transitional changes in statutory regimes.  That is what we have here.  Everyone welcomes the fact that the Policing Authority will take over responsibility in this regard, but these eight people should be treated fairly.  The Government is not treating them fairly.  They are entitled to expect that the State will honour the terms of the competition that previously existed and the integrity of the panel that was established last summer.  Fairness requires that the eight successful applicants should be appointed.  They succeeded under the system under which we all operate at present.</p></speech>

The Minister is committed to the authority assuming its functions regarding senior appointments as soon as practicable, and work is ongoing in her Department on the preparation of the necessary regulations to facilitate this.  At this stage, subject to the authority confirming that it is ready to undertake selection competitions so as to avoid any undue delay in the filling of vacancies, the Minister expects to make the necessary commencement order in December.  In the interim, the appointment of persons to the senior ranks remains a matter for Government in accordance with section 13 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, the Government made a number of appointments to the senior ranks to fill existing vacancies as follows: four appointments were made to the rank of assistant commissioner on 24 May; ten appointments to the rank of chief superintendent; and 18 to the rank of superintendent on 13 July.  The appointments were made in accordance with the statutory framework as set out in the 2005 Act and related regulations.  In particular, the appointees were drawn in order of merit from promotion panels formed on foot of competitions held by the Garda Commissioner in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority was consulted on the proposal to fill these vacancies and it supported the filling of these critical posts up to the limit of the agreed strength as approved by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The appointment of the ten chief superintendents in July brought the number of chief superintendents to the agreed strength as set out in the employment control framework of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as approved by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The Minister was informed by the Garda Commissioner that in September this year a chief superintendent retired.  This, together with the recent departure of an assistant commissioner to take up a post abroad, brings the number of vacancies in the senior ranks to three, including one at superintendent level.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined, the intention is to transfer the appointment function to the authority very shortly.  Once this is done, it will be a matter for the authority to undertake its own selection competitions for appointments to these ranks.  The transfer of this function is a very important signal of reform and, taking account of the very recent origin of the current vacancies, I am sure the Deputy will understand that the Minister's clear preference is that the authority should have the opportunity as early as possible after taking on this function to exercise the function itself.  This will give confidence to the new oversight arrangements in place and to the role of the Policing Authority in those arrangements.</p></speech>

Everyone in this House - or most people in this House - welcomes the fact that, in future, important decisions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to who should be promoted will be made by the Policing Authority.  That is a positive development.  However, we need to consider where we are at present.  We do not have that system in place.  We do not have a system in place whereby the regulations are available to the Policing Authority, which in turn has the power to promote individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Consequently, we are operating under the old regime.  Everyone welcomes the transition that will take place.  However, since we are still operating under the old regime, fairness dictates that the individuals who were on that panel and who had a legitimate expectation that it would be kept intact should be entitled to promotion to the position of chief superintendent.</p>  <p>  I note that the Minister of State says it is the expectation of the Minister that all of this new regime will be in place shortly.  We do not know that will be the case.  On many occasions in this House we have been told that there is an expectation that something will be done shortly.  We cannot allow the governance of this country to come to a standstill simply because we are waiting for a new statutory regime to be put in place.  That is what has been done in respect of the appointment of judges.  It now appears it is being done in respect of the promotion of individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to chief superintendent.  The job of Government is to govern.  Nobody can criticise the Government for the fact that there are vacancies within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for positions of chief superintendent if it now proceeds to fill them.</p>  <p>  I will conclude by saying once again that the eight individuals who succeeded in this competition and who are on the panel - and that panel has resulted in certain individuals being promoted - have a legitimate expectation and a right to expect fairness from this Government.</p></speech>

Her Department is working as a matter of priority on the preparations required to give effect to this transfer before the end of the year.  The commencement of section 12 is dependent on the regulations governing promotion in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being amended to reflect the envisaged role of the authority.  In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner and the authority must be consulted on any proposed changes to these regulations.  In addition, the Garda representative bodies are being consulted.  Work on the preparation of the proposed changes to the regulations is well advanced in the Department and, as I said, the Minister expects that this necessary preparatory work will be completed this year.  All going to plan, the function will transfer to the authority in December.  I have taken note of other points the Deputy has raised, and we will bring them to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the European Defence Agency.  The EDA is an agency of the European Union and is composed of defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states and the European Commission.</p><p>Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes in the region of &euro;311,000 to the annual costs of running the agency, including its annual work programme.  The European Defence Agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, in obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness, securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement, which have been notable for fragmentation and duplication.</p><p>The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 regulates IreIand's participation in European Defence Agency <i>ad hoc</i>projects.  It prescribes that participation in category A or B projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  A category A project is one which all member states join unless they specifically opt out; a category B project is one in which two or more member states come together to pursue a particular initiative.  The proposal put forward by the Minister of State with responsibility for defence today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects, one in the area of maritime surveillance, the other in the area of cyber ranges.</p><p>This category B project, MARSUR Networking - Adaptive Maintenance, MARSUR II, is a follow-on to the category B project, Maritime Surveillance Networking, which ended in October 2015.</p><p>The objective of the initial project was to develop an automated information sharing environment through the development of software technologies and the formation of a network to enhance information sharing within the maritime surveillance community.  This web-based system is now operational and information regarding the positions of ships, fisheries protection and maritime safety and security is engaged in a number of electronic forms between member states participating in this project.  This has proven particularly useful for the Irish Naval Service, which is currently carrying out humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean Sea.  Classified information is being exchanged between ships and the Italian authorities, who are involved in the rescue of migrants in this area.  The main objective of the follow-on category B project is life cycle support of the existing maritime surveillance capability through provision of adaptive maintenance, system upgrades and enhancements and technical support.  It will ensure the system is maintained, kept up to date and adapted to meet the ongoing needs of the Naval Service.<br/><br/>I will now provide some detail on the second European Defence Agency project.  This category B project aims to maintain and improve cyber resilience, as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of member states personnel.  Cyber attacks pose a potential threat to the communications and command and control systems of the Defence Forces both at home and overseas.  The requirement to be able to defend Defence Forces systems against cyber attacks has been identified as a specific capability requirement by the Defence Forces.  Cyber ranges are a virtual environment used for cyber training, exercises and technology testing and evaluation.  It also provides the means to help strengthen knowledge of cyber defence operators and<br/><br/>performance of the computer information systems.  It can be remotely accessed in one country by personnel from another location or country.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has the lead role in the whole-of-government response to the cyber threat.<br/><br/>This project is about the Defence Forces having access to a secure cyber environment, as distinct from the ICT systems they use in the course of their activities, in which they can test their own ability to secure and defend the ICT systems on which they rely.  Participation in the training and exercises available through this EDA category B project will enhance the capacity within the Defence Forces to secure, protect and defend their own systems against cyber attack and also to contribute to enhanced cyber security capacity at national level.<br/><br/>The total budget for the new maritime surveillance category B project is &euro;675,000 and the cost of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this project is &euro;15,000 per annum and &euro;45,000 over the life of the project.  With the second project, cyber ranges, there will be no financial contribution to this project.<br/><br/>In conclusion, lreland's participation in the EDA affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence, published in 2015, states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate in multinational capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.  The two projects discussed today are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in maritime surveillance and in cyber defence.  On behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500036#JJ00200"><p>I welcome our participation in the European Defence Agency.  We discussed this at length at committee level and at that stage I made it very clear that I very much supported our participation in both of these projects.</p>  <p>  The European Defence Agency allows us the opportunity to pool resources, connect with other member states and benefit from economies of scale.  We get to share knowledge and obtain information from other member states, perhaps on operations they do better than us.  Perhaps we do some things better and we can share it with other member states.  It is a very efficient way of doing business and ensuring our troops have the most up-to-date knowledge and experience.</p>  <p>  Our participation in these training programmes ensures that our soldiers receive the best training and expertise that they can get to assist them in their overseas duties.  We know our soldiers go on peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions but we should be clear that these are not holidays.  They are extremely dangerous excursions for up to six months or even longer.  It is very important that we ensure our troops have the most up-to-date training they can get.  That means when they go abroad and interact with other armies in countries where it is not entirely safe, we can ensure that they are as best equipped as they can be to come home safely.</p>  <p>  We have one of the lowest rates of spending of any EU member state.  It is not that I advocate for large amounts to be spent on defence but it is worth noting that we are very modest in the amount of money we spend on our Defence Forces.  Participating in these programmes allows us the opportunity, while spending some money, to get back in return something that represents significant value for money in terms of training, expertise and access to knowledge that we would not have otherwise.</p>  <p>  Two programmes were described by the Minister of State.  The MARSUR networking is a continuation of a previous project on which we have already embarked.  We initially participated in this automated network, which allows members of the community to share knowledge on the position of ships and other fisheries protection issues.  Most recently we have seen it being used where Irish authorities and the Irish Naval Service communicated with the Italian authorities on joint operations to save migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean.  That demonstrates that having this capability and access to the most up-to-date information allows us to do our duties to the best of our abilities.  We can all say we are very proud of the work that our Defence Forces have conducted in that regard in assisting migrants and as part of addressing the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.</p>  <p>  The cyber ranges are a fairly new technology and it demonstrates that we are thinking ahead, recognising and anticipating down the line what we as a country may face in terms of security.  Cyber ranges allow us to pool expertise and knowledge while participating in these cyber ranges to test technology and conduct exercises in a virtual reality.  It allows us to test our capabilities in terms of withstanding or dealing with a cyber attack in our own country.  We hope we never have to deal with such an instance but we would be very foolish and naive to think we are totally immune from such an attack.  Given it is such a complex area that is constantly progressing and changing, it is difficult to stay on top of it.  Certainly, in terms of sharing knowledge and learning what other countries are doing to deal with the potential threat of cyber attacks, this can only be positive.</p>  <p>  We may be a small country but we have always punched above our weight.  Certainly, our Defence Forces have done no less than that.  We have always operated to the very best of our abilities and at a very professional and modern level.  It is because of our participation in these joint projects with other countries that we have been able to do that.  We are a small country and we do not have the resources and capabilities to do all this training on our own.  It is imperative that our troops are facilitated and encouraged to participate in these projects with other countries.  They are similar to other projects in the past where we have done training related to nuclear and biological warfare.  This involves the anticipation of potential threats that we could face in our country or that troops could face abroad while on duty representing our country.  It is up to us when we send troops abroad that we know they are as safe as they can possibly be.  I ask anybody suggesting that participation in this training is not good to think about sending troops overseas to participate in a mission where they do not have the same skill set as other soldiers from other countries.  It is not a position with which I would be very comfortable.</p>  <p>  I support the participation in both these projects and I look forward to the continued participation in joint defence projects with other countries.</p></speech>

It would be very difficult to oppose the efficiencies that would help our Defence Forces gain experience and knowledge.  In this instance we are told the MARSUR II project will enhance the Naval Service's ability to fulfil the humanitarian task it is carrying out brilliantly in the Mediterranean.  The second motion deals with virtual scenarios to deal with cyber security and attacks on military cyber security, etc.  It relates to the experience that will be gained by those in the military dealing cyber security.</p><p>I raised some questions surrounding both projects at the select committee.  The Minister of State answered some of those questions but I still have concerns about our ability to protect our interests in the cyber security area, even though it is a virtual project in itself.</p> <p> The context in which we are dealing with the EDA and the militarisation of the EU has shifted greatly in the past two weeks in light of the election of Donald Trump as US President.  Before and during the presidential debate, Donald Trump and others in the US demanded that the EU should take on a greater role in its own defence.  He put it to the NATO countries and other countries that they had a role to play.  As a result of this State signing up to the Lisbon treaty, we have agreed to enhance the capability of each of the individual EU armies.  The other part of the context for this debate is the agreement at yesterday's meeting of EU foreign and defence Ministers to move quickly in reaction to the agenda set out by Donald Trump by trying to distance themselves from it.  That was specifically why the meeting was held.  The Ministers agreed to create a military headquarters, or "permanent operational planning and conduct capability", to command "non-executive military missions".  They further agreed that the battle groups should be used more frequently.</p> <p> Last week, I raised with the Minister the decision to use the EU budget for the first time to subsidise military research.  I highlighted the preparatory action for defence research spending of &euro;80 million on EU military research.  If this goes ahead and there is not enough clamour about it, there is a proposal that they will move towards spending &euro;3.5 billion of EU money on military research by 2020.  That is a major shift, given that the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.  The EU, as a group of nations, is supposed to be advancing and enhancing peace in the world, but its recent actions are in total contradiction to that.  This should not be a surprise given that many of these countries have an imperialist status and are members of NATO.  The EDA is part of the EU military complex.  For that reason, I oppose motions that come before the House with the intention of enhancing the agency.</p></speech>

I am against the arms industry.  There is simply no justification for the disgusting arms industry.  The EDA was previously known as the European Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities Agency, which was a more accurate title, before its name was softened and it became the EDA.  It was set up explicitly to ramp up defence spending and the military-industrial complex and to produce more weapons for use and for sale.  The EDA is about developing the European military-industrial complex.  The consequences of that are disgusting, in my opinion.  I do not use that word lightly.</p>  <p>  EU countries have licensed arms exports valued at &euro;39.9 billion.  This includes &euro;9.7 billion to the Middle East.  The biggest recipient is Saudi Arabia.  I really do not have to say any more.  Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship which is involved in an absolutely savage assault on the people of Yemen.  It has produced a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including the displacement of millions of people and the deaths of tens of thousands of people.  It is an obnoxious regime at every level.  The European military-industrial complex, which the EDA was set up specifically to support, is promoting this kind of stuff.  That is what leads to the sorts of horrors we are seeing in the Middle East, including the displacement of millions of people in Syria.  Ireland is being progressively dragged into this stuff because of our support for treaties that explicitly increase and ramp up our involvement in this area.  There is simply no excuse for the sale of components of arms to countries like Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Israel and the purchase of military equipment from places like Israel.  We will not support any further involvement in the European military-industrial complex.</p></speech>

The Government's statement in the White Paper on Defence that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed "to improving the potential for Irish enterprise to compete for Defence contracts" means that it wants a cut of this peddling of death.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, the agency exists to promote the military-industrial complex in Europe.  That is what it is.  We should have nothing to do with the EDA.</p>  <p>  The context for this debate is very important.  I remind the House that the idea that there was a process towards militarisation in the EU, leading to a European army, used to be ridiculed.  The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the most powerful person in the EU, said last week following the election of Donald Trump that "we have to do this ourselves, which is why we need a new approach to building a European security union with the end goal of establishing a European army".  That is what is happening here.  EU Ministers agreed at yesterday's meeting to create a mini military headquarters, in effect, and to have joint rapid reaction forces.  They said that battle groups could form the core of the new multifunctional civilian and military capabilities.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously in the D&aacute;il, there are divisions not between those who want war and those who want peace, but between those who want an independent European army and those who want to be linked to NATO.  Those divisions among people who are in favour of further militarisation are going to come out in the context of Donald Trump and the idea of NATO being downgraded.  For this precise reason, a number of groups have called for a protest at the US Embassy at 6 p.m. on Thursday.  It will be a protest against Donald Trump and against the policies of war and racism, etc.  These issues are relevant in America and here.  Last weekend, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste represented the Government at events commemorating the lost generation of people who were victims of the First World War.  Working-class people learned from that war that the danger of inter-imperialist rivalry is that they are the people who get butchered.  However, the Government has not learned a thing.</p></speech>

The two projects outlined by the Minister of State seem simple and safe.  It seems that we should not be too worried about this matter.  Like other Members of the House, I am concerned about our continued involvement in the EDA.  We seem to be on a drip-drip road towards the complete integration at a military level of the EU and the further expansion of the military capabilities of the EU.  Deputies are often derided for saying this is not going to happen because of the triple lock system in this State.  I suggest we will wake up very quickly when we are actually involved in this.  Everybody is going to wonder how we arrived at this place.  It is actually happening.  The European Commission recently outlined its work programme for the coming year.  It intends to make Europe a "stronger global actor" because "a Europe that protects also defends our interests beyond our borders".</p><p>That does not seem to have very good implications.  They then go on to say that soft power is not enough in an increasingly conflictual world.  The opposite to soft power is hard power.  We saw how that played out in recent years in regard to the destruction of Libya by the British and the French military primarily, assisted by the Americans.  Is that the kind of thing we want, as a state, to become more deeply involved in?<br/><br/>Yesterday we had the joint Council meeting between EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and Defence Ministers, where they agreed to set up this mini-military HQ, as they call it.  The EU foreign service says it will have a permanent operational planning and conduct capability and will command non-executive military missions, such as training the Libyan or Iraqi military, but not combat.  This is despite the fact we would have to ask who are the Libyan military at this stage, given the different militias that exist within Libya, yet we are quite happy to go along and participate in that.  After yesterday's meeting, Italy's Foreign Minister said the mini-HQ was &quot;not yet a European general staff&quot; but &quot;that was the premise&quot;.  That is the road the EU is on.  We are going to see very quickly in the next year a ramping up of military involvement and military activity.  Federica Mogherini, speaking after the Council yesterday, said:</p><blockquote>It also includes the way forward: strengthening rapid response and reinforcing the usability of the Battle Groups.  Next year it will be ten years we have them; they were never used - maybe it is time to make use of the instruments we have.</blockquote><p>To my mind, that is very dangerous talk.  It implies the EU is itching to send out these battlegroups and to make use of them in the exercise of what can only be described as hard power.  We have seen how the EU has behaved in recent years, not only in the destruction of Libya but also in regard to how it encouraged and facilitated a coup in Ukraine, which sparked a conflict with Russia in that country, and how it has effectively supported a fascist-type Government in Ukraine.  We also see how many European member states have bombed Syria and participated quite happily in that, although it is illegal under international law.  In particular, we saw how the French rolled out bombing there after the disgraceful attacks on their territory, a response that saw the bombing of innocent civilians.<br/><br/>This is something I do not believe we should be happy to participate in.  While the projects encompassed by today's motion seem quite simple, it is a sign of deepening development within the EU and the European Defence Agency.  I believe it is something we should be very worried about and we should oppose it tooth and nail.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that Europe and, indeed, this country are under increased threats from the rise of militant Islamic organisations and groups organising cyber-crime attacks.  To that extent, we need to consider practical ways to increase co-operation among member states without creating an overly militarised culture.  It is important we deal with such issues without getting sucked into the military machine.  One of the things which many people in Europe are afraid of is that, in our haste to defend ourselves, we run the risk of creating something akin to a European state army.  We can never emphasise this enough because we do not want it.  We have been a neutral country and we respect our neutrality, despite what may be happening with different issues relating to the Middle East.</p>  <p>  While the motion is quite technical, I would raise a matter of deep concern related to how we extend our involvement with European defence projects.  I have concerns that this is one area where we must use the limited resources we have to strengthen the quality of life for the men and woman who serve in the Defence Forces on this island.  In fact, questions about the Army were raised with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business today.  We know that poverty rates in the Garda are real and the same applies to the Defence Forces, many of whose members are struggling to survive.  Before we consider European supports, we must look after those at home.  It should not be like the situation with the veterans in the United States who have been neglected.  The members of the Defence Forces have served all over the world on peacekeeping missions.  We had a wonderful establishment in Clonmel before the last Government closed that excellent barracks.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces said there is no reason soldiers, sailors or air crew should be sleeping in cars.  The problem is that they are, in many cases.  The Minister and the Government need to smell the coffee.  This is because of the remuneration they receive and the lack of subsistence.  Lieutenant-General Conor O'Boyle was responding to a claim by PDFORRA at its annual conference that a small number of enlisted personnel were forced to do this because they could not afford to drive home after work.  It is true.  With the closure of barracks in places like Clonmel, they now have to go to Kilkenny, Cork or further afield.  PDFORRA has said that accommodation costs &euro;2,500 a year, money that those who stay in their cars simply do not have.  PDFORRA has also claimed that more than 20% of enlisted personnel are receiving family income supplement payments, which is a staggering figure.  These are the kinds of issues we need to think about before we overextend our Defence Forces, which are already stretched.</p>  <p>  Those are my sentiments.  While cyber crime is a huge threat and we must lend any support we can to try to deal with it and fend off those attacks, we need to have a modern, well supported and well resourced Defence Forces.  For that, we need morale to be kept at a high level but it is clearly not at a high level.  There are huge issues which I am dealing with every day of the week, such as transfers from barracks and family issues, and personnel find it very hard to get any understanding or appreciation of their family situations.</p>  <p>  I suggest we make haste slowly before we get involved in any of these issues.  We must remember how we have always maintained our neutral stance.  We need to have more support and respect for ex-Army veterans and those currently serving in the Army.</p></speech>

While we very much support our Defence Forces in the work they are doing in the Mediterranean and in countering cyber-terrorism, we have real concerns about the nature of the strengthening of these common European defence operations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the role of maritime surveillance, we have a general concern that the approach the EU has taken in recent years has not shown the proper regard for international refugee law.  While we have ended up sending in our own naval vessels in order to save lives, the manner in which the EU has approached this through the Mare Nostrum programme that was first applied by the Italians, and wider involvement of the EU in the whole area, has not brought about a process of managing the refugee issue in a way which does credit either to the EU or anyone involved.</p>  <p>  We have a concern that the deployment of this technology or the improvement in the surveillance mechanisms for vessels at sea will not necessarily lead to an improvement in the areas we would like to see improved, for example, surveillance against illegal fishing in Irish waters or other movements within Irish waters.  In addition, we would love to see some sort of mechanism to track UK nuclear submarines coming out of the rivers in Scotland and their passage through Irish waters.  As Brexit looms, it is that type of surveillance measure we would like to see greater certainty about.  Our fear is that this will be used in the Mediterranean area, including the Aegean, to continue a policy that has not worked.</p>  <p>  The dramatic increase in the budget for Frontex and the nature of the European military response to trying to protect our border is one we have real concerns about.</p><p>We are concerned about this budget allocation although it is very small.  If it is a sign of approval of the way Europe has managed the refugee and migration crisis, particularly on our southern borders, we cannot agree with it.</p> <p> While I very much welcome the possibility for us to increase our capability by training and upgrading of staff in the use of cyber ranges to improve our ability to defend ourselves from cyber attacks, I am concerned that the scale of our capability is not being sufficiently ramped up.  Following the potential Brexit of our nearest neighbour, the UK, which already engages in widespread surveillance of everything that happens on the Internet in Ireland, it behoves us as it leaves the Union to look to increase our capabilities in this area and to be able to observe all ranges of cyber surveillance, including interstate cyber surveillance.  That does not seem to be one of the issues we are highlighting or seeking to address here.  As we head into a more dangerous world with the American and British Governments seeming to head into a more isolationist and less co-operative mode, we need to be careful to seek to maintain our security.  I do not believe we will do that by an investment in a European security infrastructure which is designed according to a different mode of thinking from the Irish one.  We have a better approach, based on neutrality, respect for the United Nations, supporting international refugee law and peacekeeping processes.</p> <p> This mechanism might lead us to trying to cut off the problem at the ports of exit in Libya where we have caused a problem partly by European military intervention in the area, leaving it without any government.  We might now look to do side deals where we would finance local groups or warlords or try to provide a refugee and border management system based not on the rule of international law but on the rules of the jungle which seem to have applied in recent years.</p></speech>

We will also table an amendment on this section as we do not believe it is in the public interest.  Indeed we should be moving to a situation where we have legislation requiring more or fuller disclosures, not fewer.  Sinn F&eacute;in does, however, welcome the introduction of a new category in the legislation, the micro company.  This is defined as a company which does not exceed any two of the following criteria: an annual turnover of &euro;700,000 or less, a balance sheet total of &euro;350,000 or less and an average number of ten or fewer employees.  This is especially significant as the majority of companies in Ireland would come below this threshold.  The Revenue Commissioners would have a far lower threshold for the categorisation of micro businesses.  In this regard and in the context of reducing the administrative burden for micro businesses, as part of their simplified processes the Revenue Commissioners allow micro companies to pay their VAT, PAYE and PRSI liabilities on a less frequent basis.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in would also like for the Revenue Commissioners to extend similar arrangements to micro businesses for corporation tax and income tax so that they do not have to pay a large tax bill in one lump sum.  Furthermore, it would be useful to allow businesses to pay tax on account during the year.  This would be of particular use for micro businesses in the service sector with seasonal cashflow.</p>  <p>  As well as easing the administration of the tax system for micro businesses, Sinn F&eacute;in would have increased the self-employed tax credit to &euro;1,300 in 2017 to help small business people and move then to full equalisation with the PAYE credit.  I was quite disappointed that the Government increased the self-employed tax credit to only &euro;950 for 2017.</p>  <p>  Moving back to the Bill, we also welcome the closing of the loophole regarding companies that are registered in Ireland as unlimited but have established ownership structures offshore with the effect that the ultimate liability of the owners is limited.  Such companies will, under the proposed legislation, now be required to submit a financial statement with their annual returns.</p>  <p>  Finally, as noted earlier, we welcome chapter 10 of the Accounting Directive requiring companies involved in the extractive industries and in the logging of primary forests, whether in or outside of the EU, to now make reports on payments to governments.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this long overdue legislation.  However, we do have certain concerns about aspects of the Bill and we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

This is long overdue and will be welcomed by many people working in those industries.  Simplifying the reporting mechanisms will help SMEs throughout the country.</p>  <p>  It is a serious problem for me that we are dealing with this legislation in the middle of November.  It is incredible.  It is further evidence of a do-nothing Government in a do-nothing D&aacute;il.  This directive was adopted at EU level in June 2013.  It is a good directive which, bar a few minor tweaks, should go through the House easily and will be welcomed.  Ireland was required to transpose it into national law by 20 July 2015 but of course that deadline was missed.  We were one of only two countries, along with Cyprus, not to implement the directive by its due date.  In September 2015 the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was sent a letter of formal notice by the Commission, yet according to all the documentation made available, which I have seen, nothing was done.  In May when Deputy Mitchell O'Connor was appointed Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department gave us all access to a detailed briefing document.  On page 15 of that brief, in big bold print was the heading "immediate priorities" and the first item on the list was the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016, yet six months later the Bill is only starting its passage through the D&aacute;il.  In his reply, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation might explain why it has taken so long to bring forward legislation which the Members of this House will support, apart from minor tweaks probably relating to reporting procedures.  Some of my issues about bringing forward the timelines and so on were addressed in the Minister's opening statement.  Why did it take this long?</p>  <p>  If it takes six months to bring forward this legislation, which is marked immediate priority, how long will it take to bring forward other legislation that is going to become a priority in the coming months?</p><p>God knows.  As already stated, this is a pretty simple piece of legislation that has to be transposed.</p> <p> To make matters worse, in June the Commission had to issue a reasoned opinion against Ireland on the matter because the Department did not action the transposition of the directive.  I recall the issues we have had in this House over a period and under various Governments in the context of transposing European directives.  I have seen it from both sides of the fence.  When I was an MEP, I saw it when I was fighting to get directives transposed.  In my time as a Minister, I also witnessed what is required to transpose a European law and the time and planning involved.  It is important that Departments plan in advance.  Efforts must always be made to ensure that laws are transposed within the prescribed period.  Historically, Ireland had a very poor record in transposing EU law.  However, such were the efforts of the previous Government, of which the Minister of State and I were both members, that we reached a point in 2013 at which there was not a single case initiated against Ireland by the Commission at the European Court of Justice for failure to implement EU law.  Last year, there was only one case, yet this Department and its Minister, through simple inertia, were trying to put Ireland back before the European Court of Justice.</p> <p> I am delighted that this Bill is coming through the Houses now.  In his reply, I ask the Minister of State to explain why it has taken so long to make something pretty simple happen.  It is not a once-off failure by the Department.  A document published by his Department in August shows that there are not one or two but eight other EU directives that have not been transposed into Irish law by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  My simple observation is this.  I support the Bill, though I have some minor amendments that I will put forward on Committee Stage.  In fairness, many of the issues that I had were dealt with in the opening statement earlier, particularly around timelines.  However, I have some questions.  Why did it take so long for this to be transposed?  What is going on in the Department and with the senior Minister in the context of transposing European law into Irish law?  Is there a problem or an issue in respect of which this House needs to be notified?  I ask the Minister of State to outline the position</p></speech>

It is of course true that small and micro Irish companies have been waiting to apply the benefits of this Bill.  Once it is enacted, those companies will find their financial reporting requirements more straightforward and will notice savings in time and effort.  That can only be a good thing.  I hope we can bring this Bill through the House efficiently and I know there is support for that from Members.  That said, efficiency should not come at the cost of a proper consideration of the issues.  It is clear from the contributions of Deputies on Second Stage that we can expect good and hopefully constructive engagement on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  While Deputies may see scope for some changes or room for manoeuvre, in some areas that may be limited as this Bill is transposing the EU accounting directive.  By the same token, we are amending the Companies Act 2014.  That is underpinned by some important policy objectives that should be kept in mind.  I was involved in bringing that Companies Act, which was quite a large item of legislation compared to the current one, through committee.  This Bill is much more straightforward.  The Companies Act was large and I would not recommend us going through that again page by page.  In any event, all proposals for amendments will be considered with an open mind.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, noted earlier, the Bill seeks to strike a balance between reducing the financial reporting obligations of small and very small companies, on one hand, and ensuring that there is meaningful information for third parties, on the other.  It is only right that the legislators address that balance.</p>  <p>  On the timing of the Bill, the Government acknowledges that there has been a long delay in bringing it forward.  We are going to try to bring it through the Houses as quickly as we can in the months ahead.  We agree that its timely implementation is very important.</p>  <p>  The Bill contains very technical aspects and the preparation took time as a result.  I know from my time spent in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that while a Bill like this might seem straightforward and simple, it can actually be quite complicated and it is important that it is gotten right.  As Deputy Kelly knows from his time as a Minister, it can be very difficult to find space when it comes to the people drafting legislation.  That can take a bit of time but I am glad that the legislation is now on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am glad that it is being debated.  In recognition that it is a complicated Bill, section 4 will allow for some retrospective effects in order that companies can apply the benefits to financial reports for a period before the legislation comes into force.  We are especially conscious of the time of year.  It is important that we do as I have outlined.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked about timelines for eight other directives.  I did remember them in the past but I do not have the timelines with me.  I will get them for the Deputy and forward them to him.  Hopefully, with the way the D&aacute;il is up and running now, things will move a lot more rapidly and we will get through legislation much quicker.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their time and ask them to support the Bill as a priority.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="19:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500040#NN01300"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, I want to thank the House for facilitating early discussion of this short Bill, which is primarily intended to avoid potentially serious disruption to court business following a recent Court of Appeal ruling.  Such disruption could arise from the need to transfer proceedings already under way before the Circuit Court to the High Court or to commence such proceedings in the High Court, with the risk of additional costs and delay for the parties involved.  The Bill contains a series of technical proposals which deal with the consequences of the Court of Appeal&rsquo;s ruling of 28 July last in Permanent TSB <i>v.</i>Langan, a case stated to the Court of Appeal from the High Court under the Courts of Justice Act 1936.  The High Court had sought Court of Appeal direction on a number of legal points concerning the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in cases involving property following a number of earlier High Court rulings that had arrived at differing conclusions and had created legal uncertainty.</p><p>  The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in cases involving land has been defined in several statutes on the basis of the rateable valuation of the property concerned.  These include the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Succession Act 1965.  Where the rateable valuation is less than &euro;254, originally &pound;200, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction.  Where the rateable valuation exceeds this threshold, the High Court has jurisdiction, unless the parties agree that the case may be heard in the Circuit Court.  The issue that arose in the Langan case concerned the Circuit Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction in cases in which the property concerned is not rateable under the terms of the Valuation Act 2001.  Section 15 of that Act provides that the categories of property referred to in Schedule 4 shall not be rateable.  It includes property such as domestic dwellings, agricultural land and farm buildings.</p><p>In the Langan case, the Court of Appeal ruled that where property is not rateable under the 2001 Act because it is included in Schedule 4, the Circuit Court has no jurisdiction to hear proceedings in respect of such property.  While the court felt obliged to reach this conclusion, it recognised that the ruling was likely to lead to consequences which were &ldquo;both unfortunate and unintended&rdquo;.  The court acknowledged that certain proceedings would have to be commenced in the High Court instead of the Circuit Court and that this would simply create additional costs for litigants &quot;and will serve to deprive the parties of access to local courts in the manner in which the Constitution actually intended.&quot;  The Bill seeks to address these unintended consequences and to avoid disruption of the orderly management and discharge of court proceedings already under way, as well as any additional costs arising from a collapse or withdrawal of proceedings based on rateable valuation.<br/><br/>The T&aacute;naiste has asked me to underline the point that this Bill does not have implications for repossession proceedings in respect of principal private residences and will neither undermine nor erode the rights of such borrowers to due process and the remedies afforded under insolvency law.  Under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, the Circuit Court has been given jurisdiction to deal with repossession proceedings involving principal private residences, irrespective of when the mortgage was created, its rateable valuation or its market value.  I very much regret that attempts are being made to create a contrary perception.  As the House will be aware, a new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service, Abhaile, was officially launched recently by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social Protection.  Under the scheme, eligible clients are given vouchers to obtain expert advice from financial and legal advisers in order to resolve their debt issues.  In addition, they can get assistance in court where needed, have access to solicitors, and get help obtaining legal aid.  More than 2,400 vouchers have been issued under the scheme to date in respect of 1,718 principal private residences.  A major Government information campaign will be launched in the coming weeks to raise awareness of the scheme.<br/><br/>I will turn now to the detailed proposals in the Bill.  With a view to minimising disruption to court business and avoiding additional costs for parties, section 1 provides that where proceedings involving non-rateable property under statutes referred to in the accompanying table have already been commenced in the Circuit Court before the entry into force of this Act, then the Circuit Court shall be deemed to continue to have jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings.  That will help to ensure continuity and avoid disruption.<br/><br/>Section 1(2) provides, however, that the continuity provision in subsection (1) shall not apply where a court has made a finding that the Circuit Court does not have jurisdiction or where a party to the proceedings has raised an issue of the Circuit Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction or the court itself has raised an issue relating to jurisdiction.  That is intended, in particular, to safeguard the rights of any party to the proceedings that has raised an issue regarding the Circuit Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Section 1(3) explains the terms used in subsections (1) and (2), while the table that follows subsection (3) lists three statutes in which Circuit Court jurisdiction has been defined exclusively in terms of the rateable valuation of property, that is, section 22(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961; section 18 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 and; section 6 of the Succession Act 1965).<br/><br/>The purpose of section 2 is to provide a mechanism whereby the market value of land which is the subject of existing Circuit Court proceedings and which will be continued under the provisions of section 1, may be determined.  Subsection (1) provides for the lodging of an affidavit in which a party states that to the best of his or her knowledge or belief the market value of the property does not exceed the threshold.  A rebuttable presumption mechanism will ensure that any disputes as to the market value of the property can be resolved.<br/><br/>In section 3, under both section 10(5) of the Family Home Protection Act 1976 and section 140(10) of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, the District Court has jurisdiction in certain cases in which the rateable valuation of land is less than &euro;25.  Such proceedings are also affected by the Court of Appeal ruling in cases of non-rateable property.  In order to ensure continuity in these cases, section 3 provides that the District Court shall have, and be deemed always to have had, jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings.  That shall not apply, however, where a party to proceedings or the court has raised an issue concerning jurisdiction.  I should point out that it was agreed in the context of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 that District Court jurisdiction in cases involving land would be discontinued on commencement of section 48 of that Act.  Following the commencement order which I intend to make to coincide with enactment of this Bill, the District Court will no longer have jurisdiction in proceedings involving land where its rateable valuation is less than &euro;25.  It will continue, however, to have jurisdiction in the case of chattels up to a value of &euro;15,000.<br/><br/>Section 4 inserts a new section 53A into the 2004 Act.  It contains a new rebuttable presumption mechanism whereby the value of property will be presumed to be below &euro;3 million for evidentiary purposes.  However, in the event of a dispute as to the alleged market value, a party may adduce evidence that the value of the property exceeds &euro;3 million and that proceedings should be brought before the High Court rather than the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>Section 5 amends several sections of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 in order to provide that the existing right to apply to have proceedings under those provisions transferred from the Circuit Court to the High Court will only apply where the land involved has a market value above &euro;3 million.  This change will, following the making of relevant commencement orders, bring the right to apply to have proceedings transferred to the High Court into line with corresponding provisions in other family law legislation, namely, the Family Home Protection Act 1976; the Judicial Separation and Reform Act 1989; the Family Law Act 1995 and; the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996).  Subsection 2(b) will replace the existing text of subsection (10) of section 140.  As already stated, the District Court will no longer have jurisdiction in proceedings involving land where its rateable valuation is less than &euro;25 but will continue to have jurisdiction in the case of chattels up to a value of &euro;15,000, similar to its jurisdiction under the Family Home Protection Act 1976.<br/><br/>Section 6 is a technical provision which substitutes a new text for subsection (3) of section 60 of the Valuation Act 2001.  It will now provide that production to a tribunal or court of a certificate issued under section 67(4) by an authorised officer shall be sufficient evidence, until the contrary is proved of the matters stated in the certificate.  At present, this subsection does not include a reference to section 67.<br/><br/>Section 7 states that rateable valuation thresholds are in use not only to determine Circuit Court jurisdiction but matters unrelated to jurisdiction such as, for example, eligibility to acquire freehold title in accordance with ground rents legislation.  Under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978, the ground rent tenant&rsquo;s right to acquire the freehold arises in certain cases where the amount of the annual ground rent is less than the rateable valuation for the property concerned.  In order to facilitate continued exercise of this right and continued use in various other contexts, for example, in cases of non-rateable property, section 67 of the 2001 Act allows the Valuation Office to issue a certificate of rateable valuation to the ground rent tenant in the case of non-rateable property, that is, property included in Schedule 4 of the 2001 Act.  In order to preserve this important mechanism, and continued usage of rateable valuation in matters unrelated to Circuit Court jurisdiction, it is proposed to insert a new subsection (2A) in section 67 of the 2001 Act.  It clarifies that the certificates issued under that section are based on the value of other comparable properties appearing on valuation lists existing prior to the roll-out of the new valuation system under the 2001 Act.<br/><br/>Section 8 contains a proposal to rectify a technical error in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015 where failure to provide a negative condition in section 170A(3Xa) means that the subsection as enacted has the opposite effect to what was intended.  It means that whatever conclusion An Bord Plean&aacute;la may come to in its assessment of whether a proposed amendment to a strategic development zone, SDZ, planning scheme is minor or significant in nature, it must under the current provision ask the planning authority to make the amendment in line with the procedure laid down in section 169 of the Act, in effect triggering the full procedure for adopting an SDZ planning scheme in the first instance.  The proposed amendment will enable An Bord Plean&aacute;la to adjudicate on and amend approved SDZ planning schemes in carefully defined circumstances, such as very minor changes or changes not affecting the broad objectives of the planning scheme.  That was the intended purpose of section 170A.<br/><br/>In section 9, several provisions in the Licensing Acts, one of which dates from the 19th century, contain requirements in respect of the rateable valuation of licensed premises.  In each case, the rateable valuation of the property concerned must be considered by the court in the context of granting a licence for the sale intoxicating liquor.  These provisions have in common the fact that they were enacted prior to the introduction of planning legislation and their objective was to ensure that certain minimum standards were met by licensed premises.  In the case of the Beer Licences Regulation (Ireland) Act 1877, section 2 requires that such premises are rated &quot;in the sum of fifteen pounds or upwards&quot;.  In the case of the Tourist Traffic Act 1952, section 44(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) provides that the rateable valuation of holiday camp premises shall not be less than &pound;200.  The licensing law provisions referred to in section 9 have been overtaken by the detailed planning provisions of the Planning and Development Acts and may now be repealed.<br/><br/>This is an important but essentially technical Bill which seeks to deal with the unintended consequences of a Court of Appeal ruling.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500041#OO00200"><p>The Bill is about extending the jurisdiction of one of our courts, namely, the Circuit Court.  It is important, however, to identify what are the different jurisdictions that operate in our courts system, as sometimes we, as Members of this House, take it for granted that the public is aware of them.  There are two courts of local and limited jurisdiction in our legal system.  They are the District Court and the Circuit Court.  The District Court is one of the courts of local and limited jurisdiction established under Article 34 of the Constitution.  It is local because the country is divided into 23 District Court districts based upon geography.  The District Court is limited, in civil matters, because, in general, a party cannot take a claim in the District Court if that claim is worth more than &euro;15,000.</p><p>We also have another court of local and limited jurisdiction in our courts system, and that is the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court is a local court because the country is divided into eight circuits based upon a larger geography than the District Court districts.  The Circuit Court is limited in civil matters in respect of the value of claims that can be made because one cannot bring a claim in the Circuit Court if that claim is worth more than &euro;75,000.<br/><br/>There are many advantages to the ordinary citizen of this country in being able to access justice in courts of local and limited jurisdiction.  It means that if one is brought before the courts for a minor criminal offence, one can have that offence dealt with summarily and quickly in a District Court in one's locality.  It also means that if one wants to take an action in our courts for a sum of damages, say, in excess of &euro;15,000 but less than &euro;75,000, one can do that by instituting proceedings in the Circuit Court and ensuring that one can have one's case heard in the circuit where one lives as opposed to having to come to Dublin to have one's case heard in the High Court.  The advantages of taking a claim in the Circuit Court are that it is quicker and less costly than the High Court.  That is to the advantage of all litigants in that they can have their cases heard more quickly and in a cheaper fashion.  It would be unfair if litigants were required always to go to the High Court, even in circumstances where they had small claims.<br/><br/>The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court derives from statute.  Unlike the High Court, it does not enjoy the full original jurisdiction that the High Court enjoys to deal with all matters concerning issues of justice.  The Circuit Court can only exercise powers that have been given to it by this Oireachtas.  Under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction to deal with matters relating to land provided the rateable valuation of the property does not exceed &euro;253.95.  That is the old translation of the &pound;200 that existed at the time the 1961 legislation and its subsequent amendments were introduced.<br/><br/>The Valuation Act was enacted in 2001.  Section 15 of that Valuation Act expressly provided that domestic premises shall not be rateable.  The House will be aware that many years prior to that a decision was made that domestic properties would not be subject to rates but it was only in the Valuation Act 2001 where this was definitively set out for the first time.  Section 3 of the 2001 Act defined domestic premises as properties &quot;which consist wholly or partly of a premises used as a dwelling and which is neither a mixed premises nor an apart hotel&rdquo;.  Accordingly, since the Valuation Act 2001, the Circuit Court did not have power to hear cases concerning land where that land was a domestic premises because such land is not rateable under the 2001 Act.  In effect, from 2001, the Circuit Court did not have power to hear cases concerning land.  However, we need to take into account that there were subsequent laws introduced giving the Circuit Court power after 2001.  Those other statutory developments since 2001 that gave the Circuit Court jurisdiction in respect of certain land cases need to be identified.<br/><br/>Section 101 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 gave the Circuit Court jurisdiction to hear cases concerning properties which are subject to a housing loan mortgage.  All houses, therefore, which are principal private residences and subject to a housing loan mortgage, could, because of section 101, be heard in the Circuit Court.  However, that legislation only applied, as legislation generally does, prospectively so it was the case that only housing loans granted after 1 December 2009, when the Act came into force, were covered by the 2009 legislation, namely, section 101, which allowed those cases to be heard in the Circuit Court.  Housing loan mortgages granted before 1 December 2009, therefore, could not be pursued in the Circuit Court but every claim in respect of a principal private residence concerning a mortgage granted after 1 December 2009 could be pursued in the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>We then had a further development in 2013 when section 3 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act came into effect.  Under section 3, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was extended to cover mortgages in respect of principal private residences created before 1 December 2009.  Therefore, under that legislation introduced in 2003, any case in respect of principal private residences before 1 December 2009 could be brought in the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>It is important to identify what those two statutory provisions mean in respect of people's principal private residences.  What they mean is that because of section 101 of the 2009 Act and section 3 of the 2013 Act, any cases in respect of housing loan mortgages for principal private residences, namely, what we call the family home, can be brought in the Circuit Court.  This Bill will have no impact in extending the powers of the Circuit Court to grant repossession in respect of principal private residences.  This Bill will make no change to the entitlement people have to go to court in the Circuit Court in respect of houses that are principal private residences.<br/><br/>However, the law at present is that there is now a situation where domestic premises - not principal private residences but investment properties - which have mortgages on them created before 1 December 2009 cannot be pursued in the Circuit Court.  They can, however, be pursued in the High Court.  This legislation will alter cases that can go before the Circuit Court but it is incorrect to present it as though if these cases do not go before the Circuit Court they can go nowhere.  They will go to the High Court and the effect of that is that we will have greater delay and more expense imposed on both sets of litigants.<br/><br/>It was because of this statutory gap that the Court of Appeal in the decision of PTSB <i>v.</i>Langan, which was decided on 28 July 2016, ruled that the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to grant repossession in respect of the six investment properties that were the subject matter of that Court of Appeal decision.  It is important to remind ourselves, and I do not want to go into the details of that case, that the properties that were the subject matter of the Court of Appeal decision were six investment properties that were being rented out.  It did not nor could it relate to principal private residences or what we refer to in this House as the family home.  The reason the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with those cases, according to the Court of Appeal, was because each of those six properties was a domestic premises which had mortgages on them created before 1 December 2009.  However, if that case before the Court of Appeal had involved a principal private residence, or what we call the family home, the court could not have decided it in the way it did because since 2009 and 2013, and the statutory provisions I referred to earlier, the Circuit Court already had jurisdiction to deal with those issues.<br/><br/>As a result of the Court of Appeal decision, there are now some unfortunate and unintended consequences.  It will mean, as was stated by Mr. Justice Hogan in the Court of Appeal decision, that proceedings in respect of such premises will now have to be commenced in the High Court rather than in the Circuit Court.  To whose possible advantage could that be?  It will simply mean that litigants will be exposed to greater legal costs by having the case taken against them in the High Court as opposed to the Circuit Court.  It will deprive litigants of access to their local courts in the manner in which the Constitution actually intended.</p><p>The reason we set up courts of local and limited jurisdiction was so that people from those areas would, in cases of a certain value, be able to have their cases heard in those areas.  I do not know to whose possible advantage it is if those individuals now have to come to Dublin to have their cases heard in the High Court.</p> <p> Those are the facts of the principal proposal in this legislation.  This is not legislation that will have any impact on, or change in any way, the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in respect of principal private residences.  That needs to be stated repeatedly.  It is legislation that will impact those who have investment properties which had mortgages created on them before 1 December 2009 and which are not principal private residences.  Therefore, only a small group of properties will be affected by this new legislation, if enacted by the House, and those will be investment properties that are not principal private residences but in respect of which mortgages were created before 1 December 2009.  Even if this legislation is not enacted, it does not mean that we are helping any vulnerable group regarding the prospect of repossession proceedings.  Such proceedings in respect of those properties will still be permitted but the repossession hearings will take place in the High Court instead of the Circuit Court.  In my opinion, there is no advantage to anyone being exposed to a more expensive and slower process.</p> <p> This legislation, however, opens up the important issue that still affects thousands of people in this country, namely, the fact that there are individuals in their homes who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  Those people need the assistance of this House and the Government.  We are not talking about people who have investment properties and who want to be able to hold on to them, we are referring to individuals in their principal private residences or family homes.  Those people continue to be under significant financial pressure.  They will remain so until such time as the Government and this House make a decision as to what can be done to ameliorate their position.  There is no point in people suffering simply because they cannot afford repayments on their properties.  We need to restructure their loans.  In the previous Oireachtas, members of my party, including Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputies Thomas Byrne and MacSharry, both then Senators, introduced a variety of legislative proposals that were of benefit and to the advantage of individuals who find themselves in such a position.  When a Member of the Seanad, Deputy MacSharry introduced the Family Home Bill 2011.  It did not get any support from the previous Government.  Deputy Michael McGrath introduced the Mortgage Resolution Bill 2013.  It did not get any support from the Government.  What we need to recognise is that the solution for individuals who find themselves in mortgage distress is not in trying to present to them that their problems will be solved if a certain item of legislation is stopped from going through.  We need to provide coherent solutions for those people so that they can get themselves out of the mortgage distress in which they find themselves.</p> <p> I should also point out that we need to reform our legislation in respect of the courts in general.  If a person is searching for where he or she should go to discover the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court or the District Court or how to get into the High Court, he or she must look through a library of books to find it.  I would urge the Minister that we need to start the process of consolidating one complete courts Act so that citizens of the State will be in a position to know themselves - without having to go to the expense of seeking out lawyers or looking at the legislation - what they are entitled to do in individual courts, what is the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, what type of cases can be brought in the High Court, etc.</p> <p> In light of what I have said, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this legislation.</p></speech>

As he indicated, it will be a very small number.  It is those with investment properties who are renting who will be affected.  While nobody wants to see increased costs in cases of home repossessions - whether it is a family home, an investment property or a rent-to-buy property - the one element missing from the debate, perhaps not so much tonight but in general, is what happens to the individuals within those properties.  We must be aware of that when looking at any legislation that, realistically, will facilitate the introduction of a process which will be cheaper for the person who is bringing a case - under the Bill, that will be somebody who owns an investment or a rent-to-buy property - but which will also make much quicker in the context of the repossession of the home in question.  The latter could mean that a family which is renting the property from the landlord could also face a much quicker eviction.  The burden will be greater, therefore, on that family, particularly if there are children involved.</p><p>While this legislation deals with one aspect of the matter on the basis of a Court of Appeal case, Permanent TSB <i>v</i>. Langan, we need to have a broader debate on how we are dealing with family home mortgages in arrears.  Obviously, the place to do so, as the Minister of State - a former justice committee Chairman - will be aware, would be in the Committee on Justice and Equality.</p><p>As we consider this matter, it is clear that there are, at a minimum, three different Departments to which it relates.  There is the Department of Justice and Equality, from a legal point of view, the Department of Finance, due to the financial aspects, and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, for which the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is responsible.  I do not know what kind of co-operation or discussions are taking place at Cabinet between the Ministers responsible for those three Departments in order to rectify the position.  It has been made a priority in the programme for Government.  One of the commitments in the programme for Government is that the issue of home repossessions will be dealt with.  To date, however, concrete proposals in that regard have not been forthcoming.</p><p>Deputy O'Callaghan highlighted at least two items of legislation that would have afforded home owners protection.  Both were brought forward by his party but neither secured the support of the previous Government.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty brought forward the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill in 2013, which would also have addressed some of the concerns that have arisen.  If it had been passed, it would have levelled the playing field between banks and home owners by making the repossession of family homes a less attractive option for banks.  It would have increased, from two months to six, the length of time the court can adjourn a case to allow for a personal insolvency process take place.  It would also have empowered the courts to perform a reasonableness test on whether the banks had really exhausted every possible option or whether they had declined any proposal from a personal insolvency practitioner and complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Further, it would have ensured that before any repossession was ordered by a court, all of the grounds I have outlined were satisfied.  There were, therefore, three items of legislation by means of which my party and Fianna F&aacute;il tried to address this issue.  In my opinion, these brought forward concrete proposals to try to examine at the entire area of home repossession in a holistic and constructive manner.  Not one of the three Bills proceeded past Second Stage.  I understand that is politics.  It is in the nature of Government to rarely support Opposition Bills.  If that is the case, the Government should at least bring forward its own proposals.  We have not seen them yet.</p><p>The Government has tabled this Bill out of concern, as the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said, that the Court of Appeal ruling has the potential to seriously disrupt the operation of the courts by requiring a range of property-related court proceedings to be taken in the High Court rather than the Circuit Court, thereby increasing court-related costs for the parties and delays in the determination of cases.</p><p> As the previous speaker and I have said, a much wider debate must happen here.  If the Government is serious about implementing some of its proposals in the programme for Government, it could have taken the opportunity to address some of those concerns in this legislation.  I realise that this Bill focuses on a particular court ruling.  In the absence of any commitment on the part of the Government to address the other issues, however, it is difficult for us to support it.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to take on board some of the proposals contained in the Bills brought forward previously by Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The Minister should examine some aspects of those and consider whether they can be incorporated into this Bill.  In my opinion and that of my party, there cannot be a situation where costs are reduced for those taking cases in respect of repossessions but where this has the knock-on effect of accelerating the process.  If this legislation is passed, families in rent-to-buy properties could find themselves being forced to vacate the property quicker than they had anticipated had this legislation not been in place.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of widening the scope of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It might not be the correct legislative measure in which to do it but, failing that, before Committee Stage the Minister must announce some concrete proposals for families who are struggling with mortgage payments, to show that the Government will address more than this court ruling.  Many families see the slowness of the Government to address their concerns, yet a legislative measure can be drafted, introduced and passed in a short period in order to address some of the concerns of those who have invested in buy-to-let properties.  Families see very little support and few options for them as owners of principal residences.  We must send the correct message.  When the Minister replies to the debate he should state that those concerns will be acknowledged, at least, by the Government.  There should be a commitment that they will be addressed, if not in this legislation, then as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500044#RR00200"><p>I will speak briefly on the Bill.  The Minister said it is a technical measure relating to the outcome of a Court of Appeal ruling in Permanent TSB plc <i>v</i>. Langan.  There is much public concern about the implications of this Bill.  While the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 gave the Circuit Court jurisdiction over repossession cases involving principal private residences, the detail of this case relates to what has been described as domestic premises where people who had buy-to-let mortgages were in default and a lender was seeking to repossess the premises.</p><p>The significant problem is that there are tenants in those buy-to-let premises.  This is a huge area of concern.  There is no need to tell the Minister that if these cases can be processed more quickly through the Circuit Court and lead to repossession, the first thing the bank will seek is vacant possession of the property.  This will add to the crisis we already have with housing and homelessness across the State.  The matter must be addressed and perhaps the Bill offers an opportunity to do so.  While the Bill clears up the jurisdiction issues and makes the process a little easier for banks, we must consider the families and tenants who will be affected by this.  If the repossessions proceed more quickly and lead to people being evicted from the properties, it is every bit as significant for people to lose a rental property and end up homeless as it is for people to lose their family home and end up homeless.  The Minister should use the opportunity of Committee Stage to consider drafting amendments to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act or other Acts to allow for the protection of tenants in these properties as well.  Surely it would be in the interest of the lender who gains possession of these properties to maintain a tenancy and benefit from the rent that the tenants were paying to the previous landlord.  That would be in the interest of everybody in society.</p><p>Under the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael measures are supposed to be introduced to achieve the result of protecting people in tenancies and allowing them to keep the roof over their heads.  The Government should aim to ensure that this can take place, rather than just facilitating the courts and making it easier for the owners of the loans to gain possession.  I ask the Minister to address that and to outline how we can take steps to ensure that, as a result of this Bill being passed, nobody will be made homeless, thereby adding to the number of homeless people and those sleeping in hostels and hotels, which is a disgraceful situation that appears to get increasingly worse.  At least we could do something positive through this Bill to prevent that happening in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500044#RR00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  It is important to stress that the Bill does not have implications for repossession proceedings in respect of principal private residences.  Under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, the Circuit Court has been given jurisdiction to deal with repossession proceedings involving principal private residences.  This Bill will not change that and will not impact on the rights of borrowers to due process and the various remedies afforded by our insolvency laws.</p><p>The Government has put in place a number of protections for borrowers in respect of principal private residences.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act grants the court the power to adjourn proceedings to allow a borrower to examine the possibility of making a personal insolvency arrangement under insolvency legislation.  In addition, a new court review process has been introduced under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 in which a decision by a lending institution to refuse a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement drawn up to resolve a home owner's debts, including the mortgage on their principal private residence, can be reviewed by the court.</p><p>A new nationwide mortgage arrears resolution service, Abhaile, which was launched recently provides free independent expert advice to home owners in mortgage difficulty.  This innovative scheme, which can be accessed through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, provides a home owner with expert advice from financial and legal advisers to identify sustainable solutions in mortgage arrears cases.  Since its launch over 2,400 vouchers for legal and financial aid have been issued by MABS in respect of 718 principal private residences.  I urge those who are worried about mortgage debt on their homes to contact MABS and start the process of putting in place solutions to their mortgage arrears which will enable them to remain in their homes.</p><p>I will briefly address the issue of rateable valuation and market value.  It was the intention to commence relevant sections of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which changed the Circuit Court's jurisdiction from a rateable valuation basis to a market value basis, shortly after the commencement of the 2004 Act.  This was not done because the expected roll out of the new valuation system under the Valuation Act 2001 was delayed.  Following the enactment of amending legislation in 2015, I am satisfied that the conditions now exist for the commencement of those sections of the 2004 Act.  A commencement order to bring them into effect is being drafted and will come into operation at the same time as the commencement of this Bill.</p><p>The Courts Bill 2016 is a short technical Bill which is designed to address the implications of the Court of Appeal's ruling in the case of Permanent TSB plc <i>v</i>. Langan.  Its primary objective is to avoid potentially serious disruption to court business following the Court of Appeal ruling.  I wish to avoid situations where proceedings already under way before the Circuit Court would have to be transferred to the High Court or where, as a result of the ruling, proceedings would have to be commenced in the High Court rather than the Circuit Court.  Such situations will only lead to disruption of court schedules, delays in the proceedings and, ultimately, higher costs for the parties involved.  In the absence of legislation on this issue the Court of Appeal ruling will have the effect, as acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, of depriving parties of access to local courts in the manner in which the Constitution intended.</p><p>For the information of the House, the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears fell further in the second quarter of 2016.</p><p>This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of decline.  A total of 82,092, that is, 11%, of accounts, were in arrears at the end of the second quarter, a decline of 4.5% relative to the first quarter of 2016.  The number of accounts in arrears over 90 days at the end of June was 57,571, which is 8% of the total, reflecting a quarter on quarter decline of 3.6%.  This reflects the eleventh consecutive decline in the number of PDH accounts in arrears over 90 days.  All maturity categories of arrears, including the over 720 days category, declined in the second quarter of 2016.  This category recorded a fourth consecutive decline, having fallen for the first time in the third quarter of 2015.  A total of 120,614 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at the end of June.  Of these restructured accounts, 88% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangements, the highest level since the series began.  The largest increases in restructures were, again, recorded in the categories of arrears capitalisation and permanent split mortgages.</p> <p> Issues relating to the protection of tenants in investment properties are not within the scope of the Bill, but I will ensure that the Deputies' remarks are made known to my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, who, as Deputies know, is implementing a comprehensive housing action plan.</p></speech>

This is the third debate on mental health since the Government was formed.  This in itself is welcome and demonstrates an increased awareness of mental health on all sides of the House.  It would be difficult to imagine so many debates on mental health occurring even in the recent past.  However, we must move beyond debates and towards implementation.  Since my appointment I have met, and continue to so do, many individuals, families and groups that have been affected by mental health issues.  Their bravery in the face of adversity and frustration at the lack of supports is only too evident.  Equally, I have met many members of staff working in mental health services who lack the necessary supports, are over stretched and under appreciated.  They feel ignored, forgotten and abandoned, just like the service users.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il in agreeing to facilitate a minority Government inserted into the confidence and supply agreement a condition that A Vision for Change would be fully implemented within the lifetime of a Government.  Appendix 1 of the confidence and supply arrangement commits to implementing fully A Vision for Change.  Confidence and supply arrangement votes are dependent on the full implementation of the policies in that document.  We agreed to facilitate budgets consistent with the agreed policy principles in the document, which runs over the full term of government of five years.  Modern mental health reform began in this Chamber when Deputy Mich&aacute;el Martin brought forward the Mental Health Act 2001.  That Act was the first reform of mental health legislation for more than half a century.  The Act radically changed how people with mental health illness were treated.  In the decades prior to 2001, mental health attitudes were all too often mired in stigma, prejudice and alienation.  Thankfully, they are less so today, but work still needs to be done to continue to challenge attitudes towards mental health.  The main objective of the Act was to address the civil and human rights of mentally ill persons while additionally putting in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment in our mental health services could be monitored, inspected and reviewed.  In addition, the creation of the Mental Health Commission in April 2002 created an implementation body to ensure that the intention of the Act was fulfilled.</p><p>Following on from this reforming Act, A Vision for Change was developed under the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government as a strategy document which sets out the direction for mental health services in Ireland.  It describes a framework providing and supporting positive mental health across the entire community and providing accessible, community-based, specialist services for those with mental illness.  It had broad support from patient groups and medical professionals and across the political divide.  It is based on a recovery model that seeks, where possible, to keep those with mental health problems centred in their communities and to retain their involvement in their family and social circles.  While the document may be in need of updating, the principles it was founded on and its fundamentals remain sound.  It is ten years since A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  Its terms were meant to be implemented by 2016.  To date, barely 75% of that vision has been met, but for old age psychiatry, it is 53%; in the area of child and adolescents, it is barely 52%; and for persons with disabilities, it is a shockingly low 19%.  It is clear that the more vulnerable you are, the fewer supports you get.</p><p>We must arrive at a point where the HSE treats the head and the heart with equal respect: a stage of parity of esteem between mental and physical health.  Mental and physical health are fundamentally linked.  There are multiple associations between mental health and physical conditions that significantly impact people&rsquo;s quality of life, demands on health care and other publicly funded services.  The World Health Organisation, WHO, defines health as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;.  The WHO states: &quot;There is no health without mental health.&quot;  Understanding the links between mind and body is the first step in developing strategies to reduce the incidence of co-existing conditions.  People with serious mental health conditions are at high risk of experiencing chronic physical conditions.  People with chronic physical conditions are at risk of developing poor mental health.  A person who presents with a broken arm is not turned away, and someone who has the courage to speak out about his or her mental health should be given equally urgent care.  We do not put a limit on the care a person with a physical injury is given.  We do not, for example, say to people who have suffered a broken arm that they are only entitled to eight hours of medical care and stop treating them when the plaster of Paris is only half on, but this is done in mental health care when people are limited to eight hours of psychological help.</p><p>It is acknowledged that the Minister of State has an incredibly difficult task on her hands, and has only been in her position for a few months, but the task she faces cannot be met if she is not given the necessary resources to implement the change that must be brought about.  Responsibility in this regard lies with the line Minister, Deputy Harris, who has failed to fund mental health adequately.  However, there is a responsibility on the Minister of State to ensure the senior Minister hears the voices of those suffering from mental health issues and to give a voice to the voiceless.  In response to parliamentary questions I tabled during the summer, the Minister stated the required amount to implement A Vision for Change fully is &euro;35.4 million per annum.  In budget 2016, the Government announced the provision of &euro;35 million, only subsequently to withhold &euro;12 million.  Following the reneging on its promise and due to public and political pressure, the Government was forced into an embarrassing U-turn.  In the budget, the Minister for Health pledged to increase funding by &euro;35 million for mental health, a sum that was welcomed only for that sum to ring hollow just a week later when under questioning from Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies during statements on mental health, he confirmed that only &euro;15 million of the announced &euro;35 million was available for spending in this year.  This was a spectacular U-turn by the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The Government has essentially halved the funding earmarked for mental health services next year.  This is despite the fact that there has been significant underfunding and underinvestment in mental health services in recent years.  The reason given is there will be a time lag in hiring staff but even if this is the case, there is no reason the differential moneys could not have been spent on one-off programmes this year.</p><p>Significant work is needed to bring our mental health services up to standard.  This cannot be achieved without adequate funding.  Currently, the Government is planning to increase mental health funding by a measly 1.6% in 2017, as opposed to a 7.4% funding increase across the health sector.  This clearly shows that mental health services simply are not a priority for this Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il remains committed to implementing fully the A Vision for Change road map for mental health services.  In that respect, the motion seeks to compel the Government to do that which it appeared it was not prepared to do voluntarily, which is to carry out an urgent review of mental health funding, set out a clear pathway for delivering the outstanding elements of A Vision for Change within the lifetime of this Government, and guarantee the ring-fencing of the mental health budget.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s intention to support the motion, but we need implementation.  The HSE, in particular, seems to suffer from a serious condition - implementation deficit disorder.  Let us not have the motion sit on top of a long list of reports that have not been implemented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500047#UU00100"><p>I welcome this opportunity to speak.  It is a motion that embodies what we have been saying for a long time on all sides of the House on mental health and the need to implement A Vision for Change.  Deputy Browne said we have already had three debates in this Parliament on mental health.  It would be a fine thing if we were debating where we will spend the money that had been committed to mental health and A Vision for Change but over the last number of years we are consistently pointing out that insufficient funds are being made available on an annual basis.  The &euro;35 million that has been ring fenced for the mental health budget over the last number of years has been consistently pilfered year after year.  The spin at every Estimate and every budget is that &euro;35 million will be made available to mental health and the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Then we find there is prevarication, delay, a reduction in the budget and excuses are made about the inability to recruit and it is claimed they cannot find the required personnel or clinicians.  It is simply not good enough anymore.</p><p>The Minister of State is new in her job but the bottom line is it stops with Government decisions and Government policy.  The Minister of State has been handed a very bad card in trying to implement and fund a key commitment in the supply and confidence arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government.  It is critically important that the central tenet of that supply and confidence agreement is acknowledged and A Vision for Change is implemented in full over the lifetime of the Government.  That means providing &euro;35 million for the next number of years to make sure we catch up with the deficit that is there currently.  If one looks at the figures and statistics with regard to the number of people that have been recruited, over the last six years there has been a 7% increase in recruitment of key personnel as recommended in A Vision for Change.  We are still a long way behind what we should be in terms of the numbers.  Every aspect of mental health services in this country is underfunded, under-resourced and incapable of delivering the service that is required.  When we talk about citizenship and about the need to be inclusive, to embrace people and to allow people to fulfil their opportunities, we need to ensure they are given every assistance.</p><p>In the area of child and adolescent mental health services, we clearly have huge problems right across the whole spectrum.  The first major mistake made was in the context of withdrawal of career guidance counsellors in our schools.  The attack on young people who need access to services is something I find very distasteful.  It has been happening consistently.  We should have a bit of honesty about the fact that A Vision for Change is the document we are all signed up to.  It needs to be supported and bulwarked by financial resources and services and by ensuring that key personnel are put in place.  We have consistently heard we cannot find the specialists.  The problem is we do not have any plan in place to ensure there is consistent recruitment, training, education and retention of key personnel.  That has been a distinct failure in Government policy over the last number of years.</p><p>The Government has committed to it in its programme for Government.  We are only trying to advise it to implement what it has said itself.  We were unsure of the Government's commitment so we insisted it was put into the supply and confidence arrangement to ensure it would be part and parcel of what we are committed to supporting in the context of this Government.  We are doing it because for a number of years mental health has been discussed <i>ad infinitum</i>in this Chamber but unfortunately the resourcing and commitment has not been forthcoming from Cabinet.  That has been consistent since 2011.  If one looks back at the figures on the number of people who were retained in the service, the number of whole-time equivalents, it shows quite clearly there has been an appalling lack of commitment and determination in terms of implementation.</p><p>This motion is critically important.  The Government still has time to redeem itself by ensuring a strong commitment is shown in 2017 to ensure we can play catch up in terms of the deficiency of services across all levels.  We still have a very distasteful circumstance in our public hospitals where people with psychiatric problems and mental illnesses who try to access out of hours services are finding themselves presenting in emergency departments across the country.  That is happening to this day.  It is wholly unacceptable for those individuals.</p><p>The broader issues of pressure in terms of mental health among younger cohorts of people is something we are singularly failing to address in any meaningful way other than with lip service to a certain extent.</p><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, was here to hear but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will relay to him the concerns of the House with regard to the lack of commitment in view of the fact that &euro;35 million was promised on budget day yet within a week it was confirmed it would be an awful lot less.  Overall, a lot of work needs to be done but more importantly there is an opportunity at this late stage to comply with the spirit of the agreement and the programme for Government and, more importantly, to have a meaningful impact on people whose lives depend on the mental health services.</p></speech>

Across the constituency of Cork South-West which I represent, mental health is a huge issue.  A recent survey shows that 45% of farming families reported a family member being treated for emotional and mental issues.  The numbers among the families of the rest of rural west Cork and towns are also very high.  Early intervention, as in anything, is crucial.</p><p>The loss of guidance counsellors to schools had a particular impact across west Cork.  People have told me that students could go in as if seeking advice on future careers but gain valuable information on mental health.  Luckily, mental illness can be treated but unfortunately cash is needed.  I cannot emphasise enough that the full committed funding needs to be provided and a plan needs to be formulated for going forward.</p><p>I will finish with a quote from Shannon Alder:</p><blockquote>Never give up on someone with a mental illness.  When the letter &quot;i&quot; is replaced with the letters &quot;we&quot; the word &quot;illness&quot; becomes the word &quot;wellness&quot;.</blockquote></speech>

The Government has said it is committed to meeting the recommendations but in order to do that, the funding, or lack thereof, needs to be addressed as a priority.  There is currently under-investment in the mental health service and significant work is needed to bring it to a higher standard.  It is not going to be achieved without adequate funding.  Government is planning to increase mental health funding by 1.6% next year compared to a 7.4% funding increase across the wider health sector.  It is a clear indication that mental health services simply are not the priority they should be.  Mental health services should not be left as the poor relation.  On budget day the Minister for Health announced &euro;35 million for mental health services in 2017.  The July 2016 Estimate for the Department of Health outlined that the required resources to implement fully A Vision for Change is &euro;177.3 million or &euro;35 million for each of five years.  In the days after the budget the Minister of State outlined that just &euro;15 million of the &euro;35 million allocation would be spent next year.  Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for a provision that there would be adequate resource and it would be spent on mental health services.  Any moneys that are not spent within that financial year could be carried over into the following year for the benefit of mental health services and for the benefit of communities around the country.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the invaluable work that community based organisations such as Tosnu in Ballincollig and Cunamh in Macroom do by providing key services locally and allowing treatment for people within their own community.  It is an invaluable alternative to acute, inpatient treatment.</p><p>Service organisations such as Cunamh and Tosnu as well as many others throughout the country are providing lifelines to many families and individuals.  They should be supported.</p> <p> Everyone recognises that there are no quick fixes, but there is a strategy in place, A Vision for Change.  To facilitate that strategy, there needs to be long-term planning in mental health services.  It is vital that the Government moves away from allocating mental health funds on a year-by-year basis.  Instead, the Government should introduce funding measures to ensure mental health services are developed further.  There should be a multi-annual investment policy, a long-term investment strategy to ensure that issues will be addressed.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that we are back here debating this issue again.  We are debating this issue again because the people on the far side of the House have not lived up to their commitment to an additional &euro;35 million in spending in this area.  In fact, only an additional &euro;15 million will be spent.  The excuse provided is somehow related to time-sensitive savings.  Members will excuse me for stating that no one believes that.  That excuse rings hollow to the parents of the children who cannot get access to critical services.</p>  <p>  Last month in a similar debate I raised the issue of Good 2 Talk, a service based in Mullingar and Longford.  The group was established because the HSE reneged on its commitment to provide affordable counselling services for young people.  An undertaking was given that the application for funding of this service would be re-examined.  I received a letter stating that the funding would not be forthcoming this year.  The &euro;25,000 is critical and necessary.  The service was told to apply to the Department of Health national lottery application.  I am not aware of the outcome of that application.  This is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, I visited the young adult mental health services in Mullingar.  The group was set up on a pilot basis by the HSE.  It has the potential to do good and I imagine it will.  However, it does not have the potential to do good if it is established with insufficient staff.  A Vision for Change, a document which is over ten years old now, stated that there should be four clinical psychologists to deal with those under 18 years of age in my region.  We have two.  We should have two occupational therapists, but we only have one in place now as well as one on maternity leave.  Three full-time social workers are on maternity leave as well.</p>  <p>  It is time for the platitudes, talk and promises to end.  It is time for delivery.  Failure to deliver is resulting in people losing their lives.</p></speech>

I am sharing with Deputy Neville.</p>  <p>  This is the third debate we have had on mental health in recent times.  I welcome the debate as an opportunity to re-state the Government's commitment to our mental health policy and to the development and improvement of our mental health services.</p>  <p>  The Government will not oppose the motion.  We agree on the need to maintain the significant progress in this area.  We have already given an undertaking in A Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the mental health budget annually to build capacity in existing services as well as developing new services.</p>  <p>  Since 2012 an extra &euro;115 million and approximately 1,150 new posts have been allocated for mental health suicide prevention initiatives.  This happened during tough economic times for this country and at a time when every other Department had its funding cut.  By the end of this year, funding for mental health will increase from the 2015 out-turn of &euro;785 million to a projected budget of &euro;826 million.  This includes the return of &euro;12 million, something myself and my colleagues fought hard for this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, budget 2017 has provided for additional spending for enhanced services of &euro;35 million on a full-year basis to enable further improvements in a range of areas.  The key priorities to be addressed for me in the HSE service plan include youth mental health, further improvements to child and adolescent and adult services as well as older people services and further enhancement of out-of-hours responses for those in need of urgent services.  These developments will be outlined in the HSE service plan in the coming days and weeks.</p>  <p>  We recognise the time-lag involved in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services.  It is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with the increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.7 million in mental health associated with increased pay costs.  This increase in wages will, I believe, go a long way towards realising the full implementation of A Vision for Change in the coming years.  The additional allocation of &euro;24.7 million for 2017 will see the mental health budget increase to &euro;851 million.  This represents an increase of 3% over 2016 and a 20% increase in the mental health funding since 2012.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has given the go-ahead for the construction of a new national forensic hospital at Portrane.  I encourage my colleagues to visit the Central Mental Hospital to meet the staff, patients and their families.  In this way, Deputies would understand why this major health infrastructure project is needed.  Furthermore, Deputies would see how some of the most vulnerable people in our society will benefit from significant capital investment in 2017, when spending on this new hospital and other minor initiatives will total in excess of &euro;50 million.  Deputies have referred to one-off projects.  This is possibly one of the largest one-off projects we will invest in and it is certainly worthwhile.</p>  <p>  I am very much focused on modernising our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.  That is why overall spend next year on mental health will be over &euro;900 million.  In addition to the substantial ongoing funding commitment to service development, I have started the progress of updating our current mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  I have commissioned an evidence-based expert review which will focus on the progress made to date in implementing the policy, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland.  The review will also take account of current international best practice and will inform the next steps in the development of a mental health policy, having regard to human rights and health and well-being objectives.  The review will provide a solid evidence base to determine the policy direction of a revised A Vision for Change.  It will provide a basis for further service development in this area and shape our future mental health policy.  This is important work.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 October this year, an oversight committee will be established within three months of the review being finalised to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of this review.  The successor policy to A Vision for Change will include a multi-annual implementation plan to inform the allocation of resources in future years.  As per the commitment to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the HSE will be directed to develop a multi-annual approach to the development of mental health services.</p>  <p>  Implementation of A Vision for Change has been affected by a number of factors since 2006, including the economic collapse and the troika.  Deputies have spoken of insufficient funds.  These factors resulted in no increase in funding from previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  Public spending constraints and the moratorium on recruitment have affected the sector as well.  However, recent years have seen investment in this areas prioritised by Fine Gael led Governments and significant advances made in the reconfiguration and delivery of services.</p>  <p>  Although I agree that it is not enough, the increased investment in mental health services in recent years has helped to increase the number and staffing levels of adult and children and adolescent community mental health teams.  Of the additional 1,550 new mental health posts approved since 2012, a total of 1,150 have been or are in the process of being recruited, notwithstanding the general challenging recruitment market in which the HSE is operating.</p>  <p>  We must continue to invest in our mental health teams.  Those working at the front-line carry out important work and we must support them.  I intend to continue in this regard.  Earlier this summer, I allocated &euro;400,000 to provide 60 additional training places for psychiatric nurses.  The number will increase to 70 next year.  In the coming four years we will increase the number of training places by 45%.  Since the summer psychiatric nurses have seen the re-instatement of their community fund and of some of their wages.  I imagine Deputies will agree that we are doing our best to try to ensure we can plan for our future.</p>  <p>  Increased investment has also funded the development of specialised services recommended in A Vision for Change, including forensic, eating disorders, psychiatry of later life and mental health intellectual disability services.  We are also seeing continued development of community mental health teams as well as improved seven-day responses, liaison services, perinatal mental health care and two new clinical programmes specifically for ADHD in adults and children and dual diagnosis of those with mental health and substance misuse.</p>  <p>  I agree with all Deputies who have spoken already in the sense that I agree there are difficulties within the service and we do not always get it right.  The aim is to try to continue to improve the services.  This year we are also advancing the development of counselling services at primary care level.  We are providing considerable extra funding to extend services such as jigsaw, which offers free access in a more informal environment to younger people.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the need to promote awareness and prevention strategies further in our education system.  This is why I have established a task force on youth mental health.  The task force has met on three occasions thus far.  At the most recent meeting, the task force met younger people, family members and service providers to discuss the difficulties they are facing.  This week, our first youth engagement panel will meet.  The panel is for people between the ages of 19 and 25 years.</p><p>We have already identified key areas which we wish to progress, and I look forward to updating my colleagues more on this in the coming weeks.</p> <p> I think we will all agree that the mental health needs of this country have somewhat changed.  The review of the implementation of A Vision for Change will help to monitor this, but the need to plan could not be clearer.  I acknowledge those in the Gallery this evening and those who are listening to this debate.  There is a momentum behind this.  We are all behind this, but if anybody is unsure in that regard, let me be very be clear: as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I and this Government are 100% committed to implementing A Vision for Change.  We are 100% committed to supporting our younger people.  We are 100% committed to planning for the future because lives will be lost if we do not do so.  Lives have already been lost.  I welcome the very open and positive discussion tonight and I thank Deputy Browne for tabling this motion.</p></speech>

This was the case until recently, going back over a number of elections, as I have mentioned previously.  I very much welcome the fact that all sides of the House are driving this issue forward and speaking about it.  I also acknowledge with sensitivity those in the House or in the Gallery who may have been affected by these issues.  We should be mindful of our comments and how we articulate them here.  I understand that everyone has a particular approach to this issue and that everyone wants to see the best outcome possible for it.  Fine Gael is committed to that.  I welcome the overall budget of &euro;900 million for mental health, with &euro;50 million allocated to the Central Mental Hospital and an overall increase of &euro;74.7 million on the previous budget.  The task force set up on youth suicide must also be welcomed.  The problem particularly affects young males, among whom suicide continues to this day.  That is well worth noting.</p>  <p>  A project was organised in my constituency last week by a number of young people, the Drive against Suicide.  There were about 120 to 150 cars.  It was an excellent initiative by young people who came together and used a medium to communicate to other young people, particularly young males in my constituency.  Much of the time politicians find it very difficult to connect with young men.  Cars were a medium through which connections were made with these people.  Many of them had been affected directly by mishaps in their own families.  It was a fantastic initiative and was a way of communicating and connecting with these people.  It was quite therapeutic for them and also a way to share their experiences, raise awareness and connect with that demographic.  Trying to connect with a certain cohort of young people, particularly young males, is a problem we have within the establishment and within politics.  We need to continue to strive to connect and we need to use such media, as well as media such as the creative arts.  I have looked at Dr. Pat Bracken's work on this.  He has put out a lot of papers and information on this.  He states that using these media as opposed to directly communicating with these people is a way to speak to them and get them involved, complemented with a technical approach.</p></speech>

The agreement stated that support would be given by Fianna F&aacute;il to Fine Gael and its Government so that these objectives would be followed through on.  It provided Fine Gael with the chance to remain in power and Fianna F&aacute;il with the ability to keep one foot in either side of the D&aacute;il, criticising what it did not like and claiming credit for policies with which it agreed.  Much was made in the recent budget of Fianna F&aacute;il's claims to have exerted positive influence on the Government to achieve certain initiatives.  Tonight we debate one glaring failure of this Government to live up to its agreement and a glaring failure of Fianna F&aacute;il to hold the Government to that up to this point.</p><p>I welcome this motion.  It could be stronger but it is necessary, and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is in keeping with its spirit, which is to pressure this Government to adequately fund our mental health services and implement the necessary reforms laid out a decade ago by A Vision for Change, a document which promised much but went largely unimplemented by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il while in government.  Fine Gael may have felt it had a soft commitment in the agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il.  I ask the Government to fully implement A Vision for Change.  However, anyone who knows much about A Vision for Change and the mental health services currently in place knows that while this objective is all too achievable, it requires significant commitment and political will, which has been absent in the last decade.</p><p>One crucial part of seeing A Vision for Change implemented is the issue of funding.  Our mental health services have long been underfunded, with their share of the overall health budget shrinking again and again.  At present mental health funding makes up just 6.4% of the health budget.  In 2017, it looks like that will be closer to 5.7%.  If we take the model in the UK and Canada - we should take a leaf out of their book - it is 13%.  This does not sound like mental health being prioritised but it sounds like more of the same - a lot of talk about mental health but very little substance.</p><p>In 2015, we remember the then Minister for Health lauding a supposed increase of &euro;124 million for mental health in 2016.  When this year's plans were revealed to remove &euro;12 million of this funding, this was only thwarted by the voices of mental health advocates and campaigners who simply refused to accept it and took to the streets and the airwaves to force this Government to back down.  In the end, funding for 2016 was &euro;45 million less than had been stated on budget day.  A Department official in a freedom of information request said the Minister had &quot;overstated&quot; funding and was &quot;not correct&quot;.  This year we were told that &euro;35 million would be added to the mental health budget for 2017.  No further detail was provided.  The figure being just short of that called for by groups such as Mental Health Reform and the Oireachtas group on mental health was welcomed.  I welcomed it while stating that more details were needed.  In the coming weeks it became apparent that once again the media, the public and the Opposition had been misled and given incorrect information.  As soon as budget fever died down, the truth was revealed quietly in response to the questioning of Deputies.  Instead of &euro;35 million, just &euro;15 million would be added to the budget for 2017, a pathetic increase of just 1.8% which would barely allow the services to stand still in a time of increasing demand.  The Government knew that this was an unacceptable figure.  It knew it was not good enough.  This was clearly the reason it hid the figure as best it could.</p><p>In Fine Gael's election manifesto it promised &euro;175 million in additional mental health spending over five years.  This would have meant &euro;35 million per year extra on average.  The 14 promises included: to extend youth mental health services, such as Jigsaw, which is free to access and does not require general practitioner referral; to extend counselling in primary care services to more people; to ensure greater access to counselling and psychological services; to support mental health recovery by offering follow-up training and booster self-help courses; to expand the national educational psychological services; to ensure integration of psychotherapy, counselling and social care services with primary care teams; and to build on reduced waiting times for child and adolescent services.  None of these were achievable in the context of such low spending on mental health, but those funding levels are achievable now.  If the Government is claiming an additional &euro;35 million over two years, are we to expect only &euro;10 million in additional funding for 2018?</p><p>We cannot wait any longer for the political will and the funding needed to bring about the needed reforms underpinned in A Vision for Change.  The Government can no longer talk out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.  Members of the Government will surely deny this is the case, but how can they do so credibly when the figures are there in front of them?  We have a lot of work to do and we need to start it now.  Our services are overstretched in every sense and staff are underpaid, overworked and undersupported.  Those who depend on these services are not being treated adequately, or at all in some cases, not due to the failures of the front-line staff but rather the political failures which have left the cupboard bare.  In the past eight years, the number of staff in posts across the mental health service has decreased by almost 1,000.  Child and adolescent mental health teams were at 50% of the recommended staffing levels at the end of 2015, while referrals increased by 50%.  Staffing levels across the service are well below what is recommended.</p><p> Referrals to counselling in primary care services increased by almost 20% from 2014 to 2015.  Just five mental health and intellectual disability consultants for children are in post throughout the country, which is 3% of the number of positions the expert group on A Vision for Change recommended.  Ireland has the fourth-highest rate of suicide among young men and women aged 15 to 19 years across 31 European countries, with increasing levels of self-harm also being reported.</p> <p> I am glad this motion has been taken today and I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will follow through with the appropriate pressure needed to ensure Fine Gael lives up to its commitments.  Sinn F&eacute;in will work with anyone to improve mental health funding and put it where its needed.  The Minister of State and her Government must listen to the D&aacute;il tonight and to the activists and the people who depend on these services.  It is simply not good enough and they can and must do better.  Tonight is an opportunity to do the right thing, which many of the people in the Government parties would like to see.  The Government should stand by its commitments to the people, those made in the election and afterwards.</p> <p> I will conclude by mentioning something posted recently by a friend on social media.  It was her story, the story of a young woman who, having endured some hard knocks in life, found herself feeling utterly beyond hope.  She attempted to take her own life but awoke a day later in hospital having done serious damage to her kidneys.  Her life continued on a cycle of behaviour that only hurt her further because she could not see through the fog of her own mental ill health and value the brilliant young woman she is.  Eventually she worked up the immense courage and strength to make a change and to seek help.  Today I am sure her life is not perfect but she has put herself on the long road to recovery.  If someone so young, dealing with all of that, can be so strong and so courageous then we too must match that example.  We must not shy away from the challenge of building a mental health services for those who seek it in their darkest hour or just on the little bumps along the road; it is for every member of our society because we all have mental health.  This is a service for all of us and its neglect fails us all.</p></speech>

Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an-chuid dul chun cinn f&oacute;s le d&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh na f&iacute;se at&aacute; ag an Rialtas i leith na meabhairshl&aacute;inte.  The implementation of A Vision for Change is a considerable distance from happening.  We have seen a reduction of approximately 1,000 staff since 2008 at a time when demand has expanded massively.  In child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, the number of referrals grew by more than 50% between 2011 and 2014.  The most recent Health Service Executive performance report from July 2016 indicates a waiting list of 2,298 children and adolescents for a first appointment with CAMHS and I have heard stories of inordinate waiting times of over a year in some instances.</p>  <p>  During a contribution to a previous debate on mental health in this House I went to great lengths to emphasise that the many issues relating to mental health are multifaceted, complex, varied and go much beyond depression or suicidality.  I maintain that opinion and there cannot simply be a discussion around suicidality or depression as we must emphasise good mental health as well.  I underline that point again before going any further.  However, given what has happened in recent weeks in my constituency, it would be remiss of me not to raise the following issue in the course of this debate on mental health.</p>  <p>  We have had a significant number of suicides on the south side of Cork city in recent weeks, particularly in the south west, with many of the victims being teenagers.  I speak on behalf of a community that is hurting and which has been shocked and traumatised by the loss of many people in recent weeks.  It is grieving and frightened, particularly for our young people.  We are at a loss.  I knew two of the deceased personally and one of them I knew quite well.  I know teenagers locally who have lost three friends in scarcely a month.  The devastation of so many is very evident, from families to neighbours and friends.  I am proud of how our community has responded.  It has come together and tried to provide the best support it can for the bereaved.  Last Friday night I attended a candlelight vigil at the lough and despite appalling weather, there were over 200 people there.  Last night there was a postvention session in the local scout hall that also drew a crowd.  I commend those who were involved with those initiatives but the community can only do so much.</p>  <p>  I support the call, made initially by Counsellor Mick Finn, for a critical incident team to come together to tackle this issue in the city.  I have written to agencies in support of this.  We need all the agencies, from councils to the Garda, the HSE, Tusla, all the voluntary bodies, schools and public representatives to come together on this.  Schools in particular are essential and I appeal to principals to take an active role in this.  I call on all our local Deputies to throw their weight behind this as well.  If we can bring all these bodies together for major flooding events or accidents, surely we can do so when so many lives have been lost.  That meeting must happen soon and action must come from it.</p>  <p>  I do not want to play politics with this and I am not interested in blaming anybody.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure her Department and the HSE take an active role in this and will be represented.  There are gaps locally and we need assistance in filling them.  I believe Jigsaw is due to come to Cork soon but the question must be asked of why it has taken so long to come to the second-biggest city in the State.  There are four such services in Dublin and it must be delivered urgently.  For context, according to some measures, Cork city has the highest rate of suicide in the State at 18.5 per 10,000, with the suicide rate in Cork city considerably higher than the national average for more than 12 consecutive years.  The need is very clear.</p>  <p>  I put down a parliamentary question indicating that the Togher and Ballyphehane area has been without a permanent psychologist since June 2015.  The locums are doing what they can but this is bad for continuity of care, and people in difficult positions and crises need to be able to build a relationship with professionals.  I do not have a parliamentary question to hand but I also understand there has not been a child psychologist service in south Lee for some 18 months.  All these gaps must be filled and I urge the Minister of State to help assist in tackling the issue.</p>  <p>  As our neighbours and friends attempt to pick up the pieces and comfort the bereaved, some may find it difficult to cope.  I urge those who struggle to please contact the services and reach out.  There are so many people willing to listen, especially after what our neighbourhoods have been through.  I urge the Minister to ensure no stone should be left unturned in helping our community to deal with this critical issue and resourcing our services to tackle mental health matters nationally.</p></speech>

What is really important is not so much that we have a debate but that we ensure there is action and implementation with regard to A Vision for Change and specific and deliverable developments in the area.  Funding is important and ring-fencing funding is particularly important.  I refer to the work of former Deputy Kathleen Lynch when she was Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  She insisted on having a ring-fenced budget as there had been a tendency for money allocated for mental health to be taken back into the general health budget.  It is important that money should be ring-fenced, with money allocated specifically to mental health being spent in the area.  To suggest that money that was to go to the area in 2016 - with a similar amount for 2017 - would be cut sends a signal to services that they will not continue to develop in a similar way to when the ring-fenced money was used in recent years.</p>  <p>  A Vision for Change set out much more focus on prevention and community services rather than the old idea that everything had to be done in acute services and through psychiatry rather than areas like counselling.</p><p>Many people felt they could not talk about mental health.  They thought they could not say they had a mental health issue.  The whole mindset needed to be changed.  In particular, services needed to be rebalanced in favour of local community care and alternatives to the acute care-based model that was previously followed needed to be provided.</p> <p> When the money was ring-fenced, it was used to support community organisations, to educate GPs on suicide prevention, to fund a primary care counselling service, to facilitate access to psychology and psychotherapy services, to make additional beds available for child and adolescent mental health services, to employ clinical nurse specialists to respond to those who present with self-harm in accident and emergency departments, to finance the national clinical programme for eating disorders, which is an area that had been neglected, to provide training in behavioural family therapy and to provide for the roll-out of Jigsaw, to which a number of previous speakers have referred.  Jigsaw is a good example of a service that is welcoming and accessible to young people in particular.  I think it is an example of the way we need to go.  I welcome the fact that it is being rolled out.  We need to continue to roll out this service.  I know that the Limerick and Cork areas are targeted at present.  I was really impressed by it when I had an opportunity to see it in action in Galway.  When I speak to young people, they tell me they want to be able to access a service that is open to them.  They do not necessarily need psychiatry.  In many cases, they need other models like counselling.  It strikes me, based on the research that has been done on young people who present to the mental health services, that they often require this kind of service rather than the traditional kind of service that was made available in the past.</p> <p> I want to make the case for ensuring counselling services in primary care are made available to young people.  I know that a service has been delivered for adults, but it should also be available to younger people.  We need more community services like the Jigsaw example I have mentioned.  Many community organisations throughout the country are doing great community support work to bring mental health services out to people in the community and to let people know what is available.  I believe they need to be well supported.  It is important that we are having a debate about funding this evening.  If we do not ring-fence funding, it is inevitable that it will be spent in other areas.  I wish the Minister of State well with that.  I think she should get the support of her colleagues in government as she seeks to ensure funding is retained in the mental health budget.  I know there have been issues with regard to recruitment, but I think many of them have been addressed.  I think there is now a capacity to recruit that did not exist in 2011.  The Government needs to ensure it continues its efforts to recruit staff and to broaden things out into the community.</p> <p> As a number of Deputies have said, the education system now places a much greater emphasis on mental health and well-being.  When we were reforming the junior cycle, we concentrated on making well-being a compulsory subject for the junior cycle.  That is due to be introduced next year as a way of ensuring all young people get an opportunity to talk about mental health and well-being, to recognise there are places they can go for support when, as a part of life, they do not necessarily feel all that well at certain times and to understand that it is okay to talk about these matters.  The cultural change that is needed must be accompanied by the practical measures that are set out in A Vision for Change.  We need to ensure sufficient money is available to implement these programmes, particularly those that provide access in people's local communities, GP services and primary care services.  This will ensure people can seek help and get it when they need it, rather than after they have been suffering for a period of time without knowing where to go forward or who to go forward to.  This is a welcome debate.  We need to continue to raise mental health issues.  This area has been neglected in the past.  I hope the emphasis that was brought about by the ring-fencing of funding by the previous Government is continuing in the current Government.  We should continue to strengthen our mental health services, particularly by making them accessible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500051#YY00200"><p>We are discussing the mental health budget, which is due to increase by &euro;15 million, or less than 2%, next year.  Ten years ago, A Vision for Change set targets for mental health spending as part of a ten-year plan.  The truth is that A Vision for Change could and should have been fully implemented by now.  We should be moving on to other issues at this stage, such as the need to provide resilience training to young people through schools across the country.  Ten years on, the State is still far short of achieving the targets set in A Vision for Change.  If that is to change, over &euro;35 million per annum, or more than double the increase allocated in last month's budget, will be necessary over the next five years.  Clearly, this is a very poor performance on the part of the Government.  I do not doubt that many people, including those facing mental health crises and their family members, have been badly let down.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the deeply cynical game that is being played by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I can explain what I mean by that by referring to a statement made by Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on mental health, Deputy Browne, on 6 August last.  He said that "the Confidence and Supply Agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael commits to the full implementation of the Vision for Change policy, and this is a key priority for us in Budget 2017".  The key words in that statement are "key priority for us".  As a minority Government, the current Government could not survive for 24 hours without the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  If mental health funding was truly a "key priority", it would have been delivered and one of two things would have happened.  Either &euro;177 million would have been allocated in the budget for the full implementation of A Vision for Change, ten years on, or - at the very minimum - a one-fifth share of &euro;35.4 million would have been allocated for the first year of a five-year programme aimed at meeting the targets set in A Vision for Change.  Neither the first option nor the second option was taken.  Instead, a mere &euro;15 million was allocated by way of an increase.  As I have already said, this was less than half of the minimum figure that would have been in line with reaching the targets.  Did the Government fall?  No, it did not.  Was the budget shot down?  It was not shot down because Fianna F&aacute;il did not make mental health a key priority in the budget.  It broke the promise that had been made on 6 August and on many other occasions before budget day.  Governments are well known for breaking promises.  When Fianna F&aacute;il is in government, it is pretty good at it.</p><p>This is a new one on me.  Breaking promises to the most vulnerable people in society from the Opposition benches is some achievement and is not one to be proud of.  What is happening here tonight?  We have a motion which is designed to make Fianna F&aacute;il look like the champions of mental health funding.  It is designed to provide headlines, such as the one it was given on <i>The Irish Times</i>website a few hours ago: &quot;Government willing to put mental health 'on the backburner', says Fianna F&aacute;il&quot;.  It is certainly true.  The Government has put mental health on the backburner.  I hope people do not forget that Fianna F&aacute;il put mental health on the backburner too.  That is what tonight is about, in large measure.  It is about covering Fianna F&aacute;il's tracks in what has been a shameful episode, given the way this has played out in the past weeks and months.<br/><br/>For the people who need improved mental health services and for their friends, families and supporters who are looking at this charade in this House, a discussion needs to start now about what steps can be taken, difficult as they are, to increase pressure on the Government and on Fianna F&aacute;il.  I think people are striving to do their best in difficult circumstances.  We need to have a discussion about finding some way to increase pressure on the Government and on Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am talking about people-power pressure where huge numbers of people in this country find a way to make their voice heard and to light a fire underneath these parties, which have let people down once again.</p></speech>

We know what we should be doing because it is all in A Vision for Change.  There is general agreement that this document is very important.  It was published in 2006 with a ten-year framework, which is now up.  The question is what has been achieved.  I acknowledge the progress that has been made.  There is a greater awareness of mental health and we have more people speaking more openly about mental health issues.  There is an acceptance that, at the very least, it is okay to say "I feel down" or "I feel depressed".</p>  <p>  I believe we are all committed to implementing A Vision for Change but that means ensuring the resources and the staffing are in place to do that.  In the last D&aacute;il I was a member of the cross-Oireachtas group on mental health and, each year, we were able to agree on a pre-budget submission.  One thing that can be learned from this strategy, and from all strategies, is the need for an implementing and monitoring committee to meet regularly - at least every six months - with very specific targets and indicators.  That has not happened and there was no information system on the outcomes of delivery.</p>  <p>  The restructuring of health and the reconfiguring of management and delivery saw mental health not getting the attention it should have.  In addition, the economic crash played a huge role in regard to funding, resources and staff, which it should not have.  No one likes to take a cut in their salary or allowances but under no circumstances should somebody with a disability, whether mental, physical or intellectual, have to take a cut.  They have additional costs of living that the rest of us do not have, as well as other difficulties.</p>  <p>  The last D&aacute;il was a kind of Lanigan's ball with the &euro;35 million - it was there, then it was not there and then &euro;15 million reappeared.  I am still not quite sure where that &euro;35 million went.  Any strategy has to fit the people it is serving, not the other way around.  The real test of a strategy is how it deals with those who do not fit into the particular categories and those whose needs are not being met in the course of a strategy.  Therefore, there is a need for flexibility.</p>  <p>  I want to mention those with mental health issues and those who are in addiction.  There is a lack of counselling services for such people, apart from one service I know in the north inner city, the Oasis-Deora counselling service.  Its funding is minimal but it is taking referrals from the bigger organisations which do get a lot of funding because those organisations either cannot or will not see those with a mental health issue who are also in addiction.  A person presenting with a physical ailment will have a battery of tests and a range of treatments offered to them; if they present with a mental health issue, they could be diagnosed within 20 minutes and then be put on medication.</p>  <p>  Another point is that we need dedicated intellectual disability nurses in accident and emergency units.  In addition, teachers and youth workers identify young people with a mental health issue very early on, and it is at that point the intervention is needed.</p></speech>

I believe this should be debated every couple of months in order to have checks and balances in this regard.  I particularly support Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's point about having a monitoring group looking into this every six months and checking where we have come from and where we have not addressed issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>The most devastating part of this conversation is that, after being told the &euro;35 million was going to be added on to mental health services, it is not being added and the figure is just &euro;15 million.  We must have a House that holds the Government to account and makes it keep that budget of &euro;35 million because we still need that support.</p><p>Dr. Shari McDaid attended the Committee on the Future of Healthcare last week and graphically outlined the needs and problems in mental health services.  She rightly said:</p><blockquote>In 2013, the WHO recommended redirecting mental health spending towards community-based services, including the integration of mental health into maternal and child health, enabling access to better and more cost-effective interventions.  A recent evaluation of a parenting programme in Ireland indicated that for every &euro;1,463 spent per child, a saving of &euro;4,599 per child was realized.  In this context, it is worth noting that between 2008 and 2015 there was a 38% cut to funding for family resource centres.</blockquote><p>That is where money could be put if we do not have staff ready to move into areas of primary care, namely, we could put it into schools to support teachers in dealing with children who are trying to deal with the issues they are facing.  That should be taken on board by the Government.</p><p>A young woman came to us yesterday.  She is a lone parent with four children who is working in a local school for ten hours a week.  Her landlord had just written to tell her that her rent was going up by &euro;200 from &euro;1,150 to &euro;1,350 in December.  She was in dire straits.  Her whole mental and physical health just crumbled in front of us.  We see that every day of the week and I am sure other Deputies see it in their clinics, where people come in who are not able to deal with an issue they feel they cannot get over.  We have to start looking at those areas where people can access help immediately, but if the Government keeps taking money from where it is needed, that will not happen.  The fundamental point made by Dr. Shari McDaid is that what we have now does not go any way to addressing what is a fundamental long-term problem or move us towards a more progressive and reformed mental health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2016-11-15a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500052#ZZ00600"><p>Ten years on from A Vision for Change we are still awaiting its full implementation.  When we consider that poor mental health costs the State some &euro;3 billion a year, surely the provision of &euro;35 million a year would not be too much to ask.  It would help to achieve A Vision for Change and ensure people can get services when they require them and when they are desperate.</p>  <p>  Much has been made of the difficulty in recruiting staff, which creates real difficulty on the ground.  I recently had need to contact a mental health team in north Donegal to try to get a nurse to call to a person's son, who was badly in need of help and whose family were very worried about him, but there was no nurse available in that team and it could not deal with the issue.  In south-west Donegal, because the psychiatrist has retired and has not been replaced, and no locum has been put in place, people presenting with issues cannot get referred on or get treatment.  There are situations where psychiatrists are trying to cover a whole county.  It is not acceptable that this should be allowed to continue.</p><p>It is not acceptable at this stage that it should be allowed to continue.  Its impact on people across the State is immeasurable.  People are going without treatment and are left without services.  For the sake of &euro;35 million a year it is not too much to ask that it be provided for.  The funding could be ring-fenced to ensure that A Vision for Change would be implemented.  Non-governmental organisations, NGOs and groups such as the family support centres that I know in south-west Donegal are overrun with requests for counselling for children and young people to assist them and they cannot keep up with the demand yet this Government slashes their funding by 38%.  They are the bodies filling the gaps left because A Vision for Change is not being implemented and resourced.  The NGOs include BeLonG To which piloted a very successful programme called safe and supportive schools to assist young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, in schools in Donegal.  That programme is being rolled out across the country but it needs to be funded and resourced to achieve what it sets out to do.  It can make a difference and building that awareness among children and young people will help them.</p> <p> We will have another motion next year wondering where the &euro;35 million went.  That is the problem and unless the Government addresses that and implements A Vision for Change, we will continue to have motions like this.</p></speech>

The motion has several objectives, including the full implementation of A Vision for Change, which is ten years old.  It is astounding that we are still trying to implement that document ten years after it was published.  It recognises the financial requirements to complete A Vision for Change as &euro;177 million, &euro;35 million a year yet only &euro;15 million is being provided to deliver new services in 2017.  It calls for a review of this inadequate spending and for multi-annual budgeting.  It is emerging from the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that we need multi-annual budgeting to be able to plan constructively for the future as planning from year to year with inadequate budgets will not provide the best results.  It also calls for the unspent financial allocation for mental health services to be retained within the mental health budget and not returned to the Exchequer and spent elsewhere.  It is quite unacceptable that over many years funding for mental health services has been promised but not delivered.  Kathleen Lynch, when she was Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, was promised funding on several occasions which was withdrawn from her by the then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, removed &euro;12 million from the mental health budget prior to the formation of this Government.  The pattern is being repeated which sends out the wrong message, that mental health funding can be siphoned off to other areas of the health service under the guise that it cannot be spent in the current year.  We know, however, that many areas of the health service are crying out for funding.  There are many voluntary organisations that supply mental health services which would give their eye teeth to get their hands on this funding.  They collect money on a voluntary basis and if they had this funding they would target its use.</p>  <p>  I propose that any funding allocated to mental health services which cannot be spent in the current year should be set aside to buy services in a manner similar to that of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which buys medical and surgical services for those on long waiting lists.  Such a fund should be set up for the mental health services.  It would supply services to those who are homeless and suffer from mental illness and drug addiction, address our unacceptable suicide and attempted suicide rates and provide counselling, psychological and cognitive behaviour therapy services, mental health services for young people through the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and dementia services.  If money is unspent and I am sure it was hard fought for in the budget, it should be set aside for a mental health purchase fund using unused funds to buy services from the private sector.  I would like the Minister of State to consider that.</p></speech>

The proposal, however, in this instance will break up a community setting.  Sadly, there is no funding for this policy because it cost &euro;600,000 a year to cater for one person.  This person was not in a seriously bad way.  Another person cost up to &euro;2 million.  It is wrong to put him out in the community.</p>  <p>  There is not even money for this policy even though hundreds of thousands of euro are spent by managers, advisers and policymakers trying to put this policy together to break up a place like Mary of the Angels.  This is shocking.  Will the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State go to see the people I am talking about before breaking the place up and disbanding it?  The land and the place were given free and it was built up by voluntary fund-raising.  It is shocking to think it is about to be taken down.  No patients are being taken in there now.  This decongregation policy has to be reconsidered because one size does not fit all.  It may suit the odd person but it certainly does not suit most of the people in Mary of the Angels.  For God&rsquo;s sake will the Minister and Ministers of State reconsider what they are doing because they do not have a clue what they are doing when they have not seen the people?  The policy should be debated in the D&aacute;il and should be applied where it is appropriate.</p></speech>

It is good that we have debated this issue three times since this Government was formed because it is a huge one.  I invite the Minister of State to attend Mount Sion in Tipperary.  Like the place Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned in Killarney, it is a lovely home, given freely.  Friends of Mount Sion do much work there but the Minister wants to get the people out of it and bulldoze it.  It is the job of some managers to design this.  I will not say who is in charge on this island.  The Minister of State knows who I am talking about, namely, the HSE.</p>  <p>  Money has been allocated over the past five or six years but it has not been spent and has been returned to the Exchequer or taken by the senior Minister back into the Department of Health.  That is a scandal.</p>  <p>  I know cases of dual diagnosis.  Dr. Harty and other medical people would know that is a very difficult diagnosis.  I know 80 year old parents with a 45 year old son who has languished in a mental health institution with dual diagnosis for 12 months because there is no place for him.  The nearest place for him is in Drogheda.  I know a 25 year old who has been diagnosed with autism and slight mental health problems.  He is in St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny waiting for a place.  There are no places.  The Government attacked and ravaged services in St. Michael&rsquo;s in Clonmel and closed it.  Now the patients have to attend at the accident and emergency department.  That is a traumatic experience for any of us, let alone for people having psychotic attacks.  They are supposed to get transport to Kilkenny but if they attend there after 5 p.m., they have to wait until 9 a.m. the following morning to get a taxi.  It is disgraceful.</p><p>There seem to be heartless people running this.  It is nothing personal to the Ministers of State present.  There seem to be heartless people with no feelings for the trauma, bullying and everything else going on running this.  The services are being removed and stripped, despite the fact that, as in the housing crisis, this and that are promised.</p> <p> There is a leakage of funding.  Successive Governments have failed to ring-fence the funding.  The mandarins in the Department have not ring-fenced it.  They have taken it from mental health and put it back into the Exchequer.  How mean can one be, when so many community facilities could do with some of that money, not all of it, as some Deputies have said?  It could deal with some services for the ordinary people who need it.  They are the most vulnerable people in society and we should all be indicted at the way they are being treated, and rightly so.  It is inhumane, degrading and only due to the fact that plans are made and drawn up inside in offices.  People get promotion on the basis of getting rid of these people from these places.  They have no feeling of understanding of how the patients or their families are going to manage or can manage.  It is heartless in the extreme.</p></speech>

While I broadly welcome the efforts to fully implement A Vision for Change in the area of mental health, this evening we are seeing more confusion around who is in Opposition and who is in Government.  I believe the policy is suffering as a result of that confusion.  The Social Democrats are committed to delivering on all aspects of the 2006 A Vision for Change strategy as a cornerstone of the country's mental health policy.  The A Vision for Change strategy is a decade old now and it is shameful that no Government has been able to deliver the required changes in that time.  The Social Democrats believe that a properly implemented strategy would not only be responsive to individuals suffering from mental health issues, it will also help to equip those with the necessary tools to strengthen awareness of their own mental health and to recognise when to seek help.</p>  <p>  Recognising when to seek help is one thing and help being available in a timely way is quite another.  We all have very real stories to tell that we have heard from people who come to us.  For example, I have had several people come into my office who said that they were feeling suicidal.  What does one do in that scenario, where the services are not available?  We have to stop thinking of a policy as a document and start looking at it as something that is living.  We must look at where the funding is to implement it and do so in a timely way.  For example, Ireland has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in Europe.  We have to build skill sets into teacher training.  We have to reskill those who are finished their training in order that it is possible to deliver classes on positive mental health, particularly in our secondary schools.  The restoration of guidance counsellors would be one step in the right direction, with best practice training able to identify and respond to children in need.  It is simply not acceptable that people should have to wait for crisis intervention, and that is happening.</p>  <p>  The decades of under-resourcing are part of the problem, as it was not just a starting point of 2006.  Society requires that this issue be addressed as an absolute priority.  Where there are positive moves, they are not moving fast enough.  For example, I watched every one of the people's debates last year, mad and all as I might be for doing so.  There was not one of the debates in which this issue was not raised.  It was the only issue that was a common denominator.  This is a problem across the country and it needs urgent intervention.</p></speech>

Despite the Government's commitments to implement A Vision for Change, it refuses to lead effectively from the front, refuses to implement real and positive changes to our mental health services and refuses to prioritise the mental wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens.  By reneging on its commitment to invest appropriately in our mental health services, this Government has signalled its contempt for the human rights of those with mental health symptoms.  It confirms in the minds of the many shattered families that their agonising wait for appropriate interventions and supports for their loved ones will be a weight that will continue under this Minister's watch.  Tragically for some, this weight has and will continue to prove fatal.</p>  <p>  It copperfastens the sense of hopelessness that they have become accustomed to since A Vision for Change was launched.  It is a blueprint document full of vision that has been accompanied by a snail's pace of change.  It is an excellent document and it does not need review but full implementation.  According to research, those who suffer from mental illness need a sustained sense of hope.  However, this Government feeds them with hopelessness.  Even more inexcusably, this Government promised a false dawn and an increase of &euro;35 million in the recent budget to respond to their needs.  However, within days of the budget, the harsh truth emerged that a significant proportion of the promised funding would not be allocated in 2017.  This Government has yet again pressed the pause button on the recovery of thousands of its citizens.  The message is very clear for those who, because of their symptoms, cannot rise and be heard and for those who, with enduring mental illness who sometimes cannot advocate for themselves, will be pushed aside as this Government balances its books.</p>  <p>  The brilliant poet, singer and songwriter, the late Leonard Cohen, is on record sharing the sheer debilitating impact that mental illness, in his case, depression, had on his own life.  He famously wrote, "There is a crack in everything.  That's how the light gets in".  To those desperately awaiting therapy and support, it must feel as though every crack has been filled in and light might never break through.  Further delays should not and cannot be countenanced.  No more reviews and no more false dawns.  There is a need to instil a proper sense of extreme urgency in order, for once and for all, to tackle one of the most critically important challenges of our time.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  However, the Government must prioritise, invest, inject hope and deliver appropriate supports and real solutions, translating words into tangible hope and delivering a real, effective, coherent and sustainable response.</p></speech>

A Vision for Change, published in 2006, is a template for a community-based progressive and modern mental health system.  The policy emphasises provision of a mental health system based on community services and supports provided by community-based multi-disciplinary teams with a significantly reduced need for inpatient services.  Ten years later, there is a crisis in our mental health services arising from and compounded by the abject failure to fund, resource, staff and implement the A Vision for Change policy.  The Government failed in budget 2017 to address the resource issues needed for mental health services.  In July of this year, the Department of Health stated that &euro;35.4 million per year over the next five years was needed to implement A Vision for Change.  Despite that, only &euro;15 million was provided; a shortfall, therefore, of &euro;20 million.</p><p>The mental health services in my own constituency of Tipperary are a good example of the malaise in which the services are at both a local and national level.  Despite the best efforts of staff, the service is dysfunctional.  In 2010, then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State, John Moloney, decided to close the county's inpatient services at St. Michael's unit in Clonmel.  His successor, then Labour Party Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, implemented that closure, despite the opposition of service users, carers, doctors, nursing staff and the public generally.  South Tipperary inpatients were sent to Kilkenny and north Tipperary inpatients were sent to Ennis.  That was done in 2012.  The Minister of State sold the closure on the basis of a promise, <i>quid pro quo</i>, of a Rolls-Royce community-based service.</p><p>Three years later, we have the worst of all worlds.  We have no inpatient service, community services are under-staffed, under-resourced and under-funded, and community-based teams are struggling to provide a safe service.  They are deficient of staff across all categories of nursing, medical and paramedic staff.  We have no 24-7 service.  The new crisis house promised has not materialised.  Patients are assessed in wholly unsuitable, busy and overcrowded accident and emergency departments with no privacy or confidentiality.  The inpatient services in Kilkenny and Ennis are regularly overcrowded, there is difficulty in gaining admission and very often inappropriate early discharge.  There is the proposed closure of the unit at Mount Sion in Tipperary town.  The situation is wholly unacceptable.  I call on the Minister of State to immediately implement A Vision for Change in Tipperary, including the provision of 24-7 services, the recruiting of additional nursing, medical and paramedic staff for our multi-disciplinary teams, the re-opening of the inpatient unit at St. Michael's in Clonmel and a commitment to keep the Mount Sion unit open.</p><p>I acknowledge the excellent work being done by various voluntary organisations in the area of mental health locally.</p><p>I acknowledge organisations such as the consumer mental health panels, C-SAW suicide awareness group, the River Suir Suicide Patrol, Taxi Watch, the Wellness Recovery Action Plan support group and the Carrick-on-Suir River Rescue organisation among many others.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, as a matter of urgency, to meet with a deputation from County Tipperary about the mental health services in the county.</p></speech>

We all embrace what A Vision for Change is trying to do.  It is a roadmap to achieve proper and substantive community-based mental health services and to improve existing services.  My criticism of what is happening is not of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who was recently in my constituency in Dublin 15 to talk about the work with Jigsaw projects and youth mental health, which is very important.  She has embraced the role very positively.</p>  <p>  I am reminded of what the national director of mental health services, Anne O&rsquo;Connor, said on television in the spring when she was asked about recruitment in the mental health area.  When she was asked why she did not spend her allocated budget she said that people emigrate and travel and that is just the way it is.  That was her justification for returning the funding to the Department and the HSE.  We need a total change of attitude at the top level of the HSE in the mental health area if we are ever going to deliver and implement A Vision for Change.  It is a strategy that works but, for example, when we take child and adolescent mental health services there is a massive haemorrhaging of existing community-based teams in many areas.  Staff members on maternity leave and sick leave are not replaced and people must wait for significant periods to get help.  Families are in despair.  Figures indicate that more than half the staffing posts are not being filled and we need a proper recruitment strategy to ensure we fill the posts that have been advertised, as that is crucial.  I will hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>

There are bullies everywhere you go; everyone always has something bad to say, some people might wonder, where are all the people who are nice?"  They are not my words but those of Robert Supple from Newbridge on 24 October on his Facebook page.  Ten days later Robert took his own life, three days after another young teenager in the town.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year Newbridge was blighted by the suicide of five young men.  Hardly a person in the town was not deeply affected by this epidemic.  We cannot allow so many to perish from the silent killer that is mental illness.  Sufferers cannot continue to sit in misery in accident and emergency departments waiting for a unit to open.  There must be a place for teenagers to go to get help when they are suffering, and there must also be a place for their parents and guardians to seek help.</p>  <p>  Every one of us has a role both inside and outside the Chamber in giving shape to a nation that cares for the mental well-being of all citizens.  We must nurture a culture in society in which people in distress are encouraged not to feel any less of a human being or any less worthy of help, and to realise that mental health can be recovered after it has been lost; a culture in which we do not feel embarrassed about our own, or a family member's, mental health.  It all starts with each and every one of us and our own prejudices, ideas and actions.</p>  <p>  The people of Kildare implore the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to listen to their cry for help.  We have the lowest spend on mental health in the country and the lowest investment in the country on young people aged under 24.  Funding is urgently required for Lakeview, the psychiatric unit in Naas hospital, which is an antiquated area designated for people suffering with acute mental illness.  We desperately need &euro;5 million.  I will hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>

I also welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in the Chamber.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Browne, for the work he has done in this area and I also thank those in the Gallery.</p>  <p>  It is hugely disappointing to see the lack of supports and resources in this area for some time.  The time for talking about mental health and making promises is over.  We must now deliver the service.  That is what people expect of us as public representatives, namely, to deliver the service and stop talking about it.  If we put half of the energy into delivering the service as we do talking about it we would have a much improved health service, in particular in the area of mental health.  We will only restore people&rsquo;s confidence and trust when they see the service being delivered on the ground.</p>  <p>  The child psychology service in my area of Kildare North is exceptionally poor.  There are massive gaps in the area.  I have a reply from the HSE which confirms that is the case.  That is an issue that must be examined as a matter of urgency.  From December 2008 to 2015, for example, we lost 1,000 staff from the mental health service area.  When services are put in place, supported properly and adequately resourced we see the positives that result.  For example, we see the advantages in Kilcock of the psychiatric day care service.  The Abbey community project in Celbridge provides services for 40 referrals, including from State agencies, although it operates on a voluntary basis with no funding.  I wish to speak further with the Minister of State about that.  It is not adequate for a service to operate without any funding.</p>  <p>  We cannot have a mental health service that shuts down at 4 p.m. on Friday and does not open until 9 a.m. on Monday.  We must have a 24-hour service in place and teams to deal with people if they are referred with mental health issues.  We must also examine and introduce alternative treatments.  We must send out the message that there is no stigma or judgment attached to mental illness.  It is the same as any other illness.</p></speech>

I am now speaking from the heart.  I recall the previous debate on the issue.  There is a distinct difference between it and the current debate.  Previously, there was unity of purpose from every side.</p>  <p>  In engaging in such a debate I think of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, Deputy Buckley, and others in the Chamber or Gallery who have been affected by suicide.  I also think of family connections and friends who have been affected by suicide.  I sat in the living room of one such family recently in my constituency.  The one thing that resonates in my mind is that the mother of the young man who had committed suicide pleaded with me to fight ferociously with the Government to get funding but not to get into the blame game of who did this and who did that.  I had no intention of saying that this evening.</p>  <p>  Deputy James Browne, a new Deputy, is one of the most sincere individuals one could meet.  The Minister of State recognises that.  He has done Trojan work in this area.  He is very concerned about the issue.  On numerous occasions he has spoken passionately at parliamentary party meetings on the issue.  He has spoken on a one-to-one basis with so many people.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Government is listening and acknowledges what we on this side of the House are doing.  I do not want to say what I will say next but I must do so.  We waited ten weeks to form a Government in this country.  It did not happen.  At the end of the day, we on this side of the House - unlike some of our critics here this evening - did the right thing and formed a Government.  The only reason I say that is because if we had a second election &euro;40 million would have been lost and the mental health services would be much shorter of money than is the case.  Having said that, we all need to step up to the mark and the Government needs to put the funding in place that was promised.</p>  <p>  I have figures going back to April 2016 which refer to a shortfall of 2,687 in the mental health whole-time equivalents for the full implementation of A Vision for Change.  In every health board area there are red figures and a minus, which means that the teams that should be in place to look after people up to 18 years of age are not there.  We must put those teams in place as a matter of urgency.</p><p> We need to be very serious about addressing this matter because many people are suffering.  It is a massive challenge for people inside and outside this Chamber and in our constituencies and wherever we find it, we must find the funding to deal with it.</p> <p> On community health services, there is a major issue in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway for people living in hostels who have been taken out of large institutions.  An attempt is being made to move them out of the hostels where they are happy.  However, I acknowledge that on two occasions at the weekend the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, telephoned me in response to messages I had left for her.  I also acknowledge what she is trying to do.  I know that she is sincere and that her heart is in the right place, but I ask her to, please, try to secure the extra funding promised for mental health services because it is needed.</p></speech>

Real and significant developments in mental health services have been initiated since 2012.  At a time when other budgets were being cut, investment was prioritised and increased to develop mental health policy and services.  Additional funding of &euro;115 million wasallocated in the Health Service Executive's national service plans the peiod from 2012 to 2016, inclusive.  In addition, budget 2017 has provided for additional spending of &euro;35 million, on a full-year basis, on service enhancements to enable further improvements to be made across a range of areas.  This funding will help to meet the key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 service plan, including youth mental health services, further improvements to child and adolescent and adult services, older people's services and an enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.</p>  <p>  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with the increased allocation will be &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.7 million associated with increased pay costs.  This will bring the mental health budget to &euro;851 million in 2017, an increase of &euro;140 million since 2012.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has given the go-ahead for the construction of a new national forensic hospital at Portrane.  This major health infrastructural project will benefit from significant capital investment in 2017, with spending on the new hospital and other more minor mental health projects planned to exceed &euro;50 million next year.</p>  <p>  New investment and personnel have been directed towards developing specialised mental health services.  A commitment to increase mental health funding every year has been given and the Government will stand over that commitment.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the HSE and the many voluntary and statutory agencies working for those who are often at the lowest point in their life when they seek treatment.  With increasing demands and resource limitations, it is important that we work together for the benefit of service users to fully develop positive mental health policy and services that will underpin that policy into the future.</p>  <p>  As well as ensuring the right services are in the right place to meet the mental health needs of the population, it is important to promote good mental health and try to prevent mental health difficulties arising.  One of the key obstacles to health and wellness is excessive alcohol consumption, one of the key causes of mental health difficulties in Ireland.  Alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and cases of deliberate self-harm; in 2014 one in three self-harm presentations was alcohol related.  Three people a day are dying as a result of alcohol misuse, or 1,056 people annually.  We must never forget that alcohol is a psychoactive drug and a depressant, if one consumes more than the body can process.  It is a drug that reduces a person's ability to think rationally and distorts his or her judgment.  In the long term it can cause mental health problems, leading to anxiety, stress, potentially depression and, sadly, suicide.  As a nation, we must reduce our alcohol consumption and the forthcoming Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will help to address this issue.  The Bill is a measured and evidenced based response to deal with the very real harm caused by alcohol.  The seriousness of the problem we have with alcohol led to the renaming of the regional drugs task forces as the regional drugs and alcohol task forces.  If we really care about the nation's health, every Member of the Oireachtas will recognise the importance of the Bill which remains a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  Listening to the very constructive contributions made by colleagues across the House, it is evident that there is a clear will across all political parties and Independent Members to modernise policies and services to bring us into line with current best practice and international norms, while retaining and further developing what is best about current HSE services which are meeting a very substantial demand across the country.</p>  <p>  The Government is giving all Deputies a commitment that we will work with them to help to improve the lives of those affected by mental health issues.  I recognise the support we have received across the House in this regard.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy John Browne and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for giving us an opportunity to again debate the serious issue of mental health in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is very much aware, mental health issues can affect any home in the country.  They can affect people from any background and of any gender or age.  That is the reason they present one of the biggest challenges the Government and we, as elected representatives, face.  I am sure we all have examples in our constituencies of homes that have been devastated by a suicide caused by underlying mental health problems or of a person suffering from depression or anxiety who does not know where to turn.  It is a terrible reality for families to face and no one is immune from its grip.  That is the reason the development and implementation of mental health policy and the upgrading of facilities and staffing allocations are key priorities for the Government.  It is also the reason they will remain key priorities for it, despite what one may read on Twitter or Facebook.  I take the opportunity to reaffirm to the D&aacute;il our full commitment to the development and improvement of mental health services.</p>  <p>  Members may recall that one of the first decisions the Government took on taking office was to sanction the appointment of a dedicated Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health services.  That highlighted the seriousness of the issue for the Government and the fact that it was of such importance it needed a dedicated Minister of State to ensure agreed targets were achieved.</p>  <p>  L0ike Fianna F&aacute;il and all parties represented in this House, we agree that there is an urgent need to make significant progress in this area.  That is why we agreed with Fianna F&aacute;il, as a matter of priority in A Programme for a Partnership Government, that we would continue to increase annual spending on mental health services, develop new facilities and services nationally and fully implement the modernisation of mental health services in line with the policy A Vision for Change.  I am glad to see that is exactly what the Government is working very hard to do and it is what we will continue to do until we leave office.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight again the revenue allocated for mental health service in 2017.  I say this because people often become confused when discussing the annual mental health budget.  A constituent of mine contacted my office recently seeking to understand why the entire mental health budget was only &euro;15 million.  When I asked where she had read that information, she replied that she had read it online.  We need to be clear and unequivocal that the mental health budget for 2017 will be &euro;851.3 million, which represents an increase of over &euro;24.7 million, or approximately 3%, on 2016 levels.  That sum of &euro;851.3 million will be supplemented by a further &euro;50 million in capital funding.  In that regard, I welcome a new development at Sligo University Hospital.  The mental health budget will continue to rise in 2018 and 2019 under this Fine Gael-led Government.  This funding will enable key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 service plan, including youth mental health services, further improvements to child and adolescent and adult services, older people&rsquo;s services and an enhanced out-of-hours response, 24/7, for those in need of services.</p>  <p>  I would like the House to acknowledge the work being done by the HSE and the many voluntary bodies that are working extremely hard the length and breadth of the country.</p></speech>

Children and parents are suffering right across the country and pressure needs to be put on the HSE to develop appropriate services within existing resources as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I have figures provided to me last week from the HSE in response to a parliamentary question in relation to waiting times for child and adolescents in Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  They are extremely worrying and critically highlight the gaps in mental health services and supports for children and young people, including staff shortages in child and adolescent mental health services.  There are currently 221 children on the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, waiting list in the areas I mentioned: 48 are waiting between nought and three months; 45 between three and six months; 43 between six and nine months; 28 between nine and 12 months; and 57 over 12 months.  Twenty-six per cent or a quarter of all children in my area are waiting over a year for assessment.</p>  <p>  The principle of early intervention is critical when addressing mental health problems, leading to better educational outcomes, avoiding later severe mental health issues, improving quality of life and being more cost effective than later treatment.</p>  <p>  In response to a separate parliamentary question, I was informed by the HSE that in July 2015 two positions of child psychiatrist attached to the child and adolescent mental health team became vacant in Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  One of the positions remained vacant until December 2015, but this consultant has since resigned.  A second consultant was recruited and took up the post only in October this year.</p>  <p>  I understand there are staff shortages in most areas but this has to be radically addressed now, and not next year.  We need to see increased staffing for the child and adolescent community and mental health teams.  The delivery of 24-hour emergency CAMHS in all community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and the proper resourcing of CAMHS community services are fundamental to achieving this.  However, this will not be possible with such a low staff complement.</p></speech>

Three hundred posts for adult MHID were recommended in A Vision for Change.  However, only 17.5 consultants are in post, which equates to 6% of recommended staffing levels.  I accept difficulties in recruitment have meant that numbers of recruited staff are significantly lower than recommended.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I visited Carriglea Cairde Services outside Dungarvan in County Waterford.  This facility has both residential and day-care patients with intellectual disabilities.  They accommodate 170 patients.  Of these 70 are day-care attendees and are so well looked after and were so happy and involved in so many activities.  They were swimming, singing, involved in artwork and colouring.  They did not realise I was visiting that day.  There was no plan and I was pleasantly surprised.  I was delighted to see these attendees being so well looked after.</p>  <p>  However, at 4 o'clock in the evening, these attendees leave.  Thirty-six of them are now living in communities.  They are living well in their communities.  I note many people feel that they cannot be decongregated back into the communities but in this instance, 36 of them are and it is working well.  The younger patients seem to adapt much easier than much older patients.</p>  <p>  The rest of the 70, that is, 34, went back to their families.  These families care for their loved ones from 4 p.m., with many of them not getting much sleep.  The families are the full-time carers at the weekend when the fantastic services in Carriglea are not available.  These families receive two weeks respite per year, two weeks when they can avail of a holiday, take a break, sleep, catch up on household jobs or simply relax.  These two weeks are a lifeline for families and carers.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should consider the difference an extra week of respite would make to these families.  Eventually, a full four weeks in a calendar year would make all the difference.  Many of these carers, parents and family members are ageing and they find it increasingly difficult to care for their loved ones.  A week's respite per quarter would make life so much easier and it would also mean that people with intellectual disabilities could stay at home longer with the support of day-care services.</p></speech>

Mental health in Ireland has many connotations.  It is broad-ranging and far-reaching and it crosses every boundary of age, gender and status, and defies adequate coverage by me here this evening.  All I can say is I concur with all who have spoken before me.</p><p>We know we do not have enough funding currently, but I would like to come at it from a different aspect.  Deputy Joan Collins spoke about the family resource centres.  They play a significant role in the communities and supporting the counselling services there.</p><p>I also want to talk about something that has come through CAMHS and the National Educational Psychology Service, NEPS.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware of this, but the operation procedure issued by CAMHS in June last, to which I referred on the last occasion I spoke here, states, &quot;It is not the role of CAMHS to make recommendations that determine the provision of specific educational supports/resources as this is the responsibility of the Department of Education and the National Educational Psychology Service.&quot;  I will translate what exactly that means.  School principals tell me that this is a clause that is used as a cost-saving detour by ensuring that CAMHS psychiatrists are precluded from making recommendations for the services for children presenting with difficulties, be they ADHD, emotional behaviour disorder or autism.  Their statements of fact would fall short of recommending a route to solutions in terms of school-based resourcing.  Basically, there is a way of joining certain dots there in the schools and that is where we can get CAMHS and NEPS talking together.  In fact, the teachers are the ones who can pull it together.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said it earlier.  We need to engage with schools and we need to engage with principals because that is where we can start with a bottom-up approach.</p><p>Finally, last week I got a response from the HSE as to where we have come in the ten years of <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  It recommends that we have 15.5 teams across the country looking after our children.  Currently, as the Minister of State knows as well as I do, we have five based teams.  That is what we have.  They are currently recruiting another five based teams.  Regrettably, it is not enough.</p></speech>

Every Deputy, bar one, made constructive challenging remarks and was focused on mental health.  I also thank the patience of those in the Gallery for whom we are having this debate for their contributions outside of these debates that keep us focused on these key issues.</p><p>I listened carefully to every contributor.  It is clear from across the House that there is no county, no family and no individual who has not been touched by the issues around mental illness.  In my county of Wexford, there are all too many tragic events that have happened in recent times.</p><p>It is unchallengeable the social, ethical and, for those who even need it, the economic arguments for supporting mental health and providing increased services in this country.  It is a question of citizenship and providing full access to participation in society.  That is why we need to focus on it.</p><p>Many issues were touched on here and there were many issues we did not get to.  Among them, dual diagnosis is something that needs to be urgently reviewed.  I accept that alcohol causes mental health problems but many with mental health problems end up in alcoholism.  Unless we treat the root cause of that issue one will not resolve the alcoholism issue, and similarly with drug addiction.</p><p>Decongregation was mentioned.  We must be very careful.  The next Leas Cross will occur in people's homes because the oversight is not there in the community.  We are putting people from congregated settings into the community but without ensuring the supports and the oversight are there to keep an eye on what is happening.</p><p>An issue we did not get to touch on is the increase in self-harm of young women.  That is not only reflected in Ireland.  It is coming out of the UK, the US and across the western world, and it is something that we will have to attend to as well.  Issues around social media and family resource centres, which are underfunded and need considerable support, were touched on.</p><p>I am glad the Government will not oppose this motion.  The motion seeks an urgent review of the budget allocation.  It seeks a multi-annual plan to set out how <i>A Vision for Change</i>will be set.  It will give a final guarantee to ring-fence funding so that any funding unspent in mental health will be carried over.</p><p>We do not want to be back here again.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has our support but she needs to ensure that the people needing the services are also getting support.</p></speech>
