It is a significant announcement by the Government and in the future will be seen to be so.  The announcement last week that agreement had been reached between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Irish Medical Organisation on terms for the delivery of free GP care for all children aged under six years represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees.  This development underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in the community.  It marks a shift towards promoting health and well-being and away from the old "illness model" of care.</p>  <p>  The commencement of the service during the summer will make a real difference to the lives of the youngest in society.  It is a major step forward in improving access, the quality and affordability of health care.  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under six years of age will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  All children under six years will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based health checks focused on well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged two years and again at age five, in accordance with an agreed protocol.  The contract will also include an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma.  Under this cycle of care, GPs will carry out an annual review of each child diagnosed with asthma, not just the two health checks, as was said in the House last night.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that in a full year the additional cost of the universal under-six service, including the preventive wellness checks and arrangements for the management of asthma in general practice, will be approximately &euro;67 million.  As the service is based on the &ldquo;choice of doctor&rdquo; principle, the next step is for the contract to be issued to GPs in order that they can decide whether to sign it.  Contracts will be issued to doctors in the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  The service should be ready to commence by early July.  It will be preceded by a public information campaign and simple online arrangements for parents or guardians to register their children for the service.  This registration can be completed by their GP in the surgery.</p></speech>

If not, it could be interpreted that there has been a withdrawal of funding from other areas or that the funding will come from savings that have not yet been identified.  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify the matter.  There appears to be an underspend in the mental health area, for example, and other key areas.  If no Supplementary Estimate is required for this measure, is the funding coming from savings that have been identified but not yet published or from moneys that have not been spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600003#A00700"><p>I have said publicly that the money for the scheme will not be taken from other areas of the health service.  In the budget for this year we estimated that it would cost approximately &euro;37 million.  The additional funding, for which we had to secure agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was signed off on by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  It will not be taken from any other budgetary area.  We have not underspent in the area of mental health.  Incidentally, we are still examining how we will spend the additional &euro;35 million allocated for mental health services this year and have not yet made a decision on the matter.  We are looking at different ways of providing services because clearly there is a blockage in delivering them.  However, the funding for this scheme will not be taken from any other stream.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, only &euro;37 million was identified as the figure that would be required to fund free access to GPs for children under six years of age.  We now discover that the anticipated cost for the year will be approximately &euro;67 million.  Is the Minister of State hoping or envisaging that only some GPs will take up the contract in an effort to find savings in the scheme?  Clearly, the money will have to be found somewhere because it was not identified in the original Estimates.  There must either be a Supplementary Estimate, savings accruing in some other area or there will not be a full drawdown of the full &euro;67 million identified as the cost of the scheme over a 12 month period.</p></speech>

We are determined that not only will the scheme be taken up by everybody, to the advantage of every child in the country, but also that it will be funded in the way we have proposed.  A Supplementary Estimate might be required towards the end of the year.  At present, one is not required.  However, the funding will not come from any other health area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600003#A01200"><p>I am advised by the HSE that there are three addiction counsellor posts vacant in the Dublin region.  Recently, these positions were offered to candidates on the relevant HSE national recruitment service panel.  As no candidate accepted the offer of work in the Dublin area, a recruitment competition specifically to fill these vacancies is under consideration by the HSE.  The ending of the moratorium on recruitment announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in budget 2015 will give the HSE greater autonomy to manage its staffing levels within the overall pay framework.</p>  <p>  Average current counselling caseloads within the addiction service are dependent on where a clinic is situated.  The HSE has indicated that the average caseload ranges from 25 to 50 individuals and that there are no addiction counsellors with caseloads in excess of 200 clients. </p>  <p>  Drug-specific community employment schemes make a significant contribution to the rehabilitation of recovering drug users.  At the end of December 2014 there were 936 referred clients in drug rehabilitation places, which is close to full capacity.  In any given year participants may exit for a variety of reasons, but there is a cycle of places becoming vacant and being filled on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Despite the economic downturn, cross-departmental provision for drugs programmes continues at a significant level, with over &euro;240 million allocated for drugs initiatives last year.  An extra &euro;2.1 million has been provided in the HSE national budget for measures to target vulnerable drug users in 2015, in line with the Government's ongoing commitment to the national drugs strategy.  This additional funding will support the expansion of residential detoxification and rehabilitation services, the continued provision of needle exchange services outside Dublin and a demonstration study for the use of naloxone in the prevention of opioid overdose.  This initiative forms part of a major effort to reduce drug-related deaths by increasing access to naloxone for non-medical staff, such as the families or friends of a drug user. </p> <p> I am fully committed to the drugs brief, and am eager to tackle the issues in the area in as comprehensive a way as possible.  My Department is beginning work on the development of a new national drugs strategy for the period after 2016, and as Minister with lead responsibility I will play an active role in the development of the strategy.  I look forward to engaging with all interested parties on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600004#B00200"><p>This is an area of major concern, yet it is the first Government in, I understand, 21 years where we have not had a designated Minister with specific responsibility for drugs.  There has been a 37% cut to drugs services over the past five years, and this is showing itself in the strain experienced by people entrusted with the delivery of drug addiction services.  They have to cope with significant caseloads, in particular in Dublin city where addiction counsellors are trying to cope with more than 200 individual cases each.</p>  <p>  The challenge in any one of these is significant and that any one counsellor would be asked to cope with 200 client cases presents difficulties.  It is very important that the real breaking points are noted in the current service, not only in the Dublin region but across the country.  I ask the Minister, apart from the response he has given, to outline the measures he now intends to take to address this most serious area which is currently seriously under-resourced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600004#B00300"><p>It is important to point out that the total cross-departmental budget for the drugs programme was reduced consistently throughout the period of the recession.  It was reduced in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and again in 2013.  In 2014 in was increased from &euro;237.5 million to &euro;240 million and this year it is being increased again.  When we had a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for this area the budget was cut every year.  Now that we have a dedicated Minister who is a senior Minister in the Department the budget is being increased.  That may be lost on people, but when one controls the entire budget it is much easier to move small amounts of money into priority areas, which is what I have done.</p>  <p>  Some 97% of those who are waiting on treatment will receive it within weeks, which is a very short waiting list compared to some of the waiting times that people may face in other areas.  If people require treatment they can get it within weeks in almost all cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600004#B00400"><p>The Minister is correct when he refers to small amounts of money.  What we need, given the crisis we face with drug addiction, is not the proposition that we add to the already chaotic situation additional areas of responsibility, such as alcohol or cannabis.  We need to properly resource the area, if we are to take on board these other critical areas and not add to the impossible situation with which the current cohort of counsellors and those working with the services have to cope.</p>  <p>  Before the Ceann Comhairle clips me once again with the clock, I would like to highlight the situation of women, in particular, and the fact that there has been a 13% drop in the number of women on special community employment schemes following the adoption of measures in a number of social protection Bills.  These are being highlighted as responsible for the withdrawal of a significant number of women from drug rehabilitation services.  I ask the Minister to comment on that, as well as the fact that the Government has failed to fill the 1,000 ring-fenced places for drug rehabilitation participants.  </p>  <p>  My final point is that despite three additional posts being offered we cannot get away from the fact that the Minister also confirmed that they have not been filled.  No positions have been filled in this area over the past 12 months, something which needs to be addressed.  It is not good enough to report that posts have not been filled.  We need to proactively seek to recruit the additional supports that are absolutely necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600004#B00500"><p>It is true that positions have not been filled in a number of areas across health, but this is not because of a lack of finance or effort by the front-line managers involved.  We have moved from a situation where for years, all of the effort involved paring down staff, so when one then tells managers to start hiring a lot of people it creates difficulties.  We are finding it difficult to recruit in some areas and in some parts of the country, but we are not giving up on that by any means.</p>  <p>  Under the dormant accounts scheme, local drugs task forces did not have their budgets cut for the first time in seven years which was in recognition of the fact that they now have responsibility for alcohol.  I can confirm that their budgets will be increased slightly this year because some of the money from the dormant accounts fund will be given to each local drugs and alcohol task force to do a specific project on alcohol in the area.  The sums involved are modest but we are getting to the point where we will have an increase in funding this year.</p>  <p>  Community employment schemes are the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection, as the Deputy will know, but I have been informed that considerable progress has been made on increasing the number of participants on community employment drug rehabilitation schemes.  In December 2014, there were 936 referred clients, which is almost the full capacity of 1,000, of whom 644 were male and 292 female.  Of the support workers, 103 were male and 117 were female.  In total, 1,156 places were taken up, compared to only 655 when the Government came into office.  I am also advised that there has been no change in the entry requirements for community employment schemes.  Places are available only to service users who are in drug rehabilitation and are referred to a place by an addiction service practitioner, referral practitioners, key workers, case managers or counsellors, GPs, treatment centre practitioners or other health service practitioners.</p></speech>

For those who do not know, ChildVision is the national education centre for blind children and is based in Grace Park Road in Drumcondra, Dublin 9.  It is an excellent service and over the past six years it has had to take cuts of some &euro;821,000 or approximately 20%.  Its costs of governing are in excess of &euro;70,000 a year and it recently had additional costs in terms of registration feeds for HIQA of &euro;50,000.</p></reply>

I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the provision of financial support to ChildVision, the national education centre for blind children, Dublin which is an excellent service.  It is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Services are provided through a service arrangement which is signed on an annual basis and reviewed regularly.  The HSE is committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers, including ChildVision, to ensure that available resources are used to respond to the needs of people with a disability, including blind and visually impaired people.</p>  <p>  ChildVision was allocated funding by the HSE of over &euro;4 million in 2014 to provide educational opportunities and support to over 500 blind and partially sighted children and young adults in a safe and nurturing environment.  The HSE has held discussions with all voluntary health service providers regarding funding and service arrangements for 2015.  The HSE has informed the Department that funding allocated to ChildVision remains at the 2014 level with no reductions planned.  I understand that this was relayed to ChildVision recently.  As I am sure the Deputy is well aware, the HSE will spend over &euro;1.4 billion this year to provide specialist services and supports to those with disabilities. </p></reply>

I hope that is on the D&aacute;il record.  ChildVision is an excellent service, as the Minister of State has indicated, and the work and dedication of Mr. Brian Allen and the staff is above the highest standards.  I visited the facility recently and was very impressed by the warmth and energy of all the staff and the people dealing with a very difficult issue.</p>  <p>  Over the past couple of years, staff have had a take voluntary wage cuts of 10% and maternity leave was reduced by 50%.  Staff costs have been reduced for lower-paid staff and there have also been changes to sick-pay policy and reduced staff numbers.  ChildVision has also had to increase funding activity to meet the annual shortfalls.  It has seen cuts in excess of &euro;821,000.  It has taken a hit and now we have an opportunity to ensure the service takes no further hit.  It is an excellent service that must be developed and not cut.</p></speech>

Even people at ChildVision would agree there were very difficult choices to be made.  In 2014, ChildVision had its budget reduced by &euro;25,000 and all disability agencies had similar reductions in that year.  This represented half of the reduction required to meet the overall efficiency target reductions in 2014.  ChildVision feared that in 2015 the reduction would be &euro;54,000; however, the HSE undertook an evaluation of the impact of this reduction on voluntary agencies and has decided not to apply the full reduction in 2015.</p></speech>

We should focus on these issues.  We can see the work the service is doing and it is delivering on efficiencies, reform and administration of services.  ChildVision still needs basic services.  It has a waiting list of 45 children, which must be dealt with in 2015.  I urge the Minister of State to stay focused on services for these children who are visually impaired and blind, as well as the broader disability issues.  We cannot have a position where people jump up and down about tax cuts in the next budget but we do not have adequate funding for services for blind or otherwise disabled children.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not believe what the Deputy or ChildVision has indicated about the shortfall.  However, the HSE imposed a reduction of &euro;25,000 in 2014.  That may have contributed to the shortfall but the reduction was &euro;25,000.</p></speech>

That includes the practice of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.  The purpose of this question is to ask the Minister of State how she intends to address the increase in the number of cases of ECT being used on patients against their will.  Will she comment on the matter?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600005#C00800"><p>Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the written consent of a patient is required where a programme of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, is to be administered.  When an involuntary patient is "unable" or "unwilling" to give consent, ECT may be administered if it has been approved by the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and also authorised by another consultant psychiatrist.  Both consultant psychiatrists must be of the opinion that the administration of ECT would be of benefit to the patient and they must give reasons for their opinion.  The Mental Health Commission has published rules regarding the administration of ECT.  Adherence to these rules is monitored on an annual basis by the inspector of mental health services.</p>  <p>  ECT usage in Ireland is low and in line with other European countries. The latest analysis carried out by the Mental Health Commission for which there is a breakdown available on the administration of ECT was published in March 2014.  This relates to 2012 figures.  The Deputy recently received figures on the total number of patients who received ECT without giving consent for the period 2011 to 2014.  Of the 22 such patients recorded in 2011, I can confirm that only three were recorded as unwilling, while the remaining 19 were recorded as being unable to give consent.  The Commission has not yet published a 2013 or 2014 analysis but provisional figures made available confirm that the number of patients who received ECT without giving consent in 2014 was 42.  I am informed that only five of these patients were recorded as unwilling, while the remaining 37 were recorded as being unable to give consent.  While the total number of patients receiving ECT without consent has risen from 22 in 2011 to 42 in 2014, it is important to note that there has only been a limited increase from three to five in the small number of involuntary patients administered ECT who were recorded as unwilling in that period.  These figures need to be considered in the context of a total of 18,173 admissions to psychiatric units for treatment in 2012, of which 2,141 were involuntary admissions.</p>  <p>  I have recently published the report of the expert group set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001.  The group has made 165 recommendations, which include some important points on the administration of ECT.  The main recommendation is that in future, it will no longer be possible to administer ECT to an involuntary patient who has capacity and does not consent to such treatment.  I fully agree with the recommendations of the expert group and have instructed my officials to deal separately with the proposed amendments relating to ECT and ensure the legislation is amended as soon as is practically possible.  This will ensure that in all cases where a patient who has capacity refuses ECT, this preference will be respected.</p></speech>

This is the Mental Health Commission's response and not mine; it is an independent body which takes these issues very seriously.  The commission has now confirmed that, based on provisional 2014 figures, 42 patients were administered ECT without consent, with only five recorded as being unwilling.  Whether the Deputy and I agree with that is entirely a different matter.  The total number of patients administered ECT without consent has risen from 22 to 42 in the period 2011 to 2014, and hence there is reference to a surge in numbers.  Those recorded as being unwilling in that period only rose from three to five.</p>  <p>  The Deputy makes regular statements on mental health issues which are inappropriate.

The HSE will have &euro;635 million more available in 2015 than was provided in the original Estimate for 2014.  In addition, a minimum savings target of &euro;130 million has been set in areas such as procurement, drugs and agency costs in 2015 and, in a welcome new development, further savings that can be achieved over and above the minimum savings target will go back into the delivery of health and social care services.  In the past three weeks additional funding has been sanctioned for primary care, the fair deal scheme and the opening of community and district hospital beds.</p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;4 billion is being made available to acute hospital services in 2015.  A further &euro;900 million comes from insurers and charges paid by patients to hospitals.  This represents a very significant increase in hospital budgets compared to the original provision last year.  When compared with the 2014 expenditure outturn, taking account of overruns which should not have happened in the first place, there is a modest reduction of approximately 2%.  These savings are to be achieved in the manner set out in the HSE service plan and include savings in procurement, reductions in drug costs and the reduction of agency and overtime expenditure through more appropriate staffing and workforce planning, including taking on additional staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE national service plan includes a robust accountability framework and the HSE is in ongoing engagement with the hospital groups to ensure a comprehensive and robust assessment of emerging financial pressures and appropriate measures to deal with same.  The service plan recognises that the allocation of more realistic budgets brings with it a requirement for greater accountability to ensure services are delivered within the budget provided.  The commitment of the management and staff of hospitals will be key in ensuring the best possible outcomes are secured from the &euro;4 billion budget within which hospitals must operate in 2015.</p></speech>

We already know that the acute hospital network is facing severe resource difficulties.  Last year there was a Supplementary Estimate and we know that legislation has been passed whereby, allegedly, there will be no more Supplementary Estimates and that so-called overspend figures will be carried forward.  This is only laying the foundations for a future crisis.  There can be no other way to describe it.  The report indicates that acute hospitals reported a &euro;10.6 million deficit for January alone.  I do not yet have the figures for February and March, but perhaps the Minister might.  If he does, do they mirror the January figure?  If that is the case, does it not tell him that we are simply not able to deliver even on the same level, let alone more with less?  The heroic efforts of those working at the coal face on hospital sites face ever greater difficulties.</p></speech>

All hospital groups and hospitals have had an increase in their budget allocation in 2015 over 2014.  What we have not done is allow them to incorporate their entire overrun last year into their base for this year.  This is very different.  We cannot have a situation where hospitals overrun by 15% or 16% and receive a further 2% on top of this for the next year.  We will not allow this.  The Deputy has clearly read the performance assurance report, PAR, but he has been quite selective in the sections he mentioned.  What is very interesting and of concern about the figures for January and February - the figures for both months are similar - is that hospitals are spending more money and have more staff but fewer patients.  The numbers attending emergency departments decreased in January.  The number of elective admissions also decreased.  What happened in January and February was that hospitals hired more staff and spent more money but saw fewer patients.  That is not acceptable.  It is very important that hospital managers and chief financial officers understand this and get to grips with it in the coming months.</p></speech>

The report to which I referred states very clearly that while a more realistic budget for acute services was provided in 2015, it was not possible to provide a budget at the full level of the 2014 spend.  The Minister is very happy to speak in terms of what was allocated at the outset of 2014, but he is completely ignoring the reality in terms of the additionality which had to be provided to meet the real cost o the provision of acute hospital services through 2014.  The report clearly states final expenditure levels for 2014 mean that costs in acute hospitals need to be reduced by approximately 1.2% to 1.4% below 2014 expenditure levels and pay and that other cost pressures must also be dealt with.  These will result in a likely cost reduction in 2015 of approximately 2% to 2.5%.</p></speech>

It seems that one of the major factors was the fact that there were so many delayed discharges, which was reducing bed capacity.  That is why the additional money is being provided for community beds under the fair deal scheme, to free hospitals of the current level of delayed discharges in order that they can operate more effectively.  That is under way.  It will happen in the next couple of weeks and should allow them to employ their resources more effectively.  Savings are supposed to come from turning very expensive agency staff into staff with proper contracts, whether fixed-term or permanent, from savings in procurement and from any reduction in drug costs we can achieve during negotiations with the industry.  Reference pricing will also help to bring down bills for hospitals.</p></speech>

If the Government is banning abortion in this country, will the Minister of State at least let the women concerned access these pills via the Internet and take their chances?  What is happening is that doctors have to sit in surgeries, hand-holding, and tell women that they will help them afterwards if there is a problem.  I remind the Minister of State that until the 1980s, contraception was illegal in this country.  I remember that time when people had to sneak around back streets looking for family planning clinics.  I also remind her that vasectomies were illegal.

Taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I have put in place a target that by mid-year nobody will wait more than 18 months for inpatient or day case treatment or an outpatient appointment, with a further reduction to a waiting time of no more than 15 months by year end.  The existing targets are that no adult should have to wait longer than eight months and that no child should have to wait longer than 20 weeks for inpatient or day case treatment and that no patient should have to wait longer than 12 months for an outpatient appointment.  However, these targets have not been met for many years.  In order to bring about an improvement, I am starting with the longest waiters to reduce progressively the period beyond which nobody will wait.  This is a realistic approach to achieving a much needed improvement, even while recognising that waiting times are considerably longer than international standards.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working on an implementation plan to achieve these targets.  This will involve both productivity improvements and rigorous waiting list management.  Further increasing day surgery rates for specific procedures will be important in improving elective access within available capacity.  Priority will be given to adherence to the guidelines on the scheduling of patients for surgery, including chronological scheduling, which will be monitored by the HSE throughout the year.</p>  <p>  I do not believe there is any massaging of figures.  If anything, I expect that there is quite a lot of double-counting on waiting lists and quite a number of people who have been referred to three consultants for the same thing or who have already received treatment privately but still appear on a waiting list.</p><p>If anything, the numbers are probably higher than the figures suggests.<br/><br/>One area that is not counted is the number of people waiting for diagnostics.  Deputy Kelleher is correct in that sense.  This is because the figures were not accurate.  However, once the figures are accurate the HSE will start publishing them again.</p></speech>

There are 405,000 people waiting for outpatient appointments.  That is a statistic, but it is an alarming statistic because there are 405,000 people involved.  Clearly, the measures that the Minister is now outlining to achieve targets represents an admission that the targets set by the Government were not achievable and are not being achieved.  Rather than addressing the problem the Minister is effectively moving the targets.  As I said previously, it would be like Johnny Sexton kicking the ball wide from a penalty kick all the time while saying that the goalposts were in the wrong place.  It is a farcical position.  This is detailed spin at its best.</p>  <p>  The Minister is setting new targets.  He is setting targets that are way behind the targets in place previously.  In other words, he is camouflaging the fact that the numbers of people waiting are going up.  Not only that, the Minister has decided to shift the targets, for example, from nine to 18 months for some people.  This is a complete admission of failure.  Yet the Minister always applauds himself for the fact that he is being brave to set targets.  The targets are in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

It includes people waiting to see a number of consultants for the same condition.  Deputies should bear in mind that it also includes routine appointments and people who are waiting one week or perhaps two or three weeks for appointments.  It is not that everyone in that figure is waiting six months, eight months, 12 months or anything like that.  The numbers waiting 12 months for outpatient appointments is currently at approximately 77,000, which is a high level but it is certainly not the 400,000 figure that Deputy Kelleher is using.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the targets that were set were not met and have not been met.  I am trying to set realistic targets that can be met.  Deputy Kelleher should bear in mind that Fianna F&aacute;il, as a party, is led by a former Minister for Health who promised to abolish all waiting lists entirely within two years at a time when there was no limitation on spending, but he was unable to do it.</p></speech>

That is one of the paradoxes of health care.  What we are trying to do is set minimum targets and minimum acceptable limits.  Even they are going to be difficult to reach.</p></speech>

Basically, the Minister is saying that the 405,000 figure is not a realistic figure in the first place and there may be double counting in it.  However, there was double counting in the previous figure of 330,000.  At the time we were told it would never climb any higher, that the issue could be addressed easily and that we were being alarmist in raising the matter as a challenge in the health services.  The figure is now at 405,000 people.  The Minister has decided to set targets that will alleviate the pressure on him and the HSE to deliver on in a timely fashion.  That is what the Minister has done.  He has gone from nine to 18 months.  As sure as night follows day the Minister will be applauding himself and will say that the health service has nearly reached its target of 18 months, although the original target set was nine months.</p>  <p>  The Minister should bear in mind that among outpatients, some 9,569 are waiting more than two years for an appointment.  A total of 2,712 are waiting more than three years.  That is where we are.  I listened to all the glib talk of my party leader being a previous Minister for Health.  Nevertheless, it is four years since the Government has been in office.  Something needs to be done about this because it is creating serious pressure on individuals throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am focusing on waiting times.  When we talk to individual patients they talk about how long they have been waiting, not whether they are placed 1,647 on the list.  They want to talk about how long they are waiting.  That is why the target should be about waiting times.  That is what I am focusing on.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher referred to people who are waiting over two years for an outpatient appointment.  If I can get my plan through and if it is properly operational by the HSE, then all those people will be called for appointments in the next couple of months.  It will be interesting to see how many of them have already had the appointment or have already seen a different consultant.  We will see how many of those extremely long waiters recorded in our statistics, for example, those waiting over two years, have really been waiting over two years.  That will become evident quite soon.</p></speech>

Information is growing that this is leading to a major sucking of resources and costs in terms of agency staff.  Moreover, it appears the ban on recruitment has led to serious shortages of staff and has led directly to the bed and trolley crisis as well, because hospitals have been unable to recruit agency staff at key times.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600008#F01100"><p>There are many different factors that contribute to trolley waits.  Some of those factors vary from hospital to hospital.  While there are difficulties recruiting certain specialties of consultants and certain categories of non-consultant hospital doctors and nurses, recruitment was not a major factor in the difficulties faced by the emergency departments in recent months.  Indeed, staffing levels were higher in January 2015 than June 2014 and the numbers of doctors employed by the HSE is at an all-time high.  Delayed discharges, in particular, have been identified as a critical factor in the difficulties that arose and this reduced effective bed capacity.  There was also a higher number of older patients who required a longer stay.</p>  <p>  I convened the emergency department task force before Christmas to examine the matter as a priority and to make recommendations.  The task force worked diligently on the issue and the report was published at the end of March.  The plan being implemented on foot of this work includes additional funding of &euro;74 million to address specific requirements identified, including nursing home places, transitional care beds and community and district hospital beds.  I am determined that the task force action plan is put into operation without delay and I will take a personal interest in ensuring this.</p>  <p>  In recent years the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where necessary to deliver front-line services.  Since the Government came to office, the number of consultants has increased by 150, the number of NCHDs has increased by more than 600 since 2010 and the number of nurses employed by the HSE has increased by more than 500 in the past 12 months.  Agency staff was also utilised to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intended to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and agencies to manage their staffing levels within allocated pay frameworks.  This change allows further recruitment flexibility, for example, where it is determined that offering permanent contracts can achieve more economical service delivery than agency use.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 pay and numbers strategy to give effect to this decision.  This strategy is currently being finalised.  Following approval of the strategy, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued.</p></speech>

There has been a 10% reduction in that time.</p>  <p>  There is a relationship between the trolley and bed crisis and the embargo and downsizing in general of our health service in recent years or since 2009.  It got worse in 2014 under the watch of this Government.  Some 77,091 people had to wait on a trolley in our health services in 2014, while in 2007 the number was 50,000.  There has been a major increase of almost 50%.</p>  <p>  I have it on good authority from managers of Connolly Memorial Hospital, which is in the Minister's constituency, that the embargo had played a direct role in making that hospital one of those with the highest numbers of patients on trolleys.  The hospital could not recruit agency staff over Christmas because they did not want to work over Christmas.  Moreover, the Minister has banned hospitals from recruiting staff directly.</p></speech>

If Deputy Coppinger does not believe me, she should go to <i>www.inmo.ie/Trolley_Ward_Watch</i>.  It will explain exactly how those figures are calculated.  Specifically, in Connolly Memorial Hospital the figures include people who are put on the day ward or the surgical day ward when there is an overcrowding problem.  They are not on trolleys.</p><p>The Deputy's thesis is entirely incorrect.  Her thesis is that emergency department overcrowding was worse this January than last January because of staff shortages, but the facts indicate otherwise.  The total number of consultants increased from 3,434 to 3,515, the total number of doctors increased from 4,918 to 5,302 and, for the first time in recent years, the number of nurses started to increase again.  The number increased from 34,177 at the end of 2013 to 34,509 at the end of 2014, to 34,993 now, and today it is probably above the 35,000 mark for the first time in three or four years.  Therefore, the Deputy's thesis that reduced staff numbers have caused overcrowding is clearly nonsense.  There have been increased staff numbers and yet despite that there has been more overcrowding, so overcrowding must be caused for a different reason that is not primarily related to staffing levels.</p></speech>

Connolly Hospital is one such example, of which I have good knowledge from talking to the managers of that hospital.  They told me they could not recruit agency staff at key times such as Christmas and other times as the staff did not want to work.  I do not know what the numbers are.  My question relates to the fact that the health service has to pay out in this respect.  For example, the hospital in Galway, as has been well publicised, had to spend &euro;10 million last year on agency staff, which represents a five-fold increase in one hospital.  Imagine the resources that is sucking from our health service.  The Minister's ban on recruitment is leading to higher costs throughout the health service.  Connolly Hospital has had the highest number of people on trolleys in the State on several occasions and that must be a bit embarrassing for the Minister as that hospital is in his constituency.  On 10 April there were 30 people on trolleys in that hospital-----</p></speech>

They just were not able to find agency staff willing to work over Christmas, and if that was the case, that was the case.</p></speech>

We will hire at least 500 additional nurses to proper jobs with proper contracts across the country this year, but that will not get people off trolleys.  People are not on trolleys because of the number of nurses.  It is to do with admission rates, bed capacity and many other different issues.  It is not the number of staff that causes people to be on trolleys; it is the fact that they are admitted and, for whatever reason, there is not a bed on a ward for them to go into.</p>  <p>  The major problem I believe Connolly Hospital has faced, and this is what I have heard from the managers and consultants to whom I have been talking, is that there has been a very significant increase in the delayed discharges in that hospital.  More than 40 people in that hospital, who would account for more than a whole ward, are now awaiting long-term care, and that is why we took the action we did a few weeks ago.  I am hoping and expecting that this will alleviate the situation over the coming weeks.  It is the case that on a couple of occasions in the past few months Connolly Hospital had more people on trolleys than other hospitals.  There are 50 hospitals and it is not unusual for any given large hospital to top the table on a particular day.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister is starting to make some progress in this area but we would accept there is much catch-up to do.  The Minister is well aware that there is a strong link between substance abuse and mental illness.  Without it sounding too much as if I am engaging in parish pump politics about this, Wexford has suffered more than most areas and things are particularly difficult there.  Successive budgets have slashed up to 25% of provision in this area.  We have no 24-hour acute mental health facility in the county.  The Cornmarket project in Wexford, which provides a drug rehabilitation programme, has noted a yearly increase of 20% in the number of clients accessing its drug rehabilitation programme.  There are particular problems and challenges there which the Minister might consider attending to.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the difficult economic climate, a range of new services have been introduced in the south east in the past five years, which have been of benefit to those in County Wexford who are affected by substance misuse issues.  The additional services provided in Wexford include a new methadone maintenance treatment service and the expansion of needle exchange, with 12 pharmacies now offering this facility in the county.  The HSE has also commissioned 12 new detox beds, including a four-bed adolescent detox service in Kilkenny, which can be accessed by people resident in the south east, including Wexford.</p>  <p>  More than &euro;3.8 million has been provided for addiction services in the south east this year, in line with the Government's policy of focusing resources on services.  This includes &euro;1.06 million for the south-east regional drugs task force, the same level of funding as 2014.  Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the national drugs strategy, we have also provided an additional &euro;2.1 million in the HSE budget nationally for this year for measures to benefit vulnerable problem drug users.</p>  <p>  The resources available to address substance misuse will be kept under review in the context of the overall resources available to the health services and the most effective utilisation of those resources.</p></speech>

He pointed out that since the merger of acute services for Waterford and Wexford in Waterford in 2011 many of those in need of help in Wexford have been left with no access to these vital services.  He claimed that a person going through a mental health episode needs a referral letter from a GP in order to get an appointment with a psychiatrist.  If the person is at risk of self-harm, he or she would be referred to the accident and emergency department at Wexford General Hospital, which is not equipped to deal with psychiatric patients, where they could wait up to 24 hours before seeing a liaison nurse who would then speak to a psychiatrist.  From there they could be referred to the accident and emergency department in Waterford where they could again have to spend hours in a queue.  Apart from the obvious fact that people are not getting the care they need, and that the need for a person with a mental illness to be seen is often time-sensitive, the person often cannot even get a lift to Waterford.  Many family members have contacted me and said that having this unit in Waterford is not quite good enough for the many people in Wexford who are in dire need.</p></speech>

Had I been aware that he wanted to raise mental health services more broadly in the south east, I would have prepared for the question a bit better.  I am informed that the 24-hour service for the south east operates from Waterford and that Wexford is catered for from there but also by its own community services across the county.  Increasingly in the mental health area we are moving towards much stronger community services and centralised acute 24-hour services.  That would have happened also, for example, in my part of Dublin where we had the old St. Brendan's Hospital but that has now changed very much to a community-based service with some acute services in Blanchardstown.</p></speech>

If a person is in dire need of help and is living in Wexford town, it can be a massive problem for them to have to go to Waterford.  I understand the Government does not have a limitless supply of money but Wexford hospital has the infrastructure to house a 24-hour acute unit.  The facility to provide for it is there.  I understand it will cost money to put such a unit in place.  The problem in this area will continue and it will increase.  It is hard to credit that Wexford has the second highest suicide rate in country.  It has one of the highest illiteracy rates and one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country.  We have an unemployment rate of just under 24%.  It is an abandoned county.  There are some serious challenges in the county.  There are more challenges in the mental health and drug abuse areas than there are in most areas.  The Minister should examine the prospect of putting a 24-hour acute unit in place in Wexford General Hospital.  I do not know what it would cost but it is something he should consider.</p></speech>

I ask this question in the context of the crisis that exists in many disability services.  There is a lack of planning and targets with regard to the provision of services for people with disabilities.  One example of this is that adult services for 30 young adults on the north side of Dublin will be under major pressure from next September.  What is happening with regard to these services?  The Minister of State has said that &euro;12 million will be made available for school leavers nationally, yet I have had 30 families tell me that they will not be able to get an adult service in September.</p></reply>

I will come back to the Deputy's supplementary oral question presently.  The aforementioned report proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community over a seven year time frame.</p>  <p>  The report identified that around 4,000 people with disabilities in Ireland live in congregated settings, defined as residential settings where people live with ten or more others.  It found that notwithstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity and lived their lives apart from any community and family.</p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the work and progress made by the HSE and disability service providers in transitioning people from congregated settings since 2008.  At the end of 2014 there were approximately 2,900 people with a disability living in institutional care and many of the original group of 4,000 surveyed had transitioned to alternative community living arrangements.  I am anxious to ensure that this momentum is maintained.  The reconfiguration of disability residential services has been prioritised by the HSE social care directorate in its operational plan for 2015, with an additional 150 people targeted to move this year.  The HSE is currently developing an implementation plan for de-institutionalisation that will be rolled out at a regional and local level in full consultation with the stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I am anxious to answer the Deputy's supplementary question.  The 30 families to whom the Deputy referred need have no fears.  As long as I have been in politics there was a crisis-driven approach, with people with disabilities coming out of training or school having nowhere to go in September.  We did not have such a situation last year and will not have it this year either.  People will have to outline to the HSE directorate the particular needs of the individuals in question and a place will be found for them.  We do not want a crisis-driven approach to re-emerge.  I assure the Deputy that it will not happen this year and the &euro;12 million that we have set aside will ensure that it does not.  A lot of planning is going into ensuring that people do not have the type of anxiety the Deputy has described.</p></speech>

I am putting down a marker now with regard to the provision of services next September.  The Minister of State should note that parents have been told by St. Michael's House services that there is no guarantee that the required buildings will be available for use in September.  Furthermore, the HSE has said that it will not fund transport services.  There is an issue in that area.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of planning for people with disabilities, does the Minister of State accept that there have been major cuts to the supports that enabled people with disabilities to live independently?  Many parents, particularly those who are more elderly, are suspicious when they hear the big fuss being made about congregated settings because they are afraid that their children will end up in a community setting without the necessary supports and services.  We have seen cuts to the mobility allowance, respite care grant, motorised transport grant, benefit allowance, medical cards and home help services.  There was also an attempt to cut the personal assistant service in the past which was reversed because of the reaction of people with disabilities.  Is the Minister of State aware that such cuts are in breach of Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?  We need to up our game and plan proper services for all people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

I do not accept that something is a crisis when it happens every year.  This is something for which we should be able to plan and that is what we are doing.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about mainstreaming people with disabilities and ensuring that they live the type of lives that we would expect to be able to live then a combination of efforts is required.  It should not be necessary, for example, for people to be driven to every single venue.  St. Michael's House, for instance, presented a project which involved service users being trained to use their free bus pass, which was a freeing experience for them, although I accept fully that not everyone is in that position.  </p>  <p>  We must be very careful to ensure that people with disabilities who are coming out of institutions into the community do not find themselves more isolated than they were previously.  I am very conscious of that danger and will be very careful about how we manage the transition to ensure that people do not find themselves isolated within communities.</p></speech>

Finally, on the broader question of people with intellectual disabilities, the Minister of State will be aware that there are 27,256 people with disabilities here, of whom 2,271 are looking for residential places or places in a community setting.  There are only 197 people who need day care services now and surely that is something that we can deal with immediately, as a priority.</p></speech>

It details the sequencing of the introduction of the free GP scheme as originally intended.  This was early in the lifetime of the Government and before electoral concerns came to the fore for the parties in government.  The memorandum states that free GP care is to be phased in over the term of the Government.and that this would take place in four phases, after which everyone would be entitled to free GP care.  The note goes on to argue that it would take four phases to allow for the financing of the initiative and the recruitment of more GPs and practice nurses.  The first two phases were chosen on the basis that the numbers were known and were small enough and manageable.</p><p>Each of the phases is set out in the programme for Government and they are as follows:<blockquote>Phase 1<br /><br />The first phase will involve providing free GP care to claimants under the Long Term Illness Scheme.<br /><br />Phase 2<br /><br />The second phase will see free GP care extended to claimants on the High-Tech Drugs Scheme.<br /><br />Phase 3<br /><br />The third phase will involve extending subsidised GP care to everyone.  There are a number of possible scenarios for this and these are being looked at.  In particular, we would hope to use this phase to focus on preventative care, particularly for people with chronic health conditions.<br /><br />Phase 4<br /><br />The fourth phase will involve extending free GP care to all.</blockquote>The note goes on to provide some points of clarification and states:<blockquote>- Please note, only those people who qualify for the Long Term Illness Scheme and who are current claimants will benefit in the first year.  This amounts to about 56,000 people.  One of the main beneficiaries in the first year will be people with diabetes.<br /><br />- The reform is scheduled for commencement around early Summer 2012, although this is subject to change.  The reform will require legislation and there are a number of logistical elements that have yet to be worked out.</blockquote>Almost three years have passed and the Government parties' original plan for rolling out the scheme has failed.<br/><br/>The briefing note to which I refer went on to provide further clarification on how the scheme would operate, including information on the medical conditions that would be covered in phase 1.  They include: mental handicap; mental illness; diabetes; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; spina bifida; muscular dystrophy; acute leukaemia; and conditions arising from use of Thalidomide.  As can plainly be seen, the original intention behind this worthy scheme which Fianna F&aacute;il supports was to roll it out by prioritising on the basis of need and leaving those of us who are generally healthy until last.  Sadly and in response to increasing electoral imperatives, the Government lost the will to roll out the scheme in a fair and just manner.  Instead, it decided to prioritise the rolling out of the scheme on the basis of where the greatest electoral gain might be achieved.  This resulted in the announcement in recent days of an agreement with one of the GP representative bodies to extend free GP cards to those under six years of age.  This will provide free GP care for all children under six years, while children who are seven or eight years of age and suffering from long-term illnesses will be denied such care.  I genuinely see universal GP care as potentially being a great step forward in the area of public health and want it to be implemented.  However, I cannot understand why the Government proceeded to introduce it in the way I have outlined.<br/><br/>Many of those who are in dire need of care and languishing on waiting lists are questioning the Government's policy in this area.  The scheme should have been rolled out in the way that was originally intended, namely, with those in greatest medical need being prioritised.  Legal concerns have been cited as an explanation as to why the Government decided to proceed in the way to which I refer.  However, that explanation is insufficient.  What does a parliament do?  The answer is that it creates laws.  If there are legal concerns about or impediments to the roll-out of long-term illness cards, the place to take action and solve any problem is in these Houses.  Shortly after sending the briefing note from which I have quoted, the Minister of State concerned felt compelled to step down from her position on a matter of principle in another area of public health policy.  Once she was gone, the political will to implement policy on long-term illness cards in a fair and just manner was lost.<br/><br/>The Bill before the House involves the extension of the scheme to those over 70 years who currently do not qualify for long-term illness cards.  Approximately 36,000 will gain from this measure.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill and look forward to supporting it, as we should provide for some ease of comfort and security for senior citizens.  The Government no doubt hopes the Bill will buy it some forgiveness from the elderly for the series of attacks to which it has subjected them during its term of office to date.  Deputies opposite should be aware that elderly people will not forget and that they are not prone to forgive.  Only two years ago, the Government brought forward legislation to take medical cards from the over 70s.</p></speech>

A sense of security is essential for all of us.  It is particularly essential for the elderly because they have a right and an entitlement to some comfort at their stage of life.  The Bill will certainly provide some security in terms of their access to medical care.  However, the cuts to which I have referred, particularly the abolition of the telephone allowance, have done much to undermine their sense of security.  Many elderly persons were reliant on the telephone allowance to pay for their land lines and the security alarms attached to them.  This might mean nothing to Deputy James Bannon, but it means a great deal to senior citizens, particularly those in County Longford.</p></speech>

I accept that this is a "smirking" issue for Deputy James Bannon, but it is not for senior citizens throughout the country.  The abolition of the allowance removed the security blanket which having an alarm offered to many elderly individuals.  Like County Longford, my constituency is largely rural and many people live in isolation.  The removal of the security blanket to which I refer has forced some of my constituents to move from rural areas into urban settings.  Those who did not move are living with a sense of unease and discomfort as a result of the threat they perceive.  Is this the kind of society those opposite want to create?</p>  <p>  I will not be opposing the Bill.  As a slight and insufficient measure to reverse the attacks the Government has made on senior citizens, it has some merit.  However, it is debatable whether it has such merit in terms of being a move towards the roll-out of universal free GP care.  It is a shame that the Government parties lost the political will to implement the policy it set down in 2011.  Those suffering from long-term illnesses, including children as young as six years, are not going to be covered.  Those to whom I refer have been told to go to the end of the queue and wait until the parties in government are done with their attempts to win re-election.</p></speech>

This is a significant and important step on the road towards free GP care for the entire population.  The Bill will also provide a much-needed boost for pensioners because, regardless of their income or means, all persons over the age of 70 years will have access to free GP services.  In addition, it provides that dependants, including spouses and partners under 70 years of age, will have access to GP services free of charge in circumstances where the existing income qualifying criteria are met.</p>  <p>  When introducing the Bill, the Minister of State indicated that general or family practices were often viewed as being at the core of the primary care system.  I support her view.  The confidence patients build up in those who work in their local practices helps to alleviate a great deal of the fear and dread which senior citizens and others have when faced with medical problems.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The new arrangements will allow greater confidence in the relationship between the GP and the patient.  The young couples who will be bringing their children under the age of six years to their GPs will be commencing a lifetime of medical care with that doctor or primary care centre.  It is a question of building confidence over a period of time.</p> <p> I had to deal with a sad family incident recently.  It was gratifying to see the level of confidence my family had in our own GP, who had been caring for my family for many years.  His support for my family during that sad occasion had to be seen to be believed.  The same could be said for the consultants who treated Anne.  That confidence meant that we could approach them and ask them questions.  We could be assured that they were giving us accurate information.  That type of relationship offers me an assurance about the service's ability to improve.</p> <p> Young couples need to have the confidence that they can develop a strong relationship with their GPs as their children grow towards adulthood.  This Bill will foster that confidence.  The two age groups provided for in this and the previous Bills are only the first steps, and I hope that during the lifetime of the next Government similar GP services will be made available to everyone.  In this way we will ensure that people need not fear to attend their GPs with illnesses or other problems and thereby improve the general health of the country.</p> <p> In his opening statement, the Minister for Health referred to persons with permanent conditions who are finding it difficult under the current medical card scheme to gain admission to hospitals.  All of us have encountered problems of this nature through our constituency clinics.  The people who are admitted to hospital will attest to receiving a wonderful service from the commencement of treatment onwards.  They are more than satisfied with the system.  The big problem is the waiting list.  I hope the Minister will investigate that problem.</p> <p> The previous speaker referred to a number of issues.  In a perfect world these issues would have been dealt with but his own party created the problems that mean we are not living in a perfect world.  Unfortunate decisions had to be made but we are taking another step towards rectifying the problems created after 2008 by wild decisions of the previous Government.  Signs of progress can be seen throughout the country.  I readily admit that the progress is not fast enough but we are at least ensuring that the progress we make will make a difference.  There is no doubt that the decision by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to provide free GP care for those under six years or over 70 years is a step in the right direction.  I hope further efforts will be made during the lifetime of this Government to address problems in respect of hospital waiting lists.  I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on their efforts thus far to address the many problems created by the previous Government.  There is understandable criticism about expenditure on health services but that is not the fault of the Minister or the Minister of State, who are trying to rectify the problems created for them.  I believe the HSE, working with representative bodies of medical professionals and the Department of Health, will improve to the point where it matches the best in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1062" speakername="James Bannon" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600012#K00200"><p>It is regrettable that Deputy Keaveney is no longer in the Chamber because I have a list of quotes by him consisting of criticisms of Fianna F&aacute;il's health policies dating from the period when he was on this side of the House.  Rather than rehearse the quotes in his absence, I will leave them for another day.</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome this Bill, which commences the second phase of the introduction of a universal GP service in Ireland, as set out in the programme for Government.  The first phase of this process was the Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides free GP care for children aged under six years. The  Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2015 now seeks to make GP care free at the point of use for all persons aged 70 years and over.  At present, nearly half of the population have access to medical or GP visit cards.  Eligibility in the majority of cases has been determined by a means test.  As a result of eligibility criteria, 36,000 people over the age of 70 were not entitled to a free GP visit card.  Thanks to the actions of this Government and the Minister for Health, everybody aged 70 years or older will have free access to a local GP.</p>  <p>  When it comes to GP care, we are one of the few OECD countries with GP fees.  In a majority of OECD countries, primary care is either free or heavily subsidised for most of the population.  Furthermore, Ireland is the only EU health system that does not offer universal coverage of primary care.  We must also bear in mind that cost is a barrier to someone deciding whether to attend a local GP.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Health, and now Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, was absolutely correct when he stated: "The evidence is clear that people delay or avoid visiting their GP where a fee is required. Removing this cost barrier will ensure citizens will be far more likely to address medical problems".  Removing the cost barrier for 36,000 older people means that older people need no longer delay visiting their GP, thereby enjoying better health while at the same time ensuring health care services will not incur higher costs as a result of a delayed diagnosis.  Therefore there is a significant benefit from improved GP access in terms of health and well-being.</p>  <p>  Nothing will change for any person over 70 years of age who is already entitled to medical cards or GP visit cards.  They will continue to receive all of their medical entitlements as normal.  Attempts by the Opposition to distort this are nothing but cheap politics, although nothing Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in does surprises me anymore.  Throughout this debate I have spoken about the importance of access to GP care and removing the barriers to services.</p><p>This is particularly important in regard to the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar and the HSE's promised commitment to 90 new nursing posts.  While the appointment of a second palliative care consultant in early March was very welcome, I have been made aware of concerns at the hospital that the HSE may row back on its plan to create these badly needed nursing posts.  When I visited the hospital last Saturday, I was told that the accident and emergency and maternity wards are understaffed.  The staff had hoped that the announcement of the new nursing posts would improve the situation in the hospital, yet we are still awaiting confirmation of that news.  Without doubt, this is one of the busiest and best performing hospitals in the country, taking patients from Roscommon, Cavan, Longford, Westmeath and the wider region.  Any row-back on the plan to provide 90 new nursing posts would have a serious effect on staff and morale at the hospital.  Indeed, it would go against the key reforms and progress the Government is trying to make in the health sector.</p> <p> The concerns that have arisen due to the level of overcrowding and pressure on beds in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar provide an opportunity for St. Joseph's care centre in Longford to reduce the problem.  St. Joseph's care centre is a fine example of an excellent care facility that could be more fully utilised.  I wrote to the Minister and spoke to him on this issue.  The standard of care and the quality of staff are excellent.  All of the centre's facilities have been purposely built towards care.  The facility already has a GP out of hours service, a physiotherapy service and a radiology department that is connected to the national IT service.  If this facility was to become a step-down clinic, it would undoubtedly free up acute beds in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  I have spoken to the Minister about this and hope he is positive on this proposal.  I thank him for that and hope he can come up with a solution.</p> <p> To conclude, the Government is upholding its commitment towards establishing a universal GP service for the entire population in line with the programme for Government, but we also need to uphold our short-term commitments and to ensure that the HSE does not row back on its pledge to the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  Economic recklessness in the past has neglected vital health infrastructure and Longford-Westmeath patients suffered as a result.</p></speech>

The Bill is welcome in that regard.  However, this small step serves to highlight the spectacular failure of the Government to honour the promises and commitments it gave to the people in the run-in to the last general election.  The Bill fails also to honour the rhetoric that was screamed from podiums at the demonstrations that took place against the moves by the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to remove medical cards from the elderly.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party joined in the chorus of opposition denouncing those moves by Fianna F&aacute;il, who it seems has now suffered a conversion on the road to Damascus.  I have heard its spokesmen here espousing universal health care and complaining the Government has not gone far enough.  That is a bit rich coming from Fianna F&aacute;il since it was the party that started the attack on universal provision for one cohort, the elderly, during its last reign in government.  Its hypocrisy is apparent.</p>  <p>  Given that the Labour Party and Fine Gael joined in the justified chorus of indignation when Fianna F&aacute;il launched that attack, this Bill falls far short of restoring the situation in terms of health cover for the elderly and far short of the trumpeting of universality it promised in terms of a universal health insurance system and free GP care for everybody.  The programme for Government suggested that free GP care would have to be phased in, but this Bill also runs counter to the priorities the Government set to provide free GP care first of all to those with the greatest medical need, particularly to those with chronic or long-term illness.</p>  <p>  The provision seems fairly arbitrary and random and does not make much sense, notwithstanding that it is a good provision for those who will benefit from it.  The problem with isolating particular groups or cohorts and ensuring a free GP care service for them is that this results in injustices, unfairness and anomalies around the edges of the groups.  For example, what has the Government got against those aged from 65 to 69 years?  They have retired, their income has fallen, but they do not get free GP care.  This is a cohort which quite often has greater medical needs, but has been hit by other cuts inflicted by the Government, including to an income that will fall on retirement.  They also have lost out on household benefit packages and telephone allowances.  Many of these people are also living in areas where property prices are high and will be victims of the property tax.  Often, people on very low incomes must fork out huge amounts in property tax.  This tax bears no relation to their income or ability to pay.  Arguably, this cohort needs free GP care just as much as others, but do not get it.  This is the type of injustice that can arise.  Similarly, a child of six or seven may have a particular need for free GP care, but does not get it.</p>  <p>  This debate offers the opportunity to highlight this failure to deliver on the great rhetoric the Government trumpeted pre the election regarding how it would introduce universality in terms of GP care and health care generally.  Instead, we are getting piecemeal, random, small incremental changes, some of which do not make sense in terms of priorities.  Added to this is the whole debacle regarding discretionary medical cards that the Government rowed back on and the change in income limits for medical cards, which have removed medical cards from many of the elderly.</p><p>It is something and it is better than nothing but it is far short of what was promised nor does it not make a whole lot of sense in terms of priorities.  Even where those who benefit from getting the free GP care that will result from this legislation - they will then be referred to surgery or to hospital - do not have a full medical card they will still face the problem of the costs they may have to bear such as hospital charges and consultant fees.  Very likely they will also face very long waiting list times because of the assault - not just under this Government and the previous Government - of cuts to the health budget, the significant number of beds that have been closed, the chronic under-staffing and under-resourcing of the health service generally.  Even where such persons get free GP care and are then referred, they still face all the problems in the rest of the health service.  What this highlights is really the failure of the Government to deliver on the vision of universality and the failure to sort out the mess that is our health service which the Government promised four years ago.  That failure to deliver on the promises and aspirations flows fundamentally from the fact that the Government does not have a plan.  In so far as it has tried to deliver on those promises, its whole vision is based on a flawed model of a mixture of a public and private system.  It has not recognised that the only way to sort our health service is to move away from this mixture of public and private which does not work, is dysfunctional, unfair, inherently about a two-tier system that creates injustices and anomalies, and to grasp the nettle of the need for a national health service.  That is the only way we will resolve this system.  However, the Minister's determination, which one can only describe as an ideological determination, is based on his belief that private health insurance companies or the private sector has some useful role to play in health, when it does not have such a role.  There is no evidence anywhere in the world that relying on the private sector is helpful in terms of delivering a universal health service in a cost-efficient way.  In fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction.  The most notable example of course, being the United States which spends more <i>per capita</i>than any other country in the world on health but about 40% of that expenditure goes into the pockets and the profits of the private health insurance industry, the private sector generally, into unnecessary costs and administration, billing, advertising, all the waste that goes along with a system where the private for-profit sector is involved in trying to deliver something that should be a universal right for all citizens, namely, health care.  It is that failure, that ideological blindness and blinkered attitude of this Government, that is at the back of its failure to deliver on all the promises.<br/><br/>For many people, when they heard the rhetoric of universality prior to the election, what they imagined was precisely a sort of national health service model but they did not really hear the word &quot;insurance&quot;.  The two things directly contradict each other because the universality and a single-tier system go out the window once private for-profit insurance interests or private for-profit health companies or hospitals or whatever it is, are in the mix, because they are in it for the money and not to provide a service to people.<br/><br/>I will not oppose this Bill but it is a very pale shadow of what the Government promised.  It raises as many questions as it answers in terms of the prioritising of health care services to those who need it but the biggest question it raises is whether this Government really has a plan to sort out the mess that is the health service, in order to deliver the universal system, the health care to which every citizen is entitled on the basis of need.  Has the Government a vision and a plan?  More than four years into this Government's term, it is absolutely clear that it does not.  The Minister has more or less admitted this, with universal health insurance being put on hold.  All the talk of the Dutch model has disappeared now because any serious examination of the Dutch model shows very serious problems associated with the cost of health care.  This has all gone out the window and we are left not knowing where we are going but we are left with very serious problems in our health service that this Bill will not address in any serious way, notwithstanding the fact that some people may gain some benefit from it.</p></speech>

The Bill represents the first steps by the Government to introduce a free universal GP service for our citizens, which I warmly welcome.</p>  <p>  This proposed service for the under sixes will be combined with a similar service being offered to people over the age of 70.  From this summer, the Bill will cater for more than 250,000 people who would usually have to pay to see their GPs.  It will cost the State over &euro;67 million to provide this service.  However, this figure will actually help to bring down costs in the health budget, which must be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The commencement of this new GP service will make a real difference to the lives of the youngest and the oldest in our society and for the families who care for them.  I believe that this agreement is a major step forward in improving access to and the quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  It will mean real savings for pensioners and for the families of young children but, as the Minister, Deputy Varadkar has stated, it is about much more than that.  These two initiatives are part of the Government's wider plan to enhance the primary care system in this country, while also achieving real savings in the health budget.  Removing the cost barrier and allowing all children and elderly people free access to a GP means earlier diagnosis which is more beneficial for families and patients alike.  This service will also make our health service more economical in the long term as it will keep more people out of our hospitals, thus reducing the pressure on beds.  It will oversee the beginning of the process of pumping money back into the general practice system once again.  This is an important aspect which has resulted in the support for the Bill from the IMO.</p>  <p>  This new enhanced GP service covers all children under six and people over 70, including those who already have medical cards.  However, along with providing a free GP service, it will also include age-based preventative medical checks focusing on the health and well-being of the patient and the prevention of disease before it occurs.</p><p>The proposed new system also includes an agreed cycle of care for asthma patients, in which GPs will carry out annual reviews of a patient's symptoms in order to gauge the development of the disorder.</p> <p> Approximately 50,000 people with a medical card or a GP visit card are expected to further benefit from the type 2 diabetes care plan, under which those who hold a medical card or a GP-only card will be entitled to two visits a year to their GP.  That means that they will have their condition managed by the GP who knows them personally, rather than in a hospital clinic, which is preferable to the patient in most cases.</p> <p> GPs play a crucial role.  They act as a gateway to the entire health system.  The patient-centred GP approach guides the patient through the referral process and into the health care system.  It is widely considered that a well developed system of primary care has beneficial effects on the health care system as a whole.  The Bill ultimately seeks to improve the role of the GP.  It is important to note that, even when the national economy was in a healthy position, a universal, patient-oriented GP service such as has been initiated in the Bill was never considered important enough for consideration by previous Governments.  The fact that it is being introduced now, as we emerge from one of the most difficult economic crises in our history, shows the Government's commitment to reforming the health service and improving the quality of care provided for patients.</p> <p> I am fully supportive of the proposed legislation.  As legislators, w must stand up for the most vulnerable in society.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the Bill and call on Members on all sides of the House to put party principles aside and support it.  It has taken a great deal of time and effort to get it onto the floor of the House.  I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar; the representatives of the GPs who have agreed to the proposals and officials at the Department of Health for the work put into the Bill to get it this far.  I look forward to its speedy implementation.</p></speech>

This is a major step forward that will deliver huge savings for families and pensioners and help to promote health and well-being throughout the population.  People over 70 years who currently have to pay to see their GP will now be able to access the free service.  This is the latest phase in the overall plan to provide free GP care for all citizens.  The Government is making progress with plans to roll out free GP care to children under six years.  The reason these two groups of citizens are having free GP care services extended to them first is the youngest and oldest members of society have the greatest need for health care services.  It is intended that the legislation will be put in place this year and for the service to be introduced alongside the free GP service for children under the age of six years.  Free GP care is a fulfilment of the Government's commitment to the introduction of a universal GP service for the entire population on a phased basis.  I am pleased to see it is being implemented gradually.</p>  <p>  From this summer, up to 300,000 children and senior citizens who currently have to pay to see their GP will no longer have to do so.  That is a big step forward in how people across the country, particularly the youngest in society, avail of health care services.  Some 240,000 children will be able to benefit from this new development when it takes effect.  That will mean real savings for pensioners and families, but it is about much more than this.  The new enhanced service covers all children aged under six years, including those who have medical cards already.  They will benefit from the management of asthma in general practice and preventive wellness checks.  Adults of all ages will benefit from the new diabetes programme, meaning that they will have their condition managed by the GP who knows them, rather than in a hospital clinic.  </p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, an additional 240,000 children under six years will benefit from free GP care at the point of service.  All children under six years will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract which will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged two years and again at age five, in accordance with the agreed protocol.  The contract will also include an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, in which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.</p>  <p>  The extension of free GP care at the point of service to everyone aged 70 years and over who does not currently qualify for this benefit will take effect at the same time as the under-six service.  This service will benefit approximately 36,000 new patients and be provided under the existing contractual arrangements for this age cohort.</p>  <p>  The negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have also resulted in an agreement on the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care.  This will enable patients with a medical card or a GP visit card who have type 2 diabetes to avail of two annual visits to their GP practice for a structured review of their condition.  This service will begin in quarter 4 of this year.  This initiative will help to integrate care across the continuum of care, improve clinical outcomes for patients and reduce complications often experienced by people with this condition.</p>  <p>  Making health care more affordable has long been an objective of the Labour Party in government and underlines its commitment to enhancing primary health care.  I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for their tenacity in pursuing this project, despite the many barriers they faced along the way.  It is certainly fitting that a Labour Party Minister is delivering such a meaningful project, in line with our policy of supporting families and ensuring they share in the economic recovery that is now clearly under way.  I warmly commend this legislation to the House.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of advancing anything to do with general practitioners.  As I come from a household in which my mother was a nurse and my father, a GP, I understand the role played by the GP in society.  I am very much of the opinion that in an advanced society people should have access to medical care.</p>  <p>  One of the cohorts of people who need access to medical care more than anyone else is the elderly owing to the ailments that go with age.  I welcome the provisions included in the Bill for the over-70s.  A basic GP service should ensure people will feel free to go to a doctor and seek peace of mind that their ailments can be treated accordingly and that they can be sent in the right direction if there is something wrong.  This also gives us an opportunity to welcome the provision of GP cards for children under six years of age.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is present in the House.  The previous Minister, Deputy James Reilly, was also an advocate of free GP care.  Members of both Government parties espouse a policy of universal health care, which is a long-held belief within the Labour Party and Fine Gael has endorsed the same ideology.  The intention is to introduce the system incrementally.</p>  <p>  I had the privilege of living in Sweden at one stage.  The capacity to access medical care there spurred my belief in the ideology of social democracy.  A cap was placed on the amount any single individual would pay - the Swedish krona equivalent of approximately &euro;100.  People made a small contribution over the course of five to eight visits to their doctor, after which it was considered the medical condition warranted access to medical care on a continuous basis and they did not have to pay any more once the cap had been reached.  The premise is that when a person pays a little towards the cost, he or she takes ownership of the process and also demands more of the service.  However, people only access the system when they need it.  The amount of money involved was not particularly onerous.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to people about how medical practice in Ireland has changed in the past 20 years.  There is a perception that sometimes people with medical cards routinely abuse the system of access to GPs and medical facilities.</p><p>There needs to be honesty and clarity but the abuse of the system needs to be eradicated.  We have limited services and need to provide them in a way that is meaningful for the individual and for the GP whose time is needed by a wide cohort of people, particularly in areas that are geographically challenged.  Some GPs say that medical practices are becoming unviable in areas where the State subsidy is not enough.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  I have met with individual GPs, with their new organisation and the IMO.  We need to safeguard access to primary care in rural constituencies.  In future areas of a 25 or 30 mile radius may not have GPs.  That is daunting for citizens in those areas and for GPs who want to retire but feel they need to stay as long as possible to provide the services to these people.</p> <p> I admire many aspects of this Bill, particularly the access to primary health care for people over the age of 70 and that their dependants can get a GP medical card.  The financial parameters are quite generous, set at an income of &euro;700 per week for a single person and for a married or cohabiting couple, or civil partners, the dependant over the age of 70 will qualify if their combined income does not exceed &euro;1,400 per week.</p> <p> I would like to see more compulsion for GP cards for children under the age of six.  If in areas where GPs can have a monopoly of services they do not opt in it will cause people a great deal of hardship because they need access to a GP personally and will not want to take their kids to another place.  As a father of two young children I can see the need for this.  There is nothing more frightening for parents who are financially strapped than to need to access medical services for sick children.  The generation having children now is the hardest hit by the economic downturn, being in negative equity and making mortgage repayments.  Some live in apartments and aspire to progress to houses in the natural way for families.  This is a way of giving them and their children a break.</p> <p> This Bill, however, concerns people aged over 70.  It is a step in the right direction.  The Government will try to encompass all of society in the system over time.  The role of GPs in society cannot be underestimated.  The easiest way to get elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is to be a GP.  There are not too many people who give out about the medical profession because they need it when they are sick.  There is nothing more salient to people&rsquo;s being than their health.  I admire the profession greatly for the services it provides.  It is well remunerated but we must admire it.  This is a good Bill.  It represents an advance and I hope we can make further progress in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600016#O00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I thank the Minister for Health for being present for the debate.  I want to declare an interest because I have two children under the age of six who may potentially avail of the medical card.  I spoke about one last year, as he was coming up to five years of age in September and I asked would he get the card.  It is coming close to the wire.</p>  <p>  When the Minister is responding I would like him to clarify what will happen in rural areas, of which there are many in the west, where there is a single GP practice that decides not to go into this scheme?  It is even very hard to get GPs when one retires in these areas.  The suggestion has been made that the patient can move to another GP but if that GP is 40 or 50 miles away that is not much good to the family or the community.  How do we address that problem in isolated rural communities?  In my new constituency of Roscommon-Galway, just over 8,000 children will be able to avail of these medical cards, which is welcome for those families.  What happens to the six year old who has a chronic ongoing condition, which imposes a significant financial burden on the family?  Initially we were told this would be phased in for children, that it would start with those under the age of six and progress to include those in primary school and on up to the age of 18.  In the revised programme for Government, however, it is being provided to those over the age of 70, who have in excess of &euro;36,400 per annum, plus potentially another &euro;36,000 in the bank.  Is this a good use of limited funds, to spend an additional &euro;12 million in providing a free GP card for some of the most affluent individuals in this State, ahead of children aged between six and eight who have chronic ongoing illnesses which place a huge financial burden on their families?  That is wrong.  Compare that with a family with two children, one of whom is sick, who earn half of the &euro;700 a week threshold applied to the people aged over 70.  If it earns over &euro;350 a week it is over the income limit for a medical card.  That family will sweat blood and tears to try to get a medical card to have free access to a GP.</p>  <p>  A woman came into my clinic on Monday morning who has recently been diagnosed with cancer.  I sympathised with her, not because of her diagnosis, which is a huge burden that she and her family must deal with but because of the horrendous experience she will have with the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, based in Finglas, to be granted a medical card.  Sadly, her family is over the income threshold for a medical card.  She will get a medical card at the end of this protracted process, three to five months down the road, but she has started chemotherapy and will be quite sick in the next couple of weeks.  The last thing she needs is letter after letter coming from Finglas asking her to justify her request for a medical card because she happens to be on chemotherapy and receiving treatment.  That is wrong.  Most individuals in that situation would throw in the towel.  They are too sick to have to deal with this on an ongoing basis, having to send back information, then be told there is something else missing, that their payslips are outside the three month limit and that they have not provided clarity that they are sick and no longer in work and may have a reduced income.</p><p>They have an additional cost not only of having to deal with the loss in income, but also of having to travel.  That is because we have developed centres of excellence, particularly for cancer, but for all other services as well.  If a person does not drive and is unfortunate enough to live in County Roscommon, it will cost &euro;150 to get to see a consultant in Galway.  Such a person cannot use public transport, so they must pay a minimum of &euro;150 for a taxi from any part of County Roscommon to Galway city to see a consultant and receive medical treatment.  </p> <p> In theory, the medical card section is supposed to take that into account.  I have been reassured on numerous occasions that the cost of transport to medical appointments is taken into account, but I have yet to see any evidence of it.  I will cite an example of a recent case I dealt with.  It concerned a young woman who attends her GP 20 times per annum.  She is also attending an endocrinologist in Galway monthly, and a gastroenterologist annually in Ballinasloe.  She also attends for audiology appointments six times a year in Galway, and the gynaecology department in Ballinasloe three times a month.  In addition, she is attending a fertility clinic in Galway every eight weeks and is forking out &euro;285 a time for that.  She is also attending a migraine clinic in Ballinasloe quarterly and is receiving monthly bereavement counselling.  She is also attending the breast clinic in Galway ten times a year, as well as awaiting a neurology appointment and one other appointment.  </p> <p> That woman cannot access public transport and does not drive.  Her husband has to take time off work so that she can attend those appointments.  Based on that, she has been given an allowance for health expenses of the princely sum of &euro;11.54 a week.  The allowance for prescribed medicines and appliances is &euro;33.23 a week, which is the drug payment cap of &euro;144 per month.  She is also getting an allowance for hospital charges of &euro;14.42 a week, which is the hospital cap of &euro;750 a year.  </p> <p> In that case, absolutely no recognition is being given to the cost of attending those appointments or the cost of her husband having to take time off work so she can attend them.  Even though we have sent detailed information to the HSE's medical card section in Finglas, it says that the original decision stands.  We have also gone to the appeals office, yet it is giving the woman no hearing whatsoever because the rules, as set out, give no recognition for additional costs associated with transport.  </p> <p> Apart from that particular case I can give the Minister numerous other examples.  I know of an individual living in Galway city who is being treated in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin.  They get an allowance of &euro;11.54 per week for health expenses and &euro;33.23 per week for prescribed medicines and appliances.  I also know of another patient in Galway city who is being treated in Galway University Hospital with exactly the same allowances.  Can the Minister justify how that woman living in my constituency, who has to travel to the four ends of the country to attend appointments, should receive the same allowance as someone in Galway city who is receiving care there?  What about someone in Galway city who has to travel across the country to get treatment at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin?  Where is the equality in that?  </p> <p> Time and time again, I have been told by the HSE's medical card section that it recognises geographical considerations when people must travel to appointments.  That is not happening, however, and people are being discriminated against geographically as regards medical cards.  That is based on the fact that they happen to live in a rural area and can no longer access social welfare support to pay for the cost of a taxi to Galway city.  Social welfare will not entertain that cost whatsoever.  Consultants are not prepared to leave Galway city and carry out appointments in local hospitals, which would save such costs.  The hospitals say it is not their problem how people get to appointments.  They have no funds for that, so it is up to people to get there.</p> <p> Is it any wonder that people are missing hospital appointments or struggling to cope with the costs of diagnosing chronic conditions, including cancer, when all these additional costs are not being recognised?  One person might live in Galway city and can therefore access cancer treatment nearby via public transport, while another person might live in Arigna and has to pay over &euro;200 for a taxi to Galway city, but it makes no difference as far as the HSE's medical card section is concerned.  That is wrong and it should not happen.  We were told that it was not happening, but I have the documentary evidence that it is occurring daily.  That system needs to be changed without delay because people are being wrongly discriminated against based on where they live.</p> <p> I want to ask the Minister about figures for the over-70s.  Speaking in the Seanad last November, the Minister said that about 10,000 people over the age of 70 would get GP cards.  In the briefing we got on this Bill, however, a figure of 36,000 was mentioned.  Can the Minister explain the change that has taken place since his speech in the Seanad last November when he said an additional 10,000 GP cards would be issued?  Now he says that 36,000 such cards will be issued.  Does the Minister have any idea of exactly how many cards will be issued?</p> <p> There is a welcome provision in the Bill for a new cohort of people who move in with a grandmother.  If someone is a qualifying dependant who is not married to the person over 70, but is living with them, they can apply for a medical card based on having an income of less than &euro;700 per week.  This seems to be a new provision that has been included, and it is probably welcome because it will encourage young people who are not eligible under the existing medical card scheme to move in with a grandmother.  They will thus become a dependant of their grandmother and on foot of that will be eligible for a medical card based on the higher threshold of &euro;700.  It will encourage people to move in with their grandparents, but what sort of a handle has the Minister put on the figures involved?</p> <p> I would like the Minister to clarify the income threshold for a medical card.  There is provision in this legislation for the over-70s medical card whereby the income threshold can be increased in line with inflation.  Yet for the standard medical card the income threshold for a single person is &euro;184 per week, which is less than the basic social welfare rate of &euro;188.  Anyone earning the social welfare rate who is trying to go out to work will be denied a medical card, but if they sign on for the jobseeker's allowance they will get a medical card, even though they have the same income.  If a person is slightly over the social welfare income, they will not get a card at all.  That is because the income thresholds have not kept in line with inflation or even with social welfare increases over the years.</p> <p> Surely it is an anomaly within the system whereby we are discriminating against those who want to work but cannot hold onto their medical card.  They cannot keep the medical card because when they go over the income threshold the card is withdrawn.  It is a barrier for people who try to get off the live register and work.   That issue needs to be examined urgently.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>One other issue I want to raise concerns the same section in the Bill.  There is a provision in it where compensation payments under the hepatitis C tribunal and the Residential Institutions Redress Board are disregarded for the means assessment.  That is very welcome but there is another small cohort of people of whom the HSE and child care services have been grossly negligent as regards protecting children under the age of 18.  After their 18th birthdays the HSE has paid out significant amounts of money in compensation because of the gross neglect, yet they are being penalised in the means assessment as regards both the medical card and social welfare.  There is no recognition of that in the legislation.</p></speech>

There was apparently a meeting yesterday with Dublin City Council and, to quote one of the Simon staff, one could see the whites of their eyes at the extent of the crisis and the lack of response in terms of short-term measures.  The Simon Community has said it has never been as bad in Dublin and that the number of homeless families is at the highest level in our history.  There are more than 800 children in emergency hotel and hostel accommodation and I understand that we are beginning to run out of hotel accommodation as well.  This whole situation has been made much worse by the cuts the T&aacute;naiste has made to the rent allowance and also by the elimination of the mortgage interest supplement.  This comes at a time when rents have risen up to 15% or 20% in urban areas.  People are being squeezed out of accommodation because they cannot afford it even when they have employment.</p>  <p>  We asked the T&aacute;naiste six months ago to reverse the cuts to rent allowance.  If this had been done it would have eased the situation somewhat.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of the particular difficulties concerning the availability of emergency accommodation, particularly here in Dublin?  Will she confirm to the House that she will immediately reverse the cuts to rent allowance and to the rent allowance caps to ensure that people can afford to house themselves?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, before Christmas, in conjunction with all of the agencies and indeed with most of the political parties, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, moved a series of special measures to deal with the situation which have been very favourably received - initiatives like the night caf&eacute; and the transport arrangements for people who are out on the street.</p>  <p>  As regards the budget, the Deputy will remember from when he was in government that his party managed to destroy the building industry through a bubble and the core of the problem now is a build-up of a shortage of houses for different sizes of families and households.  Slowly but surely, following what Fianna F&aacute;il did to the building industry and the 330,000 people who lost their jobs as a result of what it did, we are now in a situation where the supply of housing is increasing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is wrong in his reference to rent supplement.  If he had been here in the House when I spoke about this on a number of occasions, he would know that we have introduced a protocol in conjunction with organisations like Threshold, Simon and other bodies who are assisting people who have difficulty with housing.  What we are doing now is what should have always been done.  We are actually dealing with cases on a case-by-case basis because to simply raise and increase all rent levels, as Fianna F&aacute;il seems to be implying, would be to drive up rent levels for people at work and for students enormously.  What we are doing under the protocol is providing for negotiated increases for any individual or family in need of help in sustaining their rent supplement.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this year we have negotiated 4,000 new rent supplement tenancies through the Department of Social Protection.  What we have also done is deal at this point in time with a couple of hundred cases of people who came to the community welfare service.  I invite people to go to the community welfare service to avail of the protocol so that a detailed arrangement can be put in place.  In that respect, the community welfare service officers have total discretion in negotiating higher rents and an agreed rent if that is an appropriate solution for helping people to hold on to a tenancy.</p>  <p>  With the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, we are also looking at the issue of seeking to provide levels of rent certainty for tenants renting privately and through rent supplement.  The Minister is looking at that at the moment.</p></speech>

The total allocation for housing this year is &euro;680 million, which is down from the &euro;805 million we provided the year the T&aacute;naiste came into government.  That is a cut of &euro;190 million.  It is time we realised there is a crisis which will only be resolved by providing accommodation and making it affordable.  The Government made the choice in the budget last year to reduce the top rate of tax rather than to deal with a greater, more urgent necessity, which is the homelessness crisis.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste what the Government is going to do in the short term for the people who are in emergency accommodation and do not know where they are going to sleep.  We will wind up in a situation in which people are sleeping in cars.  It seems the Government benches think that is a laughing matter.</p></speech>

What the Government did before Christmas, to much praise from some of the organisations to which the Deputy has referred, was initiate an emergency response over a number of areas.  While that seems to have passed Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v by, it has been widely written about as being very successful.  However, it is not a long-term solution.  The long-term solution to homelessness and housing difficulties is to build more houses.  Unfortunately, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, it crashed the building industry.  We are now slowly rebuilding it to get homes for families and homes for people.  Already this year, we have devoted in the budget for 2015 and over the next three years the largest amount ever devoted to a house building programme in the history of the State.  The Deputy will know that local authorities all over the country have received significant allocations to build social houses as well as builders in the private sector developing and building affordable houses.  While that obviously has passed Fianna F&aacute;il by, it is actually the way to solve the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  What we are doing on rent supplement, which the Deputy will remember from his time as a Minister, is providing that when people go back to work, they go off rent supplement.  We have now got unemployment down to just 10%.  When we came into office, we inherited an unemployment rate of nearly 15% from Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  The numbers of people on rent supplement is going down for two reasons: the numbers of people going back to work, which is a great credit to them and a great development and recovery for the country, and because we have developed the housing assistance payment.  We are slowly but surely moving very large numbers of people and the budget that goes with that to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government where the rent supplement of old will be handled by local authorities.  The value of that will be that, as with a council house rental, the adult family members involved will not be inhibited from going out to work.  We want everybody in the country to be able to get back to work.  Thankfully, we are now putting builders back to work.  The construction workers whose jobs Fianna F&aacute;il destroyed will build the homes that families need.</p></speech>

Across the State, over 30,000 lone parents are receiving letters from her Department.  As their youngest children turn seven, they are being taken off the one-parent family payment with the result that thousands will see their weekly incomes fall.  Of these parents, 6,400 are set to lose up to &euro;36.50 per week while an unknown number of working parents will lose as much as &euro;87 per week.  These are real people who are struggling to get by, yet the T&aacute;naiste is pushing them into poverty.</p>  <p>  Let me tell the T&aacute;naiste about Mandy.  Mandy is the parent of three children whose partner died a number of years ago.  She works in a low-paid job and receives the one-parent family payment.  She is not eligible for the family income supplement because she only gets 14 hours work per week.  She has asked her employer for more hours, but has been refused.  Last week, Mandy received written confirmation that, as her son has turned seven, she will be moved to jobseeker's allowance in July.  As a result, her weekly income will be cut by &euro;87, which is a 20% drop.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that when she introduced this change in 2012, she said it was dependant on there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place similar to what is found in Scandinavian countries.  Does the T&aacute;naiste remember saying that?  She said she would only proceed with these measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that she got a credible and bankable commitment of such a system of child care by the time of the budget.  She said that if that was not forthcoming, the measure would not proceed.</p>  <p>  There is no Scandinavian child care system available to Mandy or the thousands of other lone parents whose incomes the T&aacute;naiste is going to cut this July.  Why is the T&aacute;naiste punishing Mandy and thousands of parents like her?  Why is the T&aacute;naiste forcing her three children and many other children into poverty?  Why is the T&aacute;naiste taking money from the pockets and food from the tables of some of the poorest families in the State?  In light of her Government's failure to deliver a Scandinavian child care system, will the T&aacute;naiste honour her commitment of 2012 not to proceed with the cuts to the one-parent family payment?</p></speech>

In the North, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, when the youngest child reaches five years of age, a person parenting alone is encouraged to take up a range of options, including education, training and work experience, with a view to helping that parent to get employment.  While our social welfare system and payments are very much higher than those that Sinn F&eacute;in pays in government in the North, the critical thing for families parenting on their own is to ensure that as the children get older, the mother, in particular, or a father parenting alone, has the opportunity to get back into work, education and training.</p>  <p>  In relation to lone parents who are already working, I note that we are in contact with employers through the Labour Market Council to improve their hours.  In that regard, the Deputy can give us the details of the case she raises.</p><p>If, as the Deputy says, her hours go from 14 hours to 19 hours, depending on the particular circumstances, she will come out with somewhere between an extra &euro;50 and &euro;150 per week in terms of family income supplement.  That is the outcome we want to see.  Some 13,000 one parent families have already transitioned to the jobseeker's transitional arrangement.  The Deputy said that she would go on to the jobseeker's arrangement.   That is not correct.  She will go on to the jobseeker's transitional payment-----  </p></speech>

The Construction Industry Federation published a statement this week about the threat posed by skill shortages to the growth potential of a number of sectors.  The Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland has also expressed concern about the failure of State-funded apprenticeships and training courses to meet demand in its sector.  The car business has raised concerns about the lack of mechanics, qualified technicians and skilled personnel.  That sector is experiencing a considerable recovery and seeing significant growth in employment opportunities, but car dealers have had to seek to employ people from abroad to fill vacancies.  According to the motoring executive, an extra 4,500 people have been employed in the sector in the recent past and there is the potential to create a further 5,000 jobs during the next few years.  In County Kerry a couple of firms that recently sought to fill vacancies for qualified welders and fabricators failed to fill them.  One firm needs up to 40 highly skilled welders, but regrettably the agencies are not providing suitably qualified people to fill such positions.  The quality of training has been substandard.  We, therefore, need to up the tempo, as the quality of training has not been in line with industry's needs.  For example, there is a major shortfall in various categories of chef and in-house worker in the hospitality and hotel industries, respectively.  We are falling far short of meeting such needs adequately.</p></speech>

Why is the Government being so unresponsive to the needs of industry by not offering courses relevant to the jobs market?  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the pick-up in the housing sector, but surely it is apparent that we are not meeting requirements for plasterers, carpenters, bricklayers, painters and decorators.  Where are the incentives for employers to provide meaningful training for potential staff?  I can see none, to be honest.</p>  <p>  Recently, the National Youth Council of Ireland commented on the JobBridge programme.  People do not feel like they are a part of productive teams.  In many cases, they believe they are being used.  The programme should be revamped.  As the economy grows, surely we should be providing high quality and well trained interns and apprentices and allowing young people to contribute to the good news stories about the pick-up in the economy.</p></speech>

The arrangements for helping people to find work have changed significantly.  First, I am delighted to say apprenticeships have restarted, including in the wet trades in the construction industry.  I met the CIF on a number of occasions in recent times to talk about the need to get the system of apprenticeships in Ireland under a revamped model going again.  The Deputy may have seen that in recent times the ESB, Irish Rail, the OPW, Bord G&aacute;is, eircom and a number of other major companies have all restarted apprenticeships, including in the skilled areas he mentioned.  What is important is that we continue to build on this.  The newly reformed Apprenticeship Council of Ireland has issued a request to interested persons, industries and businesses to bring forward proposals for additional apprenticeships and traineeships not covered by traditional apprenticeship skills.  In countries such as Germany and Austria, for instance, the latter being a small country like Ireland, there is a range of apprenticeships available in retail to banking, administration and different areas of the technology sector.  The model is extremely well developed.</p>  <p>  I regularly meet people from industries in Ireland.  We also have in the Department of Social Protection a labour market council of key employers.  We will shortly move to an account management system of key staff in the Department who will connect directly with the 500 biggest employers in Ireland with a view to ensuring some of the vacancies that arise to be filled can be targeted and filled by persons on the live register.  If we need to provide additional training or specific training to help them to fill those jobs, we are doing so.  If the Deputy has a specific example in mind in County Kerry or the south west, I would be happy through the local Intreo office-----</p></speech>

However, there has been a problem for a long time in towns such as Tralee where there are many young men not working.  What Deputy Tom Fleming is saying about the construction industry is correct.  We need to ensure as many of these young men as possible have an opportunity, if that is their wish, to be involved in the construction business as it returns.  That is a choice many of them want to make.</p>  <p>  We are revamping apprenticeships.  Just last week, as the Deputy probably knows, the OPW opened a special apprenticeship training course in County Kerry covering traditional but very important skills such as stonemasonry and other specialist construction skills.  The Deputy may actually have attended its launch.</p></speech>

If we take into account the thousands who have been forced to emigrate, the figure would be well over 30%, which is unacceptable as we are letting down a large cohort.  This represents a major potential long-term loss to society.  We must acknowledge that young people are our greatest resource.  Every effort should be made to facilitate and channel them into training courses that properly meet the demands of industry.  This will involve upskilling and reskilling to respond to the needs of the economy in general.  We must also provide incentives and encouragement for the many emigrants we have lost in order to attract them back to Ireland.  The experience they have gained will be valuable for the country's future.  If we do not develop the right skills, employers will begin to question why they have set up shop in this country.  This is already happening and in vogue.  It is apparent that we must boost the number of people with intermediate skills, as opposed to those with university degrees, if we are to fill the gaps in the labour market and provide good and sustainable jobs for the long-term unemployed.  Co-ordination and cohesion are required between, for example, the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.</p><p>I am sure they are working together, but this must be brought to a higher level, to include, in addition, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  There is a huge shortfall in the number of computer programmers in this country.  The courses in universities are not adequate to meet the demands of modern industry, with outdated technologies and so on being taught.  We need to get our act together and ensure we produce graduates who are able to avail of sustainable job opportunities.</p></speech>

There are a lot of IT-type industries and technologically-based service businesses which will be attracted to Kerry.  The chambers of commerce in the county, including the Tralee chamber, members of which I met with recently in the town, have very ambitious plans and are working with IDA Ireland to achieve them.  The latter now has regional officers in place, rather than having people from Dublin coming down occasionally.  The regional officers are there to attract industrial, business and commercial development and foreign direct investment into areas like Kerry and the regions in general.</p>  <p>  Another important aspect of our work in this area is our use of the embassy network, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to make contact with the emigrants, many of whom are very young, who went abroad when times were difficult.  Now, having worked abroad, they could well fill the vacancies that have arisen here in a context where some areas are actually experiencing a skills shortage.  All along the western seaboard, we are seeking to engage with people who emigrated but now want to return home.  This is a very important part of public policy.  Emigrants are beginning to return home in significant numbers and recruitment companies are focusing very specifically on them.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Arthur Spring, has been involved in a number of Kerry-based initiatives to draw foreign direct investment into the county, build on what is there already, and develop the Kerry Technology Park and the Institute of Technology, Tralee so as to have a complementary development of courses at both technician and graduate level.  In regard to apprenticeships, I certainly hope we will see, under the education and training boards and with the support of SOLAS, an increase in the number of apprenticeships across the country.  For the 20% or so of our young people who do not want to go down the third level route directly, apprenticeships, traineeships and work experience are a very valuable way of getting them into employment.  It is greatly to be welcomed that youth unemployment has fallen very significantly nationally.</p></speech>

We send our sympathy and solidarity to the family at this dreadful time for them.</p>  <p>  My question relates to the water services Bill.

When will that legislation be published and when will it be brought before the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

In the meantime Members of this House have recently met the groups of unions representing Bord na M&oacute;na workers who now find themselves in a position where their terms of employment are under threat by a company that is profit-making, a company the management of which is no doubt emboldened by what it sees happening in Dunnes Stores.

It will make it an offence for a person to send or cause to be sent by means of public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or menacing in character.  </p><p>The background to the Bill is the report of the Internet content advisory group, chaired by Dr. Brian O'Neill of DIT, which considered the regulatory and legislative framework for, and policy responses to, issues of Internet content governance, specifically in regard to online abuse and the accessing of potentially harmful content.  The expert group reported to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in May 2014 and made altogether some 30 recommendations for action by different Departments of Government. </p><p>In this Bill I am addressing a gap in the legislation in that the Communications Regulations (Amendment) Act 2007 addressed messages by telephone only, excluding electronic communications or social media.  The O'Neill group recommended that the 2007 Act be amended to include all electronic communications within the ambit of the prohibition on the sending of messages which are grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing.  In 2014 the Law Reform Commission agreed with the O'Neill group's recommendation to include electronic communications.  The Bill will close a loophole in the legislation.  It will support victims of abuse and it will strengthen the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with reports of offences.  </p><p>This Bill deals with a net point.  My colleague, Senator Lorraine Higgins, has published a more comprehensive Bill today in respect of online abuse.  I hope that after due consideration Senator Higgins's Bill progresses through the Seanad with all-party support.  I also take this opportunity to urge the Government of the need to respond to the wider recommendations in the O'Neill report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.317" nospeaker="true" time="12:50:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on Wednesday, 15 April 2015That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:

acknowledges the establishment of the Low Pay Commission and the Government&rsquo;s decision to fund research by the University of Limerick into the prevalence and impact of zero-hour and low-hour contracts across both the private and public sectors; and to assess if vulnerable workers have sufficient protection under the law;

notes that:

&mdash; Ireland has a significant low pay problem with almost 12% of workers being at risk of poverty;

&mdash; according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Employment Outlook Report for 2014 Ireland has the second highest percentage of low-paying jobs in the OECD, following the United States which has the highest;

&mdash; the Dunnes Stores dispute brings to the fore the inadequacy of existing legislation to protect vulnerable workers;

&mdash; currently such workers have no guarantee of hours of work; and that an employee may be scheduled for work but is likely to be sent home;

&mdash; such employees are extremely vulnerable to having their working hours reduced;

&mdash; the operation of split shifts whereby the employee&rsquo;s hours of work are broken up across a day or week (for example working 20 hours a week spread across six days, or working 4 hours a day broken into two 2 hour shifts) makes it extremely difficult to make plans, such as provision of child care or school pick-ups, while also making it difficult to complete household budgets because there is no consistency of weekly income;

&mdash; the practice of spreading a short number of hours a week across six days makes it impossible for workers to claim social welfare to boost their low income; and

&mdash; employees often receive very short notice of their working hours schedule;

further notes:

&mdash; existing legal safeguards are inadequate, including section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which requires that where an employee on a zero-hours contract has received no hours then they should be compensated either for 25% of the possible available hours or for 15 hours, whichever is less; and

&mdash; the newly established Low Pay Commission is extremely narrow in focus investigating the minimum wage only;

calls on the Government to introduce legislation to:

&mdash; provide a clear legal entitlement to workers to full-time work;

&mdash; allow workers request banded hours and place a corresponding obligation on the employer to consider the request and permit refusal only in exceptional circumstances which can be objectively justified;

&mdash; require employers to provide information to employees on the overall availability of working hours available in the employment;

&mdash; provide an immediate ban on all zero-hour contracts;

&mdash; task the Central Statistics Office to record the incidence of low-hour contracts as part of the Quarterly National Household Survey;

&mdash; amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, to ensure workers are entitled to be compensated for 100% where they have been called into work;

&mdash; improve the compensatory elements of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to protect employees from penalisation in the form of being &lsquo;zeroed down&rsquo;;

&mdash; provide a statutory entitlement to overtime for hours worked in excess of those stated in the contract or over 38 hours whichever was the lesser;

&mdash; immediately implement in full the EU Directive on Part-time work; and

&mdash; broaden the remit of the Low Pay Commission to deal with specific sectors where low pay is particularly prevalent such as amongst women, younger workers and migrants and to deal with other contributing factors to poverty amongst those employed such as regressive taxation and inadequate public services and State supports; and

further calls on the Government to set a date for the introduction of Collective Bargaining legislation before the summer recess which statutorily compels employers to engage with trade unions; provides for trade union recognition; and has robust anti-victimisation clauses to protect workers from intimidation.

Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:

To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;acknowledges that in steering the country through and out of the economic crisis the Government has focused on protecting the most vulnerable workers, pursued an agenda of maintaining and improving employment rights and reforming and enhancing both the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations legislative framework utilised by workers and employers, and in this regard:&mdash; recognises the legislative changes introduced by the Government to protect workers&rsquo; rights, especially the most vulnerable workers in society, and in particular;

&mdash; to restore the cut in the national minimum wage, thereby reaffirming that a statutory minimum wage is a statement of core values, providing a threshold of decency under which society agrees that workers&rsquo; wages should not fall;

&mdash; through the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, to reinstate the joint labour committee system to support wage setting in sectors where workers are poorly organised and vulnerable, and wages tend to be low; and

&mdash; to enact legislation (the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012) to protect temporary agency workers through a legal framework in which agency workers are afforded equal treatment in respect of their basic working and employment conditions;

&mdash; further recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to pursue an extensive industrial relations and employment rights reform agenda and in this respect notes the progress made, including the following in particular:Low Pay Commission:&mdash; the establishment of the Low Pay Commission earlier this year as an independent body that, taking specified economic and social matters into account, will make annual recommendations to the Government on the national minimum wage and related matters;

&mdash; that establishment of the Low Pay Commission on an interim basis, in advance of legislation to establish the commission on a statutory basis, allows it to proceed urgently with its first review of the national minimum wage;

&mdash; the legislation to be published shortly, with a view to enactment before the summer, will provide that, alongside examining the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act - a work programme will be agreed by the Government and presented to the commission each year;Registered Employment Agreements:&mdash; following on from the Supreme Court judgment in the McGowan case, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to provide a revised legislative framework to replace registered employment agreements, REAs;

&mdash; the legislation will provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises and also provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and pensions for a specified type, class or group of employee as a replacement for the former sectoral REA system;

&mdash; this legislation has completed pre-legislative scrutiny and is due to be published shortly;Collective Bargaining:&mdash; the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to reform the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 to provide for an improved and modernised industrial relations framework that will provide more clarity for employers and ensure that where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining either with a trade union or an internal &lsquo;excepted body&rsquo; the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there is an effective means for a union, on behalf of members in that employment, to have disputed remuneration, terms and conditions assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court, if necessary;

&mdash; the legislation will contain strong anti-victimisation provisions to protect workers who may feel that they are being victimised for exercising their rights under the legislation, including the introduction of interim relief against unfair dismissal;

&mdash; this legislation is due to be published shortly;Study of Zero Hour Contracts and Low-Hours Contracts:&mdash; the University of Limerick has been appointed and has commenced its work on a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees;

&mdash; the study will have a broad scope covering both the public and private sectors with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, health and education sectors;

&mdash; the study will assess current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts;

&mdash; one of the key objectives of the study is to fill the gap in knowledge currently available about the use of such contracts and their impact on employees and to enable the Government to consider any evidence-based policy recommendations deemed necessary on foot of the study;Workplace Relations Reform:&mdash; the Workplace Relations Bill 2014 which is expected to complete its passage through the Oireachtas in May will deliver a significantly streamlined workplace relations service which is fit for purpose, simple to use, independent, effective, impartial and cost-effective; it will provide for more workable and efficient means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period for all users of the service;Organisation of Working Time Act 1997:&mdash; the Government has brought forward, in the Workplace Relations Bill 2014, amendment of the organisation of working time legislation to provide for the accrual of annual leave while absent from work on sick leave, which strikes the right balance between protecting the rights of vulnerable workers who are off work due to illness and the impact on business; andnotes:&mdash; that since the launch of the first action plan for jobs in 2012, 90,000 net new jobs have been created, of which 86% were full-time jobs rather than casual or temporary jobs;

&mdash; that unemployment has fallen from 15.1% in January 2012 and will achieve single digit levels in 2015;

&mdash; that average hourly earnings continue to increase ahead of inflation; and

&mdash; the achievement of accelerating economic growth to 4.8% of GDP in 2014 provides the basis to continue to enhance the well-being of all in our society, particularly the less well off.

As the Minister will be aware on 2 April thousands of workers in Dunnes Stores were forced to take to the picket lines, in the face of extreme bullying and intimidation by Dunnes Stores, in their battle for decent conditions of employment.  This took place against a background where a huge number of these workers are in a very precarious situation as a result of having low-hour contracts.  The hours they are being given are being used as a weapon by management essentially to discipline workers.  Workers with families find themselves in an intolerable position where they do not know from week to week and, sometimes, from day to day what hours they will work, how much they will earn and, consequently, whether they will be able to pay their bills.  The Dunnes Stores workers deserve great tribute for having the courage to go out and fight in the face of intimidation against this intolerable situation imposed by a hugely profitable company that has more than &euro;2 billion turnover.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Since the strike we have seen many workers threatened with having their hours reduced in an outrageous way.  This is just one employer, but it is happening against a background of a chronic low pay issue in this country where 16% of adults whose income is below the poverty line are actually working.  The phenomena of zero hour contracts and the appalling treatment of workers are rampant throughout the economy.  The point made by the workers and their union representatives is that much of the abuse could and should be dealt with by law, with the Government passing laws to make zero hour contracts illegal and to give people certain rights and entitlements in terms of security and minimum hours of employment, as well as transposing European directives in this area which it has failed to do.  I hope it will respond positively to the call of Dunnes Stores workers and the plight of low paid workers who are suffering abuse.</p></speech>

There has since been a successful strike by a majority of Dunnes Stores workers and my description of Dunnes Stores and how the company has behaved has been absolutely vindicated by its response to the strike.  What has happened is outrageous victimisation and retribution against those workers who stood up against low hour contracts, lack of job security, short-term contracts, low pay and the lack of union recognition.  Workers were dismissed within 24 hours of the strike taking place; cuts have been made to the numbers of hours worked that are punitive; workers have been moved from one department to another by way of punishment; and shift pattern changes have been implemented which are designed simply to put people out.  This is outrageous behaviour by Dunnes Stores and it should be condemned by everybody in the House.   The workers should be supported by the public and their union in taking further action to push Dunnes Stores back and show that its behaviour is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  What is happening in Dunnes Stores is symptomatic of the so-called recovery, involving low hour, short-term contracts, low pay and bullying employers.  In many senses, the Dunnes Stores workers are in a better position than other workers because they are unionised.  They have a union that will stand up with them and can take action with their fellow workers.  The problem arises precisely because of the model of recovery pushed by the Government.  That model is pushed by its actions with schemes such as JobBridge, Gateway and First Steps which are driving mandatory, forced labour for young people, in particular, and driving down wages for all.  The Government has created a recovery for the rich, with the richest 300 people here having increased their wealth by over 60% between 2010 and 2014.  If we want a recovery for the majority in the country, we need the kinds of measure outlined in the motion, including a ban on zero hour contracts, full implementation of the EU directive on part-time work, a ban on exclusivity clauses and the right of people to have banded hour contracts based on actual hours worked.  We also need trade union organisation, mandatory trade union recognition and the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act to ensure organisation of workers on the ground in order that such measures will be carried through.</p></speech>

We must register that the tactics of management at Dunnes Stores are, in some ways, an indication of weakness rather than strength.  It is desperate to see off any form of serious organisation of workers and our job has to be to stand alongside the workers.  What we are seeing is a consequence of the erosion of working conditions which has taken place throughout the workforce, not just in Ireland but also in the rest of Europe, whereby employers are using the economic crisis to drive down decent wages and conditions which, we must remember, were never granted in the first place but hard fought for by unions.  The unions must learn the lesson that defending workers' rights requires sacrifice and struggle.  Workers' rights will not be granted by benevolent governments or employers.</p>  <p>  As legislators, we have an obligation to all members of society to do more than is being done in this House.  The correspondence all Members received from the Ryanair pilot group on the exploitation of zero hour contracts in that industry is a shocking warning bell for the establishment.  A full 60% of Ryanair pilots are on zero hour contracts and new pilots have to accept such contracts.  These are people who start their working lives with debts of approximately &euro;100,000 and are working under the pressure exerted by zero hour contracts.  Is this what we really want for those who are flying aeroplanes?  I do not think so.  There are serious implications when people are going to work sick because of a fear of being disciplined and so forth.  </p>  <p>  The Government can legislate for standby pay and honest contracts which deter employers from using zero hour contracts.  Nice words from the Taoiseach are all well and good but people want to see a little action.</p></speech>

Increasingly, we are seeing this in the teaching profession, for example, at primary, post-primary and university level, and it is having a major impact.  There are societal consequences which must be factored in.  The more we see of casualisation and the less we see of work providing a living wage, the more society has to pick up the tab on the other side in terms of the impact of poverty on families, particularly children, and also in terms of the subsidy paid to some employers in order that they can have so-called flexibility.  Flexibility is often portrayed as something positive but, in actual fact, it is a very negative word from the point of view of employees and employment rights.  Casualisation also has implications in terms of having a roof over one's head and the ability to provide for oneself, either by way of renting or purchasing.  It simply will not be possible for many working people to do this.  We are being told that the increase in casualisation will give us a competitive advantage, but it has very negative implications, not just for the individuals in question but also for society in general.  This must be considered in a very serious way because we are storing up serious problems for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600024#W00500"><p>Some weeks ago during Leaders' Questions I raised very serious concerns about the low-paid.  I pointed out that 25% of employees, or 345,000 people in the labour force, were earning an hourly rate less than the living wage threshold of &euro;11.45.  A very significant number of these low-paid workers - 60% - are women.  While the cut in the minimum wage has been reversed, the point I made then was that while everybody wanted to see people coming off the live register and moving into employment, that employment had to allow them to live in dignity.  Otherwise, it is distorting the progress made on the live register.  We have the irony of employed people struggling to pay bills and left with no disposable income when these bills are paid.  This has a knock-on effect on the wider economy.</p>  <p>  I come from a docklands community and, with many others, remember grandfathers and other relatives standing along the quay side every morning waiting to be offered a couple of hours work.  Many of these men were paid in pubs along the quays.  There are elements of that situation to be found in zero hour and low hour contracts.  While they may suit some, for example, students and those who want seasonal work or flexible hours, the vast majority of employees need income certainty, particularly those with mortgages and rent to pay and those with families.  There is absolutely no certainty with zero hour and low hour contracts.  Equally, there is no doubt that they are being abused and taken advantage of by big companies.  While some small companies or those starting off in business do need some leeway, the big companies are getting away with far more than they should in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of temporary contracts and their continuous use in certain sectors.  It is obvious that there are jobs available in these areas, but there is also the continuous use of temporary contracts, with few or no rights for workers.   There are unintended consequences, with people on these contracts not wanting to take part in sports etc. because of a fear of accidents.</p><p> Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do Shinn F&eacute;in toisc go bhfuil deis againn na ceisteanna seo a phl&eacute;.  I acknowledge the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  Before it reports, however, very vulnerable workers will continue to struggle.  I am of the view that the contracts on which they find themselves are nasty remnants of the recession.  If, as the Government states, the recession is over, then these contracts should be brought to an end as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600025#X00200"><p>I wish to share time with Deputies Spring, McFadden, Maloney, Connaughton and Conaghan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this important debate.  The Government takes this matter very seriously.  During the economic crisis it has remained committed to maintaining rights, particularly those which protect the most vulnerable workers in society.  If anything, where changes have been made or where new legislation has been introduced, the Government has improved those rights.  On low pay alone, one of the first actions the Government took was to restore the minimum wage to &euro;8.65 from &euro;7.65, thereby reversing the cut delivered by the previous Government shortly before it left office.  It was important that we did this as one of our first actions in government.</p>  <p>  Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of the Government's agenda and the establishment of the Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments contained in the statement of Government priorities agreed in July of last year.  The commission was set up last February on an interim administrative basis.  Legislation to provide for its establishment on a statutory basis has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny before the relevant committee.  This legislation will be published shortly, with a view to its being enacted very soon thereafter.  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be - on an annual basis - to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the latter will, where necessary, be adjusted incrementally over time, having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.</p>  <p>  Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to its functions under the Act.  A work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the commission in February of each year.  In addition, in the discharging of its function the commission will be required to make recommendations that are evidence based.  It will do so by using a suite of agreed data sets or, where required, it will base such recommendations on bespoke research undertaken at its behest.  The approach to which I refer draws on that adopted in the UK where, since 1997, the recommendations of the UK Low Pay Commission have brought about a progressive increase of the minimum wage which has had little detrimental effect on the functioning of the economy or labour market.  As with its counterpart in the UK, the success of the Low Pay Commission will be measured by its recommendations being accepted and acted upon by successive Governments.</p>  <p>  Work should always pay.  However, the Government is conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair with one which is sustainable and which will allow employers to continue to create quality jobs.  In that context, a particular function of the commission will be to ensure that any advice it offers or recommendations it makes to Government will be evidence based and that agreed data will be utilised in carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives.  In addition, the commission will take written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the national minim wage will have the least adverse impact on employment and competitiveness.  Alongside the work it will carry out in respect of this "hard data", the commission will consult employers and worker who are directly affected by the national minimum wage.  This real-lived experience will be vital for the commissioners when deciding what should be the minimum wage rate.  From an employer and worker perspective, a significant benefit of the Low Pay Commission concept is that national minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and, therefore, where they occur, any adjustments into the future will be incremental and less disruptive for business and will bear no relation to the type of "step changes" witnessed in the past.</p>  <p>  The commission has already commenced its work.  It has sought submissions and is expected to submit its first report by the middle of July.  I look forward to the commission proceeding with its work.  It is important that we should take action in this area and I am glad we are doing so.  There is general support for the concept of the Low Pay Commission.  In my view, the commission will remove politics from the equation.  In the context of people's livelihoods, this issue is too important to ignore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1048" speakername="Arthur Spring" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600025#X00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue, particularly having met many of the Dunnes Stores workers in recent weeks.  This matter is going to affect society on many fronts, not just in terms of work but also in the context of how people lead their lives.  I agree with much of what was said by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Clare Daly and Maureen O'Sullivan.  The Deputies are three women of wisdom.</p>  <p>  In the context of the issue under discussion, we must consider how people are paid and the responsibilities of unions and employers.  In the event that people are not given the opportunity to go to work in a meaningful, purposeful, fair and equitable manner, they will not be encouraged to take up positions in the first instance.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, has a long-standing relationship with the unions in the context of protecting people's rights and ensuring workers' access to fair conditions.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight a couple of issues that are of pertinence to people's lives.  The Dunnes Stores workers with whom I spoke are concerned by the fact that they do not know what will be their working hours in any given week.  This gives rise to uncertainty in the context of child care and certain of the individuals involved are obliged to ask family members to look after their children.  If these people want to put their children into cr&egrave;ches, they must consider whether to book places for five days or whether to proceed on a day-to-day basis.  Of course, booking a place for five days works out cheaper.</p>  <p>  I consulted my local credit union in Tralee in respect of this matter and discovered that when people apply for loans, their credit risk is ultimately determined by their cash-flow and their ability to show that they have secure incomes.  Credit unions offer loans in respect of simple things such as the refurbishment of houses and the purchase of cars.  Ultimately, people who save enough with them can potentially obtain mortgages.  The ability to obtain any of these is forgone by those on zero-hour contracts.  This is despite the fact that many on such contracts may be working for 35 hours each week and obtaining decent incomes.</p>  <p>  Security of tenure is of paramount importance.  Having been present at some of the stores at which picket lines were in place, I could not believe the treatment meted out by the management of Dunnes Stores to staff.  What I witnessed was particularly distasteful and it would appeal to very few citizens.  Those who saw what was happening were not happy with the way Dunnes Stores treated its staff.  The low pay commission has a major role to play in the context of resolving this issue.  I welcome the establishment of the commission and I acknowledge that a great deal of work is being done by the coalition Government in this area.</p>  <p>  There is genuine concern among people regarding the model society is currently pursuing in respect of this matter.  I have heard the heads of State agencies refer to contracts, not just those for individuals in receipt of low pay but also for people on middle and higher incomes.  Such talk is not good for society in general and it does not provide people with either security of tenure, peace of mind or the capacity to progress, particularly in the context of access to housing and loans.  The model of multiple jobs and multiple careers through contracts is not one for which anyone should advocate.  Those whose primary reason for getting out of bed each morning is a low-paid job must be protected.  A previous speaker referred to the fact that students, certain single parents and others require flexibility.  However, this must not be facilitated to the detriment of society overall or workers in general.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight a couple of positive aspects to this matter.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy English, who indicated that when it took office, the Government acted immediately in order to protect people with incomes at the lower end of the scale.  The decision to reverse the cut in the national minimum wage and increase it from &euro;7.65 to &euro;8.65 was made by the Government, not the Opposition.  Some 410,000 low-paid workers have been removed from the universal social charge net.  This was a development we brought about; it was not brought about by the Opposition.  Ironically, the Opposition voted against the proposal.  Recent increases in employment have come in the form of full-time rather than part-time jobs.  I acknowledge that some of these jobs are contract based but 86% of the growth in jobs in the past two years has come about in the area of full-time employment.</p>  <p>  What Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to achieve by means of the motion is largely correct.  However, it should seek to deliver some of the same medicine in the North of Ireland.  I found it very difficult to listen to the vehement and nasty comments uttered by those in Sinn F&eacute;in about the Labour Party's performance in government.  There is a contradiction in their discussing the protection of people when members of the IRA, who are also members of Sinn F&eacute;in, did not do a great deal in the past to protect those who were the victims of paedophiles and rapists.  As already stated, it can be difficult to listen to some of what those in Sinn F&eacute;in have to say.</p></speech>

At the launch of the Low Pay Commission in February, the Taoiseach outlined data which indicate that 9% of families in which the head of household is at work are classified as consistently poor.  I agree with him that such a situation is morally unacceptable and economically unwise.  Fine Gael believes, however, that gainful employment is the only sustainable route out of poverty.  Work should pay more than welfare and no household with a person in full-time work should be poor.  Unfortunately, that is not always the case.</p> <p> The low pay commission has been established to advise the Government on an appropriate rate for the national minimum wage on an annual basis.  This was a specific commitment outlined by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste when they made the Government's statements of priorities last year.  The current national minimum wage of &euro;8.65 was last increased in July 2011 when the Labour Party-Fine Gael coalition reversed the cut of &euro;1 imposed by the previous Government.  I welcome that the commission's membership will include people who possess a deep understanding of the interests of low paid workers.  Equally, the Government will seek to protect existing jobs by examining measures to mitigate the impact any changes might have on small businesses and employers.  This Government is committed to introducing measures to support low paid workers.  This is why hundreds of thousands of low paid workers have been taken out of the USC charges imposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p> <p> Other challenges remain, however.  We are all aware that Dunnes Stores workers have taken to the streets to fight their corner.  I welcome that University of Limerick has been appointed to carry out a study of zero hour and low hour contracts.  I hope the results of this study prove beneficial to workers, including my good friends in Dunnes Stores in Athlone who provide a service to their company and customers that is second to none.  Their treatment by Dunnes Stores has been disgusting.</p> <p> The Minister outlined the range of initiatives already introduced by this Government to improve the pay and conditions of workers.  The hard work is paying off.  We have moved from a position where the country was on the verge of economic collapse to one where the economy has been stabilised and is now growing.  Did anyone think the unemployment rate would have fallen to single digits by the end of 2015?  From an economic point of view, every person who leaves the live register for employment saves the Exchequer &euro;20,000 per year in reduced social welfare expenditure and increased tax revenue.  This is a self-reinforcing cycle of economic benefits.  Employment is the Government's top priority.  In the two and a half years since the Government launched the action plan for jobs, we have put in place a range of measures to support job creation.  Successive budgets have introduced measures aimed at avoiding job killing income tax increases and the most recent budget took the first steps to reducing the income tax burden on ordinary workers, which will help to create further jobs.  The pathways to work strategy has also had a major impact on long-term unemployment by ensuring that job vacancies are filled by unemployed people.  While too many people remain out of work, I commend the Government for rescuing our economy and building confidence in growing the economy, creating jobs and reducing unemployment.  This will ultimately create a better country for all of us.</p></speech>

We should spend more time debating these kinds of social issues, which principally affect those on low pay or with no job.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion for that reason.  Those of us with lifelong involvement in the labour movement welcome support on these issues irrespective of whether it comes from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il.  Some of the contributions by Sinn F&eacute;in Members were very good, although other contributions were not particularly pretty.  I remind those who spoke negatively about the Labour Party and the labour movement of Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to the 1913 Lockout.  The party's founder, Arthur Griffith, told Jim Larkin that it was an unfortunate distraction.  James Connolly drew attention to the special relationship that existed between William Martin Murphy and Arthur Griffith.  However, we are 100 years away from those events and the labour movement welcomes solidarity from every political party.</p>  <p>  This is an important issue.  All but the most conservative of Members will welcome the establishment of a commission on low pay.  I thank the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, for ensuring that the commission will deliver findings in a timely manner.  We will receive a report of its findings before we break for the summer.  That is important to us, and even more important to those on low pay, including families who are struggling.  These are the issues Members who have an affinity with those on low pay should be trying to progress.  People should be able to expect a living wage.  The curse of zero hour contracts simply should not be tolerated.  I look forward to support from every Member of this House on any proposals to protect low paid workers and abolish zero hour contracts.</p>  <p>  We are dealing with a legacy in this regard.  People may speak about the good things that happened during the Celtic tiger but many bad things also happened during that period, one of which was cheap labour.  Unfortunately, the new Irish ended up working in menial jobs without access to trade unions and they were paid awful wages.  It is our responsibility as legislators to deal with that legacy.  I look forward to studying the findings of University of Limerick's investigation of zero hour contracts and of the Low Pay Commission.</p></speech>

I also welcome the initiatives taken by the Government to date to protect workers rights by restoring the cut to the national minimum wage and enacting legislation to protect temporary workers.  The establishment of the Low Pay Commission as an independent body which can make recommendations to the Government is an important step in ensuring that we focus on people and families on low pay and examine the repercussions changes to the minimum wage will have on the families concerned and the wider economy.  The issue of low and zero hour contracts is currently in the news but it is only through the creation of this independent body that we will ensure it remains a priority in the medium and long-term.  This is an issue which determines the economic viability of a great number of families.</p><p> The establishment of the Low Pay Commission, as an interim measure, is important, but so, too, is other legislation being pursued by the Government, including legislation dealing with a replacement of registered employment agreements and reform of the Industrial Relations Act.  A study of the prevalence of zero hour contracts, to be undertaken by the University of Limerick, is welcome.  Not only will it examine the prevalence of these contracts, it will also look at their impact on employees and their families.  It will cover a range of public and private sectors and focus on the retail, hospitality, health and education sectors.  Until we fully understand the prevalence of these contracts and their implications for employees, we cannot fully determine the proper legislative course to pursue.  For that reason, obtaining increased knowledge and proper evidence must be our first goal.</p> <p> It must be acknowledged that this debate has been prompted by the ongoing dispute in Dunnes Stores.  I note that the matter was referred to the Labour Court, but Dunnes Stores management did not attend the court hearing, which is regrettable as the expertise available in the Labour Court has helped to resolve many thorny industrial relations issues in recent years.  People on zero hour contracts are not in a good position when it comes to making a stand against an employer and I sincerely hope the might of a retail giant such as Dunnes Stores is not pitted against an individual employee taking part in the current dispute.  The dispute raises a much wider issue, namely, our awareness of the conditions under which various employees work and the knock-on effect our everyday choices have on our fellow citizens.  The retail sector has at its base the decisions made by ordinary householders every day on how to spend their hard earned money.  Supporting commercial giants that employ people on zero hour contracts may not be in the long-term interests of Irish families whose children must grow up and find employment in an ever changing landscape.</p> <p> The commitment of the Government to low wage workers deserves a greater focus.  We have, rightly, placed a focus on job creation, reflected in An Action Plan for Jobs, of which the wider public is aware.  However, we also need to communicate our commitment to low wage workers.  The restoration of the cut to the minimum wage was an important step in this regard and made a significant difference to the lives of many low paid workers.  Legislation enacted in 2012 to protect temporary workers was another significant step.  Next month we will consider the Workplace Relations Bill which, when enacted, should create a more streamlined workplace relations service and strengthen the hand of the Workplace Relations Commission in terms of compliance and fixed charge notices.</p> <p> I welcome the focus placed on zero hour contracts in recent weeks and months.  Put simply, it is almost impossible to have a proper family life while working on such a contract.  We have heard of families that cannot apply for a car loan because they have no security of income, workers whose hours have been cut dramatically and drastically without explanation, people working part time who do not qualify for jobseeker's allowance on a casual basis because they have to be available for work and are contracted to their employer to work for six days, although that contract may not result in any work or pay.  Life is unimaginable in such circumstances.  For that reason, we need to obtain evidence on the prevalence and impact of these contracts and take action.  I believe the Government does have the will to take such action, but it needs to do so based on proper evidence.  I look forward to publication of the work of the University of Limerick on the prevalence and impact of zero hour contracts.</p></speech>

I will start by reiterating that we are all aware that the Government's principal task in 2011 was the daunting task of rescuing the economy and creating jobs.  When we consider the scale of job losses, we readily understand the scale of the challenge presented.  Some 330,000 jobs were lost in the economy between 2008 and 2012.  Therefore, we were faced with a mighty challenge.  We have faced multiple challenges.  For example, we faced the challenge of how to restore confidence in the country, how to attract inward investment and how to create the conditions necessary for sustainable employment growth.  There were some who hoped the Government would fail in these challenges, so keen was their thirst to make political progress.  However, the Government did not fail.  Against all of the odds, it made and continues to make progress.  Last year alone, some 29,100 net new jobs were created.  </p><p>I refer to employment as providing a context for employment rights.  The increase in employment which I believe will continue brings with it a challenge.  This relates to the rights and conditions of workers, on which the Labour Party has strong beliefs.  It is a party that focuses not only on work but also on the rights of workers in the workplace.  For that reason, I commend the objectives and aims of the Minister of State with responsibility for employment, Deputy Gerald Nash.  He is a person of strong beliefs and has great experience in this field.  He is a man of conviction and progressive thought.  I mention his ideas and plans not just for the creation of work <i>per se</i>but also for decency in the workplace and the rights and entitlements of workers.  These ideas fall into three principal proposed plans of action.  He has established the Low Pay Commission, one of the most important public policy innovations in decades.  The commission will examine and make recommendations annually on the minimum wage, with a view to ensuring it is adjusted incrementally and regularly over time and that it keeps pace with the cost of living.  The Minister of State's second focus will be on zero hour contracts.  Precarious work and zero hour contracts are issues the Labour Party is tackling.  The Minister of State has commissioned the Kemmy school at the University of Limerick to carry out a study of zero hour contracts, their prevalence and impact on employees.  It is appropriate that this work is being carried out in a place named after the famed former Deputy Jim Kemmy, a man who was admired and well known here, who gave his life to fighting for workers' rights.  He died prematurely, but the selection of the Kemmy school is an evocative choice by the Minister of State.</p><p>The third focus of the Minister of State is on collective bargaining.  New legislation is being drafted on this key Labour Party commitment and will be brought before the House shortly.  It will allow workers to improve their terms and conditions and ensure unions will have an effective legal system behind them.  These provisions are necessary and effective antidotes to a philosophy that has been growing apace for years and has sought to erode the traditional rights of workers and trade unions.  I wish the Minister of State well in this regard, particularly in his work in ensuring decency and dignity for workers in the workplace.</p></speech>

T&aacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r againn in &Eacute;irinn, Thuaidh agus Theas.Is cuid iontach t&aacute;bhachtach d'Eire cothrom a chur ar f&aacute;il p&aacute; cothrom a thabhairt don lucht oibre.  N&iacute;l sin ag tarl&uacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.</p><p>This State, the Twenty-six Counties of our island, has the second highest percentage of low -paying jobs in the OECD, coming a close second to the USA and the situation is getting worse.  Many will be aware of the situation in the USA where some of their most profitable corporations may also be beneficiaries of the taxpayer- funded programme commonly known as food stamps.  Working while remaining in poverty is a perversion and it is something that occurs here also.  This alone should give us great pause for thought.</p> <p> We know that poverty and poor health worldwide are inextricably linked.  The causes of poor health for millions across our globe are rooted in political, social and economic injustices.  We are told that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of poor health, something any of us who is committed to working for this increasing body of citizens across the State, understand deeply.  Poverty increases the chances of ill health and ill health keeps families and whole swathes of society in the poverty trap.  There has been a disproportionate effect of successive austerity budgets on low income families who are also particularly dependent on the public health system and therefore most affected by cuts in health services.  The inverse care law tells us that those who need health care most, get it least.  Lack of housing, poverty, lack of education and low occupational status are all linked.  Low pay and zero hour contracts, along with these factors, all converge to create a perfect storm that acts against good health.  It challenges the ability of these workers to seek health, to afford health, to make informed decisions about their health and it most certainly increases mental stress.</p> <p> There are considerable differences evident in Ireland in terms of life expectancy and premature death between people from different socio-economic backgrounds.  This relates to the reduced availability of health care services and reduced coverage, along with reduced disposable income for many of our citizens.  Reports tell us of 10% food poverty in Ireland and one in five children going to bed or to school hungry.  Wide gaps in health indicators between children of different socio-economic groups are evident from as young as five years of age.  Cancer survival is decreased and cardiovascular disease rates have higher mortality outcomes among patients from lower income and deprived families.  Ireland is the only EU country that does not offer universal access to free GP care and charges on prescription drugs inadvertently hit those who can least afford it.  Charges went up and stayed up, despite evidence that this stops many from accessing necessary medications.</p> <p> Access should be based on need alone.  Free GP care and free medication charges are essential but these alone are not enough; to truly break the cycle we need to address the root of the problem and the perpetuating factors.  To break the cycle the Government must take a stronger role in labour market regulation.  The Government must introduce collective bargaining and robust anti-victimisation legislation to protect workers.  That we have to ask this of a Government party that styles itself the Labour Party is particularly worrying.  Zero hour contracts give an inability to plan from week to week and certainly not longer term.  This and previous governments have failed to further workers' rights.</p> <p> Who are most likely to be low paid workers?  Clearly, they are women, people with low levels of education, young people, vulnerable people, and undocumented migrants with many having increased health care requirements. Low pay is not good for workers, the economy or for wider society.  Social transfers such as family income supplement mean that the State subsidises the low pay in some businesses.  Ireland is a low wage economy by comparison with other EU countries.  The minimum wage must be increased by &euro;1 to &euro;9.65 per hour.  This might not mean a lot to the Minister and many in this House but for someone on the minimum wage it can mean the difference of providing a healthy meal for their children, being able to repair a washing machine or, under this Government, for those bullied and frightened, being able to afford to have access to water.</p></speech>

The growing number of families living in working poverty is having a detrimental impact on children and families with consequences felt by entire communities.</p><p>The reality is that this<b></b>Government is failing in how it deals with child poverty.  With the country regressing ten years in this regard, as has been noted by the Children's Rights Alliance, low pay and precarious employment is more often than not intrinsically linked with poverty in the home.  Low pay and precarious employment is characterised by work that is unstable, unprotected and increasingly unable to sustain individuals and families.  It means the future of work is uncertain and workers face a constant possibility of job loss.  We also know that precarious work is often characterised by situations in which workers lack a voice provided by unions or other organisations.  They work under inadequate regulation and receive pay rates which are considered low in relation to hours worked.</p><p>Unfortunately, as we have witnessed most recently with Dunnes Stores, the treatment of workers is secondary to profit.  No matter where it happens, precarious employment overwhelmingly undermines women workers as we also saw in the case of the La Senza lock-in.  Precarious employment and low pay has such an impact on the lives of those it affects, including on their current and day-to-day lives, as well as on their future prospects, that their lives and the lives of their children, not just their work, are made precarious.</p><p>It is increasingly clear that women are carrying a heavier burden of responsibility, accompanied by increased levels of poverty for them and their children.  Often described as the triple burden of women, the feminisation of poverty underscores the three fundamental roles women play, as mothers, as workers and as community advocates.  Often, the burden in one area of responsibility results in decreased attention to the others, in this case, detracting from women's participation in community and family.  Women around the world are more likely than men to be in precarious work.</p><p>Child poverty is not inevitable; in the past, child poverty levels have been significantly lower in the State.  However, the number of children living in consistent poverty has dramatically increased since the recession started.  Fergus Finlay from Barnardos has said it is undeniable that public policy has played a significant role in this increase.  He has correctly pointed out that not only has no progress been made in meeting the national target to reduce child poverty but the situation has become steadily worse and that child poverty remains not just a moral imperative but a national scandal.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has also expressed serious concern at the lack of progress made to deal with child poverty.  It has pointed out that the increase in child poverty over the past five years coincided with an increase in calls for help.  Around &euro;40 million a year was given in direct assistance to families over the period.  This is double the figure in the pre-austerity years.</p><p>Last year a UNICEF report found that Irish families with children lost the equivalent of ten years of income progress, ranking Ireland No. 37 of 41 OECD countries in its league table measuring relative changes in child poverty.  Barnardos has stated that there are 130,000 children in poverty in Ireland, roughly equal to the entire population of County Mayo.  Tanya Ward, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, said the number of children experiencing consistent poverty has doubled since the beginning of the downturn in 2008 and that we can only conclude that children were and continue to be the real victims of the recession.  She has asked, as I do, how will the Government respond to these children during its last year in office.  She has said that families are struggling with rising rent prices, utility bills, personal debt, homelessness and food poverty and she has called on the Government to carry out a social impact assessment in advance of budgetary decisions, ensuring budget 2016 is poverty proofed.  It is widely known that a child raised in consistent poverty is much more at risk of raising his or her own children in consistent poverty.  Child poverty blights childhoods.  Growing up in poverty means being cold, going hungry and not being able to join in activities with friends.</p><p>It has long-lasting effects.  Leaving school with fewer qualifications translates into lower earnings over the course of a working life.  Poor children are more likely than their wealthier peers to grow up obese, to have poor diets and to have behavioural problems.  The negative consequences of poverty can be seen in children as young as three years.  Poverty is also related to more complicated health histories over the course of a lifetime, again influencing earnings as well as the overall quality and indeed length of life.  Professionals live, on average, eight years longer than unskilled workers.</p> <p> Child poverty imposes costs on broader society.  Governments end up committing themselves to providing services in the future if they fail to address child poverty in the here and now.  Ultimately, the effect of zero-hour contracts, precarious work and resulting low pay on mothers with families is detrimental to society as a whole.  If the Government is in any way serious about tackling societal issues, it must begin to introduce protections for workers from the start in order that parents, especially mothers, are given a decent chance to provide a future for their children.</p></speech>

We all know them.  They say we must be competitive and flexible and so on.  All those clich&eacute;s amount to excuses to allow the exploitation of workers across the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in is clear: there is no justification or excuse that can allow for the exploitation of workers.  There is also no economic rationale for running an economy like a low-fare airline.  A sustainable and fair recovery cannot be built on a low-paid workforce unsure of how much will be in the next pay cheque.</p>  <p>  A culture of exploitation of workers and of labour has been allowed to develop under the Government.  It has always been with us to some extent but some employers have taken full advantage of the economic crisis to stoop to new lows.  They have done that in the full knowledge that the Government will turn a blind eye at worst and fully support their plans at best.  Government policy has been to support fully the exploitation of workers and even to take part in it itself.  JobBridge is a scandalous scheme when it exists in the private sector but is particularly disgusting to see it used by the State.  That is the example the Government is setting for the private sector.</p>  <p>  That is not the way an economy is supposed to work.  The State should not subsidise profitable companies by allowing them to hire for a few months mainly young workers for a pittance.  A job should be a guarantee of having enough to live on.  Something has gone terribly wrong.  A culture of economic exploitation has developed and has been allowed grow to horrible levels.  However, the Government is not concerned.  Its counter-motion contains lots of promises but on reading it the only question that springs to mind is whether this is a different Government than the one that has been sitting across the floor for the past four years.  No worker should believe one word from the Government.  Its record is clear: it has supported a system where workers are exploited.  The Government throws out useless excuses with no basis in reality.  For it, the Dunnes Stores dispute is regrettable but none of its business.  It is only the Government after all.</p>  <p>  The anti-worker rhetoric of the Government has had its day.  It is time to build a society and economy where workers are rewarded fairly for their labour whether their employer is the State or a private company.  That goal hardly seems too ambitious, but having listened to the contributions of Fine Gael and Labour Deputies and others to this debate, it is clear it is not even on their agenda.  The rest of us will do it for them.</p></speech>

At the moment we are building an even more unequal and unfair economy than the one we had before the fall of the Celtic tiger.  We are building this economy on precarious, low-paid work which brings little protection for workers and their families and puts more strain on social protection to pick up the tab for the gap between what workers are paid and what they need to survive.  We now have a Low Pay Commission to investigate the situation.  Every day, Deputies in working class communities hear stories from our constituents of families struggling to survive despite the fact that they are working every hour they can get.  An economy which does not reward work and punishes those that cannot work or cannot find work is an economy which criminalises working class people and treats them as second class citizens.</p>  <p>  In the past, ordinary working people had a reasonable expectation of finding employment, which though hard and often monotonous was secure and allowed them to afford the most basic things needed for some measure of comfort in life, namely, to be able to feed their family, pay their bills and meet their rent or mortgage and still have something to engage in some form of leisure.  This is for many today a pipe-dream as they are forced to work in low-paid jobs, which are completely insecure.  While large lay-offs are no longer as common as they were five years ago, every week workers wonder what hours they will be given by their employer in the future and whether it will allow them to keep the lights on, put bread on the table and keep the roof over their head.  This is best seen in the increase in working people experiencing homelessness.  I cannot count the number of people in employment whom I have sought to help who have now become reliant on emergency accommodation.  They have been placed with their children in hotels away from their schools, their work and their community.  What is the point of work if working people cannot keep a roof over their head?</p>  <p>  Currently, minimum wage workers rarely get the 39 hours required to earn the approximately &euro;17,000 per annum they are often said to earn.  That is far less than the &euro;35,000 the Taoiseach thinks minimum wage workers get.  In fact, many minimum wage workers only get approximately 15 hours a week.  On average, that would net a worker just &euro;6,487 a year, which is barely enough to rent a room in Dublin these days.  Even two full-time minimum wage earners would need to fork over approximately 50% of their combined earnings to rent a house in Dublin.  That is before one factors in water charges, the cost of ESB, Internet, a TV licence, transport costs and bin charges.</p>  <p>  People cannot live on such wages, but their employers want everyone but them to pick up the tab.  Dunnes Stores has now gone as far as to punish workers for seeking better conditions by cutting their hours or even getting rid of them.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>The majority of these workers are women, who despite much reform in our society remain major contributors to the economy through millions of hours of free work they do in the home.  These are the hardest working people in the State yet they are the lowest paid by far.</p> <p> When these people cannot make work pay enough to live in dignity we need more than a commission, we need root and branch reform of how our economy treats workers at the bottom.  Does it continue to support employers in maximising exploitation or does it support workers in achieving a fair day's pay for a fair day's work?  The responsibility for this situation lies with the Government.  It is its responsibility to regulate the market to ensure that workers receive fair treatment and that all citizens can live in some level of comfort.  Zero hour contracts, work place intimidation, rock bottom pay levels and union free work places are the fault of Government inaction on protecting workers and promoting fair and equitable treatment.</p> <p> We cannot allow a system to remain in place that allows employers to punish women workers for becoming pregnant as we heard was happening to some Dunnes Stores' workers on flexi-hour contracts.  Workers are being taught in these work places that they are first and foremost economic units and their needs and their lives come second in the quest for maximum profit.  We cannot allow a situation where workers who have been in place for years get reduced hours at busy periods while the workplace is flooded with cheaper temporary workers.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party tabled a motion on this issue during the previous D&aacute;il but like so many of Labour's principles this has been left at the door in order to meet the demands of the right and Fine Gael.</p> <p> In the United States, US, a major campaign has been going on to raise the minimum wage.  The evidence from organisations such as the Economic Policy Institute shows that an increase in wages would in the US create nearly 100,000 jobs by increasing consumer spending power.  These benefits would be even greater with implementation of rent controls and an increase in council-owned social housing stock which would increase rent revenues to local authorities while also cutting costs for the low-paid and stabilising rents across the private market.</p> <p> If we want a fair and decent economy which will be stable and provide decent lives for those working in it we need to embark on a major campaign of reform and this must start with the Low Pay Commission.  We must raise the minimum wage to &euro;9.65 per hour.  We must abolish zero hour contracts which only provide flexibility to exploit; end, through legislation, victimisation in the work place; reform pay-related social insurance, PRSI, to support low paid workers who receive pay increases; and begin the process of implementing a living wage which will ensure decency and dignity for all workers and access to the most basic needs for their families such as housing, health care, education and transport.  An economy which cannot or will not ensure the comfort of those who prop it up is not worth having.  Low pay and zero hours should be unacceptable.  Exploitation of workers is unacceptable in any society.  Everyone needs some certainty in their lives, proper working hours and rotas.  I call on colleagues across the political divide to support our motion and not water it down or support amendments or even say there is legislation coming down the road.  That is not worthy of anyone. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600030#CC00200"><p>The legislative changes we have proposed in this Private Members' motion will benefit all workers, particularly an emerging group of vulnerable workers described as the precariat, heavily concentrated in the retail and hospitality sectors and across the service industry.  Their working lives are characterised by low pay, part-time work and uncertain hours.  Ireland has the second highest levels of low pay in the OECD and one of the most "flexible" labour markets.  Employers and businesses stress the importance of flexibility to economic recovery, as does Government, but flexibility in the workplace is starting to look more like exploitation.  They emphasise the notion of 'choice' but the reality is different.</p>  <p>  Low-paid workers want security around their working hours, decent rates of pay, permanent employment contracts, and guaranteed working hours.  In other words, they want to be treated with respect and dignity and to be free from workplace harassment and victimisation.  These issues are nowhere more graphically illustrated than in the Dunnes Stores dispute.  It is a classic case study of the glaring inadequacies of current legislation in protecting vulnerable workers. </p>  <p>  The Dunnes Stores dispute illustrates the failure of the Government and in particular the Labour Party to put in place real, meaningful legislation instead of making endless commitments.  Commitments to legislate do not help the workers in Dunnes Stores.  Vulnerable workers like them are the last people who can afford to go on strike.  For them it is the very last resort.  Where else have they to go when on strike except into further poverty?  The Dunnes Stores dispute demolishes the notion of flexibility and is a clear and defining argument for collective bargaining rights in legislation.  Overall, almost 350,000 workers in Ireland or 19.2% of the workforce suffer multiple deprivation while another 34% of single income households in the workforce are classified as deprived.  We now see the wholly unacceptable situation that 150,000 part-time workers are in receipt of dole payments.  From an economic perspective this is unacceptable as depressed take home pay reduces demand in the economy as consumer spending is reduced.  Investment is also depressed because businesses are reluctant to invest if they are unsure of a return from higher consumer spending.  One cannot kick-start an economy and build sustainable growth on low pay.</p>  <p>  At another level, flexibility, low pay and exploitative work practices have far-reaching and profound consequences for the broader society.  Women are heavily concentrated in the ranks of the precariat.  They are over-represented in the retail and hospitality sector and are more likely to have part-time work contracts and low pay.  A recent survey by the Mandate trade union, which represents workers in the retail sector and in Dunnes Stores, found that seven out of ten of its members are women.</p>  <p>  The Nevin Economic Research Institute's, NERI, most recent quarterly economic bulletin highlights the fact that 60% of low-paid workers are women.  The report confirms what has already been highlighted repeatedly by Central Statistics Office, CSO, EUROSTAT, and OECD data, that a majority of low-paid workers in uncertain and precarious employment are women.  Constant uncertainty around working hours and no guarantee of earnings constitutes exploitation.  Financial insecurity means one cannot get a loan from a bank or the credit union.  Uncertainty around working hours means one cannot organise one's family life.  This has particular implications for women with children and anyone with caring responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Taken together these factors have resulted in the increasing feminisation of poverty and an increasingly worrying trend towards the erosion in the quality of life for large numbers of women in the workforce and their families.  While 25% of all workers earn less than the living wage of &euro;11.45 per hour, CSO data tells us that 50% of all women workers earn &euro;20,000 per annum or less.  European Community figures also tell us that the gender pay gap is growing, from 12.6% in 2009 to 14.4% in 2012.  The National Women's Council is now talking in terms of an income crisis for women in Ireland and has called for State-funded universal child care, social clauses in public spending and legislation to protect vulnerable workers.  I suggest to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in and to Government that everything contained in this Private Members' motion should be acceptable and there is no reason to oppose these measures.</p></speech>

The debate is timely in reminding ourselves what has happened in terms of how the economy has been turned around and what the Government has done to protect the most vulnerable during the crisis and how it has brought forward measures to reduce inequality during that period.</p>  <p>  The Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the well-being of lower paid workers.  On taking office, it restored the national minimum wage from &euro;7.65 to &euro;8.65.  It introduced legislation to restore the joint labour committee system and enacted the Temporary Agency Workers Bill 2012 to protect temporary agency workers.  It provided collective representation rights for retirees in terms of access to trustees to ensure their collective voice would be heard when the trustees were considering amendments to a particular scheme.</p>  <p>  Having returned the economy to sustainable growth through transformational policies implemented on the twin tracks of An Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, the Government is determined to ensure the benefits of the recovery are felt by all in society, both nationally and regionally.  Making work pay, enhancing dignity at work and reducing inequality are cornerstones of the Government's agenda.  Its commitment to pursue an extensive industrial relations and employment rights reform agenda continues.  We have established the Low Pay Commission to make annual recommendations to the Government on the national minimum wage and related matters.  The commission will report to it within the next 12 weeks.  We are introducing legislation to provide a revised legislative framework to replace REAs.  This legislation will be published within the next few weeks.  We are conducting a study of the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and their impact on employees.  The study will be completed as a matter of priority and the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will act quickly on foot of the report.</p>  <p>  As regards collective bargaining, a focus of the debate last night, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to reform the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  It will provide for an improved and constitutionally robust industrial relations framework that will provide greater clarity for employers.  It will ensure that, where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, either with a trade union or an internal excepted body, the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there is an effective means for a union, on behalf of members in that employment, to have disputed remuneration, terms and conditions assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court, if necessary.  Such a determination will be enforceable in the Circuit Court.  In addition - this issue was raised last night by Members on the Opposition side - the legislation will contain strong anti-victimisation provisions to protect workers who may believe they are being victimised for exercising their rights under it, including the introduction of interim relief against unfair dismissal.  Given the concerns expressed last night, the Government looks forward to receiving the full support of the House in moving these measures along, as they are part of its dignity at work agenda.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government is succeeding in turning the economy around and improving the lives of citizens.  Unemployment is down to 10%.  Almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first action plan for jobs in 2012 and the increase has been in full-time rather than casual or temporary jobs.  It is also clear that the Government has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining and improving employment rights, as well as reforming and enhancing both the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations framework utilised by workers and employers.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge those who have made positive contributions to the debate on the motion.  The Government intends to press ahead with its programme of work with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable workers.  It will be seeking the support of the House to ensure the key legislative measures to which I have referred can be passed into law in the months ahead.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600031#DD00300"><p>Who does it suit to have people in precarious, low paid work?  Who does it suit to have a legal framework that allows employers to stagger ten hours of employment over five days and have a workforce at their beck and call?  Who does it suit to allow workers to live their lives with the real threat of unemployment hanging over them?  Who does it suit when employers can tell their employees that due to unemployment there will always be someone there to take their place and do the hard graft for poor wages in poor conditions?</p>  <p>  I commend the Dunnes Stores workers for the stand they took in going out on strike recently.  It was a brave move and they are not asking for much.  As stated in the Mandate campaign, they are only seeking basic decency.  We have come to expect these poor employment practices from certain categories of employer, but many more are successfully hiding their actions from public view.  There are a huge number of such examples.  The Dunnes Stores workers are asking for a permanent employment contract, decent rates of pay, guaranteed working hours and decent working conditions.  It is not a lot to ask.  It is not as if they are seeking a doubling of their wages or an extravagant pay increase; rather they are looking for security.  They are asking to be employed in a manner that will allow them to know if they can make their rent payments week to week, as well as paying for child care and their children's dinners.  It is also about paying for their children's education and clothes.</p>  <p>  The Government promised that it would introduce collective bargaining legislation, but it is still nowhere to be seen.  People are, rightly, asking when this legislation will be introduced in order to tackle the difficulties faced by many workers.  Companies such as Dunnes Stores are now punishing and sacking workers for attempting to engage in a fight for better conditions.</p>  <p>  One third of all one-income households are officially recognised as deprived.  I do not know how anyone can stand over this shocking statistic.  Low pay means increased dependency on social transfers.  We all understand this, including the Minister of State.  The State is subsidising low pay employers in the pursuit of profit, which is not right.  There is talk of economic recovery, but there are people who had nothing before the recession, nothing during it and still do not have a penny now.  We are talking about building economic recovery, but for whom are we doing it?  That is the question on which we are focusing in this debate.  Are we building it on the basis of exploiting other workers?  That is what is happening and what the motion is about.  We want these things to change.</p>  <p>  We know that in Ireland there is a significant low pay problem, with almost 12% of workers being at risk of poverty.  The issue is not unique to Ireland.  It is also a challenge for workers all over the world, many of whom are facing unfair zero hour contracts, reduced rights and poor working conditions.  I have met the organisers of the Fight for $15 campaign which is seeking a living wage for fast food workers in the United States.  It has mobilised tens of thousands of workers to strike.  Workers in 123 cities in 35 countries are joining demonstrations in the first worldwide co-ordinated strike to achieve fair pay, a safe working environment and improved working conditions.  Last week I was in Canada during the Dunnes Stores strike.  I spoke to trade union activists in Toronto and Montreal about the dangers of zero hour contracts and Sinn F&eacute;in's campaign to achieve a living wage in Ireland.  The motion, rightly, calls for an immediate ban on zero hour contracts.  Certain groups of workers, many of whom are women, are overly represented in being offered zero hour contracts and precarious work.</p><p>Many of these jobs are done by people with low levels of formal education, young people, vulnerable people and undocumented migrants.  That is the pattern, not only across the developed world but also in the Third World.  I welcome the fact that the low pay commission has been established but it is extremely narrow in its focus and is limited in its remit to looking at minimum wage.</p> <p> I have heard people asking what is going to happen about zero-hour contracts.  We are told that the University of Limerick is doing a paper on it.  Great, we have a paper on the way.  Yet it must be asked what is going to happen for those workers.  That is what people want answers for.  I welcome the fact that at least for a couple of hours we have focused on this scandal that is happening across this economy and across the western world.</p> <p> For some bizarre reason, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash is proposing to replicate the current British commission, which increasingly is being found to be totally inadequate and not fit for purpose.  I ask the Minister of State to think again about where he is going.  There is also no reference in the proposals by the Minister of State to inequality, poverty, gender, migrant workers, public services access or social protection.  That is what the debate is about.  It is not about scoring points off each other.  What we would like to see happening is that this Oireachtas would move towards establishing a real fair pay commission that will look at this whole area.</p> <p> Some people are saying we are just going to look at minimum pay.  Minimum pay can go up or down, a point that was not made by many of the Minister of State's colleagues.  We need to see some primary watchdog on low pay and the commission's responsibilities should be widened to tackle the extent of low pay, not just the minimum wage.  This would enable it to make long-term, sector-specific recommendations to the Government of the day.  It should also deal with other contributing factors to poverty amongst those employed such as regressive taxation, inadequate public services and State support of low pay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600032#EE00200"><p>People looking in on this debate will have listened to the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's rosy picture of how the economy is functioning at the moment.  The reality is that these people will be well aware of the continuing unemployment crisis.  They will be aware that people who are unemployed and over 65 are not even counted as unemployed, and that the tens of thousands of people receiving a pittance on job activation schemes are also not counted as unemployed.  They will be aware that for every job this Government has created, four people have emigrated.  That is a damning statistic for the Deputy's Government.</p>  <p>  People are also aware that at the same time there has been a savage hollowing out of the pay and conditions of those in work.  Low-paid insecure work is now entrenched in the labour force.  A total of 20% workers are in casual and part-time work.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of low pay in the OECD, and of underemployment in the EU.  It is not Sinn F&eacute;in that is delivering this information.  These are internationally recognised bodies that are respected for their level of research.  Half of all workers in this State will earn less than &euro;25,000 this year and 30% will earn less than &euro;20,000.  Every day 135,000 children face material deprivation.  These are startling facts and they are a disastrous monument to the Government's two-tier economic policies.</p>  <p>  Last night in the debate we heard the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton speak.  Not for one second did he acknowledge that there is even a problem with regard to low pay or job insecurity.  "What crisis?" was his mantra.  What crisis indeed? The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny earns &euro;3,500 a week, more than the British and French Prime Ministers and nearly seven times the weekly pay of half the workers in the State.  Its clear from the comments by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that politicians cannot represent if they cannot relate.</p>  <p>  The truth is that Ireland's economy is built on two tiers and that this is not by accident.  For example, the average senior manager's earnings are 7.7 times those of secretaries, as opposed to Nordic countries where senior managers' compensation is 3.5 times that of secretaries.  Fine Gael and Labour Ministers are beneficiaries of that income inequality.  Real change is a material threat to them.  As a result, the junior party in the Government has been politically neutered yet again.  We welcome the fact that there is a low pay commission but it is deficient.  It will tackle only the minimum wage and ignores the plight of 8% of workers who are in danger of poverty.</p>  <p>  All we seek to do in this motion is offer positive, real solutions to deal with the current crisis.  The fact is that work and poverty discriminate on the basis of gender, age and race.  We propose that the low pay commission is built to take this into consideration.  Poverty is a result not just of wages but also of the terms and conditions of work, access to public services, taxation, and State supports.  We propose that the low pay commission take this into consideration.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in shook his head during the last speech, when my colleague indicated that the low pay commission was narrow in its focus.  The fact is that it only has one focus, the minimum wage.  If I had a year left in government and had one shot at rectifying this disaster that is happening in the labour force, I would make sure the commission's remit was broad and robust enough to deal with the problems at hand. </p>  <p>  Another problem at hand is the zero-hour contracts.  They are a disease in our society and are eating away at job security.  They cause poverty and they prevent workers from getting another job and from getting mortgages and car loans.  Everyday issues for families, such as child care, becomes next to impossible.  Indeed, zero-hour contracts create opportunity for exploitation that has not been seen for decades.  We saw this in the recent Dunnes Stores dispute.  For "zero-hour contract", read "poverty trap".  However, rather than tasking the low pay commission to end their use, the Labour Party says it will outsource analysis of zero-hour contracts to a third party and on that basis make the decision.  Is this to be "Labour's way" in the midst of an immediate workers' rights crisis?  When Labour Party candidates who were standing for election in 2011 were asked what they were going to do about these issues, why did they not stand up and say they would outsource the analysis to somebody else and then make a decision?</p>  <p>  Under this Government insecure, low contracts have been allowed to develop and to create competitive advantages for unscrupulous employers.  This motion simply seeks to remove that competitive advantage to make sure that exploitation of workers does not increase the profits of employers.  Our motion seeks to make banded contracts an option for workers who seek them, so that they can improve their own job security.</p>  <p>  The motion proposes a number of positive solutions.  It seeks to create a good environment for workers from which decent employers will benefit.  It would create good standards of living.  It would also end the bullying and manipulation of workers and negate the need for industrial action.  I can understand that the Minister of State gets a little bit prickly around these issues.  The Labour Party does not like other parties being critical of it.  I assure the Minister of State that this is an effort to wake up the Labour Party to the catastrophe that is happening in this country.  I urge him to give workers real legislative protection.</p></speech>

The capacity is not in the system to provide free GP care for the population as a whole.  When we were working on this initiative prior to the 2007 general election, one of the key fundamental elements to ensuring the FairCare universal health insurance worked was that capacity needed to be built up within the system before rolling out enhanced accessibility.  If that was not done, demand would be built up for services which did not exist.  It is all well and good to provide people with free access to GP care, but, as we know, there are huge delays and backlogs in getting occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and all of those other therapies.  This is not only in respect of adults and older people but also in respect of children.  Giving children or older people free access to a GP without putting the physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy capacity in place is a pointless exercise.</p>  <p>  When we look to the United Kingdom, we see an appalling situation where primary care is creaking and bursting at the seams.  A study was completed last year which showed that GPs in the United Kingdom are under considerable strain, with insufficient capacity to meet the current and expected needs of parents.  The interesting and telling thing is that the number of patients waiting up to four weeks, one month, for a consultation will increase significantly if capacity is not provided in the system.  If we do not resource primary care properly, we will see waiting lists for GPs in this country.  It will force people to go down the SwiftCare and Beacon accident and emergency route.  People will have to buy in specialist GP cover because the public system will be creaking.  It is fundamentally important that we put the proper resources into primary care.  This is not only in order that GPs will be able to deal with the capacity issues, it will also bring a far more significant return in reducing demand in accident and emergency departments and acute hospitals.  There will also be a knock-on impact in delayed discharges and nursing home supports.</p>  <p>  We need to treat people before they need to go to a hospital.  We need to try to reduce the number of people who are getting sick by putting resources for preventive measures into communities.  We need to ensure that when people get sick, they can access a GP or other primary care physician or specialist.</p><p>Only those who are really sick should attend hospital.  When they do, they should be treated and discharged into the community as quickly as possible.  The system of housing adaptation grants which have been slashed significantly in recent years should not block people from being discharged from hospital.  In the past two years in my county the grant has been cut by 72%, which has had a direct impact on the number of delayed discharges.  This is replicated across the country.</p> <p> There needs to be fundamental change in the health system.  We must front-load it and resource preventive care services.  If we can do so, we will reduce demand in hospitals and overcrowding in accident and emergency units and have a much better service for everyone.</p></speech>

From speaking with many people on the ground since the initiative's announcement, it seems to be a welcome step, albeit a small one but in the right direction for those aged under six years or over 70.  The majority see it for what it is attempting to do, particularly as regards regular checks for diabetes and asthma.  It is viewed as progressive and positive.  It is to the eternal credit of the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that it seems to be getting over the line.  The concerns expressed by some Opposition spokespersons were related to how it had taken too long to reach this point.  We wish it had happened earlier, but this is a positive step in providing for universal health care.  One need only put oneself in the mind of a young parent whose child has a sickness that he or she does not understand.  One would hate to think he or she would fear going to a general practitioner, GP, because the cost was prohibitive.  This initiative will help in that regard and I welcome it as a step forward.</p>  <p>  I do not know whether some members of the Opposition will support the Bill, but their objections gave the impression that doctors' surgeries would be filled with healthy and wealthy kids and that those who needed this initiative would not benefit from it.  That is scaremongering of the worst kind.  Why anyone would bring to a doctor a child who did not need to be there is beyond me.</p>  <p>  There is an issue in accident and emergency departments, in that some people who attend might not need to do so.  While the Bill will not solve that problem, it will help in some way.</p>  <p>  I wish to address a point raised by Deputy Denis Naughten.  In this debate there has been little conversation about the decision in respect of those aged under six years or over 70.  Deputies have instead discussed everything else about the health service.  They went off topic and everyone got to vent for five or ten minutes; the Minister will excuse me, therefore, if I do a little of the same.</p>  <p>  There is still an issue with medical cards.  If I had my way, I would dismantle the whole system because it is not fit for purpose.  The first question I would then be asked would be what I would do differently, but that is the problem - I do not have an answer.  This is why the Minister is where he is and I am where I am.  We only get to deal with the hardship cases.  Like Deputy Denis Naughten, some people whose cases I have encountered have been tortured and put through the wringer when asking the State for a medical card or assistance for the first time.  Some people treat a medical card as if it was another card for their wallets and something to which they are entitled, but others who really need it cannot get one.  Worse still, they need it within a certain timeframe, for example, cancer sufferers, but they cannot access one for 12, 15 or 18 months.  Efforts have been made to resolve this issue, but we have a long way to go.</p>  <p>  I will cite one or two examples.  A constituent of mine who is in his late 80s only has an income of &euro;4,000 per annum from renting farm land.  He has never applied for a pension and is proud of having saved the State so much money for 20 years, but he was continually refused a medical card because his income had not been assessed for social welfare purposes.  There was no assessment because he was adamant that he would not apply for a pension for the remainder of his life.  He was hospitalised a number of times last year and living in considerable fear of large hospital bills.  He was unwilling to visit a doctor because of the costs involved and, as such, was probably not on the correct medication to reflect his changing circumstances.  Thankfully, he was granted a medical card in the past month after 15 months of effort.  This individual had saved the State money for a considerable period only to find that he could not apply to one arm of the State for necessary assistance because another arm knew nothing about him.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a welcome first step on the long road towards universal health care.  Instead of knocking what is a positive start, perhaps the Opposition might explain how it would do things better or what the next step should be.  All I am hearing is Deputies going on about issues in the health system about which we all know and in respect of which we will need assistance.  Some of the proposals from the Deputies opposite have not been costed.  It is pie in the sky stuff.  Now is the time to admit that the Government has made a positive first step and support the initiative.  If Opposition Deputies can make it better, please do.  If they have alternatives or opinions, let us hear them.  All I am hearing is Deputies giving out for the sake of it.</p></speech>

In the programme for Government we committed to introducing a universal GP service for everyone.  In line with the statement of Government priorities 2014-16, we prioritised the over 70s in providing free access to GP care.  The Government decided to commence the roll-out of universal GP care services for the entire population by providing for all children under six years of age and all persons aged 70 and over.  In real terms, this means that more than 36,000 people aged 70 years and over who currently must pay to see their GP will no longer have to pay such fees which can range from &euro;40 to &euro;70 for a single visit.  Many constituents from Dundalk, Drogheda, Ardee, Dunleer and Carlingford visited my constituency office to outline the fact that they were encountering severe financial hardship in paying for doctor visits, despite the fact that they had incomes in excess of the limits imposed for the granting of a GP card.  The Bill will be a great relief for them and will, once and for all, take away the financial worry of the costs involved in visiting a GP.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the many improvements that have taken place in the health service in my constituency in the past two years.  In 2015 the Government has increased the budget for health service for the first time since the financial crisis began.  This has meant 198,000 home help hours in County Louth, representing an increase of 29% on the 2013 figure; two new primary care centres opening in Ardee and Carlingford, and 48% of the population, or just over 59,000 people, having full medical cards.  More than 60 houses have benefited from the disability housing adaptation grants scheme at a cost of &euro;723,000.</p>  <p>  I am working closely with Louth County Hospital to raise awareness of the many excellent services available which will go a long way towards alleviating the overcrowding issue in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  They include general, surgical, gynaecological, dental and urological services.  It should be noted that Louth County Hospital's minor injuries unit is open seven days per week and sees almost 30 patients daily, with an average turnaround time of less than one hour.  The venesection service at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital transferred to Louth County Hospital in September 2010, involving the transfer of 300 patients with haemochromatosis.  The number of venesection procedures has increased from 25 to an average of 65 weekly, representing a 160% increase.</p>  <p>  While much is being done to improve the health service, I acknowledge that we have a great deal of work still to do in order to provide the world-class health service the people deserve.  The are more than 400,000 people in Ireland aged 70 years and over.  Of these, more than 36,000 must pay to access GP services.  There is medical evidence to support the idea that those aged over 70 years have a greatly increased chance of contracting multiple chronic conditions.  Therefore, there is a significant benefit to society in providing them with free access to core primary care in the form of GP services.  It is widely accepted that a well developed system of primary care offers significant benefits for the health care system generally, which is welcome.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Under the provisions of the Bill, people aged 70 years and over who currently have a medical or a GP card will continue to receive all medical card entitlements as normal.</p> <p> When the first phases of free universal GP care are in place, namely, the provisions for the under sixes and the over 70s, we will have a situation where the most vulnerable in society will have access to care without facing a financial barrier.  In effect, the Government is ensuring an additional 250,000 people will have unrestricted and free access to GP care.  I strongly support the decision to roll out the next phase of free universal GP care to all over 70 years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600036#JJ00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Primary care has been a key area of reform for the Government since it came to office.  The quality of health care in any country is measured by its responsiveness to changes in society and the changing needs of the population.  A Central Statistics Office report on population and labour force projections from 2016 to 2046 predicts that the number of people aged 65 years and over will rise to almost 1.4 million by 2046.  More significantly, it forecasts a marked rise in the numbers aged 80 years and over, with the figure jumping to 470,000 by 2046.  We cannot ignore these figures which highlight the fact that a strong strategy is needed to ensure we will have a quality health system in place well in advance of 2046.</p>  <p>  The legislation before us represents a strong step forward in that planning process.  Some 36,000 people over the age of 70 years currently do not qualify for free GP care.  That is out of kilter with best practice internationally and among our European partners that, in most instances, provide free access to primary care.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the removal of all persons aged over 70 years from the means-testing process for free GP care.  This section underpins the premise of the legislation and builds on the first stage of the implementation of free GP care for all citizens.  In addition, free care is being extended to all children aged six years and under.</p>  <p>  The Minister has indicated that both initiatives will be brought forward by the summer.  I welcome this move which will see approximately 800,000 people aged over 70 years and under six being able to visit a GP without facing a financial barrier.  I congratulate the Minister on his success in finalising the negotiations on a new GP contract.  The majority of GPs have bought into the system, which is a very welcome development.  GPs are central to the delivery of health services, functioning as the point of access for most patients.  GPs enjoy the confidence of their patients and it is vital that they be properly remunerated and motivated.  It is meritorious in itself that the Minister has managed to secure industrial peace, for want of a better term, between his Department and the majority of GPs.</p>  <p>  One of the key components of the programme for Government is the undertaking to implement a phased introduction of universal free GP care.  I am pleased to see that real progress is finally being made in this area, which will have a positive and reassuring effect on many individuals and families.  It is progressive to seek to create a society where health care is related to need rather than income.  I am very proud to be a member of a party which is pursuing that objective in government.</p>  <p>  As I said, section 2 of the Bill which amends the Health Act 1970 will give everyone aged over 70 years an automatic entitlement to free GP care, removing the requirement to go through the sometimes lengthy process of means testing.  A study carried out by the Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, at Trinity College Dublin found that there was some evidence to suggest persons without a medical card or a GP visit card might face barriers when it came to accessing the flu vaccination.  Any disincentive in this regard gives cause for concern and the Health Service Executive strongly recommends that those aged 65 years and older ensure they avail of the vaccine.  Influenza can be fatal, especially for those with underlying medical conditions, which is common among many of the population aged over 70 years.</p>  <p>  TILDA also identified a significant reduction in the numbers of people over 70 years of age with full access to primary and secondary care services at a time in their lives when their need for health care was increasing.  Such services are especially important at the end of life.  As people age, access to health care becomes all the more important but often more difficult to access because of means.  If initial difficulties are not addressed, people may end up being hospitalised or needing nursing home care, with the associated expense.  There will always be a cohort of the elderly population who require that level of care in any case, but early intervention by GPs may help to reduce the numbers.</p>  <p>  The main barrier to accessing GP care is financial, particularly for the older generation.  Many elderly people put off going to their GP and, as a result, their condition may worsen, resulting in a potentially greater cost of care.  These are startling facts and make this legislation all the more vital.  The key message of the Department of Health's primary care strategy, published in 2011, was that the overarching goal of Irish health policy was to provide a strong, effective health system that would focus on the delivery of services designed to keep people well and out of hospitals.  This involves placing a greater focus on early intervention, health promotion and regular screening.  Primary care centres play a huge role in this regard.</p>  <p>  In Cavan-Monaghan there are between 48 and 57 GPs per 100,000 of population.  This is, by no means, ideal, but it does compare favourably with the figures for neighbouring counties.  Nevertheless, there is a need for constant improvement.  GPS are at the coalface of the health service, working on the front line and, in so doing, earning the respect of the patients and communities they serve.  They are usually the first port of call for those seeking to access health services.  Removing financial barriers to access is extraordinarily progressive and will be of great benefit to hard-pressed parents of younger children, many of whom have a range of competing financial obligations, including mortgage payments, and to those aged over 70 years, most of whom are living on reduced incomes and must cope with a reduced cash flow.</p>  <p>  According to a recent EU-funded study, strong and effective primary care is associated with better population health, lower rates of unnecessary hospitalisation and relatively lower socio-economic inequality.  This finding was issued with the caveat that health expenditures were higher in countries with stronger primary care structures, which are, by their nature, costly.  The bottom line is that investing in good health care services delivers long-term savings.  In Cavan we have a very good network of primary care centres with state-of-the-art facilities, including those in Cavan town, Kingscourt and Bailieborough, as well as excellent services in towns such as Cootehill, Ballyjamesduff and Virginia.  However, there is always scope to do more.  I ask the Minister to ensure funding for primary care services remains a top priority for him and his Department as we budget for 2016.  In particular, home help provision and back-up supports are vital for those who care for others in the home.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Bill which inserts a new section 58A(1) in the 1970 Act puts in place a new legal arrangement which will ensure GPs provide a free-of-charge service for all persons aged 70 years and over and, where income criteria are met, their dependants.  This means that in the case of a married couple, where one partner is under the age of 70 years and provided that their joint income does not exceed &euro;1,400 per week - a perfectly reasonable figure and nobody could suggest there should be an increase in that threshold - both partners will access free GP care.  There has been some criticism of the legislation to the effect that it will be of more benefit to those with higher means, with those with lower means losing out.  Bearing in mind the threshold mentioned, that is hardly the case in this instance.</p>  <p>  The service needs to be supported by restoration of the reduction in the respite care grant of &euro;300 or whatever the figure was.  There is a need for strong support through carer's allowance and ancillary benefits to ensure we have a good primary care system because if we have carers, we will have a good system.</p>  <p>  I am glad to note that the allocation of discretionary medical cards increased by 56%, from 52,000 last year to 81,000 this year.  That is positive.  A mechanism must be put in place to give such cards to people with a chronic illness, illnesses that are extremely expensive to manage, and who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  While probity and other proper processes must be maintained, the procedure must be made as simple and as accessible as possible.</p>  <p>  We have achieved a lot in this legislation, on which we can only build.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar; the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Government on making a very progressive start in this area of health service delivery.</p></speech>

We have ten minutes each.</p>  <p>  Our health system is in itself unhealthy.  Based on a two-tiered system, it both perpetuates and exploits inequality by prioritising those who can afford health care over those who need it.  Privatisation has destroyed our health care system and it is the antithesis to a community-based approach.  The large number of people on medical cards, accounting for 43% of the population, and the falling number of people availing of private insurance are all signs of an unaffordable system due to these privatisation policies.  Privatisation has exacerbated the crisis of waiting lists in the public system across the country and elderly people have literally been pushed aside to the margins, on trolleys in accident and emergency department corridors, living in emergency wards for months on end, unable to afford a place in a nursing home or with insufficient care packages or for some, none at all.  That is the most shameful aspect of privatisation policies imposed by consecutive governments; it is a system that marginalises the most vulnerable.  Elderly people have not only been dragged through numerous Government policy changes over the years but they are the most vulnerable to those changes in the health care system.  Age Action Ireland states, "it is those with the least means, often needing the most intervention and care, who are the current losers".  It is  clear that we must move away from a privatisation model towards a universal one based on the need of services.  The only way to achieve that is through the development of a primary care system with universal health care at its core.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this Bill, although positive in its intention and for its recognition of carers, contains unrealistic expectations.  First, it assumes that a primary care system already exists which could support the introduction of GP cards for those aged over 70.  Second, it assumes a free GP card will be sufficient to meet the needs of people aged over 70.  Research has consistently proven that primary care is the best system both in terms of equal access and cost effectiveness.  Strong primary care is associated with better population health, lower rates of unnecessary hospitalisations and relatively lower socioeconomic inequality.  Countries with strong primary care systems spend less on health care.  However, Ireland is the only EU health system that does not offer universal coverage for primary care.  Nearly 1 million people will be aged over 65 by 2031, which will be an increase of more than 86% or an extra 20,000 people per year.  How can the Government expect our current system to facilitate such an annual increase in the demand of our health services?  How can we expect GPs to alleviate this pressure on top of existing costs and demand?</p>  <p>  GP care is central to the primary care model.  In the words of the authors Freeman and Moran, GP care "represents a powerful means of alleviating the anxiety, discomfort, and incapacity that come from sickness and ill health".  GPs could provide many outpatient procedures, tests and check­ups in primary care centres, moving patients away from hospitals and into our local communities but that could only be done with adequate investment.  In a primary care setting GPs would essentially take a medical advocacy role co-ordinating patient care according to the needs of the individual.  </p>  <p>  While GPs are central to primary care, other health care professionals also need to be supported.  Nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and others all contribute to a community model of health provision.  However, structural issues exists which are not recognised under this legislation.  Less than 20% of GPs work with more than four other GP colleagues in the same practice, suggesting it is not the norm for GPs to work alongside other health professionals.  This work culture will make it difficult to establish a fully integrated health care system.</p>  <p>  While this Bill attempts to respond to an ageing population, it has avoided responding to the changing profile of the GP sector.  The sector is also ageing as younger doctors are emigrating or moving away from GP practice.  There is a growing preference for flexible hours and early retirement and an increase in the numbers holding vocational training.</p>  <p>  There is now significant shortfall and geographical disparity in the supply of GPs and health inequality is becoming an increasing worry.  We are witnessing, especially in Donegal, a declining proportion of GPs working in rural areas, a decline from 33% in the early 1990s to 22% in 2005, and in Donegal there are only 48 per 100,000 of the population compared to 64 nationally.  Therefore, long-term planning and investment are vitally needed to ensure that our health service can sustain the pressure of an ageing population as well as meeting the needs of those through all stages of the lifecycle.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to prioritise the rollout of these proposed primary care networks and move away from damaging privatisation policies.  Primary care has been talked about for over a decade now with very little results.  The Government's report card on health care investment has shown there has been a failure in terms of progressing it and we still have not seen a primary care Act, a primary care fund or recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other professionals in the primary care area.  It was envisioned that 400 to 600 of primary care teams, two thirds of the full requirement, would be established by 2011, but only 247 have been established four years on and to date there are 85 primary care centres in operation.  It was also envisaged there would be 90 primary care networks across the country, each with about four or five primary care teams, essentially acting as a one-stop shop providing a wide range of health services at a local level.  The Minister recently announced that 17 integrated service areas are being replaced by nine community health care organisations and that existing resources will be reorganised into 90 primary care networks but we still do not know what is the status of the primary care networks.  Many organisations representing elderly people have been critical of the pace at development of primary care health centres and health teams.  Unfortunately, at this late stage, moving towards a community-based approach will take time as large-scale structural reforms need to take place.</p>  <p>  According to the National Association of General Practitioners, we are so far away from achieving this model that it is too late for the current Government to make any changes in time for the next election and it will not be until the middle of the term of the next Government that we might see some changes being made.  Instead of using the elderly population as political capital in time for the next election, why not use the funding, time and resources to invest in a primary care infrastructure to ensure that universal health care can become a reality for all?</p>  <p>  The Bill is naive in assuming that GP cards given to all those aged over 70 means their needs will be met.  It presumes that our current system is highly developed with enough GPs and a fully comprehensive health system to address the complex nature of elderly health needs.  The principle makes sense but the Bill is misleading.  People are often put off going to the doctor because of costs, and those who have a GP card tend to visit the GP on average two visits more per year, which means that overcrowding in emergency departments may ease.</p>  <p>  However, a GP card will not grant those aged over 70 access to the wide range of community services available under a medical card.  A GP card does not cover hospital visits, community health services, dental services, prescription medicine costs, hospital care, optical or aural services, social work services and community services.  The IMO expressed concern that GP cards are seen as an alternative to medical cards, when the two are not comparable.  What use would a GP card be to someone aged over 70 whose visit is paid but whose further needs will come at a cost?</p><p>If we were cynical we might assume that the PCRS will use the fact that the over 70s have GP cards as a way of reducing the number of medical cards given to people in that age group.  I envisage that the more elderly people visit the doctor, the more treatment they will need and the more they will need access to other primary care services which they currently cannot afford or cannot access.  Could this mean that the quality of GP care to patients across the population will decrease as a result of this cyclical pressure?  Already our community-based services cannot meet demand from elderly people for supports to live in their own homes and communities.  There has also been a lack of capital investment to replace or refurbish community nursing facilities.</p> <p> It must be made clear that a GP card does not mean universal health care and it is not correct to say that universal health care means only a free visit to a doctor.  The two should not be confused.  Today there is still no right to health care in the Irish Constitution or through any statutory provision even though Ireland is a signatory to Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR, which recognises the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.</p> <p> Universal access to health care on the basis of need must be recognised in our legislation as a right for all citizens before it is at risk of privatisation again.  Recently the Minister for Health imposed a deadline for those under 34 years of age to acquire private health insurance and we have seen Government proposals to increase nursing home charges for elderly people using community-based services.  We also saw the Minister for Health appear in advertisements for private health insurance companies, encouraging people to take out health insurance.  How does this equate with the commitment to a universal health care system?  These are worrying developments as they signify the possible privatisation of our entire health care system in the future.  In the meantime, doctors and patients do not want to see another primary care strategy or a mini-primary care strategy.  We all want to see a structured, reliably funded investment programme for GP practice so that our primary care system can be developed.  Building primary care clinics does not equate to the development of integrated primary care services; nor does the number of team meetings happening indicate progress in this regard.  Only the health of our patients will indicate this Government's progress.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that young families with children under six and elderly people will see some bit of light.  There are a lot of families who are struggling throughout the country.  People with young children often try to be the doctor at home, rather than paying the &euro;50 fee.  If children have the flu or some such, their parents will often fall back on the old medicines that their fathers and mothers before them used because &euro;50 is not easy to come by for many.  In that context, this move is a step in the right direction.  The argument will be made that the rich will be able to avail of it and that is true but if we can help people in middle-class Ireland who do not have medical cards, then that must be welcomed.  That said, I know that when they go to the chemist, they will still have to put their hand in their pocket but every pound saved is good.  In terms of the elderly, many of whom worked all their lives, I would go further and give them full medical cards.  Many of them deserve it because they fought the good fight down through the years.  The number of people over 70 is growing all of the time and we should do whatever we can for them.</p>  <p>  As other Deputies have said, great rural doctors have done so much all over the country.  One could throw a stone up at their window at night and they would come out to help with a sick child or relative.  Such doctors are getting scarcer however and now when one calls a doctor out of hours there is often a problem.  In many parts of Ireland - people are afraid to say it - doctors are covering for local GPs and it is very hard to understand a lot of them, with all due respect.  Generally one is told to head for the hospital when, in a lot of cases, there is absolutely no need to do so.  We could be treating more problems at home.  That problem has to be addressed and we must start with its root cause, which is where doctors go after college.  We are educating a lot of youngsters in college and we must introduce some enticement for them to stay in this country.  People are spending seven years at college and a lot of funding is invested in their education.  We must give them some incentive to work here rather than go off to the sun the minute they qualify.  We must address that problem because statistics indicate that the numbers are dwindling in rural Ireland.  There is no point in trying to hide from that fact.  People are having to travel longer distances to find a doctor.  It is not as appealing to be a doctor in rural Ireland if the numbers living in the area are diminishing.  We must do a bit of soul searching in this regard and do whatever is necessary to keep youngsters at home.  We have a very good education system and the doctors who qualify here are of a very high calibre and we should do something to make sure that they stay.</p>  <p>  Currently I am dealing with a seven year old child who needs an operation which is not available in this country.  Even if families are given a GP visit card, the sad reality is that there are children who have to go to other lands for operations and their families are fund raising in order for this to happen.  Every child is special to his or her mother and father.  Every parent wants to see his or her child growing up and we should try to facilitate them in whatever way we can.  Medicine is moving on constantly and more operations are being carried out in different fields but there are still things that we, as a nation, need to do to make sure that these youngsters are given a chance.  I spoke to a family recently who are trying to raise funds for their child to go to America and it is sad that we cannot provide the necessary care in this country.  The Minister for Health is relatively new in the job and given that he comes from the field of medicine, he probably understands it better than most.  I urge him to think outside the box and do things that were never done before because that is the only way we will achieve things.</p>  <p>  Another issue of major concern all over Ireland is the fair deal scheme.  Farmers, whether male or female, who have land are finding that the fair deal keeps eating into their package of land the whole time, even after the initial three years.  It keeps going at it.  It is a different scenario in every other situation and I encourage the Minister to look at that.  There is also a lot of confusion out there about insurance.  I spoke to a person recently who is 54 and who has no health insurance cover.  He heard about the new health insurance scheme that he was supposed to join but he did not know if he would have to pay a 50% fine if he did not go into the scheme on the first day.  There is a lot of confusion about that.  It would be no harm to prepare and distribute a booklet on the matter to help people to understand it.  I have spoken to many people and discovered that they have not grasped what is involved, particularly those who do not watch a lot of television.  A lot of people are asking a lot of questions about what the insurance policy will cover.</p>  <p>  Long before I ever came into the D&aacute;il there was talk of providing universal health insurance for everyone.  We heard that it would be 2019 or 2020 before it could happen but now we seem to be going down a different road entirely involving everyone having private health insurance.</p><p>As with any other scenario, this is because the powers that be like to move people through the system fairly fast as a result of the money which can be realised via some of the private hospitals.  I am concerned about this matter because I am aware of people with various complications who were admitted to private hospitals and who then had to be transferred to public ones which had the technology and facilities necessary to treat them.  I hope the position in this regard will be reconsidered.</p> <p> I welcome much of what the Government is doing.  However, we should examine the possibility of extending free GP care to children over the age of six.  I accept that things might be somewhat easier now but in the past year children who were genuinely entitled to medical cards were refused them.  It does not matter whether one is three, six, nine or 12 years of age, if one needs treatment, then one must have it.  There should not be a distinction between children who are five and a half years of age and those who are six and a half.  In view of what is proposed, the parent of a child of five and a half can bring him or her to the doctor immediately if he or she is concerned.  However, the parent of a child who is six and a half might think twice as a result of the financial cost involved.  This is a major problem.</p> <p> Anything that will assist people who are under pressure financially is welcome.  Those whose children are going to qualify for free GP care, will bring them straight to the doctor and will not take risks because there will be no cost involved.  In general, one must welcome any development of this nature.</p></speech>

I welcome the developments taking place, particularly those relating to senior citizens and children under the age of six.  As a result of what is proposed in the Bill, everybody who reaches the age of 70 will now be able to go to his or her doctor and will not be charged for the privilege.</p><p>I wish to comment on a number of cases with which I recently dealt in the course of my work as a Deputy.  One such case involved a 95 year old man who previously had a medical card but who lost his entitlement to it.  The trauma experienced by him and his family was both unbelievable and heartbreaking.  Notwithstanding the fact that the individual in question has an income which is not small, he had a medical card for 25 years.  It was absolutely unacceptable to his family that he, at 95 years of age, was informed he was going to lose the card.  What happened had a significant and adverse impact on the man's health.  He felt he was no longer needed or wanted.  In particular, he was of the view that he was a burden to his family.  The good news in this case is that earlier today I received a call from a member of his family to inform me that the card is to be restored until 2017.  It was a major battle for the man's family to achieve this result.  They were obliged to approach various doctors and consultants and expend enormous amounts of energy to have the card - to which the man, from his perspective, is entitled and which he had previously held for 25 years - restored.  The amount of pressure exerted on the individual in question was unacceptable.</p><p>The Government should consider restoring medical cards to all of those who previously held them and who lost them when, from a financial perspective, times were very difficult.  As matters improve, we should ensure that those who lost their cards will have them restored.  In addition, cards should be restored without people having to do what the man to whom I refer was obliged to do.  I must also refer to the case of a 77 year old man who came to my office recently and who was totally out of breath.  That individual is on oxygen 18 hours a day and he lost his medical card, again for financial reasons.  He clearly has a very difficult medical condition.  The individual in question was successful in fighting to have his card restored but matters should never have reached that point.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has done an excellent job since taking up his position.  He is aware of the issues to which I refer and I ask him to address all of them either now or in the context of the forthcoming budget.  If there is any leeway in the context of the public finances - it is clear that there is - and if we are intent on cutting taxes for people, which we should do, then we should cater for the needs of those who are oldest in our society and who need greater protection.</p><p>I wish to comment on issues raised by a number of previous speakers, particularly in the context of the fair deal scheme.  There are many people in acute hospitals who are awaiting discharge.  In that context, there are alternative care arrangements to which we should give consideration.  In many instances, the community services that are in place are not as good as was previously the case.  I am aware of increasing numbers of people who are seeking home help hours and home care packages and who cannot obtain them.  I visited the home of an 80 year old woman and her 82 year old husband.  He had just returned from a day centre at which he receives dementia care.  The woman's problem is not that she cannot care for her husband - who, in addition to his dementia, has a serious medical condition and is doubly incontinent - because, by God, she is doing her very best in that regard.  Rather, this very elderly lady's difficulty is that she was offered 18 minutes worth of home help per day.  That is both appalling and unacceptable.  I have raised this case with the HSE and I hope it will be dealt with properly.  There are many people who are involved in caring in the community who could be given greater support.  The provision of 18 minutes worth of home help per day to the lady in question is simply not good enough.  I should point out that she is on the waiting list for further home care package support if and when money is made available.</p><p>Large numbers of people are being obliged to access fair deal scheme.  These individuals do not want that to be the case and they would not be involved with the scheme if the relevant services were available in the community.  It is far better to make services available in the community than it is to place people in long-term care, particularly if adequate supports can be provided to the families involved.  The Alzheimer's facility in Dundalk, County Louth, is appealing for more funds because its budget has been cut by 5%.  The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland branch in Drogheda is also seeking more money because it is not receiving the financial support it needs.  I appreciate that the Government has one further budget to introduce.  Regardless of that, we must consider how we support community services, particularly those relating to dementia care.  The problem of dementia is going to increase in the years to come.  As I understand it, every year a further 20,000 citizens are going to reach the age of 65.  The total number of those above that age is due to increase by over 200,000, or 40%, by 2021.  We must plan for that.  While it works in many cases, the fair deal scheme is not the answer in a large number of others.  There are significant alternatives which must be utilised.  If we review both the scheme and the position regarding home care packages and home help hours and invest more money in the provision of support services, it will make a huge difference.</p><p>I wish to address a particular issue relating to home care.  The role of migrant carers has been acknowledged and a policy relating to such carers must be formulated and implemented.  As a recent report indicates:<blockquote>The racial and cultural differences of care providers and recipients of care must be respected within domestic and long-stay care settings. Older residents, their families and the public need to be assisted in adapting  to changes in the ethnic and cultural mix of care staff taking place within care organisations.</blockquote>It also states that &quot;Increased resources and support structures for education, training, orientation and integration should be introduced for migrant carers and Irish staff to cope with multicultural care environments&quot;.  I came across a very sad case recently whereby the person involved insisted that their care should be provided by a person of a particular ethnicity.  The cost of that care increased by over &euro;2,000 per month in order that the demands of that individual, who is paying for the care privately, might be met.  Clearly we need to examine the possibility of increasing the level of resources available in respect of integrating care providers.</p><p>Appropriate structures must be put in place for the reporting of racial abuse and labour exploitation at organisational, regional and national level.  Better information should be provided on migrant rights and entitlements, particularly in respect of employment and equality regulations.</p> <p> I congratulate the Minister on his successes to date, but in coming budgets we have to help that cohort of people over the age of 70 years who have reared their families and paid their dues.  They want to live at home and their families want to support them.  We must provide more resources to support community care, including home care and home help packages.  The current system is almost like a factory.  When patients are discharged from acute hospitals, their only option is a long-term care institution if adequate support is not available.  It is far cheaper to support people at home than to put them into long-term institutions which are not necessarily the best place for them.</p></speech>

I refer to the previous Opposition speaker who called a spade a spade and acknowledged that what we were doing was good for young couples and children.  It is welcome when Opposition Members refrain from knocking a proposal for the sake of it.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for Health for delivering on his commitment to grant free GP care for everybody over the age of 70 years.  This is part of the Government's policy of rolling out universal GP care for the entire population.</p>  <p>  When my children were very young, I was continually running to the doctor if a child had a temperature or a runny nose because of the risk that it would lead to something more serious.  That remains the reality for many young couples.  A GP fee of &euro;50 or &euro;60 is a scandalous amount of money to treat a baby that may be only three or four months old.  As parents of young children are often anxious and want to do the best for them, they are likely to make multiple trips to their GP.  The new arrangements will also alleviate pressure on the children's hospitals because parents are presenting to emergency departments instead of going to their GPs in the first instance.</p>  <p>  I have met a significant number of older people who have lost their medical cards and some of them are very angry about it.  Most of them worked for their entire lives, but they are being excluded because of their earnings, in many cases from private pension arrangements.  The Bill is a step in the right direction because it will give them the opportunity to access GP care.  It will also help to reduce the pressure on emergency departments in adult hospitals.  If elderly people have the opportunity to visit their GP in the first instance, there is an opportunity to deal with a serious illness at an early stage.</p>  <p>  Other speakers referred to primary care services.  A number of primary care centres have been established in my constituency, including in Ballyfermot and Inchicore.  They have brought huge benefits to everybody, from young to old.  I meet people on a daily basis who express the greatest of respect for the successful revitalisation of previously poor quality health centres, with their green walls and smell of disinfectant, which have been replaced by modern facilities where one can see a community nurse, a doctor or a mental health professional.  That is a step in the right direction and demonstrates the Government's commitment to dealing with this issue.  It has been a slow process and we are under no illusion that it was a struggle for everybody who has had to contend with cuts, but the fact that primary care centres are getting the seal of approval in communities is a hopeful sign that we are doing the right thing.</p>  <p>  The Bill is the second step in the Government's phased introduction of universal free GP care, as proposed in the programme for Government in 2011 and restated in 2014.  This is the first time that any Government has tried to introduce universal health cover.  We have to take small steps because we are not in a financial position to make big leaps.  Buckets of money were poured into the health service in the past.  I do not know what holes that money filled, but it certainly did not go into local hospitals.</p>  <p>  At this critical stage in providing GP care for children under the age of six years, I appeal to GPs to come on board.  I acknowledge that they have reasons for their doubts, but care should never be put ahead of profits.  I have spoken to a number of GPs who are very much in favour of these changes, but others have complained that they will not have the same level of earnings.  We are moving in the right direction.  Most doctors take their oath to look after sick people.</p>  <p>  When this legislation is enacted, 36,000 people will no longer have to pay for GP visits.  This will be an important change for senior citizens because it will remove the financial stress associated with visiting a doctor.  Our relationship with GPs is a vital link with the health service and it is important that older people in the community who have health complaints do not struggle to cope alone.  The GP is the first port of call for all of us and I believe many GPs will come on board to deliver the services needed.</p></speech>

We are sure to be on a good thing if the Opposition is calling for its provisions to be extended to a larger cohort.  Usually all we hear from the Opposition benches is empty rhetoric in which the Government is accused of a power grab or making promises we never keep.  We have been accused in the past of breaking promises on health policy, securing economic recovery or taking people off the dole queues.  The reality is that we are either delivering or have delivered on every promise we made.  This is borne out by the fact that Ireland is the fastest growing European economy.  We have taken 400,000 people out of the USC net and reduced PRSI.  The dole queues have been reduced from 15% to 10%.</p>  <p>  One of the pillars of our health strategy was to introduce free GP care as a start in moving to universal health care, particularly for those aged under six years or over 70.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Health and his negotiating team for managing to get the issue of care for children under six years over the line with GPs.  I acknowledge the cuts with which GPs have had to contend due to the economic crisis.  We will be taking larger strides towards recovery in the future, which I hope will allow us to invest more money in health services.  The Bill implements our commitments in the programme for Government, as restated in the statement on the priorities for Government published in 2014.</p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne has pointed out that 36,000 people over the age of 70 years are currently paying for GP visits, even after working and paying into the PRSI system for their entire lives.  It is time we started to give something back to them as a cohort rather than based on their individual means.  It should be a universal right that a person who reaches the age of 70 years has access to free GP care.</p><p>The basis behind this is not just to return services to people through the money, but to facilitate and progress the healthy Ireland initiative started by the Government.  This will provide diabetes treatment and asthma treatment for children under six, which will be taken on by GPs.  It will also allow for healthy Ireland initiatives to be taken for those over 70.  This is very welcome.</p> <p> Many people over 70 have been entitled to GP and medical cards in the past, but the application process has been cumbersome and worrying for them.  That is going and now these people will automatically receive their cards.  I welcome this and the fact that their spouses who are younger than them will also receive these cards.  Access is key to preventative care, medicines and holistic treatments that will ensure we have a healthy Ireland.  I look forward to the day I can stand in this Chamber to welcome the next Bill that will include those over six and under 70.</p> <p> I commend this Bill to the House.  The Government is one that keeps it promises and we look forward to doing that over the next 12 months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1184" speakername="Billy Timmins" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600041#OO00200"><p>It is easy to support this legislation.  I like to think that people on this side of the House take a progressive and pragmatic approach to legislation.  However, while I support the Bill, it does raise issues.  A number of years ago when driving in by Dolphins Barn one Tuesday morning, I saw a nice big yellow sign which promised free GP care for all.  I felt a little sick on seeing it because, as we all know, nothing is free.  There is a cost for everything and somewhere down the line somebody must pay.  It is important to try to market our policies correctly, but rather than try to be populist, we should be open about the consequences of such a policy.</p>  <p>  I have a concern regarding the concept of universal benefits, be they third level fees, health care or something else.  I could pick at this legislation and ask whether it is fair any billionaire over 70 would have free GP access while somebody younger in financial difficulty who is just over the qualifying limit cannot have that access.  However, in the area of health, more than elsewhere, the argument can be made that by providing people with access, we will save money in the long term.  I have listened to some of the figures trotted out suggesting that people who have to pay for GP visits are less likely to visit the doctor.  Perhaps the corollary of that is that people who have free GP cards are more inclined to visit GPs and waste their time.  I know from GP practices around the country that many of them are frequented by the same people all the time.</p>  <p>  I am loath to comment here at times - due to the use of social media and the fact there are so many people with little to do except to put their comments on the Internet or on Twitter - without giving an introduction, a preamble and a conclusion.  Nevertheless, I would have been a supporter of the basic charge for prescriptions, not as a means of raising revenue but as a means of ensuring respect for the service.  In general, people do not appreciate what they get for free, be it unearned rewards they receive financial or otherwise.  We should look at a basic charge for prescriptions, for example a &euro;1 charge or one linked to the consumer price index.</p>  <p>  This legislation has been welcomed by most bodies, but I understand it was not welcomed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  One can always pick out a weakness in policy and consider that money could be better spent.  However, in principle it is a good idea to give people access to medical facilities, particularly in the context of prevention.  I understand this measure will cost in the region of &euro;18 million.  This is a small amount in the general scheme of things and will provide for 36,000 people.  Some 10% of those over 70 do not currently have free GP care.  While this legislation does not deal with children under six and I have not seen any costs in regard to providing this access, I am not as comfortable with the idea of providing free GP care for those under six as I am with providing it for those over 70.  Other speakers have referred to free GP access for children under six and currently approximately just over 40% of those under six have that access.</p>  <p>  Recent research showed that during the economic downturn people were less likely to visit GPs and it has been suggested this may be due to GP fees.  There is huge diversity in fees charged across the country.  People in both the public and private sector have taken a hit in their wages.  I note that at the public service reform and innovation conference today, the public sector declared an increase in productivity will not be part of any deal.  I am not sure what hymn sheet the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, is singing from currently, but he seems to be caught between two stools.  He will suggest there must be increased productivity as a result of this legislation.  We must all, politicians included, put our shoulders to the wheel.</p>  <p>  I believe it would make life easier for people if they saw a reduction in the cost of services.  Accountancy fees have been reduced, but legal fees have not.  I do not believe there have been any radical reductions in medical fees.  Much of the reason for the failure to reduce fees is the lack of competition and the existence of monopolies.  Wherever we find monopolies and a lack of competition, it is hard to drive down fees.  If people saw a reduction in energy fees or insurance costs, it would be easier for them to accept a reduction in their wages.  However, if people's wages are reduced, but the cost of services remains the same or increases, it is difficult for them to accept lower wages.  On increased fees, I notice the clampers in a hospital in the Minister's area are seeking to increase clamping fees from &euro;80 to &euro;120 or &euro;130.  However, I have often thought parking or speeding fines should be reduced, unless there is clear evidence they act as a deterrent and ensure better road safety and smoother traffic flow.</p>  <p>  There is not much to be said about this legislation as it is straightforward.  Many people raised constituency issues and examples.  It is important to recount these as these accounts inform policy.  We can talk about health services and funding, but we must be prepared to recount the stories of those we meet who have had bad experiences.  Few of us talk here about good experiences.  Human nature being what it is, we are not inclined to articulate those experiences.  Deputy Durkan is a strong advocate of pushing issues that illustrate wrongs and we all work on the basis that everything else is working smoothly.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of an educational course provided in Britain for people in the medical profession, consultants and doctors, who must relay information, particularly bad news, to clients.  Time and again I have met people who have been dealt with in an insensitive manner.  This is understandable where there may be a language difficulty or where the doctor or consultant is under pressure.  However, each case is individual to the patient or his or her family.  I would like to see the Minister bring forward some proposal in this regard.  A number of years ago we had a patients' charter, but I do not know whether it had any provision for this.  Perhaps we should look at what has been done in Britain and arrange a seminar.  We should ensure that when information is being relayed to people, particularly on occasions when people are being informed of a terminal illness, they are given privacy and dealt with in a sensitive manner.  This happens in most cases, but not in all.  Insensitivity can leave a terrible and negative impression on service users, yet this is an issue that could be dealt with quite easily.</p>  <p>  I am aware of a case in Waterford where an individual waiting to see a dermatologist has been on the waiting list since 2007.  I have not got to the bottom of this issue yet.  I have been told there is a shortage of dermatologists and that interviews are due to take place.  Eight years is a long time for someone with a skin problem to be waiting.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> Deputy Naughten referred to the issue of capacity.  I do not know what impact this will have on capacity but GPs are under a lot of pressure.  The Minister will have heard their stories at their conference last week.  Hacketstown in Carlow is across the border from me.  A GP there has given a lifetime of service and he is finishing up at the end of this week.  He covers a rural area in Wicklow and Carlow.  It may be very difficult to find a replacement for him and there may be pressure on his replacement to move to a more populated area with a primary care service with extensive facilities.  I am a strong advocate of the primary care concept but this should not be at the expense of the rural-based doctor.  People in rural communities like the doctor to be based locally.  They do not want to be travelling 15 or 20 miles to a primary care centre.  It is not possible to have a doctor in every parish but if a rural population can support the service then pressure should not be put on the doctor to go to the primary care centre.  I refer to the monopoly situation where the GP has control over the medical lists and the new GP is unable to access it.  I ask if the Minister plans to address that issue.  </p> <p> Much good work has been done in the health service but I note a situation which affects my constituency and also parts of south Dublin.  I refer to the STEMI centre in St. Vincent's hospital which provides emergency care for cardiac arrest.  It seems that it has been decided to close the unit with effect from this Friday.  This leaves two units, one in St. James's Hospital and one in the Mater hospital but people from south Dublin or the east coast will have to go to those hospitals.  I hoped to raise this matter as a Topical Issue on budget day last year but it was deferred.  I have been trying to ascertain the situation from the HSE.  The Minister may not be familiar with the situation but it would be catastrophic to close it.  I am glad to hear it is not a funding issue-----</p></speech>

The Minister is familiar with the community first responders in Wicklow who work day and night to ensure immediate medical access.

I welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for bringing this legislation to the House.  The Bill provides for universal GP service to be available without fees to everyone aged 70 years and over.  This Bill is only one step in the process of providing free GP care to all our citizens.  About 36,000 senior citizens will benefit and 436,000 children will benefit as a result of the agreement with the IMO on free GP care for those under six.  The next step is to see about introducing a free universal GP service for all children under the age of 18.  This Bill continues the process by providing the oldest and the youngest with free GP care with the aim of providing that care to all children which is very desirable.</p>  <p>  This Bill is the ideal template for dealing with the most vulnerable.  Health and education are essential for all citizens.  We have provided free education, which is essential.  Nobody argues against the idea of universal free education and any talk about reducing free access to third level is opposed from all quarters.  Health is equally essential for citizens.  To be in a position to provide a universal free health service to the most vulnerable in our society and to expand it on a phased basis to all citizens, is an ideal to which we all aspire.  I am delighted that we have taken the first important steps in its delivery.  I look forward to the next steps being taken to provide the full level of GP services to all our citizens free of charge.</p>  <p>  The current system of means testing for access to health care stigmatises the poor.  It is very bureaucratic and is the subject of all sorts of difficulties and rows.  In this House no issue gets more attention than the health issue.  The provisions in the Bill will help to limit the bureaucracy while increasing the quality of the service.</p>  <p>  The provision of primary care centres is essential for dealing with the level of difficulty experienced for decades in our hospitals.  The accident and emergency service is cumbersome in its operation and it is used as the first port of call by many people.  A free GP service will help to relieve pressure on accident and emergency departments.  The primary care centres soon to be available in all constituencies will provide at local level services such as GP care, public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and dietitians.  People will be able to receive treatment in their own community and this is the way forward.  This service will be in tandem with the provision of free GP care.  I refer to four primary care centres being developed in my constituency.  One centre is open and serving the public in the Navan road area and serving Cabra west, which is well known to the Minister.  Three other centres are planned for Summerhill, North Strand and Grangegorman.</p>  <p>  This package of measures is the most fundamental change in the delivery of health services in many a long decade.  It will deal with many of the issues that currently cause significant grief to citizens.  There is the danger that GP fees will prevent people from attending a medical practitioner and leaving their medical problems to a later stage which may be very dangerous in the case of many illnesses.  The sooner the treatment the more likely a successful outcome.  Anyone suffering from an illness or condition will be able to attend a GP without undue delay.</p>  <p>  This Bill is an important, logical and sensible step.  I look forward to a move to universal health care in the same way as we have gradually moved to universal education for all our citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600042#PP00500"><p>In common with other speakers I welcome this initiative.  I thank the Minister and his Department for progressing both of these initiatives as they apply to children under six years of age and adults over 70 years of age.  No one is arguing on this side of the House that this is some sort of revolutionary change in the whole health system but it should be acknowledged that given the economic climate and the difficulties with the finances, it is an achievement that we can make any progress in the area of health.</p><p>It is also an acknowledgement by the Department that not every adult over the age of 70 years has the financial resources to go to see the GP when he or she wants to do so.  Likewise, all of us who are practising politicians understand there are families with children under the age of six years who have the same difficulty.  They may wish to take their child or children to the doctor, but that is not always possible if one does not have the money to do so.  There are hard-pressed families who are in that position.  The Bill acknowledges this, which is the progressive element of the Government's policies.  It is an illustration of a society that is more caring in the health area, which is good.</p> <p> Some very positive contributions have been made showing much common sense, but I am always amazed at the level of begrudgery from some Opposition Members towards any initiative, whether it relates to health, education or job creation.  Certain speakers, some of whom may have been here for a long time - perhaps for too long, but that is another matter &ndash; appeared to be in a delusional state and to think nothing had happened in this country seven years ago and that people had money at the bottom of their garden.  I heard people talk about various issues, including trolleys and waiting lists.  Any politician with a morsel of sense would not come to the House to criticise the Government for what it was doing to improve the health system.  They act as if nothing happened, as if young people volunteered to emigrate and others to stand in the queues for the live register.  I am appalled at the naked begrudgery and lack of acknowledgement of what I consider to be a modest but important health initiative.</p> <p> I am trying to avoid references to areas about which other speakers have spoken.  However, I must acknowledge one initiative which bears repetition, given the incidence of asthma in the country.  I commend the inclusion in the GP contract of an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma and the annual review of children diagnosed with asthma.  It is an extremely important measure.  The Minister is better qualified than I - I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong - but to the best of my knowledge, the incidence of asthma is very high in particular among the working class or poorer people.  There are a variety of reasons for this which we will not go into, but in my constituency I am aware of more than one family with two or three children with asthma.  The asthma care programme is one measure which will be welcomed by families who find themselves in that predicament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600043#QQ00200"><p>Like other speakers,I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak about this particularly welcome legislation.  I compliment the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on their efforts in moving on the health service as nothing remains as it is.  In recent years it was very easy during the difficult times to be critical of everything that happened.  It was very easy also to have the solution to everything and know what could be done, while knowing very little about the cost of how to do it.  Even in those very difficult circumstances we should congratulate the Government and the Ministers responsible for seeing fit to proceed in this fashion at this time.  Of course, it is not the solution to everything.  Neither is it the conclusion of the matter.  I accept that it is not the adoption of universal health care that was originally intended, but it is part of the way and a step in that direction.  Those who have criticised the starting position have asked about children aged over six years.  However, one could also ask about children aged under six.  One could equally have the same degree of anxiety about serious illnesses in children aged less than six as those over six.  We are, however, moving in the right direction.  The same is true of people aged over 70 years.  In the first instance, it is a question of providing reassurance.  People who may feel a little vulnerable and isolated, who are not in the best of health, can at least have one service readily available to them, namely, the GP service.  That is something good which will ultimately save money because it will cost less rather than more to address the health needs of those aged over 70 years.  As attention can be paid to people at an earlier stage, earlier diagnoses can be made and action taken which might otherwise be too late.  It is also in keeping with the 21st century that we move in that general direction.</p>  <p>  In recent days I heard criticism from speakers on the other side of the House.  They referred to the Dutch system, the French system and various other models of health care around the world.  There are nearly as many models as there are economic theories.  The same was evident in the context of the economy.  Reference was made to the Icelandic system, the Swedish model and the Danish model.  One would not find as many models at a fashion show.  Even in difficult times of financial stress we can learn from what has happened before and work within the exigencies within which we are forced to work and, in fact, improve the quality of service all around, which is what is happening.</p>  <p>  The general perception appears to be that the quality of the health service is not as good as it is elsewhere.  That is not true.  There may be a difficulty in getting into the system or appointments and there may be waiting lists, but, with one or two exceptions, everyone admits that once a person gets into the system, the quality of the service is good.  While comparisons can be made, in this country we have the best in the business when it comes to dealing with any medical issue that arises.  Unfortunately, we live in an era when criticism comes easy.  It is very easy to criticise all those who make the odd mistake, or more than one, but we have the ability to provide the best services in the world, as we have proved many times.</p>  <p>  An issue that has come to the fore in recent times is the logistics of delivering the service.  I have always believed it is a management issue.  The simpler the system is, the easier it is to manage and the better, more effective and efficient it is to operate.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware that if we were to arrange a waiting list system for constituents to visit us in our constituency offices, we would never get our day&rsquo;s work done because the queue would get longer.  A system must be found in the health service to eliminate waiting lists.  I can never understand what happens.  If there is a waiting list, it grows.  There is something wrong if that happens.  One can ask whether it is because we do not have enough personnel to deal with it or because the population is growing and the demand is greater or is it a combination of the two.  Whatever the reason, it is part of the equation and it should be possible to deal with the issue effectively.  We heard about the UK model also.  The NHS becomes overloaded, too, and also has waiting lists.  Accident and emergency departments become overcrowded in the United Kingdom also.  We are not unique, therefore, in that regard, but that is not to say we should not improve because we do need to improve in these areas.</p>  <p>  I have spoken previously about primary care which is a hugely important part of the health service.  From a previous incarnation I have experience of the operation of the health service, but I accept that it is not medical experience.  The management of the system is important in terms of how to deliver a good quality of service to an increasing population.  The population is nearly double what it was in the mid-1950s and there has been a considerable increase in demand on the health service.  I presume there are fewer hospital beds because thousands of beds were available previously.  Medical science and the method of conducting operations have changed.</p><p>It does not necessarily mean that fewer beds is a bad thing.  It is a question of how we deliver the service to those who are there.  I compliment the Minister&rsquo;s recent initiative on nursing home services.  I hope that will percolate through to all our hospitals that have been experiencing overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  Overcrowding and disorganisation in the accident and emergency department does not make for a good reputation of a hospital or for the confidence of the general public.  This has happened before: in the middle of the boom there were between 3,000 and 6,000 people on waiting lists for between two and five years.  It is no harm to monitor the situation from time to time and consider how to move on.</p> <p> I believe in ensuring that adequate nursing home beds remain available at all times with the potential to accommodate an overflow in the event of a serious epidemic such as flu.  I do not understand why sometimes hospital wards are closed.  That does not make for good, efficient or safe delivery of services.  There should be an ongoing evaluation of the requirements and best practice in that area.  The general public recognises that we must pay for a service but thinks that because we pay taxes a certain amount should be free.  There is nothing free in any service.  As time goes on the cost increases.  We must become more efficient and effective in delivering the service.</p> <p> I compliment the work done and the quality of the service given by all the practitioners in the health service.  Reference has been made to the young doctors and practitioners who go overseas after qualifying.  That is sad and should not happen.  We need to deal with it, otherwise we will have a seriously depleted health service which will lack the enthusiasm, dedication and energy of that new generation of practitioners who should be coming on stream in the health service here.  I also compliment GPs throughout the country.  They can be cantankerous from time to time.  We all can I suppose.  Many GPs have built up a high quality of service over many years at great cost to themselves.  It is not unusual for such people to start work at 8 a.m. and to be still in their surgeries at 8 p.m. or 10 p.m.  They also do house calls.  I welcome the provisions being made now and hope there is general support for them and that we will see the evolution of a modern health service as befits the 21st century.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600044#RR00200"><p>I too am delighted to speak on this Bill.  We hear about targeting resources rather than giving them to people over the age of 70 who can afford to pay.  I remember the march on Leinster House, the anger and the anguish, when the last Government removed the medical cards for people over the age of 70, and the promises made from the back of a lorry outside the House by senior members of Fine Gael and others.  If that was not playing politics with it I do not know what it was.  Nonetheless they got what they wanted: they got into government.  We have a relatively new Minister now and I wish him well.  I am glad he is here today for the debate.  There are many issues and he should know more about them than I do because he is a medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  I never agreed that everybody should be entitled to GP visit cards or medical cards.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary has said this and there are others like him who are wealthy and do not need medical cards.  I do not understand why our system is not efficient enough to deal with that.  I do not accept it is too difficult and costly because with specialised information technology today we should be able to distinguish between people and not waste scarce resources on people who do not need them and have said they do not want them.  The Government could ask them to give them up.</p>  <p>  The free GP card is for those over the age of 70 but their dependants, spouses and partners under the age of 70 will continue to be means tested in order to have free access to their GPs.  How is that fair?  The spouse aged 69 or 68 and a half, might not be in the best of health while the person over the age of 70 might be in excellent health.  That is farcical. </p>  <p>  Section 2 amends section 58 of the Health Act 1970 to remove all individuals over 70 years of age from the scope of a means-tested service based on holding a medical card or GP visit card.  Instead, all persons over 70 years of age will automatically qualify for a GP service and it will not be necessary to hold a means test for a medical or GP visit card.  Since that famous march, the withdrawal of the cards and the recession, many sick people and their families, if they are lucky enough to have families, who have been waiting a long time for cards, have come to my clinic.  They are cancer patients and people with other disabling conditions and the stress and trauma of dealing with forms and sending more and more information has been enough to make them sick.  When one is seriously ill, young or old, one does not need other stresses.  One needs to be able to receive treatment and try to maintain a stable condition mentally and physically, to the best of one&rsquo;s ability.  My office has been inundated with horrific stories.  I am no different from any other public representative in this respect. </p>  <p>  The pet child of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, was free GP care for children under the age of six.  I have eight children and often in the cycle had three under the age of six.  They were normally pretty healthy, thank God, and did not have serious illnesses.  We were blessed in that respect.  A five year old who has a serious diagnosis, a disability, or some staggering disease will not have the free care when he or she turns six.  It is nonsense.  New diagnoses and treatments have turned up and people have lobbied and had to go the National Health Service, NHS, in the United Kingdom, but those treatments are now being provided here, after a battle.  The free care should be available to all or none, instead of discriminating on the basis of age.</p>  <p>  I know we cannot have a panacea for everybody but we need to improve the health services.  Good work is being done.  I returned ten minutes ago from the Mater Private Hospital.  Appointments are kept there without queues of people on trolleys.  It useful to see how a private institution can be run.  I do not know about its profitability but it is run efficiently.  I have been there several times.  I left here at 2.30 p.m. and am back with my procedure completed.  That is how the service should be run.  I have spoken to the Minister about this.  He set up a so-called dynamic team to deal with the trolley crisis but I believe the wrong people were on it.  Consultants, GPs and unions were represented on it.  Certainly they have to negotiate but not on the strategic committee.  It should involve front-line managers.  The Minister told me Grace Rothwell from South Tipperary General Hospital was on it.  There could not be a better person on it.  That is the sort of person the Minister needs, not the vested interests.  I am surprised at the Minister for allowing that to happen.  Front-line managers and workers are the only people who know how to clear the backlog.</p><p>Hospital rounds should be changed to much earlier in the mornings in order to free up beds.</p> <p> A relative of a patient in Cork University Hospital contacted me last week because ten days after finishing his treatment he could not get home.  There was no taxi service.  If they used an ambulance to bring him home they would have a free bed.  I could not understand the logic of waiting ten days to get home.  I contacted the manager in South Tipperary but she said it was a matter for Cork University Hospital, and rightly so, but there should be joined-up thinking.  A person should not be waiting for ten days to get transport home.  That is totally farcical.  I see that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, looked at the Minister, Deputy Varadlar, as if to say "Is that fellow raving again?", but I am not.  I can give the Minister the details but it should not be happening.  I have the details on my email database and the reply as well.</p> <p> We have seen the situation concerning GPs in Tipperary.  I attended a public meeting 18 months ago and we saw an excellent GP, Dr. Paddy Davern in Tipperary town, who is now in Doha or Saudi Arabia.  His wife is a nurse and they have a young family.  He was a very good doctor with some specialties and had a great practice but he could not make it viable.  The Minister knows as well as I do that GPs are under siege.  During the health crisis people were discharged quickly when Trolley Watch announced figures in our hospital in South Tipperary.  That was the answer to get rid of those waiting lists, but people were being sent home too early.  As a result, that night they were looking for Caredoc or were in the GP's surgery the next morning.  The Minister is creating the backlog, pushing people back and forth, but they are not being serviced. </p> <p> Some great treatments happened in South Tipperary General Hospital and I want to praise the management and staff there and in other hospitals too.  Once a person gets into the system some excellent treatments are carried out with good recovery rates and compassionate care, which is what it is all about.  However, we need to have some kind of sensible management.  Front-line staff must be supported but we should get rid of about four layers of middle management.  When the health boards were amalgamated we were told it would be like manna from heaven.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, said he was going to disband them and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Brian Cowen, may have said something similar.  They have not been disbanded, however, and even if they were, nobody lost any positions.  There were no job losses, so that is where the fat is.</p> <p> I am tired of saying it.  When matrons ran the hospitals there was no RSA and various other bad conditions.  We now have a plethora of mangers in charge of beds, wards, floors, hygiene and day therapy.  They are going around with flip charts to conferences and having case meetings about things.  It is a joke.</p></speech>

They are the people who should be looked after above all.  We all hope to reach that age with the help of God, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.  It is nice to have some reassurance but that is what is going on unless some Minister tackles it, and not when he comes back from his Christmas holidays and is exasperated by the problem of having so many people on trolleys.  I wish him well any time he takes a holiday, but what happened on the last occasion?  They closed down the official side of the system for almost two weeks.  Anybody who is self-employed will know that one cannot close down a service for even 24 hours because the system must go on.  No letters were sent out, no discharge letters or correspondence from doctors.  They will do the same thing next Christmas and laugh at us all.  It is disgusting, immoral and unhelpful.  </p>  <p>  We are losing rural GPs, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows being from a rural area.  There are a number of vacancies in South Tipperary and Tipperary generally.  In one area we failed to get a rural GP because there was no rural GP practice allowance.  It was well earned and negotiated by the general practitioners' union.  It was there to support them in rural areas because they need different equipment and a different dispensary set-up as there are all kinds of disadvantages.  We failed to get a GP there, however, and I have been told that there are 39 GPs in the queue awaiting approval for the rural GP practice allowance.  We cannot approve one or two because of that. </p>  <p>  We are lucky in Clogheen, which is a huge area with a wonderful small district hospital, St. Theresa's.  Two GPs who gave wonderful service wanted to retire for the last three years but could not do so.  Eventually, God was on our side because He delivered an angel to us called Dr. Melanie O'Reilly.  She applied for and got the job, so the community is blessed.  She had to invest in the surgery because it was old and much equipment was missing, but she has been denied the rural GP practice allowance.  If she has to leave because she cannot afford to stay, our district hospital will be gone as well.</p>  <p>  We have heard so much in this debate about step-down beds.  They are vital to taking those discharged from acute hospitals and allowing them to recuperate with wonderful care.  However, if Dr. O'Reilly is assigned to hospital cover and leaves the rural GP practice, our hospital is d&uacute;nta, finished.  That will be another 22-bed hospital gone.  It is a wonderful institution whose matron, Anne Halley, and her staff have given sterling service.  I was to have had a meeting tomorrow morning with the senior management there because she is not getting the support she needs.  The situation is archaic.  I plead with the Minister from the bottom of my heart, in as calm and rational manner as I can, to deal with management.  There are silly issues ongoing between senior managers about who is taking responsibility for community care and acute care.  They have been fighting over this for two years.  I have had meetings every couple of months and something was supposed to happen, yet the meetings are futile and a waste of time.  Senior managers have arrived to talk to the matron and myself.  They appear to listen attentively and promise this, that and the other, yet they do nothing.  Someone needs to catch these people and knock heads together - I do not mean physically - and get them to take responsibility.  We need to have management accountability and a support service for this hospital, which is a great institution with a wonderful young matron.  She will be driven out of the job, however, if she does not get up-line support.  </p>  <p>  HIQA is due to revisit the hospital.  Following HIQA's last inspection, recommendations were made but they have not been carried out because the management in South Tipperary General Hospital would not go out to do fire inspections, although duty bound to do so.  I hate to have to say it, but the situation is disgraceful and frustrating.  I discussed the matter with the Minister on an earlier occasion, but I am so frustrated that I am saying it on the record now.  It is a wonderful institution with wonderful staff.  My own mother died there and it is a wonderful hospital.  Many people were born there in the past, but now it has been abandoned because it is out in the sticks.  The HSE management in the south east would prefer if it was in the ocean off Ardmore.  They do not want to know about it.  </p>  <p>  There is a negligence of care by senior management and I do not say that lightly.  They have a duty of care and are being paid for that responsibility but they will not take it and support the matron of that institution.  A meeting was to be held there tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock but it has been cancelled because it could not be arranged.  That is what is going on.  I sought the meeting three weeks ago, although I should not have to be involved in it at all.  However, senior management are wilfully neglectful of their onerous responsibility.  I will give the Minister all the details afterwards.  Support structures are meant to be there for the matron, her assistant and staff.  After one of our meetings, we thankfully got permission to recruit some extra staff to come up to a minimum safety level.  Whatever way the interviews were organised, however, the three wonderful nurses had to be re-interviewed.  I do not understand it but it is a joke.  Why would our nurses and junior doctors not be on aeroplanes to other countries when they are getting that kind of treatment here?</p>  <p>  If there was any kind of management in the South Tipperary hospital system we would not have half the queues, chaos, costs and expenses that exist.  I salute rural GPs who are the engine room, main arteries and front line.  They need to be supported, as do urban GPs.  They are all self-employed people.  My own GP practice in Clonmel has about five doctors and it is like a small industry with 20 staff.  They are employers paying taxes and wages, yet they have sleepless nights.  Apart from the duty of care, they are wonderful employers in villages and towns.  One will not see anyone with placards about zero-hour contracts outside those surgeries.  They need to be supported, not stripped of resources.  </p>  <p>  We should not have divisive issues like those that arose at the conferences held last weekend, with one conference accepting a proposal and the other not.</p><p>We do not need that.  They need to be able to help the people.  They do not need their surgeries full of under-sixes because it is free.  Some people unfortunately will attend because they do not have to pay for it.  I always supported the fact that there should be some charge for medical cardholders for GP visits and some charge for prescriptions.  Unfortunately, the prescription card has gone too dear now.  There are no free lunches and I accept that.</p> <p> The GPs have to be supported.  From the point of view of their own sanity, they cannot stick it.  It is not financially viable.  They have to pay the banks.  Some of them have invested hugely in their own surgeries.  Some are getting into the new primary care centres.  They are willing to put their money where their mouth is.  They have spent a lot on their training and are still upskilling.  They have set up practices starting with one doctor, expanded and employed other doctors.  Many in County Tipperary and other counties are group doctors now and they have nurses and all kinds of services.  They are taking enormous pressure off the hospitals, doing bloods and everything else.  The hospitals would be chaotic, submerged and not able to function only for the front-line GPs doing this.  They need a bit of respect, support and, above all, the rural GPs need that allowance.  I do not know what it is, &euro;25,000 or whatever, but it is a damned lot of money when they have to raise it to buy beds and the equipment that is needed in a modern surgery.  Sometimes GPs leave and take away some equipment with them because they are still working.  It is their equipment and they are entitled to take it but it leaves a person with nothing.</p> <p> We have a wonderful angel of a doctor, a gem to have, and that is hard to get because many rural practices cannot get anyone.  We are blessed.  She comes over the mountain from Lismore, which is a nice spin, and is dedicated and committed to working with and serving the people and providing a service seamlessly and with no fuss.  She needs the support, as does St. Theresa's Hospital and the matron and staff.  This is probably replicated in many other places.  I know it is in Carrick-on-Suir and in St. Patrick's in Cashel.  Wonderful matrons and staff under huge pressure are now being forced to collect money off patients.  Mar fhocal scoir, I ask the Minister to please take seriously what I am saying and have it investigated and I will give him any details that he needs.</p></speech>

There is no regulation at present in Ireland for the registration of psychotherapists or counsellors.  There is no requirement for a qualification to practise in these areas.  It is dangerous for untrained and unskilled people to probe a person's unconsciousness.  We are dealing with extreme human vulnerability and serious damage can be done to such delicate people.  We have seen it.</p>  <p>  The eating disorder organisation, Bodywhys, has been discussing this for a number of years.  It has quite extensive complaints about treatment by unregulated counsellors.  Back in 2005 the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, which provides for the registration of persons qualifying under the title of a designated profession, was enacted.  This is for the determination of complaints concerning the fitness to practise of professionals named under the legislation.  Psychotherapy and counselling were not included as the various organisations could not agree.  Subsequently, 22 of them made a presentation to the then Minister at his request, and produced the Psychological Therapies Forum report, Submission on the statutory registration of counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 20 March, 2014, the former Minister wrote to me saying he intended in the public interest to designate by regulation the professions of counselling and psychotherapy under section 4(2) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Minister informed me he was obliged to consult the council in the first instance and give interested persons, organisations and bodies an opportunity to make representations to him concerning the proposed designation.  The Minister also informed me he had requested that his officials put the necessary arrangements in place to initiate this consultation process as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  On 20 February of the same year, the director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention of the HSE, Mr. Gerry Raleigh, stated that people in distress should avoid these services because counsellors may not be fully trained and may not be basing their counselling on best advice.  He said it was important that a person seeking psychotherapy and counselling identifies professionals who are members of the Psychological Therapies Forum, which I already mentioned and which encompasses 22 professional organisations.  This forum said it provides protection to clients but falls short of optional protection, as under the common law system it is possible for any person to take the title of counsellor or psychotherapist and to practise accordingly without training or competence.  Any person can put up a sign and say he or she is a counsellor or psychotherapist and charge the usual fee of around &euro;80 an hour to perform psychotherapy and counselling.  The previous Minister accepted that it was extremely dangerous for such untrained people to do so and that regulation should take place.</p>  <p>  I have two leaflets here - I have about a dozen more as well - one of which is advertising a so-called advanced diploma in suicide studies.  It is a course taking place over seven weekends.  There are two weeks for suicide prevention, two weeks for suicide intervention and two weeks for post-intervention.  That makes up an advanced diploma in suicide studies.  Bodywhys informed me of another diploma programme from the eating disorder resource centre of Ireland, with a certified trainer in practitioner skills for eating disorders and obesity.  The diploma is granted over an eight-weekend period.  The cost of that is &euro;370 per module, which makes it up to &euro;3,000 for the eight-week programme to obtain the diploma.  As the Minister, a qualified professional himself, knows, eating disorders are psychological, psychiatric and physical.  It is a very complex area.  I got somebody who has no interest whatsoever in eating disorders or any area of psychotherapy and counselling to apply for this diploma, and they got a reply back - I have it here - saying they could start the course the following weekend, without any background whatsoever in any branch of medicine.</p><p>As such, I would welcome an update from the Minister on the current situation in respect of the regulation of psychotherapy and counselling.</p></speech>

The regulation of the 14 professions currently designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, including the optical professions, is being implemented on a phased basis as the registration board and register for each profession is established.  To date, eight registration boards have been set up.  The registration boards for the remaining designated professions will be established between now and 2016.  In addition, the regulation of the optical professions will transfer from the Opticians Act 1956 to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Regulation under the 2005 Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles, confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions to be regulated, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  From a public protection viewpoint, a crucial milestone in the regulation of health and social care professions in Ireland was the introduction on 31 December last of the 2005 Act's fitness to practice regime which is similar to that applicable to doctors, nurses and midwives.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question of regulating counselling and psychotherapy, the current position is that, while the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not specifically designated under the 2005 Act, there are various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act, which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and-or psychotherapists will in time be regulated under the Act.  A psychologist registration board is due to be established this year and will be an additional source of advice on the question of regulating counselling and psychotherapy in the interest of protecting the public.  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Also, counsellor therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have the minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  The previous Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wrote to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council last year seeking advice on the question of specifically designating counsellors and psychotherapists under the 2005 Act.  A number of issues require clarification and there are strong differences of opinion on these issues among the various professional bodies representing counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland.  The main questions to be resolved include whether counselling and psychotherapy should be treated as one or two professions for the purposes of regulation, the title or titles of the profession or professions to be protected and the minimum qualifications that would be required.  The readiness and compatibility of the professions for designation under the 2005 Act also need to be determined.  The council's detailed report on the matter has been received in my Department in recent weeks and is being examined carefully by officials with a view to deciding the next steps.</p></speech>

Hopefully, steps will be taken to progress matters as it is now 14 months since the previous Minister asked that this be done.  There are professional bodies which do very good work on the requirements for entry on their registers, but these are not the problem.  The problem is those people who practice without any training or supervision by a professional body.  We appreciate the work done by the professional bodies to ensure there is a level of competence among their members, but these are not the issue.  The problem is those people who are not members of any association and who are not subject to any regulation.  As we know from the NGOs in the area, they can do serious damage to people who are suicidal, have eating disorders or many other psychiatric issues which would benefit greatly from professional psychotherapy and counselling.  We look forward to information in the coming weeks on the report of CORU on the registration of psychotherapists and counsellors under the 2005 Act.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right that there are a number of very strange people out there advertising their services as psychotherapists, counsellors and all sorts of other things.  Not only may they not be very good, they can also do real harm in certain circumstances.  If we are going to regulate the professions, we must ensure that we get it right.  A number of issues need to be considered, including whether it will be one profession or two, which titles should be protected and which should not, given that people can always invent a new title and start to provide a service under it, what the qualifications should be and the readiness and compatibility of the professions as things stand.  We must also look at grandparenting and the assessment of the qualifications and experience of good counsellors, particularly members of religious orders who have been providing a great service, including to my patients as a GP, but who may not fit the criteria.  Further issues include the impact on psychology and social workers and international experience.  I understand the experience in the UK has not been that good.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the matter is not on the back burner.  My officials will take a look at the document, on which I would be interested to hear the Deputy's views also.  The next stage will be a further consultation once we know what direction we are going in.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1185" speakername="Brian Walsh" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600047#UU00600"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for making the effort to attend to take it.  The Minister is very familiar with this issue which I have raised with him on a number of occasions.  I have been working on the plight of the Galway Hospice for the past three years and in that time have met with the Minister's predecessor.  I have also met with other members of Government, senior HSE officials and the Secretary General of the Department of Health, but Deputy Varadkar is the first person who really gets to the nub of the issue and appreciates the challenges faced by Galway Hospice.  I mean that sincerely and it is very encouraging that we have a Minister who takes that view.</p>  <p>  Galway Hospice is the only hospice in Ireland that has been accredited by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare and the only one in Europe which has received an international quality award for outstanding achievement in the delivery of health care.  The fact that it has achieved both of these awards against a backdrop of chronic underfunding is testament to the dedication, commitment and professionalism of the staff working at the hospice.  Galway Hospice receives proportionately the lowest amount of funding of any specialist palliative care unit in the State.  It is underresourced in other areas also.  For example, Milford Hospice in Limerick, which is the closest hospice to Galway Hospice, has 7.2 occupational therapist posts and 4.5 palliative physiotherapist posts.  By comparison, Galway Hospice has one occupational therapist and no palliative physiotherapist.  As a result of this underfunding, Galway Hospice does not have the capacity to provide vital services and is constrained in its ability to meet demand.  Patients are occupying precious and scarce acute hospital beds who should be availing of either the inpatient unit at Galway Hospice or, better again, having care provided by the Galway Hospice home care service in the comfort of their own homes.</p>  <p>  The extent of the problem is reflected in the fact that almost 50% of all deaths that take place in the acute hospital in Galway are cancer related.  By comparison, the figure at the closest hospital to ours, which is Limerick General Hospital, is 18% as there is a properly funded hospice service at Milford.  That obviously puts a strain on University Hospital Galway as well as forcing patients to receive end-of-life care in an inappropriate and undesirable environment.  While there are plans afoot to deal with the capacity shortage at the inpatient unit, the more immediate challenge is to deal with the explosion in demand for hospice services, particularly home care services.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>In 2011 there were 162 discharges from the acute hospital to Galway Hospice.  Last year the figure was 363 and it is expected to increase again this year.  The system is at near breaking point.  The time for the Government to provide additional resources is long past.  </p> <p> One weekend last month there were five patients in the acute hospital in Galway who were approved for discharge to the home care services provided by Galway Hospice.  Four of these patients were not discharged because of capacity issues in the home care services.  One patient - luckily for him - is a resident of north County Clare and was discharged because he could avail of services provided by Milford Hospice.  The Minister knows that the cost of the provision of an acute bed is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1,000 per night.  A person availing of home care services could avail of up to ten home care visits for the same resource.  This matter is in urgent need of attention.  </p> <p> There is a very negative impact on staff morale.  There has been a change in the dynamic between the public and hospice staff and there is now hostility in some cases towards hospice staff because of their inability to provide services.  This issue urgently needs the Minister's attention and I look forward to his response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600048#VV00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which I know is of great interest to him.  I particularly acknowledge his special interest in Galway Hospice and the service it provides.  </p>  <p>  It is the aim of the Government that all people will be provided with the type of palliative care service they need, regardless of what diagnosis they have received, how old they are or whether they die in a hospice, an acute hospital, a nursing home or at home.  The Health Service Executive has an annual service level arrangement with the Galway Hospice Foundation.  In 2014, &euro;3.36 million in funding was provided for the organisation.  Funding is provided for local services on the basis of the budget allocation to palliative care services at a national level.  It is normal practice for such service level agreements with hospice providers to cover all specialist palliative care services, namely, inpatient care, home care and day care.  I am informed that the allocation to Galway Hospice represents the highest rate per specialist palliative care inpatient bed in the country.  Perhaps that information is incorrect, but it is the information I have been given.  The lowest allocations are for the north east, south east and midlands, where there are few or no inpatient hospices. </p>  <p>  The HSE national director for primary care has recently been alerted, through local representation, that there are service pressures in respect of the funding for home care services being provided through Galway Hospice.  This is being investigated as a matter of urgency by the executive with local service management in Galway as it raises concerns about the provision of this vital home care service for individuals and their families.  It is recognised that hospices are usually funded through a combination of HSE funding and significant voluntary fundraising and this issue will be considered in its totality in the investigation with a view to ensuring value for money is achieved.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the position carefully and have asked for an update on progress.  On foot of our conversation earlier today, in the debate which the Deputy requested, I was in touch with the director of primary care services who has committed to examine the matter.  None of us wants to see terminally ill patients dying in hospital when they could die at home with the help of home care packages.  As is always the way with any request for additional resources - it is a very strict rule that I have - the service provider must establish and show that it provides best value for money and that it uses its existing resources to the maximum extent possible before receiving any more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1185" speakername="Brian Walsh" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600048#VV00300"><p>It is clear that value for money is provided.  If the Minister compares the cost of occupying an acute hospital bed with the cost of providing home care services and examines the knock-on and positive impact on things such as waiting lists and trolley counts, when acute hospital beds are freed up, it has to have a very positive impact.  The cost of staying one night in an acute hospital bed is &euro;1,000.  Ten home care visits could be covered for the same cost.  I do not know from where the Minister got the figures for Galway Hospice which show that it receives the highest proportion per acute bed.  However, it is worth noting that the only funding it receives is for its inpatient unit beds.  I think it is the only hospice in the country that does not receive any assistance from the State for the home care service.  Perhaps that is what is throwing up the figures mentioned by the Minister.</p>  <p>  This is a no-brainer.  It would ensure patients in the later stages of cancer received specialist care in the most appropriate environment.  The last thing we want to see happen is loved ones spending the last hours of their lives in a six-bed ward surrounded by a plastic curtain, with perhaps a neighbouring patient watching television or listening to the radio.  That is unacceptable, especially when we look at the quality of service that can be provided not just through Galway Hospice but in hospices all over the country.  </p>  <p>  I mentioned staff.  Some staff are, as the Minister said, experiencing hostility from the public because of the inability to meet demand.  This obviously affects staff morale.  Crucially, it also threatens to adversely impact on the fundraising capacity of the hospice.  The people of Galway have been hugely generous during the years and I would hate to see anything happen that would compromise the ability of the hospice to fundraise, as it has plans to develop a new inpatient unit.  It is in negotiations with the HSE to develop a state-of-the-art 26-bed inpatient unit, in the provision of which fundraising will be a central part.  I hope the Government will include capital funding for that service in the soon to be announced capital plan.  </p>  <p>  This issue needs to be taken by the scruff of the neck and addressed.  We are talking about it long enough.  Galway Hospice will not be found wanting in the quality of service and the value for money it provides.  One of its directors, Mr. Keith Finnegan, met the director, Mr. Hennessy, earlier today.  It was a positive meeting.  However, it needs to be followed up.  A Government is judged by the way it treats the most vulnerable in society and there is no cohort more vulnerable than those who are preparing for death and for whom the only medical care available is palliative care.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for taking this issue and showing an interest in it.  I ask that he continue to monitor the position in the coming days to ensure funding or resources will be provided to address the issue.</p></speech>

No one can disagree with the statement that we would all much prefer to see people who are terminally ill looked after in a hospice or their own home.  That is much more preferable to them dying in a hospital ward, particularly in a shared room.  If something can be done, we will do everything we can to do it.  When it comes to the financial aspects, it is never a question of whether it is less expensive to have someone in community or primary care versus acute hospital care.  As a rule, acute hospital care is always more expensive than community or primary care, but that does not mean that we should not get best value for the money we spend on community, hospice or primary care services.  Nor is it about saving money.  Money spent well in providing hospice, community and primary care allows us to treat more patients.  There will, therefore, be no penny pinching.  This is about enuring taxpayers' euro are spent as best as possible to treat and look after as many patients as possible.</p></speech>

I mean no offence to the Minister of State, but I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice and Equality who was in the Chamber only half an hour ago has left.</p><p>When I saw her on the monitor, I believed that she would be present to listen to my concerns.</p> <p> Recent years have seen an erosion of the Garda's manpower and resources.  Compared with four years ago, there are 1,600 fewer garda&iacute; and 139 stations have closed.  In Granard in my constituency, a senior position has remained unfilled for a long time, creating a lack of leadership for stations.  Some Garda cars have 300,000 km or 400,000 km on their clocks.  I compliment the Garda on the job it is doing in difficult conditions.</p> <p> I raise this topic in the context of recent bouts of anti-social behaviour in my home town of Mullingar.  For the most part, Mullingar is a safe, quiet and well-policed town.  We benefit from CCTV, which acts as a deterrent and has helped to solve many crimes.  Recently, the town was awarded the internationally recognised purple flag for its level of safety and the manner in which its garda&iacute; respond to incidents.</p> <p> Unfortunately, the past few months have witnessed a series of substantial anti-social incidents.  On the night of St. Patrick's Day, a full street had to be closed.  Garda&iacute; were quick to intervene, but three of them were assaulted with one requiring hospital treatment.  A number of members of the public were also assaulted.  This was the third time that anti-social behaviour emanated from the venue in question.  There was a further incident on Easter Monday night, albeit not to the same magnitude, thankfully.</p> <p> This anti-social behaviour stems from one licensed premises.  In recent days, the Garda has secured a temporary closure order against that public house and a number of the individuals involved have been brought before the courts.  However, these measures are not strong enough if people can bring a street to a halt and cause serious anxiety among residents and visitors.  Businesses that conduct themselves properly have had to close their doors because of the level of anti-social behaviour.  All that the legislation enables the Garda to do is to give a slap on the wrist, close the venue's doors for five days and hope that, when they reopen, all will be resolved.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State inform the Minister that we need stronger and more robust legislation to ensure that there are serious consequences for the sections of our communities that believe they can flagrantly break the law, namely, they might lose their licences and their premises might be closed down?  We must send a strong and clear message to the effect that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.  It is not fair on the people living next door.  If it not fair on the businesses that are conducting their business appropriately.  The reputational damage that such behaviour can do to a town like Mullingar is not fair.  At a minimum, will the Minister of State commit to considering legislation so that we might resolve issues such as this?  I am sure that similar incidents occur in other provincial towns.  When the next batch of Garda recruits graduates from Templemore, Mullingar Garda station should be given priority for additional resources so that people in its community know that this type of behaviour is not tolerated.</p></speech>

As he will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda regions, divisions and districts.  Garda management keeps this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to resourcing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Restarting recruitment was a key priority and we started to deliver on this last September with the first recruitment of new garda&iacute; since 2009.  From September 2014 to the end of this year, the number of new recruits entering Templemore will total 550.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the Minister is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner regarding the overall response to the problem of anti­social behaviour.  A key priority for the Garda is to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and to enhance community safety.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality-of-life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti­social behaviour.</p>  <p>  A range of strong legislative provisions is in place.  These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  The Garda has powers to deal with anti-social conduct that is attributable to excessive drinking, including through exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders in respect of licensed premises and catering outlets.  The Deputy alluded to one such premises in Mullingar.  In addition, garda&iacute; have powers to seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property or where a person is under age.  Where anti-social behaviour is directed at property, the Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for a range of offences and penalties, including imprisonment for a term of up to ten years upon conviction.</p>  <p>  The existing provisions provide the Garda with a wide range of powers to deal with offences associated with anti-social behaviour, including juvenile and adult cautions, fixed-charge penalty notices and the bringing of prosecutions.  There are also provisions under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 for civil proceedings in respect of anti-social behaviour by adults and specific provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour by children.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  In engaging with the Garda Commissioner on these issues, the Minister has asked her whether there are further legislative options we might consider that would be of assistance to the Garda.  We are actively considering legislative measures.</p></speech>

The most positive aspect that I can take from it is that the Minister has engaged with the Garda Commissioner to determine whether there are further legislative options that we can consider.  There are further options.  Every section of our community has rights.  No one disputes that, but every section also has responsibilities.  A particular section of Mullingar's community is not being appropriately responsible to wider society in its actions.  A level of anti-social behaviour has materialised at a licensed premises in recent months and we do not want that one premises to cause reputational damage to our whole town.</p>  <p>  I compliment garda&iacute; on intervening as quickly as they did, but they are stretched to their limits.  I met the superintendent and asked whether additional resources were needed, to which the response was that all stations needed additional resources because of the reductions in recent years.  The superintendent would not say "No" to additional resources.  Garda&iacute; also need robust legislation that enables them to enter licensed premises, apply closure orders and go to court to ensure that such premises never reopen, thereby sending a clear message to their wider communities that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.</p><p>I hope that through the engagement between the Minister, the Department and the Garda Commissioner, we can bring forward proposals to ensure that when behaviour such as I have outlined occurs, the licensed premises in question will no longer continue in operation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-04-16a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041600050#XX00200"><p>I am trying to read between the lines of what the Deputy is saying.  It seems to me he is touching on rather dangerous ground if he is attempting to pit one community against another.  We must be very careful as to how we describe issues within communities.  If we set out to address anti-social behaviour purely as a policing issue, then we miss the point almost entirely.  As I said in my reply, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies are constantly working on strategies to empower communities.  Where anti-social behaviour occurs, it is clear evidence that there already has been a failure right across the board.</p>  <p>  I had a meeting this morning with representatives of YoungBallymun to discuss the advancement of the area-based child poverty, ABC, initiative, with which the Deputy will be familiar from his work as party spokesperson on children.  The whole point of that programme is to empower parents and communities to look more profoundly at the issues that affect them, including issues around parenting and advancements in education.  If the only response from parliamentarians to anti-social behaviour is a legislative or policing one, that is to miss the point.  Of course we must be strong in defending our streets and towns against anti-social behaviour, but working out the reason that behaviour is happening is often the more difficult question to answer.  That is why policy makers often shirk from answering it.  We need to investigate more deeply why these incidents take place.  In my own constituency there are instances of endemic anti-social behaviour.  We can put 100, 200 or 300 garda&iacute; out patrolling estates and they may deter some people from engaging in such behaviour, but the incentive to engage in it is still there.  We must ask ourselves why that is the case.  Why are young men and women from certain backgrounds and in certain areas not getting enough empowerment from mainstream society?  Why are they seeking empowerment through these types of activities?</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's points very seriously.  I am sure he is anxious, as am I, to hear what the Garda Commissioner has to say in response to the approaches the Minister has made to her.  However, I would caution anybody against moving potentially onto dangerous ground by pitting one community against another.</p></speech>

It concerns a hugely pressing issue for hundreds of thousands of households in this country.  As public representatives, we must always seek to convert statistics and figures to give us a sense of how they impact on people.  The Minister understands that better than anyone.  It is what politics and fairness are all about.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath introduced a Bill in this House on 31 March concerning the standard variable rate being applied by the banks to residential mortgage accounts.  That debate was very important.  Deputy McGrath highlighted that Allied Irish Banks which, together with Bank of Ireland, is one half of the duopoly of pillar banks, has 130,000 variable-rate mortgages, Permanent TSB has some 80,000 such customers, and Bank of Ireland has approximately 70,000.  AIB is charging, on average, a variable rate of 4.15% on its mortgages, while Bank of Ireland and PTSB are charging, on average, 4.5%.  However, the current eurozone average for variable standard-rate mortgages is 2.5%.  In other words, these banks are charging a shocking and extortionate rate of almost 70% more than the eurozone average.  That is not right.</p>  <p>  The two main banks should not be allowed to retain a duopoly hold over the nation in respect of loans they advanced into the credit pyramid and bubble they created.  I have in front of me figures which illustrate the calculable culpability of all the banks by reference to their funding models, as they call them.  In fact, there is no such thing as a funding model.  Rather, there are funding principles, because the principles of banks funding their assets are determined by bank boards.  Unfortunately, that issue is not even being addressed in the banking inquiry, which is a shocking indictment of the approach being employed.  By referring to the banks' balance sheets, which are the financial evidence of what the bank boards decided as policy, over the seven years from 2001 to 2008, we see there was a reckless departure from 90% loan-to-deposits ratios to a 173% weighted average.  That was wrong.  It is wrong that people who have the legacy loans from that era are being forced to pay an extortionate super-profit margin above the normal new loans margin.</p>  <p>  Today I took a walk to visit some the nearby branches of the main banks.  AIB on Lower Grafton Street has a sign emblazoned above its door advertising a mortgage awareness day which took place on Saturday, 21 March 2015 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.  There is a great deal of irony to contemplate there.  By God, that bank's  variable standard-rate mortgage holders are very much mortgage aware.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, there was an advertisement showing a house and the text: "Need to move?  We pay your stamp duty to the value of 1% of your mortgage."  Of course, there is no mention that this 1% will only apply, at most, to 80% of the cost of the property.  That is another illusion, a lie to tempt people innocently into tying themselves to Bank of Ireland, as the bank describes it, "for small steps, for big steps, for life".  The bank's 80,000 standard variable-rate mortgage holders certainly are in it for life, paying a 2% super-profit over eurozone rates for a euro loan.  That is simply wrong.</p>  <p>  The Minister must bring the banks to heel on this issue.  Bank of Ireland, in particular, is out of control.  Until nine months ago, its board of directors included an individual who made a profit of &euro;500 million from his small investment of &euro;350 million, which was a one-way bet into profit.  He has since gone back to America.  It is instructive to consider the backgrounds of the 12 remaining directors.  The governor is British and has mainly been involved in the Lloyds Banking Group.  Kent Atkinson is also British and previously with Lloyds TSB.  Next we have Richie Boucher, who spent a lot of time at the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Pat Butler was in the resolution group in McKinsey &amp;amp; Company.  We have Tom Considine, a former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, former member of the advisory committee of the National Asset Management Agency and a former board member of the Central Bank of Ireland.  James Herron is British and formerly of Invest Northern Ireland.  Andrew Keating is only a young man but formerly worked with Ulster Bank.  Patrick Kennedy, like Pat Butler, was formerly with McKinsey &amp;amp; Company.  John Moran, like Tom Considine, is a former Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  Davida Marston is another director who is British.  My point is that most of these people have no empathy for or understanding of their Irish customers, yet they are the men and women who decide the policy of the bank and decide what the variable rates will be and if and when they are changed.</p>  <p>  Bank of Ireland reported a profit of &euro;1.1 billion in 2014, which followed a loss of &euro;1.7 billion the previous year.</p></speech>

In the space of a year, the bank turned a loss of &euro;1.7 billion in 2013 into a profit of &euro;1.1 billion, a turnaround of &euro;2.8 billion.  The Minister knows well that this is all to do with the manipulation of provisions.  It is not to do with the health of the bank or its normal operating profit.  The same applies in regard to AIB.  All of this is seriously wrong and we must be courageous and honest about it for the sake of the Irish people whose lives are being impacted by it.</p><p>Some 300,000 mortgages equate to approximately 1 million people.

As he is aware, the statement of Government priorities 2014-16 recognised the need for competition in the banking sector to put pressure on banks operating in Ireland to reduce the interest rates charged.  This issue was also discussed in the context of a Private Members' motion brought forward in the House just before Easter.  It has also been the subject of a number of recent parliamentary questions.</p><p>I met the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, on 2 April to discuss the issue.  The Governor provided me with an update on the ongoing work he and his officials were carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates, SVRs, charged by the lenders.  At the meeting we spoke about the fact that the SVRs charged in Ireland were higher than those charged in other euro area countries and had not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates.  The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.  The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a commercial matter for each lending institution to determine the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates.  However, the Government expects, as the cost of funding for the banks reduces, this to be reflected in the interest rates charged to both new and existing customers.</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.  Nonetheless, as I have said, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.</p><p>The Governor of the Central Bank, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November, stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it had long been understood tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.</p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 introduced changes to section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which regulates fees and charges, in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector.  There is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector, with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business models.  In the past 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market, bringing additional and welcome competition to the sector.  While not an option for all borrowers, those who are in a position to move mortgages should look into their options to do so.  The banks must be convinced that they are at risk of losing customers if they persist with SVRs higher than what is available to customers in other banks.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's website at <i><i>consumerhelp.ie</i></i>contains useful information on the process.  It also contains comparisons of mortgage products and information on incentives institutions will give to encourage switching. </p><p>As set out in the statement of Government priorities 2014-16, supporting increased competition in the banking sector is essential to put downward pressure on interest rates.  Increased competition between existing and new entrants will have the effect of reducing prices to consumers, which in the mortgage sector means reducing the SVR.</p></speech>

Similarly, Bank of Ireland reported a profit of &euro;920 million in 2014 and a loss of &euro;500 million in 2013, representing a turnaround of &euro;1.5 billion.  We have two banks in a duopoly with a turnaround figure of &euro;4.3 billion, set against the reality of customers being being insulted, in operational terms, by them.  I have first-hand experience of this.   I am a former commercial banker in a State-sponsored bank for businesses, small and medium enterprises, a worthy bank that understood the principles of banking and kept really close to its customers.  What is happening now is that the banks are becoming remote.  I gave as an example the board of Bank of Ireland.  Four members are foreign, while the remainder, bar two, have all had experience working outside Ireland.  They are remote and unfeeling.  I do not mean that they have to be lovey dovey, but in the sense of having a heart, they are out of touch with households and those in jobs and who work in businesses.  It is not right.</p>  <p>  The last bank I passed by was a branch of PTSB.  An advertisement displayed read as follows: "Ready to buy your first house?  Yes, give me a debt!  Permanent tsb back to basics".  Given what has happened, that is the philosophy, if it could be called that, the three banks should not be allowed to have.  I will give the Minister the paper to which I referred and which I sent to the Chairman of the banking inquiry.  The evidence shows that it was banks' boards and auditors who were clearly at fault.  We do not need the processional.  Does the Minister remember in May last year that there was a proposal to have in the terms of reference that every member of every board from 2001 to 2008 should be required to be in attendance in the one place to listen to the reports on their own accounts and their own financial engineering and the lack of principles during those eight years, with the auditors sitting behind them, in order that the people of Ireland would be able to see how a credit pyramid grew, which went out of control in terms of the figure for domestic banking in Ireland growing from three times to more than five and a half times national income?  That was unacceptable and so wrong but nobody has said so formally in this House.  I say it again - it is so wrong that this fact has not been understood and it needs to be.  Advertisements such as the one mentioned, given what has happened, should not be allowed to be placed at the entrance doors to banks.</p></speech>

The loan my wife and I took out with one of the duopoly banks was securitised, without much notice.  We received a little note on it in the post and, as I had a lot of experience of banking, I knew what it meant.  When we paid off the loan in full, the bank was unable to find the title deeds to our house because as a result of securitisation the loan had been channelled through funny vaults.  They were found eventually, but that is wrong.  That is what happens, however, when the relationship entered into for 35 years does not continue with the same institution for the 35 years.  It is nothing personal, but I hope the Minister understands.</p></speech>
