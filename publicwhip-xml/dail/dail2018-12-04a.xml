While the Government's position has shifted, overall it has been mean-spirited and lacked any moral compass.</p>  <p>  In addition to hospices, the Taoiseach knows that many organisations are labelled "section 39" but, in essence, do the State's work in catering for people with disabilities and children with special needs.  We know that thousands of people across the country depend on such organisations for residential services, respite services, day care and support services, personal assistance, home care assistance and access to therapies.  For many of these people, even those services, for example, respite and access to therapies, are not fully adequate or sufficient.</p>  <p>  I am referring to organisations like Enable Ireland, Rehab, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at national level and, regionally, Ability West, the Western Care Association, the Kerry Parents and Friends Association and the St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which covers Limerick and Cork.  There simply would be no services for people with disabilities without those organisations.</p>  <p>  In research commissioned recently on behalf of these organisations under the title, Who Cares? Building a new relationship between the not-for-profit sector and the State 2018, the reality is brought home in terms of the financial crisis that such organisations are in - they are no longer sustainable financially - and the Government's lack of honesty in meeting the actual cost of services that are being delivered on the ground by the agencies.  This is important research and, in essence, it captures the crisis and the lack of honesty in the relationship between the Government and these agencies.</p>  <p>  The Government has compounded the crisis and made it far worse in respect of the restoration of pay for the workers in these organisations.  They are not getting a full restoration of pay.  There is a significant differential at the end of each month between such workers and workers in the general health service.</p><p>Why are those agencies and workers who look after people with disabilities and very sick people penalised so blatantly by Government through its pay policy?  Why are they discriminated against so much?  It suggests a morally bankrupt position for Government to adopt.  It places these agencies in financial peril and will result in the cutting of services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400004#B00200"><p>In Ireland, we provide our health and social care through a number of different mechanisms.  Sometimes it is provided directly by the State through the HSE while at other times, it is provided through a section 38 body, which is a voluntary body.  St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is not too far from here, would be an obvious example where the staff are considered to be public servants but the body itself is not part of the public service.  Sometimes this care is provided through section 39 bodies, some of whom have been mentioned by the Deputy.  In these cases, the body receives some of its funding from the State and often receives some of it from other sources.  The people employed in these organisations are not public servants.  Sometimes care is provided through private contracts.  For example, most of our GP and dental services are provided by GPs and dentists who are self-employed and have staff who are not on public service contracts and are not part of the public service pay bill.  That is how we structure our health and social care services in Ireland.  We provide those services in lots of different ways - sometimes directly by the State through State employees, sometimes through private contractors like GPs and dentists who have their own employees, sometimes through section 38 bodies, and sometimes through section 39 bodies.  For better or for worse, that is the way it has grown up since the foundation of the State.</p>  <p>  There was a dispute about pay in section 39 bodies that went to the Workplace Relations Commission.  We have an agreement and I would expect the employers and the unions to honour that agreement.  I am sure they will.  I do not have the exact figures relating to funding in front of me.  I will dig them out.  Funding for section 39 bodies has increased for each of the past three years.  Funding for these bodies has increased at a higher rate than has funding for the HSE and its own services.  While HSE services got a certain increase, the section 39 bodies got a larger increase than the HSE, so the assessment offered by the Deputy does not really add up.  If the HSE bodies are getting less of an increase than the section 39 bodies, the section 39 bodies should be well able to afford any additional spending the HSE bodies are providing.</p></speech>

He is in denial, as is Government.  We have met the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  The bottom line is that I am not offering up that analysis.  It is commissioned research that the Taoiseach should read but it is also the reality on the ground.  I have met representatives of St Joseph's Foundation in Charleville, which has done heroic work for years.</p>  <p>  We all know about the history of the relationship between the State and these organisations.  The more recent history is that Government instructed the agencies to cut pay in line with the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation but when it came to the restoration of pay, these agencies were left out.  This was never an industrial relations issue.  The unions will look after their members but what they have not done is look after the agencies and they will not do so because it is not their remit.  Many posts will not benefit from pay restoration because workers who came in after the cuts do not get any restoration so the agencies get no funding for that.  Neither is there retrospective funding in terms of those agencies that have engaged in pay restoration.</p>  <p>  The situation is very grave for agencies like Kerry Parents and Friends Association, Ability West, St. Joseph's Foundation and the hospices which have told me they will cut services in January.  That is the reality.  They have been shortchanged.  What has happened is fundamentally wrong.  These agencies should have been kept in line with the HSE, which was always the case and which had been underpinned by Labour Court recommendations down through the years and indeed since 2010 onwards.  It is not fair to say what the Taoiseach has said with regard to them.</p></speech>

Some section 39 bodies are very small, may only receive &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 from the HSE and may have only one employee or a part-time employee.  Other section 39 bodies are very large, have a large number of staff and provide a large number of services.</p><p>Sometimes they have very little other income, other than what they get from the State.  Sometimes they have very large income, which they either raise themselves, get from bequests or raise from their assets because some of them have substantial assets and surpluses.</p></speech>

That body receives a particular amount of money in order to honour the service level set out in the service level agreement.  That is the way it is done.  It is similar to a contract, for example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400005#C00400"><p>Traditionally, December is the time of year when we think, in particular, of those who are homeless and, more specifically, those citizens who are sleeping rough.  We know from last week's homelessness figures that there are now more people homeless in the state than ever before.  We also know that the official figures actually understate the reality of homelessness across society.  The rough sleeper count, published yesterday, shows a 40% increase in the number sleeping rough since March, which is shocking.  It is no exaggeration to say hundreds of thousands of people across society are affected by the housing crisis.  Up and down the country, families are worried about whether they will have a roof over their heads come January.  People in the private rental sector are being hit time and again with rent increases which are still exorbitantly high, while long promised social housing is being constructed at a snail's pace.  House prices are out of control and, for young people, owning a home is a pipedream.  </p><p>The Taoiseach's response is to stick with the plan.  It may not have occurred to him, but his plan is not working.  In fact, he is failing spectacularly.  Last Saturday thousands of people took to the streets of this city to tell him that.  I think it is time he listened to them.  Last week the Central Bank stated to would-be homeowners who wish to get out of the high rental trap to wait and hang on for new homes to be built before trying to buy.  That would be prudent and worthy advice if houses were coming on stream and people were in a position to actually save a few bob.  Week in and week out, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and their colleagues state <i>ad nauseam</i>, both here and elsewhere, that people should simply wait, that the houses will arrive, yet we continue to witness homelessness and the housing crisis.  We have highfalutin guarantees that new homes will sort everything out, but that they will only arrive at some undefined point in the future.</p><p>The crisis is real.  It is in the here and now.  Frankly, people are fed up waiting for the Taoiseach to get his act together.  They are being screwed, day in, day out, with runaway rents and it seems the Government is incapable of taking meaningful action.  The Taoiseach seems to specialise in empty promises.  We need something tangible that will benefit the people who are struggling and need a break.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he should do something decent and constructive to cut people a bit of slack.  I suggest the introduce a three-year rent freeze and temporary tax relief for renters with immediate effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400005#C00500"><p>We are approaching Christmas time and the holiday season and people are looking forward to the Christmas holidays and spending time with their families, perhaps at home near the warmth of the fire.  Of course, when one thinks about that, one's thoughts inevitably turn to those who are less fortunate, those who do not have a home to go to, those without shelter who are exposed to the cold.  That is why the figures for rough sleepers produced yesterday were very disappointing.  They show that 156 people were sleeping rough on the particular night.</p><p>It is not the highest ever, by any means.  It was higher a year ago and, in fact, it was higher four years ago.  It represents an increase on the previous count in September.</p> <p> What do we want to do?  We want to make sure people have access to emergency accommodation this Christmas.  Now that beds are available for everyone who needs them, nobody has to sleep rough.  That is why we have set aside &euro;60 million in the budget for additional investment in emergency accommodation.  The first step is to get people into emergency accommodation.  After that, more permanent accommodation can be found for them.  An extra 203 beds will be put in place between now and the end of the year.  In fact, 51 of them are already in place.  The provision of 203 additional permanent beds and 130 contingency beds will ensure there is emergency accommodation for everyone who needs it this winter.</p> <p> We are continuing to work with the Peter McVerry Trust and other charities to advance the Housing First programme, which is all about getting secure tenancies for people who have been rough sleepers and are now in emergency accommodation.  When they are in secure tenancies, they will be given all the additional supports they need to hang on to their homes.  As the Deputy will be aware, rough sleeping is a complex social problem and is not just an issue of housing.  As it often involves issues like addiction, mental health and physical health, it can sometimes be hard to get people to come in and therefore it can be hard to help them, even though we do our best to do so.</p> <p> In terms of supply, I do not think it is a case of promises anymore.  The figures on supply are very positive.  According to the most recent set of numbers, 5,000 new houses and apartments were built in Ireland in the past three months.  Between 18,000 and 20,000 new homes have been built in Ireland this year.  Those are not just figures, as we can see by turning back to the theme of Christmas, which was raised by the Deputy.  This Christmas, approximately 20,000 people and their families will sit around a Christmas tree in new homes that did not exist this time a year ago.  It is possible that 60,000 or 70,000 people will spend this Christmas in a house or apartment that was not built this time last year.  We are going to need to ramp that up more and more next year until we get to the kind of figure - 30,000 or 40,000 - that is indicative of the level of housing construction that will be needed every year if we are to get on top of this crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400006#D00200"><p>The Taoiseach's party has been in government for more than seven years.  For the purposes of clarity, the theme I raised was not Christmas so much as the theme of a housing crisis and a homelessness crisis over which the Taoiseach and his colleagues have presided.  People took to the streets in vast numbers on Saturday.  I am sure all of us are aware that it is not easy to mobilise people.  The very clear message being sent by the thousands of people who took to the streets on the brow of Christmas is that the Government is failing and that they want it to change tack and to be imaginative, decisive and brave.  I think it would be wise to listen to that message.  I am very familiar with the Housing First approach, which was mentioned by the Taoiseach.  I have been informed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that the Government is planning to cater for 200 people, when in fact the need is somewhere closer to 3,000.  That is a metaphor for how short the Government has fallen in terms of need and public expectation.</p></speech>

However, she did not mention that we spent the first five of those years putting this country back on track.  Perhaps she would like people to forget, or not to know, that we spent five years getting the public finances back in order, reversing some of the awful cuts that were made in previous years to welfare and to people's pay and salaries and dealing with enormous levels of unemployment.</p><p>A set of figures came out today which shows that the rate of unemployment in Ireland is now at 5.3%, the lowest in ten years.  It is an achievement and those of us on this side of the House are very proud that we have got to the point where the rate of unemployment is at a ten-year low.  We spent the first five years really putting the country back together, getting the economy working again, getting people back to work, restoring their incomes and giving them hope again.  We have spent the past two years or perhaps a little more dealing with many of the legacy issues caused by the crisis.  It was a seven-year period during which the construction sector was dysfunctional and did not build any home and the banks were unable to lend either to builders or people who were seeking mortgages.  </p> <p> On the question of rent tax relief, it is not a proposal we are supporting.  We have an alternative proposal in the Finance Bill.  Rather than just having income tax cuts for people who are renting, we are making them for all workers because others struggle with other bills, not only those who are renting.  There are also people who are struggling to pay their mortgage, save for a deposit or with childcare costs, for example.  Rather than giving tax relief to one group which is the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal, we will give it to over 1 million people, which is nearly everyone who is working.

When the court case to try these crimes was concluded, Keith Burke was convicted of 23 of 39 sample charges of rape and buggery of the three children over a prolonged period between 2003 and 2007.  Significantly, we know all of this not from any internal examination by Tusla or the HSE but from "RT&Eacute; Investigates" and because the children, now young adults, were forced to give evidence when Mr. Burke pleaded not guilty.  Consequent on the RT&Eacute; programme which has become a familiar theme in the D&aacute;il - a significant phenomenon in itself - questions were raised by other Deputies and me.  Many fine words were used, including "courageous" and "brave" when referring to the children who are now young women, as well as "appalling" and "shocking" when referring to the crimes perpetrated.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach commended the bravery of Rachel, Sarah and Amy in telling their stories and said it would help others to come forward.  They were fine words, but the reality has been confusion, obfuscation and delay.  The Taoiseach's approach to date has not only added to the confusion, but he is also actively standing over a system that is failing the young women and utterly unaccountable.  In one of his replies the Taoiseach stated an independent investigation would commence.  He then told us that it had commenced and that it was nearing completion.  He then told us that the fact there was a criminal trial in train impeded the investigation.  The latter point is completely unacceptable and was pointed to by HIQA in a report commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, which clearly stated it was imperative that Tusla did not allow a criminal investigation to impede its statutory duty to protect and safeguard children.  Two and half years later, we have no report, despite assurances that it would be published in October and November.  The Government is standing over a review mechanism which, using the most benign interpretation, is tardy and inefficient.  A more realistic and honest view is that the situation is perpetuating the abuse suffered by the children.  When will the report be published?  What is the reason for the delay?  </p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to reply in the context of what a former chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Committee stated - that it was time the State stopped its automatic response to every scandal, being first to deny, then delay, lie and cover up and eventually, if forced, throw some money at it in the hope it will go away.  Will the Taoiseach, please, answer my direct question directly?</p></speech>

It is a very important issue, one in which the Deputy has taken a deep and genuine interest.</p><p>It was not a question that I anticipated would come up today so unfortunately I do not have an up-to-date note on this particular matter and I have not had a chance to speak to the Minister for Children and Family Affairs, Deputy Zappone, about it.  I know there is absolutely no requirement for Deputies to give us any advance notice of the questions that are raised, but we do get it on occasion and it does at least allow me to get an up-to-date note.</p> <p> I will certainly check with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, as to the reasons why the report cannot be published.  I understand that sometimes reports cannot be published for good reasons.  This may be because there is a criminal investigation or trial under way, and no one wants to do anything that might cause a criminal trial to collapse or a prosecution to fail as a result of information being put in the public domain that a defendant could use to get acquitted or bring a trial down.  Also, sometimes people can take a case against a report being published and seek injunctive relief.  Often there are reasons why reports cannot be published and they can be good ones.  It is not necessarily because someone does not want them to be published.</p> <p> I am told that on Monday last Tusla published its 2017 annual report of the national review panel.  It also published five individual case reviews relating to children and young people who, sadly, died in care or in aftercare or who were known to the child protection services.  Each of those represents a tragedy for the children and young people involved as well as for their families and those who cared for them.  The annual report from 2017 does not cover the cases Deputy Connolly is raising today.</p></speech>

An independent review panel was set up to report on the systematic rape of three young children.  Those adults came forward and said on a television programme and subsequently that they wanted an independent commission of inquiry.  They said they wondered why they had come forward.</p>  <p>  It is entirely unacceptable for the Taoiseach to stand up in the manner that he has and give inane quotes from reports.  As Taoiseach he has a duty to ensure that the system is accountable.  The Taoiseach cannot do a Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of it.  It has been raised many times and the Taoiseach is fully familiar with the case and the independent review mechanism.</p>  <p>  At this point, I have to ask serious questions as to the independence of the review panel.  Why has the panel not communicated with the Taoiseach to tell him why there is a delay?  Is there an absence of resources or staff?  What is the problem?  There is an absolute duty on the Taoiseach towards these three children to tell them that their suffering was not in vain.</p></speech>

I have no wish to insult Deputy Connolly or anger her any further by giving a different response to that.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, succeeded in getting Fine Gael to support the Bill in return for his support for the Fine Gael-led Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in was readily on hand to give its support.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leadership thought it was best to do the same as Sinn F&eacute;in.  Finally, what happened was that 75 Deputies voted for the Bill, 75 abstained and eight of us voted against.  Only myself and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, of the five Deputies in Kerry, voted against the Minister's Bill.</p>  <p>  Last summer, the Minister, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, and Deputy Heydon announced some small amount of LocalLink services aid for Kerry.  That is not enough for all of Kerry.  The people of the Black Valley and such places need more, as do the people from around Cahersiveen, Waterville, Glencar and Beaufort.  These places are remote and far away from anywhere.  We need more transport services there and likewise in east Kerry, including in Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin and Currow.</p><p>Will he provide more bus transport services in these areas?  It is a different story in Dublin where many forms of transport are available.  This is true of other greater urban areas throughout the country, but it is a different story in places such as County Kerry.  The social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens.  People who need a car to get from A to B cannot even have one pint.  Who is ordering all of the checkpoints?  Is it the Taoiseach; the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan; or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross?  People are being checked in going to and coming from mass.  I am not blaming An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or individual superintendents because it is occurring across divisions and county boundaries.  Does the Minister, Deputy Ross, now also want to close churches, as well as post offices?</p></speech>

Many people are very angry and upset about what has happened.  They feel they have been let down and that they cannot move.  They are isolated.  Bars are empty and closing on a regular basis.  Shops and restaurants located beside them are also closing.  Having two pints was the only social outlet for many.  They met in pubs to talk about farming, work or football, inquire about the health of neighbours or relatives who perhaps lived far away, or have an ordinary or usual conversation.  The culture of rural people is being blown to smithereens at the behest of the Government in its quest to satisfy the Minister, Deputy Ross.</p></speech>

It used to be the case that 600 or 700 people died on the roads every year.  The figure is now between 100 and 200, which is still 100 or 200 too many.  We have both met the families of people who were killed on the road.  The Deputy knows how the loss of a loved one on the road hurts a whole family and how families grieve.  It is particularly the case at this time of year when people are thinking about the empty space around the dinner table.  That is the purpose of road traffic legislation.  We do not seek to discommode people or make their lives difficult.  We want to make the roads safer.  Roads in rural Ireland are still less safe, for many reasons.  Most deaths on the roads occur in rural areas.  The roads in urban areas are now much safer.</p>  <p>  The extra bus services were pressed for by Deputy Hayden and other Deputies, in co-operation with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  A call for funding was made.  Counties made bids for funding, with some bidding for more and some for less.  The new services are now in place throughout the country.  It will never be possible to provide a service from house to door, village or pub or to replace all of the journeys people could take if they could use their car.  However, it is possible to provide better bus services.  There was a competitive call and different amounts went to different counties.  I have no doubt that there will be further calls for funding in the future.  </p>  <p>  I am glad to hear that there has been an increase in the number of Garda checkpoints and that the Deputy has noticed them throughout the country.  We should not forget why they are needed.  It is to check for people who might have consumed alcohol or drugs who might injure or kill another citizen.  It is to check to see whether vehicles are taxed and insured.  They help to intercept and disrupt networks of burglars in travelling around the country to break into people's homes, take their possessions and sometimes occasion real harm.  They help to disrupt anyone involved in a criminal enterprise.  It is good that there are more Garda checkpoints.  It is a reflection of the fact that just last week the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exceeded 14,000 for the first time since 2012 when the Garda College in Templemore was reopened and we started to recruit garda&iacute; again.  The force now has more 14,000 members which people will notice while on the roads and in the streets.  The Garda presence will be much more visible and people will feel safer.</p></speech>

People are being killed while cycling and walking because roads are not adequate for use by pedestrians late at night.  People are also being killed while riding motorcycles.  I am still asking the Taoiseach to provide the services he promised.  It was supposed to be no trouble at all to provide LocalLink services, but they have not been added to.  Even the ones that were promised are not being delivered.  That is the truth.  The purpose of this question is to see what we are going to do to help people in rural Ireland to get around.  They do not have the train, taxi or DART services that are available here.  There can be no checkpoints on roads around here.  If a garda was to stand there for five minutes, there would be a five-mile tailback.  It is very easy to have a checkpoint at a crossroads when people are going to mass on a Sunday morning, but I do not know what the purpose is, or on whose orders it is done.  Is it being directed by the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice and Equality or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to answer this question.  It is happening across the boundaries of three counties and in the divisions of different superintendents; therefore, a direction is coming from the top.</p></speech>

I passed through one on the south quays just outside the Guinness brewery the other day.  If there is anywhere where a checkpoint could cause a tailback, it is on such a busy road, yet there are checkpoints in those areas too for very good reasons.  Neither I nor the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan and Ross, order the setting up of checkpoints.  They are decisions for the Garda Commissioner, superintendents and inspectors in their particular areas, but I am not going to apologise for the fact that there are Garda checkpoints throughout the country.  The vast majority of law-abiding citizens want to see a more visible Garda presence.  They want to see garda&iacute; on the streets in their communities on bicycles and on foot.  They want to see Garda checkpoints because that is how crime is disrupted.  Particularly when we are trying to crack down on the scourge of burglaries in rural Ireland, we need a more active Garda presence on the roads to disrupt those who go into rural Ireland and people's homes to take their possessions and do them harm.</p></speech>

That is addressed in the programme for Government in regard to post offices and community banking.  The post office network has been debated in this House for many years.  The Taoiseach may be aware that in the wake of the Labour Court hearings last year An Post confirmed it would be closing one of its mail centres.  The staff in the existing centres in Dublin, Athlone, Portlaoise and Cork are very concerned.  Up to 200 people could be laid off as a result of that decision.  Has the Minster, Deputy Bruton, as a shareholder, engaged with An Post on this specific issue?  Surely, the Government should be doing all it can to avoid the loss of 200 jobs in any particular centre.  The staff in all four are very anxious-----</p></speech>

This was the subject of a Topical Issue matter last week.  As the Deputy is aware, An Post has gone through a very difficult period and had to restructure its business substantially and increase the price of stamps.  As part of the restructuring, one of the mail centres will be closed.  That was integral to the labour agreement negotiated in September 2017.  Some of the savings from the closure were allocated to the payment of increased wages at that time.  This decision has long been flagged by An Post, which is a commercial State body.  It will be a matter for the board to make a decision on this and it has indicated that a decision will not be taken until 2019.</p></speech>

It is timely to remind ourselves that although 2018 has been an important year for citizens with a disability, much remains to be done.  In March, the State finally ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was very welcome.  However, that ratification was only a first step and the real measure of delivery will be the implementation of the rights contained in the convention.  It is very disappointing that the Government did not ratify the optional protocol to the convention as promised.  Several matters remain outstanding to comply fully with the convention.  I understand that Committee Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 is scheduled for late December and that is very welcome.  However, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 remains at a standstill with the essential establishment of a decision support service still needed.  When will that important work be progressed and when will the State be in a position to ratify the optional protocol to the convention?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will acknowledge, the Government controls neither this House nor the Upper House, so it is no longer possible for us to give assurances on how long it will take legislation to pass through the Houses.  There is an effective filibuster in this House by Rural Independents on the abortion Bill and a filibuster in the Seanad by urbane Independents on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  Those filibusters are slowing the passage of all legislation and making it very difficult for us to do the job the people elected us to do.</p></speech>

Somebody in receipt of a disability allowance is now able to earn up to &euro;427 per week without losing the medical card.  That is an important reform we made in recognition of people with disabilities on International Day of People with Disabilities.

A high proportion of the children so excluded or expelled are affected by autism and have behavioural issues in addition.  In the Dublin region, there are seven special schools dealing with the children with a high level of need.  Many of these children are non-verbal.  They also have sensory issues, including in respect of noise, light and being involved with groups of people.  In my constituency and that of the Taoiseach, which includes Dublin 15 and part of Dublin 7, which has a population of more than 120,000, there are no facilities for children on the autism spectrum with a high level of need.  Parents are at their wits' end.  Children, teachers and principals in schools who are trying to do their best cannot cope unless they are resourced with facilities such as a special school.</p></speech>

I know the Taoiseach is aware of it because the group has been in correspondence with him.  Many constituents are being excluded by the education system.  They are on a home tuition grant and have been expelled by their schools.  The ASD units, which were established for the right reasons, are excluding the children because they have very severe and profound autism difficulties.  The group&rsquo;s request to the Taoiseach is that he meet it in the first instance and liaise with the National Council for Special Education so that children&rsquo;s needs can be met and so that the education system will be fit for purpose for them.  I would like the Taoiseach to accept the invitation to meet the group so it can outline its difficulties.</p></speech>

A very large public meeting took place in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Blanchardstown, on this issue.  Parents have done lot of research to demonstrate the need for a special school.  This does not go against the policy of integration, which may comprise the initial reaction.  It is actually about children who cannot integrate into the ASD units or mainstream schools.</p>  <p>  Dublin 15 is the fastest-growing area of western Europe.  It is in the Taoiseach's constituency.  It has the youngest population and it obviously has a need for what is proposed.

I am engaging with the National Council for Special Education and the special education needs officer on that issue.</p></speech>

It brings into focus the question of precarious work in the sector, which is worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion to the economy.</p><p>I visited the lunchtime rally today organised by the teachers and their union, Unite.  These teachers are determined that their sector will become organised and unionised in order that employers such as this one cannot walk all over their rights.  However, they also want to see legislative change.  The Qualifications and Quality assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 before the Seanad provides for an international education mark.  Will the Government support the amendment, which also calls for a fair employment mark to cut out unethical and even illegal activities on the part of employers in this sector, bogus self-employment, zero-hour contracts and so on?  Will it also support the amendment not just for a learner protection fund but also for a teacher protection fund and ensure-----</p></speech>

Perhaps the Taoiseach had an input into that decision when he was the Minister for Health at the time.

About 50,000 women took up that opportunity.  That has, however, led to delays in examining those smears because of capacity constraints in the laboratories.

Since its initial meeting on 9 May, the group has met on 11 occasions and is expected to make a report in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I understand that the work of the Seanad reform implementation group is due to conclude next week, that it was to sign off on a proposed Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Manning report and that the legislation was then to be sent to the Taoiseach.  What happens next in the process?  Will the Taoiseach accept the group's Bill?  I am aware that he had reservations about the Manning report.  When will a Bill be before the D&aacute;il and when will there be legislative changes?  To have or not to have the Seanad and its reform comprise a long-running saga in political life.</p>  <p>  There are people out there - in fact, there may be people in here - who do not really believe that this will ever happen.  We need to allay those concerns.  People voted for the retention of a bicameral system on the understanding that it would be a reformed system.  It is only right that we honour that expectation.  The last thing we need is anything that contributes to further cynicism towards political life or, more importantly, the institutions of lawmaking and government.</p></speech>

In fairness to him, he did a great deal of work in reforming the Seanad and giving it constitutional provision in the 1937 Constitution.  More than that, he removed from the then D&aacute;il the right to change the Constitution by itself, which was a remarkable giving up of power for the 1930s or, indeed, any time.  That is where we are in this context.</p>  <p>  It is time for significant reform of the Seanad.  I am glad that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's personal veto of the nominee for chair of the implementation committee was eventually lifted and the committee was able to get on with its work.  In passing, the Taoiseach might comment on why the highly unusual situation of an Independent member of Government personally blocking a parliamentary majority's wishes is one that he continues to tolerate on such matters.  It was shocking.</p>  <p>  It seems that the committee is doing good work and that it is coming to a conclusion.  Given that the Government is considering referendums next year on divorce and other matters, I am curious as to why the Seanad is not featuring in those plans.  It seems that an outline is ready and a legislative template is almost ready.  My understanding is that the committee has to meet and sign off on it.  Maybe the Taoiseach can encourage the Government members of the committee to attend and be constructive as regards the agenda.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree with me that the timescale exists for producing legislation on the Seanad that could lead to a constitutional amendment?  I am sorry, I did not mean a constitutional amendment, but a change in the Seanad's make-up, how it is selected and so on.  I do not know whether the Attorney General's office has examined the committee's work.  The legislative proposals seem more realistic politically than the Manning report in terms of phasing in changes over the next two Oireachtais.  The Taoiseach might comment on this matter.  There is room for fundamental change within the next six months.</p></speech>

It is, of course, an all-party committee.  As it has not issued a report yet, I cannot really comment on it.  Obviously, once the report is issued, I look forward to reading and examining it.  The Leader of the Seanad, Senator Jerry Buttimer, keeps me up to date on occasion as to what is going on in the committee, but I did not realise that it was quite that close to signing off on a report.  I have not seen a draft report yet or anything like that if such a report exists.</p></speech>

I would like to know what the cost of the election would be.  The Constitution requires that Seanad elections be carried out by postal vote and only by postal vote, so a postal vote involving millions of electors, potentially hundreds of thousands of them outside of the State, could be very expensive, but I do not know what that figure is.  Perhaps the committee does, and I am sure that will be in the report.</p>  <p>  Second, I also have some reservations about retaining the different panels as they currently exist.  I understand that to change them would require a change in the Constitution, and that is not being proposed.  The last iteration of the Manning report that I saw would require pretty much everyone to register to vote again for the Seanad elections.  If we open up the franchise to everyone in the State or every citizen abroad, that would require a registration mechanism by which people would register to vote and would then pick a panel on which they wanted to vote, whether it was  the University of Dublin, NUI, cultural and educational, industrial and commercial, administrative or some other panel.  I think that could be quite a confusing exercise for people.  People, when they register to vote, tend to register to vote where they live for their local constituency.  Asking them to choose between a number of different panels when they register to vote could cause some confusion.  I also think the panels are out of date.  They do not really reflect 21st century society.  They derive from a papal encyclical in the 1930s that de Valera was very fond of.  It was sort of Catholic corporatism.  That is from where those particular panels arise.</p>  <p>  However, those are just my reservations.  I am not determining this or running it or seeking to-----</p></speech>

However, if we look back historically, the contribution of the university Senators has been enormously positive.  I would like to see them retained in some way, perhaps with a third constituency for the newer institutions that are not included.  We could just merge them all into one, but I would like to see the NUI retained and the University of Dublin retained and maybe have a new constituency for the more recently established institutions like DCU, UL and some of the institutes of technology.  Again, though, those are just my thoughts.

Finland and Ireland are like-minded on many issues and both bilateral meetings were very warm and constructive.  </p>  <p>  In my meeting with Prime Minister Sipil&auml;, we discussed a range of issues across the EU agenda, including Brexit, migration and economic issues, such as the multi-annual financial framework and economic and monetary union.  We also looked forward to Finland's upcoming Presidency of the Council of Ministers in the second half of 2019.  In my meeting with President Niinist&ouml;, issues raised included security, defence and external relations, including the EU's relations with Russia, an issue which is of particular concern in Finland.</p>  <p>  In both my meetings, we also discussed bilateral relations between Finland and Ireland, which are excellent, and agreed to continue work to further strengthen our strategic relationship.  I also took the opportunity to thank both leaders for their solidarity throughout the Brexit negotiations.  I also attended a networking event later that day hosted by our ambassador to Finland where I met Irish business, cultural and community representatives.</p>  <p>  On 11 November, I travelled to Paris where I represented Ireland at the Armistice Day commemorations.  A total of 84 Heads of State and Government gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to remember those who lost their lives or were wounded in the First World War.  This was a solemn occasion and served as a stark reminder of the tragedy of war and the need to focus our efforts on working together at European and international level to ensure that history does not repeat itself.  President Macron hosted the event and I had the opportunity to speak with him upon arrival and in the margins of the ceremonies.</p>  <p>  I also had informal exchanges with other counterparts, including several European and African leaders as well as Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the heads of international organisations.  I did not have an opportunity to speak extensively with President Trump on this occasion, although we did exchange greetings.</p></reply>

In the significant amount of scholarship published in recent years, the consensus points to it being a war that was far from inevitable.  It followed an extended period of peace and growth in Europe and there was no compelling reason for war, even in terms of the values of the time.  Ultimately, what was seen was a lack of strong rules-based organisations that could ensure trust and co-operation between countries.  This remains a powerful lesson for today, one that, unfortunately, some parts of the English political class have chosen to ignore.  It is an interesting fact of history that those who fought in the two world wars were the biggest enthusiasts for what we now call the European Union.  Given the success of the commemorative programme of recent years and the significant level of public engagement, can the Taoiseach assure us that the commemoration's budget will remain intact?  Given the central role of our academic historians not only in researching the period but also in opening up scholarship to the public, will the Taoiseach reconsider the recent policy of that has seen a steady downgrading of the role of humanities research in the State's research strategy and, of greater significance, funding for postgraduate doctorates in the humanities?  A mechanism is available to facilitate greater scholarship in that area.  I established it in the late 1990s.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Taoiseach's meetings in Finland, we welcome bilateral meetings with countries such as Finland that have always had very constructive relations with Ireland.  The trip had the added benefit for the Taoiseach of combining an official trip to Helsinki with the congress of the European People's Party, EPP, which happened to be held at the same time in the same city.</p>  <p>  Following his bilateral meeting with his EPP colleague, Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n, earlier this year, the Taoiseach told the House that we should be understanding of Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n's belief that he is protecting Hungary.  Does the Taoiseach still believe this?  He will have seen yesterday that a highly rated university has been driven out of Hungary because of the Orb&aacute;n Government's analysis and hysterical campaign against anything funded by George Soros.  The undertones of scapegoating, fearmongering and anti-Semitism are obvious.  Orb&aacute;n has also launched a campaign against the few pieces of the free media that are left and all non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that are not supportive of him.  He has even enacted legislation to ban state funding of gender studies in universities.  Is the Taoiseach aware of any more obvious violations of agreed EU values and rules?  Does he believe that enough is being done to face down Orb&aacute;nism?</p></speech>

In the midst of that very necessary remembrance of young lives lost - an entire generation - in the killing fields of Flanders, it is very important that we do not lose sight of the waste and sin of imperial war.  Ireland learned that lesson because Irish blood was spilled.</p>  <p>  In that spirit and being mindful of the fact that in a post-Brexit scenario, the battle is under way for the future of Europe and what the European project ought to be.  There is a very obvious contradiction involving those of a federalist mindset who correctly cite the success of the European project as the world's greatest peace project, yet insist on the need for increased militarisation and, like the Taoiseach's friend, President Macron, the necessity of a European army.  The Taoiseach spoke to his counterpart in Finland which, like Ireland, is militarily neutral.  I put it to him, as Head of Government, that as this debate about the future of Europe unfolds, all of us who are in favour of military neutrality should protect that status and seek expression of it in the European treaties.  Structured co-operation, NATO and all the ambitions of the militarists are codified and found within the treaties.  Why do they not also feature our identity, ambition, distinct tradition and belief in the need for the European project to keep faith with the peace mission?  Will the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, seek their inclusion within the treaties?  That would be a positive and necessary contribution to this debate at this time.</p></speech>

In particular, he referred to the dangers of the far right.  We need to be very conscious of the dangers posed by the far right and the sort of political forces that gave us the horrors of the first part of the 20th century.  When he looks at the uprising and protests taking place in France with the so-called yellow jackets, does the Taoiseach agree that Emmanuel Macron has shown a complete inability to understand the lessons of the 1920s and 1930s by imposing an unjust, regressive austerity flat tax on struggling working people in France and couching it in progressive environmental terms?  By imposing it on people suffering from poverty, precarious work and a series of austerity attacks, President Macron is making precisely the same mistake that was made in the aftermath of the First World War with the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed austerity on Germany with disastrous consequences.  If we want to avoid the disasters of the 1920s 1930s and 1940s, we must not attack ordinary people with regressive and unjust taxes and austerity measures.  In fact, we should stand with the protesting yellow jackets who are saying they are not responsible for the economic mess in France and they have not threatened the environmental future of the planet.</p><p>The very wealthy have done that.  This is the irony of what is going on in France.  At the same time he imposes these fuel tax increases, President Macron has cut the wealth tax in France.  The wealthy are going to see a 6% increase in their income while working people and the poor in France are being hammered under the guise of a so-called environmental tax.  President Macron has shown exactly the wrong way to avoid the disasters of the 1920s and 1930s.  We should learn the lessons here too.</p></speech>

Everybody who identifies with the European Union is very conscious of that.  Irish neutrality, as a concept and a policy, owes its origin to the slaughter of Irish men, and it was mostly men, in the First World War, who signed up for a variety of reasons to fight, as some saw it, for the freedom of small nations and ended up being slaughtered on the battlefields over a four-year period.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach support the recent statement by the Minister for Education and Skills that will see the restoration of history as a critical subject for young people in schools, particularly at secondary level, as well as at primary school level?  Is it important that our young people know about this history and how wars on the European Continent largely came to an end?</p>  <p>  In the context of the remembrance of the Great War, as it was called, does the Taoiseach propose to celebrate Irish neutrality?  I know, within his own party and the party it is aligned to in Europe, as with all the other groups, there are people who are for neutrality policy and armies which are essentially for domestic defence rather than parts of greater co-operation and structures.  Where do the Taoiseach's feelings lie?  It is important that, as Taoiseach, he should not be dragged willy-nilly into a European federalist structure which would include the notion of a grand European army.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept Irish neutrality?  Does he believe it should be expanded and developed and that neutrality is an especially appropriate position for Ireland, as a small country, and the other neutral European nations to take?  Does he acknowledge that the respect which the Irish Defence Forces and other structures like the Garda command internationally in European peacekeeping is because we are recognised as a former colonial country which is neutral and is therefore particularly suited to helping to keep the peace and enforce peace around the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400019#R00300"><p>I think we will all agree that the First World War, or the Great War, was a truly terrible war that caused great suffering and the death of tens of millions of both soldiers and civilians.  Its impact and the changes that followed therefrom still affect us and echo in the politics of today.  Some good lessons were learned from the First World War.  There was a move away from monarchy towards republics in large parts of Europe.  There were at least attempts at multilateralism.  The establishment of the League of Nations after the First World War was a progressive step in the right direction.  Unfortunately, it did not succeed as an organisation, or certainly did not succeed in preventing the Second World War, but did form a template for the United Nations which came thereafter.</p>  <p>  Another result of the First World War was a growth in the belief that nation states should have self-determination and, after the First World War, there emerged new nation states across Europe, including our own.  Movements for disarmament also followed, as well as opposition to secret treaties.  Many of the lessons that were learned from the First World War were well learned and I would not like to see them forgotten.</p>  <p>  I think Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n believes what he is saying about the Central European University, CEU, in Hungary, but that is not to say that I agree with him and I do not.  I do not agree with him on quite a lot of issues, whether it is migration, academic freedom, press freedom, or the freedom of NGOs to be able to operate freely in a democratic society.  The loss of the Central European University would be a loss to Budapest and Hungary.  I understand it may be going to Vienna, where it is being welcomed by another of my European People's Party, EPP, colleagues, Chancellor Kurz.  The CEU will be Vienna's gain and Budapest's loss.</p>  <p>  On EU integration, I have said before on many occasions in this House that Ireland will not be joining NATO or a European army.  I believe Irish neutrality is an asset.  We are a small country and will never be a military power.  Any military contribution we would make to Europe's defence could only ever be very limited.  We can be powerful through our peacekeeping, foreign policy, international development aid and commitment to organisations like the United Nations.  That Ireland is not a member of a military alliance is an advantage for the reasons Deputy Burton articulated.  When it comes to the United Nations, for example, there is recognition that Ireland is a country with which other countries can identify, especially other island nations and nations that were colonised or a part of a larger nation.  For example, in peacekeeping operations, the fact that we are not part of a military alliance means we can go places where perhaps other countries do not go, or would not be accepted.</p>  <p>  I will have to double check, but I think our neutrality and non-alignment is already expressed in the treaties.  I think it is in the Lisbon protocols.</p></speech>

That was endorsed by a very large majority in this House.  That means Ireland participating in greater co-operation around security and defence with our European partners where we believe it makes sense to do so.  For example, that could be in areas such as peacekeeping.  Ireland participates in an EU mission in Mali which is an important contribution to trying to stabilise that part of the world.  The Irish Naval Service has participated in operations in the Mediterranean, particularly around the management of the migration issue on the central Mediterranean route.  We also need to co-operate on issues such as international terrorism, cybersecurity and other security threats that, quite frankly, no small country, or even big country, would be able to deal with on their own.  That is why it makes sense for us to co-operate in a structured way on security issues and we intend to do that.</p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, the yellow jacket protests in France were spurred by opposition to increased taxes on fuel.  Increasing taxes on fuel have benefits for the environment, pollution and health.  For example, we know that diesel causes damage to people's health because of the emissions of sulphur oxide, SOx, and nitrogen oxide, NOx particles.  If a tax causes people to buy or use less of something, in the same way as we tax cigarettes, for example, that can have environmental and health benefits and reduce pollution.</p>  <p>  The reaction in France is a lesson to us when we consider how to increase carbon tax over the next couple of years.  We have seen the French experience with increases in fuel taxes.  We have seen what happened in Australia, where public opposition to increased taxes on petrol, diesel and other fuels brought down a government and prime ministers.  We can see a model that may work being pursued in Canada, which is to bring in a carbon tax and price, but to rebate that to people in the form of tax credits or carbon dividends.</p><p>Essentially, the money that accrues from the introduction of a carbon tax is given back to people in another way.  That allows people to understand that a carbon tax is an attempt to change behaviour, rather than an attempt to take money out of their pockets.</p></speech>

Staff across several divisions of my Department contribute to the work on Brexit.  The international, EU and Northern Ireland division of the Department covers work on all international, EU, British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs, including Brexit matters.  The economic division of the Department advises me on economic policy aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including the possible economic impacts of Brexit.  To augment this work, the Department of the Taoiseach recently established a unit to work on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning and to assist a Secretaries General group that is overseeing ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The staff in this unit focus on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management and work closely with their colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the approval of the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship.  The finalised agreement provides a basis by which we can avoid a hard Brexit, which would see the UK crash out of the EU with all the severe consequences that would imply.  Rejection pushes us all towards a no-deal Brexit, from which nobody would benefit.  Preparation and planning is ongoing across all Departments to deal with and plan for a range of Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal scenario.  As the T&aacute;naiste has previously stated, in a disorderly scenario the implementation of all planned arrangements would not be possible by 29 March 2019.  Therefore, we are also focusing on possible temporary solutions which could be rapidly implemented until more long-term arrangements could be put in place.  The whole-of-Government response is led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and underpinned by a comprehensive set of Government structures, which ensure all Departments and their agencies are engaging in detailed preparedness and contingency planning, including through the development of sectoral action plans.</p>  <p>  At several recent meetings, including one last week, the Government discussed Brexit preparedness and contingency planning and agreed a range of important actions for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an east-west basis.  For example, the Government sanctioned the recruitment of additional staff for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary controls, as well as information and communications technology and infrastructure actions at our ports and airports.  In a no-deal scenario, various actions could be employed, including accelerated recruitment and rapid redeployment of staff.  Many issues will need to be dealt with on an EU-wide basis.  The contingency action plan that was published by the European Commission recently covered eight particular areas.  The specific impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish businesses was flagged in the Commission's communications.  Businesses and other affected sectors need to respond and prepare.  Assistance is available from the Government to help them.  The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign was launched in September and several very successful outreach events have been held under this banner.</p></reply>

The ongoing chaos in Westminster is a reminder to us all that the default position under UK law is that Britain will leave the EU in 115 days' time.  The withdrawal agreement may somehow be passed, there may be an extension of the Article 50 process or there may even be a new referendum, but the default position is that unless a majority can be constructed for an alternative, Brexit will happen on 29 March 2019.  The cost of this to Ireland would be a minimum of &euro;5 billion.  According to an analysis by Copenhagen Economics, this could rise to &euro;10 billion in the event of a collapse in sterling caused by the UK crashing out of the EU.  In light of the scale of this issue, is it really a mark of successful preparations that basic information seminars are still being conducted less than four months before the most critical deadline?  Would it be possible for the Taoiseach to put aside for a moment his spin about the number of people looking for information or about the potential funding?  He needs to look at the bigger picture.  According to data produced by the Government, most of the firms that are threatened by Brexit will not be ready for Brexit in March.  They have few contingencies in place for disrupted supply lines, are badly exposed on sterling and have little of the required expertise available to them.  If the majority of critical firms are not ready, or are exposed to threats without a means of tackling them, how can the Taoiseach say he is happy with the pace of preparations?  If he disagrees with this interpretation, will he indicate what percentage of firms would need to have Brexit plans and contingencies in place and to have implemented them for him to be happy that Ireland is ready for Brexit?  I am not asking him how many helpline calls we should log but what percentage of firms he believes should be ready on 29 March 2019.</p></speech>

I do not believe this State should concede that we will countenance for a second a scenario in which there is any hardening of the Border on our island.  I do not think we should concede our ambitions in respect of North-South trade, the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>and the protection of our agreements.  We have agreed that all of these things are priorities for us.  I do not think we should concede on the issue of east-west trading.  I am very conscious that a debate is under way in Westminster.  It is now a matter for the MPs who have been elected by their respective constituencies to have their debate, however chaotic and shambolic it may appear to our eyes.  A degree of breathing room is necessary to allow that debate to happen.  In my view, Brexit will happen.  I have never believed we should be in the business of trying to wish it away.  Of course there has to be an intense engagement with every sector, in business and beyond, on what might happen in a post-Brexit scenario.  This is a long-term issue.  The challenge for us is not simply to ensure in the immediacy of the fact that there are supply chains or that commerce takes place in the here and now.  This is for keeps.  It marks a profound shift in the political landscape.  As the dust settles, there is a need for us to have a wide-ranging and deep conversation about what our island will look like in a post-Brexit world.</p></speech>

The hope that certain issues could be avoided on the basis of an agreement that resolves things to everyone's mutual satisfaction is looking a hell of a lot more shaky.   That brings the possibility of a hard Brexit into view.  What scenarios are being envisaged in the contingency planning mentioned by the Taoiseach?  I reiterate my concern that in the event of a hard Brexit, we will come under pressure from the EU to erect a border between the North and the South of this country.  While the Taoiseach has said he would not countenance that, we have heard slightly ambiguous statements from the T&aacute;naiste, who has said it might be difficult to avoid.  People need to know what the position is.  I certainly believe that under no circumstances should we countenance that, regardless of who we come under pressure from.  We should say we are not doing it and it will not happen.  We should make clear that we will not participate in any attempt to impose a border between North and South for any reason and under any circumstances.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide some clarity in that regard.  Is this something that is envisaged under the Government's contingency scenario planning?</p></speech>

Does the Taoiseach feel it is potentially very beneficial to Ireland and people in the UK who may want a soft Brexit or a rethink in the form of a second referendum?  They are matters for the UK Government but they have an enormous influence on us.  I want to know what is the Taoiseach's view.  I have always thought that in the Brexit process, one of the things that should be explored is an extension of the Article 50 process.  Until the Advocate General's viewpoint, which we expect will be endorsed by the European Court of Justice, was announced this morning, the feeling was it might be difficult to do because it would require all 27 countries to allow for it.  It now seems to be potentially off the table.  Does the Taoiseach welcome it?  Does he feel it gives more flexibility to the Irish position?</p>  <p>  In terms of preparing for Brexit, people all around the country, particularly farmers, are scared about the loose references to the World Trade Organization, WTO, rules in the event of a hard Brexit.  As such, have we taken on experts in trade negotiations who are experienced on both the legal front and in the technicalities of trade negotiations?  We have not negotiated a trade agreement since we joined the EU and neither has the UK.  We need such expertise in the EU in the case of such an outcome.  Is the Taoiseach preparing for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400021#T00200"><p>On the various information seminars, we will keep doing them all the way through to Brexit and perhaps beyond.  The suggestion I thought I heard from Deputy Martin was that the seminars should be all done and dusted by now.  It is not the case at all.  It has to be a continual process of informing business as the situation unfolds.</p>  <p>  In terms of percentages, all firms that need to be prepared should be prepared by 29 March but we need to acknowledge that all firms are different.  Some do not trade with the UK at all or do not trade much with it and some can shift operations.  We have to acknowledge that different companies need to be prepared to different extents and some do not need to be prepared at all if they are not trading with the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  In terms of scenarios, we developed quite some time ago what we call the central case scenario.  It turned out to be something very close to what we now have with the withdrawal agreement.  The central case scenario says there will be a transition period of two years or more and when it is over there will be customs and regulatory checks east-west but not North-South.  That is the central case scenario we have prepared for.  We also prepared for a no deal scenario.  While the central case scenario and no deal scenario sound like two scenarios, the response is a graduation of one from the other.  That is how we have done the various scenario planning.  We have not made any contingency or scenario planning for a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or any associated physical infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In terms of trade agreements, as we will stay members of the European Union, trade will continue to be a sole EU competence and therefore will only be negotiated by the European Commission.  We will not be negotiating our own trade agreements because we will be staying in the European Union.  We have people who are experts in trade already.  They are not negotiators because they will not be involved in any negotiations but they are experts in the rules and laws of trade.  They are in the Department and they come in very useful when it comes to examining, for example, the impact of EU trade deals on Ireland, whether they are CETA, EU-Japan, Mercosur or EU-Mexico deals, because we need to have people who understand the WTO, how trade works and international trade law to make sure our interests are protected when we plug into discussions around what those trade deals might look like.</p>  <p>  As was acknowledged, the report of the Advocate General is not an ECJ decision.  It is the opinion of the Advocate General which the ECJ usually, but not always, concurs with.  It says the Article 50 procedure could be withdrawn by the UK.  It could unilaterally decide to stay.  It would not have to renegotiate re-entry terms.  It is up to the UK.  It is a sovereign decision for it to make.  It has decided not to make that decision.  It has decided to respect the result of the referendum that occurred in the United Kingdom which was to leave.  It is still the case that an extension of Article 50 would require a unanimous vote of member states.  The difference is between the UK choosing to cancel Article 50, which it can do unilaterally, and seeking an extension which would require a vote of member states.  The report suggests if the UK was to withdraw from Article 50, it would have to be done in good faith; it could not be done on a tactical basis.  It could not invoke Article 50, withdraw it, revoke it again and then withdraw it on a tactical basis.</p>  <p>  On the roles of other parties, we have often spoken about the role of Sinn F&eacute;in and the fact it has seven MPs who could vote in the House of Commons if they chose to do so.  It is also the case that Fianna F&aacute;il has a sister party in the Liberal Democrats.  The Labour Party has a sister party in the British Labour Party.  I encourage leaders to engage with their counterparts in the UK because there are a number of votes coming up.  It is not simply just a vote on whether the House of Commons accepts the withdrawal agreement or not.  There will be other votes.  Some votes are being put down, particularly on the backstop.  I would not like to see a vote in the House of Commons specifically repudiating the backstop.  We know there cannot be a withdrawal agreement without the backstop.  It is important that the sister parties, whether the Liberal Democrats or the British Labour Party, understand that.</p></speech>

I do not know.  I note the release of the results of the labour force survey for quarter 3 of 2018 by the CSO on Tuesday, 20 November.  Overall, the release is very positive.  Figures show employment continues to grow strongly with 66,700 jobs created in the year from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of 2018, which brings total employment to 2,273,000.  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of 2018.  The exception to this is the mid-west, which has remained static, and the Border region.</p><p>We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth and thereby reduce regional disparities.  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, embodied by Project Ireland 2040, and actions focused on maximising the competitive advantages and potential of each of the regions are key to ensuring each region can contribute to and participate in Ireland's future national growth and sustain a higher standard of living.<br/><br/>Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State.  The figure is for the period from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 3 of 2018.  A total of 163,500 people in the regions outside Dublin entered employment in that period.  That represents a figure of over 63%, or three in five jobs created, for regions outside County Dublin during the period from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 3 of 2018.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is a central pillar of the Government's ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, of which some 135,000 will be outside Dublin.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>A key objective of the initiative is to have a further 10% to 15% at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of reducing the unemployment rate in each region to within one percentage point of the national average.<br/><br/>Government policies are working but, of course, we always want to do more.  That is why in April this year I asked all Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all regional plans to ensure their relevance and impact up to 2020.  The refresh and refocus will ensure the plans remain effective and continue to deliver jobs throughout the country.  It will ensure the plans can be sufficiently robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.  In October I met the chairpersons again to hear directly about the progress made to date.  All regions have established a project delivery team.  Each team has met to examine initial proposals for each region's strategic objectives and all regions have a working draft of their refreshed plans.<br/><br/>My Department is also working closely with the agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices, and other relevant stakeholders.  Their ongoing regional activities will also be included in the plans.  The aim is to have the refreshed regional plans completed by the end of the year.</p></speech>

However, it is sometimes or often outside the control of Government policy which sets down broad parameters.  It is then up to business to thrive within them.  The Government has an active policy on regional development, but it is failing dismally.  I will explain why.  In the Border region the employment gain from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018 was 0%.  The figures for other areas are as follows: in the west the figure is 5%; in the mid-west, 0%; in the south east, 0.6%; in the south west, 15%; in Dublin county and city, 32%; in the mid-east, 7.3%; and in the midlands, 7.9%.  In two regions there was zero growth, while there is a major uptake in job creation throughout the country.  Imbalance is part and parcel not of Government policy but of its consequences.</p></speech>

Our ambition has been to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, of which some 135,000 will be outside Dublin.  According to Central Statistics Office figures released last week, we are over 96% of the way there in meeting both targets.  We are well on course to meet and exceed them by 2020.  Overall, three out of every five new jobs have been created outside Dublin since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2015 and we continue to see an increasing number of positive job announcements throughout the country.  I am altogether familiar with the Border region.  In the past year the rate of unemployment along the Border has dropped from 6.5% to 5.1%.  It is down from a high of 16.1% in 2012 and lower than the State average.  The number of unemployed persons in the Border region in quarter 3 of 2018 dropped to 9,500 people from 12,400.  This means that there are 2,900 fewer people on the live register in the region.  The Government is absolutely committed to continuing to drive job creation along the Border.</p></speech>

What I am questioning is her ability to implement the commitments she makes.  It is clear and evident that she is failing dismally.  There are two regions with zero employment growth, namely, the Border region and the mid-west.  These regions saw zero growth when we had a boom.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, said Ireland was unbalanced.  We must accept that comment, given that 45% of GDP is generated inside the M50.  That is a clear indication that the country is grossly unbalanced.  It will tip into the Irish Sea if it continues to develop around the capital and on the east coast.  At the same time, there are large areas of the country where there has been zero growth in employment during a sustained period of growth nationally, which is an indictment.  It is time we accepted that Government policy is not working.  While the commitments are in place, their roll-out is having a negative impact because, unfortunately, the regional imbalance is very much to the fore in everyday life in many parts of the country.</p></speech>

We have done a great deal of work during the past year to ensure there has been a regional balance.  Only last Monday, in the second call for the regional enterprise development fund, I announced an allocation of a little over &euro;25 million in funding that will support the regions to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential.  Of course, there are some areas that are not doing as well as others, which is why we have the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees.  They have started a process to refresh and refocus all of the regional plans and come up with good ideas.  The regional enterprise development fund provides the money that will make them materialise.  There have been some particularly good projects.</p>  <p>  I do not want to hear that the Border region is not doing well.  It is doing extremely well and a great region in which to invest as there is a strong work ethic in it.  I was there yesterday - I live there - and there was great excitement about all of the investments that had materialised through the regional enterprise development fund.  There was a really good investment in a hub in north Leitrim.  It had started off originally with Drumshanbo Gunpowder Gin.  It is a highly successful business, on which the hub is building.</p></speech>

My Department and its agencies are working as part of a coherent cross-government approach to help businesses and the country to prepare for a worst case Brexit scenario, while continuing to work with our EU partners to secure the best possible Brexit outcome.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has placed preparing for Brexit at the top of its budget 2019 priorities.  I have also prioritised Brexit preparedness as one of my three main priorities, alongside regional growth and innovation.  I am confident that the business community will be best placed to meet the challenges ahead.</p><p>Budget 2019 provided over &euro;110 million for additional Brexit preparedness resources and initiatives across Departments and agencies.  My Department and its agencies are participating in the new cross-government awareness campaign, Getting Ireland Brexit Ready, with events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin in October, as well as in Limerick and Donegal last month.</p><p>Over 3,000 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland's Brexit scorecard to date and 85% of its client firms are taking Brexit-related actions such as diversifying their export markets, improving operational competitiveness and investing in research and development.</p><p>I have provided funding for 98 additional staff for the agencies and regulatory bodies within the remit of my Department to date to prepare Irish businesses for Brexit.  In addition, I am providing an additional &euro;8 million in 2019 for my Department, as well as its agencies and regulatory bodies, to continue the work on our Brexit response and in increasing our global footprint.</p><p>The additional work of my Department's agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland is particularly important in helping businesses to prepare for a worst case scenario.  I am providing an additional &euro;1 million for InterTradeIreland in 2019 to expand its essential work in providing support and advice for businesses to sustain cross-Border trade and on the specific issues related to potential tariffs under a reversion to a World Trade Organization regime.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>Enterprise Ireland and Revenue are working closely in the design and development of an online platform on future customs requirements for when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union and becomes a third country.  It will be rolled-out from early 2019 to all importers and exporters through the local enterprise offices.</p><p>I am acutely aware that in the event of a worst case scenario access to finance and liquidity may become issues of concern for exporting businesses, in particular.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the roll-out of a new &euro;300 million Brexit long-term loan scheme, to come into effect from early 2019, to provide loans of up to ten years.</p><p>The Brexit working capital loan scheme which I launched earlier this year provides affordable working capital for eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are, or will be, impacted on by Brexit and meet the scheme criteria.  As of 23 November 2018, there had been 307 applications for eligibility, of which 270 were approved, ranging from the agrifood to the retail and distribution, manufacturing, hospitality and transport sectors.  A total of 54 loans have progressed to sanction at the finance provider level, corresponding to a total value of &euro;12.51 million.</p><p>I recognise the importance of the haulage, transport and logistics sectors to the functioning of the economy and success in international markets.  As the Deputy is aware, transport issues are within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister and his Department are engaging actively with stakeholders in the sector on Brexit preparedness.</p></speech>

With the increased threat of a hard Brexit, I am very concerned about businesses that depend on using the land bridge through Britain for goods going to and from the Continent.  According to the data from the Copenhagen economic report, two thirds of Irish exporters make use of the British land bridge to access continental markets.  This is particularly true of our food exporters and importers, and they are vulnerable on this specific route as travelling to the Continent by sea is two to three times longer and consequently is not viable.</p> <p> There is now a real risk that Britain will crash out of the EU with no deal.  Are there any specific plans to deal with the land bridge issue?  Has the Department looked at solutions such as bonded warehouses in Britain or additional freight ships that could cater for some of the non-perishable goods?</p></speech>

The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and indeed all Departments, have continually stressed the importance of stakeholders taking all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including the importance of undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations.  I assure the Deputy that I and other Ministers will continue to work with our EU counterparts, both in EU capitals and within the EU institutions, to protect the interests of our businesses and our haulage sector.</p>  <p>  It is vital to minimise the impact of Brexit by avoiding any new regulatory burden for our hauliers.  I am pleased that transport and logistics providers have been participating in many of the advisory sessions being held around the country.  Many of them have also applied for the Brexit loan scheme.  The recent developments on the withdrawal agreement have been welcome.  Pending the final outcome of the EU-UK negotiations, however, it is not possible to outline the regulatory regime that will be in place for Irish licensed road transport operators in the various post-Brexit scenarios.  While the Government remains focused on the finalisation of the withdrawal agreement to ensure an orderly UK exit, preparations are continuing for all contingencies.</p></speech>

I understand that it was a memo from the T&aacute;naiste which stated that Ireland will not be ready for a hard Brexit and referenced things such as site acquisitions, planning permission and procurement and construction issues that exist at our ports and airports.  This was very concerning to hear and will add to the business worries around a hard Brexit and how businesses will get their products to and from Ireland.  What plans is the Government putting in place to ensure we have a smooth continuation of imports and exports should a hard Brexit materialise?</p></speech>

A number of other stakeholder events were held this year and last year.  The Department continues to work with the road haulage, tourism, aviation and maritime sectors and stakeholders to identify and plan further for the implications of Brexit.  A study was carried out by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to assess the reasons for the use of the land bridge.  There is a lot of information in that report, but, to cut to the chase, the study recommended that Ireland's continued access to the UK land bridge is protected in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations.  There is ongoing liaison with the European Commission on this matter and on other implications for the international road haulage sector.</p>  <p>  We are continuing with contingency planning for all scenarios, both for the central case of a withdrawal agreement being fully agreed and a no-deal outcome, which I feel remains unlikely.  It is not helpful to discuss the no-deal scenario at this time.  The focus must be on ratifying the agreement, which is the only possible deal that can deliver an orderly UK withdrawal and which has been endorsed by the European Council and the British Government.</p></speech>

We are all aware that Ireland is out of step with its European partners.  Claims for whiplash in Ireland average around &euro;20,000, whereas across the water the average is between &euro;3,500 and &euro;4,000.  There is a fivefold difference.  We are well out of step, and measures must be implemented immediately to address this.</p></reply>

Its objective is to identify immediate and longer-term measures which can address increasing costs while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.  The first phase of this work involved an examination of the motor insurance sector.  The second phase involved an examination of the employer liability insurance and public liability insurance sectors.</p><p>The work of the cost of insurance working group is complemented by the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC.  I was pleased to submit the second and final report of the PIC to the Government on 18 September 2018.  The publication of this report concluded the challenging work programme of the PIC since its establishment in January 2017 on foot of a recommendation in the cost of insurance working group motor report.</p><p>The benchmarking exercise, undertaken by independent consultants on behalf of the PIC and published in this second and final report, has revealed that the level of general damages for whiplash injuries in this jurisdiction runs at a multiple of typically 4.4 times that of our nearest neighbours, England and Wales.  This multiple is of such a magnitude that the PIC is satisfied that it calls for a response that is both effective and achievable in the shortest possible time.</p><p>The key recommendation in the report follows the example of judicial intervention which has occurred in Northern Ireland and in the UK, namely the introduction of judicial guidelines for judges.  The PIC believes that the imminent statutory establishment of the Irish Judicial Council provides a unique opportunity to seek and obtain guidance for judges in measuring general damages for personal injury.  Judicial guidelines should lead to greatly increased levels of consistency in awards, enable early resolution of claims and reduce costs.</p><p>I welcome the publication in November by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, of data on whiplash related injury compensation awards resulting from road traffic accidents.  The publication of these data delivers on a recommendation from the first report of the Personal Injuries Commission published in December 2017 and involved analysis of approximately 4,500 awards made in the first six months of 2018.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which is scheduled for Committee Stage this evening, is an important measure to encourage more personal injury claims to be settled within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process.  PIAB facilitates the objective assessment of damages at a much lower delivery cost and in a far shorter timeframe than through litigation.  PIAB processes claims within 7.3 months compared to several years for litigation.  Therefore, encouraging more claimants to finalise their cases through the PIAB model rather than resorting to litigation should lead to cost savings in the claims environment.  This is good for society as a whole as it delivers compensation more quickly, with lower costs and predictable outcomes.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that people see whiplash injuries as a soft money-making proposition.  As a society and as an Oireachtas we have not challenged this issue at all.  We consistently turn a blind eye to the fact that people are scamming in this way and forcing up the cost of insurance.  That has profound implications for people, especially young people and rural people who have no choice in the matter.  They need a car, but the cost of insurance is excessive.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, in one of his only recent announcements in the area of insurance, discussed the holding of a referendum to cap awards.  The Minister knows as well as I do that that is not likely to happen in the near future.  It would be very helpful if he brought forward a judicial council Bill instead of sending out press releases.  Such a Bill would establish a council which would give effect to what is recommended in terms of the Judiciary having guidelines and its members being able to educate themselves about awards and to set benchmarks.  The idea of having a referendum, which is a major announcement, undermines the whole process and diminishes the credibility of it.</p></speech>

These form part of a suite of measures taken by the Government which will help to reduce insurance claims.  Other measures are also being taken.  The Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 was signed into law in July this year.  It is important legislation and will address the Setanta legacy.  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 is another very important step forward for the work of the cost of insurance working group.  It passed Committee Stage last month and it is hoped this Bill can be enacted by the end of the year to allow the database to be operational from early 2019.  The Bill also included two amendments to section 8 and section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to implement recommendations contained in the employer and public liability report.</p><p>These measures are very important for stakeholders as, when implemented, they should make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.</p></speech>

I am not questioning the Minister's bona fides, but the reality is that the pace of progress is lethargic.  We only have to look at the Judicial Council Bill 2017 which was only recently sent to the Seanad.  It is a key recommendation and an important component.  We have been talking about the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 for the last year and a half.  It is an integral part of ensuring the independence of the Judiciary and streamlining its ability to self-assess to ensure it is making awards that are commensurate what is required and with those made in other countries.  A Garda fraud unit is another key recommendation, but it has yet to be established.  The insurance industry is talking about financing it.  There would be no cost to the State.  We need action on that issue now.  At the end of the day there must be sanctions.  I introduced the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018 which is to proceed to Committee Stage at some point.  I sincerely hope it will be supported, while accepting that amendments might be required.  It will send a strong message that fraudsters and chancers will face the rule of law and that there is a downside to fraudulent claims.</p></speech>

Fraudsters, gangsters and chancers should not be rewarded through fraudulent claims.  That is wrong.  The insurance companies need to challenge such claims and should not pay out until they are fully satisfied that a claim is genuine.  It is a priority of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to proceed with establishing the judicial appointments council and the Garda fraud unit, a recommendation made in my Department's report.  There are a number of approaches; the problem will not be fixed, with just one solution.  Several things are happening concurrently.  The Government is satisfied that when all of the different items of legislation are passed and enacted, they will make a difference.  We are doing everything we can because the Deputy is right - people who claim fraudulently should not be rewarded.  However, we have to find a balance with the needs of those with genuine claims.  It is all about finding a solution that will not impact negatively on those who do deserve compensation.</p></speech>

That was reflected in the figures for the third quarter of 2018, with a 3% improvement nationally.  In the mid-west, however, the figures have not improved; rather, they have been stagnant.  My question is whether the Minister is concerned about this.  There is certainly concern in the mid-west about the fact that there was no increase in employment in the region in the third quarter of 2018.</p></reply>

Overall, the release is very positive.  The figures show that employment continues to grow strongly, with 66,700 jobs created in the year from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018.  It brings total employment to 2,273,200. </p><p>Between the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs in the first quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2018 there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment in the State as a whole, of whom 163,500 are located in the regions outside County Dublin.  It equates to three out of every five jobs created.  In the mid-west region there has been an increase in the number of people in employment, from 196,500 to 215,300, since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched, that is, from the first quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2018.  This represents an increase of 18,800 jobs, or 9.5%.  In the same period the level of unemployment has reduced, from a high of 12% to 7.2%.  In real terms, the number unemployed in the mid-west region has decreased by 10,300 in the period since the first quarter of 2015.  The CSO labour force survey reports no change in the numbers in employment in the mid-west in the year before the third quarter of 2018.  However, it also reports a decline in the level of unemployment of 2,600 in the mid-west region in the same period, which is very welcome. </p><p>Realising the enterprise and jobs potential in all regions and thereby reducing disparities between regions continues to be a priority of the Government.  Under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, we remain committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10% and 15% in each region by 2020 and bringing the unemployment level in each region to within at least 1% of the State average.  We have more to do.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The mid-west Regional Action Plan for Jobs process has had some notable successes such as the launch of Propeller Shannon Accelerator, a student enterprise network at the University of Limerick, and a Limerick for Engineering showcase, among many other initiatives.  Earlier this year I asked the Regional Action Plan for Jobs implementation committees, including in the mid-west, to refresh and refocus their plans to ensure their relevance and impact from now until 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit.  This work is ongoing and expected to conclude by the end of the year.  On Monday, in the second call for my Department's regional enterprise development fund, I announced an allocation of more than &euro;29 million in funding that will support the regions in delivering on their economic and enterprise development potential.  Some 21 projects all over the country received funding.  This was in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding in the first call which I announced in December 2017 and also funded 21 projects.</p></speech>

In fact, I was present when it was launched.  My concern is that the improvement has apparently stopped.  We need to take action now to ensure employment will continue to grow.  In the mid-west there is excellent interaction between higher education and educational establishments generally and employment and industry.  It has produced very positive results in recent years.  My concern is that it has stopped.  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, recently expressed the same concern in the region.  I ask the Minister to contact IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and other bodies under her aegis to ensure any issues that needs to be addressed is addressed in order that we can continue to improve the position in the mid-west.</p></speech>

The mid-west is one of the best performing areas in collaborating, attracting investment and jobs.  I have been especially struck by the success of Limerick and surrounding areas in the last year.  There have been huge job announcements.  I recently visited Edwards Lifesciences which has announced the creation of 600 new jobs in Castletroy.  More than 122,000 people are employed across 649 IDA Ireland client companies located outside Dublin.  Some 45% of all new foreign direct investment jobs created last year were in regional locations.  IDA Ireland client companies in the entire mid-west region created 897 new jobs in 2017, an increase of 5% since 2016, with total employment in overseas companies in the region now standing at 17,787 jobs across 128 client companies, which is a wonderful achievement.  Looking ahead, IDA Ireland will continue to work with both existing and prospective clients to identify new opportunities for investment in the mid-west and highlight the region's strengths for overseas firms.</p></speech>

Things like the Limerick for Engineering showcase and work undertaken by the Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick are fantastic collaborations with companies.  I have seen for myself the precision engineering industry's engagement with Limerick Institute of Technology and the work done by a variety of industries with the University of Limerick.

Some &euro;1.7 million has been allocated to a project in County Clare and the Shannon Estuary providing specialist infrastructure for maritime-related training and field research support.  Funding of &euro;2.2 million has been allocated to a digital collaboration centre in Limerick in the mid-west to drive the application of disruptive technologies.</p><p>These three projects are in addition to the funding received by the Irish Bioeconomy Foundation and Emerald Aerocluster under call one.</p> <p> As I stated, the regional action plans for jobs have been very successful.

What we need to see is the full report of the ODCE because Judge Aylmer's report clearly identifies that the office was insipid, weak and incapable of prosecuting on behalf of the State.

The purpose of publishing the account is to understand the factors that led to such investigative shortcomings and to take appropriate steps to address them.  These steps include ongoing reform within the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, including ongoing recruitment of specialist expertise and the establishment, as announced by Government in November 2017, of the ODCE as an agency to provide it with greater autonomy in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  The general scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision was considered by Government today.</p>  <p>  On 2 November 2017, the Government published the report, Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework: Ireland combatting "white collar crime".  A comprehensive set of 28 measures was developed to augment the existing regulatory and legislative framework in the area of corporate, economic and regulatory crime.  The implementation of these measures is progressing across three Departments, namely, the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Justice and Equality, and Finance.  There has been considerable progress on the delivery of these actions, with most of them either completed, on schedule or on track to be completed.</p>  <p>  Of the actions assigned to my Department, the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill was signed into law on 25 July 2018.  In addition, the Company Law Review Group has submitted its report on corporate governance and I consider that some of the recommendations in this report should be implemented in legislation.  These recommendations will be given effect through the general scheme of the ODCE Bill.  The transposition deadline for the shareholder rights directive of 10 June 2019 is expected to be met.  Submissions were received from a public consultation, which concluded on 9 February 2018.  Draft regulations were sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on 28 November 2018 for finalisation and settlement.  The general scheme of a Bill to establish the ODCE as an agency was considered by Government today and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the ODCE as an agency is intended to enhance the independence of the office by providing it with more autonomy in relation to staffing resources, particularly the ability to recruit the required specialist skills and expertise; build on its existing expertise and experience; strengthen its capability to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law; and build on the organisational and procedural reforms that have been implemented.</p></speech>

All we know is that Judge Aylmer highlighted several inadequacies.  On foot of that report, we commissioned from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement a report into itself.  We are now being given an account of the ODCE's report.  This is a sanitised version when what we need is a full, honest and open account of what happened and why the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement failed to prosecute and carry through an investigation.  As Judge Aylmer said, he had to strike out the case because of the incompetence and inefficiencies of the agency.  We did not get accountability in the court and we certainly need to get it from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Government is holding Parliament in contempt by providing a sanitised account of the report, rather than the full report.  That is shameful.  It should publish the report and be damned.</p></speech>

For this reason, after the trial in the case of the DPP <i>v.</i>Sean Fitzpatrick ended in May 2017, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation requested a report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the investigative failings that led to the result.  However, the Attorney General advised that it is not legally possible for the Minister to publish the report under section 956 of the Companies Act.  I cannot publish the report because if I do, I will break the law.  That is why we are committed to the publication of an account of the shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer in this particular investigation.  That is the most important issue.  The account relates to the role of the ODCE and not the role of other parties involved in the case, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, auditors and solicitors.  The focus of this account is on moving forward using the learnings from these shortcomings and taking steps to address them as the Government continues with its commitment to ensure that Ireland continues to enjoy its well-deserved reputation as a good place in which to do business.</p></speech>

Week in and week out, one can see people being hauled before the repossession courts because they are unable to keep up mortgage repayments.  Sometimes they lose their home and, tragically, some of them even lose their lives.  At the same time, the longest criminal trial in the history of the State collapsed and Judge Aylmer was scathing of the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We commissioned a report and we now get the sanitised version of what happened.  I cannot believe the Minister can come into the House and say the Attorney General advised this course of action.  Across the water, we see that the UK Government has been found to have held parliament in contempt by not publishing the attorney general's advice.  It is shameful that the full report of the ODCE has not been laid before this House in order that Parliament can discuss it.  At this late stage, it should be published.  Everybody who has suffered deserves to know why one of the biggest and longest criminal trials in the history of the State, which was related to the banking system, failed miserably.  The State is failing again.</p></speech>

One of the main shortcomings the judge identified was the lack of skill sets in the ODCE for this investigation, which took place between 2008 and 2012.  It is clear that the office did not even have one forensic accountant at that stage.  It now has eight forensic accountants and a number of other expert staff, including a digital forensic specialist, two enforcement portfolio managers and two enforcement lawyers.  The office will also have a digital forensic laboratory.  Since 2012, the ODCE has been strengthened considerably and now has a stronger set of skills.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of a Bill was considered by Government today.  This Bill, which will be published shortly, will establish the ODCE as an independent agency.</p><p>It will give it the autonomy it needs to employ the required skill set to undertake its extremely complex work.  The Deputy is correct that this was one of the most complex cases in the history of the State.</p></speech>

In order to implement the measures, the Government agreed that it would support and amend the Prohibition of Above-cost Ticket Touting Bill introduced in January 2017 by Deputies Rock and Donnelly and would take Second and Subsequent Stages of the Bill in Government time.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation would ban the resale of tickets above face value in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.  The use of bot software to purchase tickets in excess of the number permitted by event organisers would also be prohibited.  In addition, the legislation will give effect to the commitment given to UEFA to ban the unauthorised transfer and use of tickets for matches and official events taking place in Ireland during the Euro 2020 championship.</p>  <p>  Second Stage of the Bill was scheduled for 21 November, but it did not prove possible to have the debate on that date.  I very much hope that the Second Reading of the Bill will proceed as soon as possible and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies to that debate.</p>  <p>  My officials have been working on a range of amendments and additions to the Bill and expect to formally submit these to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel later this month.  When finalised, the Government amendments will be tabled on Committee or Report Stage of the Bill.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Deputies Rock and Donnelly in highlighting this issue.  The Bill has cross-party support and it is important that it be progressed.</p></speech>

Since taking office, she has treated this issue and a great many other consumer affairs issues with urgency, which I appreciate.  It is the kind of practical bread and butter politics that people appreciate.</p>  <p>  With regard to Euro 2020, the Minister will appreciate that we are increasingly under time pressure as a commitment was made to have the legislation in place before tickets for that event go on sale.  The draw for the matches, which will begin in a few weeks, took place in Dublin a few days ago.  We need to act quickly on the Bill as the tickets will soon go on sale.  The Government has worked hard on this issue.  I look forward to the amendments from the Department.  We hope to see action on the Bill as soon as possible.  I am conscious that the Minister and the Department tried to progress the Bill, with Second Stage having been scheduled for 21 November.  I hope the Minister can commit to having a debate as soon as possible when we return in the new year.</p></speech>

There have been recent problems involving tickets for the Ireland versus New Zealand rugby match and the Spice Girls concert next year being sold online for multiples of face value.  That is not right and it is not fair on genuine fans.  I assure the Deputy that I will get the Bill enacted as quickly as possible.  My officials are working with drafters on the necessary amendments and additions to the Bill and we expect to submit the amendments formally to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel later this month.  Second Stage of the Bill was scheduled to be taken on 21 November but, unfortunately, was replaced by a debate on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.  There is limited time available between now and Christmas but I want to have Second Stage as soon as possible in order to get the Bill moving.  It is my intention to bring forward the relevant amendments on Committee or Report Stage.  I am very hopeful that we will be able to progress the Bill substantially and enact it in the next session, although the allocation and scheduling of D&aacute;il time is not always within my control.

The Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017 which I introduced to tackle ticket touting is again stuck in limbo, this time awaiting a money message.  I look forward to the Minister's amendments.  After an examination of them, Sinn F&eacute;in will decide on whether it will support the Bill.  It is to be hoped that we will be able to support it because all Members genuinely want to deal with this issue.  Ticket touting costs consumers dearly, with those seeking Electric Picnic tickets the latest to be affected.  The Minister is ignoring the issue and blocking solutions brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in by putting up barriers to the Bill we introduced.  I ask her to explain to consumers, many of them young people on tight budgets, why they will continue to be ripped off for concert and match tickets for the foreseeable future.  Has UEFA sought an update on the promise given by the Government to legislate on this matter in advance of the Euro 2020 games?</p></speech>

The legal opinion was sent to the legal advisers seconded to my Department from the Office of the Attorney General for their opinion on 28 November.  This is normal practice when such legal opinions are submitted.  The examination of the legal opinion is in progress and I expect I will be briefed by my officials once that process is complete.</p>  <p>  On the matters raised by Deputy Quinlivan, all Members want the same result but we are trying to do it in a way that maximises the impact of the legislation.  The Bill introduced by Deputy Quinlivan provides for a prohibition on the sale of tickets at a price of greater than 10% above face value for events for which more than 300 tickets have been offered for sale.  The Government proposes to amend the Bill introduced by Deputies Rock and Donnelly to provide that the ban on above-face-value resale would apply to designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.  I consider that applying the legislation to known designated venues rather than on an event-by-event basis would facilitate more effective enforcement.  It is often not known until the day of an event whether the attendance will exceed 300.  I do not wish to cause damage to local clubs which are fundraising or holding charity events.  We are trying to find a way for the legislation to be effective.</p></speech>

Brexit is undoubtedly the most significant challenge to have faced Irish enterprise in more than 50 years.  With less than four months to go, I am determined to deliver on the commitments in budget 2019 which have Brexit at their core, building on the many measures we have already introduced and responding to the evolving needs of business.  We started this process with the introduction of a suite of measures in budget 2017 and further measures in budget 2018. </p>  <p>  In allocating my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2019, I am once again stepping up our response to Brexit.  My decisions are based on an extensive body of research and direct feedback from the sector.</p><p>To start, I am allocating an extra &euro;14 million to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, which work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.<br/><br/>As part of the increase to my Department for 2019, I am allocating an additional &euro;3 million to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2 million to IDA Ireland to enhance our global footprint.  This will help companies to diversify into new markets as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  I am also providing additional funding of &euro;3 million to regulatory bodies, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and my Department to enhance their existing functions in the context of Brexit.<br/><br/>I am providing an extra &euro;1 million in capital funding for InterTradeIreland, representing an increase of 17.5%.  InterTradeIreland has a vital role to play as part of Ireland's Brexit response.  This additional funding will enable the body to meet demand in existing programmes, develop initiatives and support SMEs affected by Brexit.<br/><br/>The local enterprise offices are present in every single county and provide crucial supports for SMEs and start-ups throughout the country.  This year, I am allocating an additional &euro;5 million, which is an increase of 22% on 2018.  This extra funding will help deliver supports to more SMEs, particularly in the current changing landscape.<br/><br/>I also announced, as part of budget 2019, a longer-term loan facility, the future growth scheme, of up to &euro;300 million to support capital investment by business.  This involves collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Department of Finance, the European Investment Bank group and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.<br/><br/>I welcome the additional measures announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, as part of budget 2019 that will enhance a number of the taxation supports targeted specifically at our businesses.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>The redesign of the employment investment incentive scheme, EIIS, and enhancements to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, share option scheme show the level of commitment from this Government to indigenous enterprise.<br/><br/>To further my commitment to the future growth of our SME sector, my Department, in conjunction with the OECD earlier this year, commenced a review of SME and entrepreneurship policies and issues in Ireland.  This will be a seminal 18 month project that will see a comprehensive review of the SME business ecosystem and policies, using OECD expertise in a structured and defined process.  The resulting recommendations and issues identified by the report will then form the basis of a long-term Department-led SME strategy for Ireland.  The delivery of the review document and the strategy roadmap will be completed by the OECD within 18 months of commencement.  To this end, I will continue to ensure that we are supporting the development needs of SMEs by providing them with the tools and incentives to grow their businesses in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is an undisputed fact that SMEs are the backbone of our economy.  The sector is the main contributor to our employment.  Over 99% of businesses are in the sector.  Almost 70% of people are employed by SMEs.  SMEs are often overlooked, with greater focus being placed on foreign direct investment and large multinationals receiving a lot of media attention ahead of the smaller companies that create the economies in our cities, suburbs, towns and villages.</p>  <p>  In County Clare, there is a strong multinational footprint.  We are sixth in the country.  We have a thriving SME sector which continues to grow, with businesses going from strength to strength.  In addition, there are new start-ups.  Furthermore, our restaurants, hotels and retailers continue to employ hundreds and create economic activity by providing quality services.</p>  <p>  Emphasis is often placed on new start-ups in establishing new businesses, and rightly so, but we also need to work on supporting existing businesses and helping them to remain profitable and to diversify when they experience difficulties.  What plans does the Minister have to continue to support the SME sector in rural and regional Ireland?</p></speech>

I want to ensure SMEs are supported, and that is why I allocated an extra &euro;5 million for our local enterprise offices in the budget.  That represents an increase of 22%.  We have 31 local enterprise offices, and they do great work throughout the country.  They can provide grants to businesses with ten or fewer employees, but they can also provide advice and soft support to other SMEs.  Sometimes that is a big help to businesses in increasing productivity, which in turn increases their competitiveness.  I refer to where they receive the soft supports to improve their management skills.</p>  <p>  Future Jobs is a new strategy being developed by my Department.  I chaired a session specifically on productivity at the launch in the Aviva Stadium.  We need to consider how to improve productivity among SMEs so they will be ready and able to adapt in a changing world.  That will be a key focus of the Future Jobs initiative, which will be launched in early 2019.</p></speech>

It is encouraging to hear that an additional &euro;5 million has been provided for the local enterprise offices throughout the State, representing an increase of 22%.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister envisage further investment in the local enterprise offices, thereby expanding their remit and improving their operations even more?  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

I am committed to supporting them.  The increase in budget 2019 of &euro;5 million was considerable and it was very much welcomed.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's area, Enterprise Ireland-supported job announcements in 2017 and 2018 in the mid-west included 80 jobs in CAE Parc Aviation in Shannon and Dublin in May 2017, 150 jobs in H&amp;MV Engineering in Limerick in January 2018, and 18 jobs in Croom Precision in Limerick in July 2018.  Enterprise Ireland client companies saw an increase in employment in the mid-west of 7% in 2017 by comparison with the national average of 5%.  Only last Monday, I announced the regional enterprise development fund.  In that, there was &euro;1.7 million for a project in County Clare concerning the Shannon Estuary with a view to providing specialist infrastructure for maritime related training and field research support.  This helps the indigenous companies to consider more innovation and research.  We need to support our indigenous companies with research and development.</p></speech>

The county's joblessness figures have not improved at the same rate as in the rest of the country.  County Mayo is home to some of the world's leading companies, yet in recent years it has not had a new IDA Ireland investment.  There was no investment in yesterday's announcement of &euro;29 million for regional enterprise development funds, in spite of applications from the county.  We need a very frank discussion about the Department's agencies' plans for County Mayo.</p></reply>

Overall, the quarter 3 results are very positive.  Figures show that employment continues to grow strongly, with 66,700 jobs created throughout the State in the year from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of 2018.  This brings total number of people in employment to 2.273 million.</p>  <p>  In the west in the year to quarter 3 of 2018, an extra 5,100 people were in employment.  In the same period, there were 1,100 fewer people unemployed in the region.  Since the launch of the regional action plan for jobs in 2015, there was an increase of 28,400 people in employment throughout the west from quarter 1 of 2015 to quarter 3 of 2018.  In the same period, the unemployment rate in the west fell from 12.6% to 6.6%.</p>  <p>  There are 16 IDA Ireland client companies operating in County Mayo, employing a total of 4,462 people.  I am pleased to say that employment in IDA Ireland-supported companies in Mayo has increased year on year since 2012, with an almost 26% increase in foreign direct investment employment from 2012 to 2017.</p>  <p>  The IDA continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in County Mayo to multinational companies.  As part of its regional property programme, the IDA has constructed an advance building in Castlebar which is being actively marketed to IDA Ireland clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is also working to support job creation in County Mayo in assisting entrepreneurs who are setting up start-up companies in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  Enterprise Ireland is also focusing on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its client portfolio in the county.  There were 115 Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Mayo, employing 4,118 people in 2017.  In the period 2015 to 2017, Enterprise Ireland paid approximately &euro;8 million to support the enterprise development of its client companies in County Mayo.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the support of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, a total of 60 new jobs were created in the Mayo Gaeltacht in 2017.</p><p>This amounted to a net increase of eight jobs on the previous year and means there were 648 full-time jobs in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies in the Mayo Gaeltacht at the end of the year.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>Work is ongoing across Government Departments and agencies to deliver on the Government's commitment to secure quality and sustainable employment in the regions and build on the upward trend in employment figures that we saw in the recent labour force survey for quarter 3 of 2018.</p></speech>

We have many excellent companies located in the county and we are proud to host them.  Their success has been on the basis of the fantastic labour force we have.  However, despite our track record and level of success, only 23 of a total of 3,289 IDA Ireland client visits undertaken between 2011 and 2017 were to County Mayo and the county has not attracted a new IDA Ireland supported company in many years.  The Minister mentioned the property solution in Castlebar.  We also have one in Ballina but it is not being marketed extensively or built on.  The alliance of food and healthcare companies is not being marketed sufficiently.  I referred to yesterday's announcement of &euro;29 million for a regional enterprise development fund.  Not one investment was based in Mayo, although a very small part of the Sligo investment was in Mayo.  We have corresponded with the Minister about the disruptive technologies innovation fund, in respect of which a very successful Mayo company submitted an application concerning a new technology which was turned down.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is crying out for capital investment and we have made this a feature of our budgets.  Many good things are happening on the back of people in County Mayo working hard, but a great many Mayo people want an opportunity to return home.  Inaction on the part of the Minister's Department means they are not getting that opportunity.  We need new investment in IDA Ireland companies and our fantastic team at the Mayo local enterprise office.  If they had more resources, they could do an awful lot more.</p></speech>

These companies continue to invest and we continue to support them to do so.  Only last week, more than &euro;3.2 million was allocated to the Ballina innovation quarter under the urban regeneration fund.  This provided for the development of the old military barracks in Ballina into a new innovation quarter.  It is projected that the new quarter will consist of a digital hub and an innovation centre and could lead to the creation of 200 jobs within three years.  The digital hub will provide 20 spaces for technology, digital media and Internet companies to scale and grow alongside local enterprises.  It will also enhance the town's attractiveness for investment and provide local start-up businesses with a place to develop and grow.</p>  <p>  Regarding the rural development fund, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, announced almost &euro;800,000 to be provided for the development of eight enterprise and digital hubs across County Mayo.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is the lead partner on this project.  These hubs will provide business clusters focusing on the creative industries, the Irish language, sport and the marine.  These are very positive developments for Mayo.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  He is the Minister who said Ireland is unbalanced.  It will continue to be unbalanced for as long as we do not have ambition for counties such as Mayo.  The Minister referred to the innovation hub.  It is a superb project led by Mayo County Council and Moy Valley Resources, which has been turned down for many projects by Enterprise Ireland.  This is the kind of ambition we have in the county.  We have a superb LEO.  With more resources and support from the Department, we could do an awful lot more in small companies and big companies.</p>  <p>  There is no sense in going on about the 16 IDA Ireland companies.  We are incredibly proud of them and the Mayo workforce, yet around us, in counties Sligo, Galway, Longford, Roscommon, new IDA Ireland companies are coming in and giving people the opportunity to come home.  We see the pressure Dublin is under.  There are many people who will come home for Christmas and will have to leave again afterwards.  They want to work and create businesses in Mayo and be given the opportunity to do so.  What we do not have is support from Departments, including the Minister's Department, to match the ambition and determination of the people of County Mayo.</p></speech>

Only yesterday, I announced the regional enterprise development fund.  The Deputy stated there was nothing specific in the fund for County Mayo, but there was much in it for the region.  I see regions, not county boundaries.  A project that was funded in Sligo will have benefits for Mayo and the neighbouring counties.  On Monday I was in Navan launching this fund, from which the Boyne Valley Food Innovation District now stands to benefit.  Its application was turned down the last time.  The representatives of the Boyne Valley Food Innovation District present at the launch said they were very disappointed by this initial decision.  They said they applied for funding under the regional enterprise development fund, put in the application and were called to make a bid.  They said it felt like they were at a football game and were five-nil down and were hoping the ground would open up and swallow them.  They had to go out the door without any money.  However, they made a second application.  I suggest that the companies that failed to get any funding under the regional enterprise development fund go back to Enterprise Ireland, talk to them and look at how they can improve the application.  This is what the Boyne Valley Food Innovation District did.  It improved its application and now has funding under this round.  This is a rolling fund.  I suggest the Deputy gather together the companies that were unsuccessful in their applications to the regional enterprise development fund, which was independently assessed, and tell them to go back to Enterprise Ireland, get feedback and look to see where they can improve on their applications.  I want to see every region and county benefitting.</p></speech>

It is important to emphasise in this context, however, that foreign direct investment performance, whether in Donegal or any other county, is not necessarily reflected in new name investments.  This is because almost 70% of all new FDI in Ireland comes from existing IDA client companies already situated in the country.</p><p>As the evidence demonstrates, there has been a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in Donegal in recent years.  The county, for example, has experienced a 52% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in the agency's client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,389 at the end of last year.  This compares very favourably with the national average increase of 31% in FDI employment across that same period.  In 2017 alone, the number of IDA Ireland supported jobs in Donegal increased by 11%, with the county now home to 12 IDA companies, including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica.</p><p>The indications are that FDI in Donegal will continue to experience further growth this year.  For example, Abbott Laboratories has announced plans to expand its workforce in the county with the creation of 500 new jobs.  Site visits by IDA Ireland client companies have also increased, with six visits as of the third quarter of 2018, compared with a total of two site visits in 2017.</p><p>While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Donegal, the Government remains determined to achieve more.  For this reason, work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential in the county.  IDA Ireland remains pivotal to this and the agency is engaging with its clients and other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investments there.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The table below outlines total new name investment by IDA Ireland clients nationally from 2008 to 2017, inclusive.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td><b>Number of New Name Investments</b></td><td>36</td><td>39</td><td>47</td><td>61</td><td>65</td><td>78</td><td>88</td><td>94</td><td>99</td><td>111</td></tr></table></p></speech>

Unfortunately, it indicates what the reality has been in recent years regarding new investments coming to Donegal.  As she rightly points out, the existing client companies in Donegal have done tremendously well, thrived in the county and continued to expand, thankfully.  The figures she outlined, going from 2,200 to 3,300 in a few short years, demonstrate what a good place Donegal can be to do business, but of course all these existing client companies had to first locate in the county.  They started off in the county and then grew.</p><p>There was a real priority in the county and there used to be an office based in Letterkenny specifically to attract new investment.  As a result, the sector and foreign direct investment in Letterkenny and across the county thrived.  That has, however, not been followed through by the existing Government in recent years.</p> <p> The Minister has confirmed today that there have only been three new investments in the county in the past ten years.  That is not good enough.  It shows the Government must reappraise how it is doing this and it must try to ensure we have a pipeline of new companies coming in to bolster and grow employment in the county.  Will the Minister undertake that she will revisit this and try to ensure we are getting our fair share of new investment in future?</p></speech>

It is always encouraging when a multinational company decides to locate in Ireland.  That is particularly the case when it is in a region for the first time.  We should not, however, allow our enthusiasm for new name investors, which I assure the Deputy the IDA is working daily to attract to Ireland, to cloud the fact that the most important investors are firms already present in Ireland.  As I said, that is because 70% of all new FDI in this country comes from existing IDA client companies.</p>  <p>  Our priority is always to sustain and support investors that already have a presence here with a view to encouraging their growth and expansion.  That remains the most effective means through which we can create new employment opportunities in places such as Donegal.  There are already excellent companies there such as Pramerica, Abbott Ireland and others.  It is important not to dismiss the great work being done by them in creating employment in Donegal.  We also have, of course, indigenous companies there which are also supported by Enterprise Ireland.  They also play an important role in creating employment throughout the country.</p></speech>

Companies such as Pramerica, United Health Care and SITA, among many others, have really thrived and are now a tremendous part of the local economy.  We need, however, to see the Government continuing to push that on in the future.  The companies we would hope to grow in future would be new ones which would come to the county, alongside companies already there.  That is where the Minister and her Government have been falling down and have not been prioritising the county.  As the Minister stated in her own figures, we have only had three first time investments in the past ten years.  The Government needs to pull up its socks and ensure Donegal becomes a priority again.</p></speech>

I have a particular priority for regional investment and that is why I announced successful applicants to the regional enterprise investment fund on Monday.  It is a &euro;60 million fund and almost &euro;29 million was allocated on Monday.  That fund is to help the regions to develop new initiatives.  It is about clustering, investing in property and investing in research and development.  I will shortly be announcing - I think next week - the disruptive technologies innovation fund.  That is another fund we have rolled out to help companies look at the jobs of the future.  Two weeks ago, I also launched the future jobs initiative and again that is looking at how we can support enterprise to improve productivity, increase competitiveness, get more labour participation and transition to a low-carbon economy.  I also refer to encouraging companies to invest in research and development.  I reassure the Deputy that Donegal will not be left out, nor will any other county.</p></speech>

This funding has been awarded to 21 regional projects throughout the country, bringing the total amount of funding awarded under the two calls of this scheme to &euro;60 million across 42 projects in all regions.  The REDF was designed to support the ambition in the Programme for a Partnership Government to create an additional 200,000 new jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 are to be located outside of Dublin.  One of the principal criteria within the scheme is that proposed projects would strengthen the potential for job creation in their region, thereby contributing to delivering on the Government&rsquo;s ambition.</p>  <p>  The REDF is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths.  The fund is supporting significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  This will be achieved by co-financing the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  The fund will help to ensure the benefits of our growing economy are felt in all regions.  Projects submitted by the 28 June deadline went through a rigorous seven-stage process before being awarded funding.</p>  <p>  This was a competitive process and so not all projects were successful.  To ensure a balanced regional spread, however, I committed to ensuring that each region would benefit by at least &euro;2 million from the fund once the required standard for projects was met under the evaluation criteria.  This threshold has now been met across all regions.  As of Monday, all projects have been informed of their result in the competition.  Further funding calls will be considered as part of a wider review of the REDF in the new year.</p></speech>

I was pleased that my own constituency of Sligo-Leitrim got &euro;1.9 million for the Sligo Enterprise and Technology Centre in Strandhill.  That is an area crying out for a development such as this.  Great effort has been put into that development, as it has in Drumshambo, where &euro;950,000 was allocated to the Leitrim Food Enterprise Zone project.  It is a project that has been highlighted for the past several years and it is a continuation of the hub already in Drumshambo.  The area allocated for development in Strandhill is full to capacity.  People are very happy with the Minister's announcement of the &euro;1.9 million on Monday, as indeed is the board of the Sligo Enterprise and Technology Centre and that of the project in Drumshambo.</p></speech>

On Monday, under the second call of the regional enterprise development fund, I announced more than &euro;25 million in funding.  Some 21 projects from all over the country received funding.  This is in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding in the first call of the regional enterprise development fund that I announced in December 2017.  That also funded 21 projects.  This is good news for the north west.</p>  <p>  Over the first and second calls of the regional enterprise development fund, the region secured total funding of &euro;5.2 million for four projects.  In the first call, &euro;1.1 million was allocated to create an innovative ecosystem in Inishowen in County Donegal and &euro;1.2 million was allocated for the development of a network of three digital and innovation hubs in counties Leitrim, Cavan and Longford.  As Deputy McLoughlin mentioned, there was &euro;1.9 million for a digital and technology hub at Sligo Enterprise and Technology Centre for entrepreneurs in digital gaming and associated technologies.  The project in Leitrim is especially good because that is the project of the owner of the company that makes Drumshambo Gunpowder Gin, which has gone on to international success.</p></speech>

Up to October 2018, 38 companies were supported through the Enterprise Ireland competitive start fund.  This year Enterprise Ireland ran nine competitive start fund calls targeting a range of areas of focus, such as international entrepreneurs, graduates, fintech, agritech and female entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  New Frontiers is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme for innovative and early-stage start-ups.  The programme is based in 14 institutes of technology and two participating universities.  At the end of October this year, there were 157 entrepreneurs on the programme.</p>  <p>  As of July 2018, 56 high potential start-ups have been supported by Enterprise Ireland.  The local enterprise offices are providing a range of training programmes to support new businesses, including start your own business and management development courses.  Up to 30 November, there were in excess of 27,000 people on local enterprise office training programmes and 3,452 people on start your own business courses.</p>  <p>  All of these supports ensure we have a continuous pipeline of start-up businesses which will create jobs throughout the country.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is masked by a competitive foreign direct investment sector which has high productivity levels.  We need to concentrate on our SMEs because they are the backbone of our enterprise base.</p>  <p>  We are also encouraging more companies to invest in research and development.  That is important and is one of the mitigating measures for Brexit.  We are asking companies to diversify their markets, look at their competitiveness and invest in their research and innovation.  It has been found that companies which did invest in innovation actually had a greater likelihood of surviving the last crash.  Many of them came through because they had invested in new products.</p></speech>

I am firmly focused on delivering on the Programme for a Partnership Government target to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these jobs to be located outside of Dublin.</p><p>My Department and enterprise agencies are playing a key role in supporting the creation of sustainable and quality jobs in the regions, including in County Wexford.  County Wexford forms part of the south-east regional action plan for jobs, which aims to achieve a 10% to 15% growth in employment over the period to 2020, as well as ensuring unemployment reduces to within at least one percentage point of the State average.</p><p>Since commencing the regional Action Plan for Jobs in 2015, good progress has been made on job creation in the south east, with 17,300 more people in employment in the region from the first quarter of 2015, baseline year, to the third quarter of 2018.  The unemployment rate in the south east at the third quarter of 2018 stands at 8.6%, down from 11.7 % in the first quarter of 2015. </p><p>There are 18 IDA Ireland client companies located in County Wexford employing a total of 2,948 people.  Foreign direct investment-supported employment in County Wexford has increased by 10% from 2016 to 2017.  IDA Ireland continues to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in Wexford and the broader south east.  In doing so, IDA Ireland will draw the attention of investors to the region's particular strengths, including its ports and existing clusters of financial services, technology and high-value manufacturing firms.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland continues to support job creation in County Wexford, with client companies employing more than 4,670 people in the county.  Payments by Enterprise Ireland to client companies in the county in 2017 totalled &euro;2.16 million.  Significant investment announced in County Wexford includes the re-opening of Glanbia Ireland&rsquo;s Wexford cheese plant following a major capital investment programme.  The &euro;35 million investment has been supported by the Government through Enterprise Ireland since 2014 and has doubled peak capacity at the plant.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has also announced national funding of &euro;4.86 million under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme to 26 seafood enterprises and three research institutions.  Two Wexford seafood businesses received grant aid, namely, Sofrimar in Kilmore Quay and Jade Ireland Seafood.</p><p>The local enterprise office, LEO, in Wexford is the first-stop-shop for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and soft supports in the form of training and mentoring to anyone wishing to start or grow a business in the area.  In that regard in 2017, the LEO in Wexford supported 213 clients with 1,348 total jobs, which was a gross increase of 238 jobs on 2016.  I also announced an extra &euro;5 million in budget 2019 to enable the LEOs, including LEO Wexford, to support a broad range of indigenous micro-enterprises.</p><p>These initiatives, along with the many supports available to businesses from my Department through Enterprise Ireland, IDA and the LEOs, are designed to maximise the creation of quality and sustainable employment in all regional, rural and urban areas, including County Wexford and the wider region.  This is a key priority for the Government.</p></speech>

The last Central Statistics Office third quarter figures showed unemployment in the south east surged to 8.6%.  The economy is supposed to be booming and we keep hearing announcements about jobs.  Unemployment in the south east is going up, however.  Wexford has 3.3% of the national population but it only has 1.3% of IDA Ireland jobs.  The head of IDA Ireland has said he has no intention of purchasing any land in Wexford for IDA jobs despite the fact that Wexford has the sixth lowest ratio of IDA land.</p>  <p>  We have low-quality jobs as well as a low percentage of our workforce in employment.  The jobs that are there are low paid, as we know from the Revenue returns for the south east.  IDA Ireland does not even know Wexford exists.</p>  <p>  What will the Minister do about unemployment in the south east and the lack of jobs in Wexford?  The unemployment rate is going up significantly at a time when the economy is booming.  It shows the Government has zero interest.  The Minister had to go back to the first quarter of 2015 to find a statistic to back up her statement.  Unemployment is going up but the Government is doing nothing about this in Wexford.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago during Leaders' Questions I raised with the Taoiseach the ODCE report on the mishandling of the investigation into the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, and his annual warehousing of personal loans from the bank.  I said I had seen the ODCE report and that it was a whitewash.  I wish to correct the D&aacute;il record.  It was not the original ODCE report that I had seen but a Government account of the investigative failures of the ODCE identified by Judge John Aylmer and the steps being taken to address them.  The Minister published that account today.  We saw it two weeks ago and I have read it twice.  I am sad to say it, but it is a whitewash.  In the introduction to the document the Minister wrote that the aim in publishing the account was to present the facts surrounding the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer, learn from them and take measures to address them.  Where in the document is that done?  The document prepared by the Department that I have seen does not do that.</p>  <p>  The ODCE report on the collapse of the FitzPatrick trial was requested in May 2017 by the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation under section 955 of the Companies Act 2014 following a direct request from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  Section 955 requires the director to give information to the Minister and, when requested, account to a committee of the Oireachtas.  This is a reporting requirement.  The Minister is now telling us that, owing to section 956 on confidential information, she does not have the power to publish the report.  I do not accept that.  Section 956 does not relate to reports requested under section 955; rather, it deals with protecting confidential information the director has accumulated while performing his or her functions which are set out in section 949.  The power contained in section 955 is not a function of the director but a reporting requirement.</p>  <p>  The ODCE report is 250 pages long.  It has been on the desk of various Ministers in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation for 17 months.  On the opening pages of the original report the Director of Corporate Enforcement wrote that no information or document had been omitted from it on the basis that it would prejudice the performance of any of his functions.  How can the Minister refuse to publish the report when the director has stated nothing in it would interfere with his functions?  I do not understand the Minister's argument.</p></speech>

One of the key areas on which the Taoiseach focused during his leadership battle with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, was white collar crime.  He said he would make it a priority, but he has done nothing about it since.</p></speech>

It makes no sense.</p>  <p>  There are many unanswered questions about the FitzPatrick trial, the ODCE's handling of it, the Garda's involvement and the decision to pursue a second trial.  I may be cynical, but it seems that this suits the Government because it wants the issue to go away and is happy to hide behind the Attorney General's advice not to publish it.  As legislators, we will be expected to sign off on a new body - a beefed up ODCE - in the near future, but how can we consider the new legislation when we cannot even see where the problems arose in the past?  Does the Minister not believe that, in the interests of democracy and in the public interest, it is crucial that the Government publish the full ODCE report as soon as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400031#DD01700"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  One of the most complex and largest investigations in the history of the State commenced in 2008 with the investigation by the ODCE into Anglo Irish Bank.  The trial in the case ended when Judge Aylmer directed the acquittal of the defendant on all charges.  Following Judge Aylmer's ruling on 23 May 2017, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation requested a report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the issues arising from the trial.  The report, to which the Deputy is referring, was delivered on 23 June 2017 to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement with the Office of the Attorney General on the publication of the report.  It was hoped initially that it would be possible to publish it.  However, prior to making a final decision on publication, further consideration had to be given to the confidentiality obligations concerning information in the possession of the director, as there was a public interest in ensuring ongoing and future investigations would not be compromised by the disclosure of details of an individual investigation and the investigative process.</p>  <p>  Owing to section 956 of the Companies Act 2014, I am prohibited from publishing reports prepared pursuant to section 955 of the Act.  While it is not possible to publish the report, I have this afternoon published an account of the investigative shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer.  My aim in publishing the account is to set out the factors that led to the shortcomings in order that we can learn from them and take measures to address them.  The focus of the account is on the ODCE's role in the shortcomings identified, not on the other parties involved in the case.  In the interests of balance, it is important, however, to emphasise that the shortcomings in this instance should not overshadow the ODCE's track record in previous investigations and prosecutions which led to successful convictions.  I accept that the standard of investigation in this case fell below appropriate standards.  This happened between 2008 and 2012.  The judge's findings point to the need for a broader skills base, a greater range and depth of knowledge and experience within the office and a greater appreciation of the necessity to employ appropriate procedures and manage risk.</p>  <p>  Now that we know the factors that led to the shortcomings, our focus has shifted to ensuring we use the lessons of this investigation, note the steps already taken to address them and identify further measures to enhance the capacity of the ODCE to tackle corporate wrongdoing.  Since the time of the investigation, the director has implemented multiple reforms within the ODCE that address many of the issues that led to the investigative shortcomings outlined by Judge Aylmer.  The drafting of the companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill to establish the ODCE as a stand-alone agency will build on these reforms and ensure the ODCE is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Furthermore, as part of the process of preparing the Bill, any further power identified as a requirement for carrying out the functions of the agency will be considered, as appropriate.  I have secured an additional &euro;1 million for the ODCE in 2019 to assist in its transition to a stand-alone agency.</p></speech>

Not publishing it is not doing him any favours.  The Minister's report does not outline any of the investigative failures or shortcomings that Judge Aylmer identified.  I can tell the Minister that 15 pages of his report after he threw out the case are far more informative - 20 times more informative - than her account.  The Minister's report ignores the fact that there was a deliberate attempt to build the case rather than investigate it independently and impartially.  At this stage, I am convinced that we need a full independent inquiry if we are to get information and understanding and find out where we are going.  We are talking about forming a new entity.  That is fine.  I do not have a problem with that because we need to do something serious about tackling white-collar crime but it does not stack up for the Government to hide behind the Attorney General's advice and not publish the ODCE report.  I do not believe the Government can continue down this road without a full independent inquiry.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that the House of Commons had a vote today about the British attorney general's legal advice.  The British Government has just been defeated and the British attorney general will be censured in the House of Commons for refusing to publish his legal advice regarding Brexit.  He also hid behind the public interest when it is in the public interest for the Government to be transparent and open.  If we want transparency and openness about what happened since 2009 concerning how the FitzPatrick case was dealt with from start to finish, we need a full independent inquiry.  For starters, we need to see the publication of the ODCE's original report, all 235 pages of it.  I have outlined with regard to the different sections why even the director of the ODCE has pointed that there is no obstacle to publishing this report.  The Government is hiding behind it.</p></speech>

It is crucial to understand the factors that led to the shortcomings identified by the judge so we can take measures to address them.  Does Deputy Wallace know the measures we must take to address them?  They involve strengthening the ODCE and giving it increased powers.  This was the largest investigation that took place between 2008 and 2012.  At that time, it was one of the most complex investigations in the history of the State.  It is clear that the investigation was not up to the standard required and the ODCE did not have the skills to take it on.  In 2008, the ODCE did not have one forensic accountant - not one.  In fairness to the current director of the ODCE, he has upskilled, got further resources and has brought in expertise.  He now has eight forensic accountants, one digital forensic scientific specialist, two enforcement portfolio managers and two enforcement lawyers.  The ODCE has been put on an independent footing and will have more autonomy to get the people it needs and more money.  There will be an extra &euro;1 million for it.  This will help the ODCE to do the job it must do, which is to ensure companies-----</p></speech>

Survival rates are 92% for prostate cancer, 83% for breast cancer and 63% for bowel cancer.  However, when it comes to lung cancer, the statistics are stark with a survival rate of 18%.  More people are killed by lung cancer than by any other cancer.  More people have died from lung cancer than have died from breast cancer and colorectal cancer combined.  It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Ireland.  The lung cancer mortality rate in Irish women is the fourth highest in Europe - more than 50% above the European average - and is still increasing.  Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the most common cause of death in Ireland as the population grows.  This translates to 1,865 deaths per year.  The incidence of lung cancer is expected to increase dramatically by 119% in the next 25 or so years.</p>  <p>  There are very significant statistics relating to health inequalities in Ireland.  Lung cancer rates are 60% higher in socio-economically deprived groups than in the least deprived groups.  Survival rates are also significantly lower in poorer socio-economically groups than among the better off.  The statistic relating to urban and rural areas is interesting.  The rate among males in urban areas is 36% higher than it is in rural areas while the rate for women in urban areas is 38% than it is in rural areas.  We are talking about over 2,500 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year.  We know the economic cost but that does not take into account the cost to individuals and their families and loved ones when a diagnosis proves to be fatal.  Lung cancer research gets lower levels of funding compared to other common cancers.</p>  <p>  Research also shows that Ireland is falling behind other EU countries with regard to patients having timely access to the most innovative treatments.  For example, in 2016, only 20% of new cancer medicines that had been launched in the previous two years were available in Ireland.  The figure in Portugal was 40% while the figure in Germany was 76%.  Lung cancer has the fourth highest percentage of emergency presentations at 25% of all cases.  We know about the association with smoking but 20% of people with lung cancer will never have smoked.  We know early detection is vital.  Treatment can include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and cancer medicines.  There are new treatments.  Research indicates the potential of immuno-oncology to improve survival rates.  Immuno-oncology medicines can be used as first-line and second-line treatment, on their own or in combination with other treatments like chemotherapy.  There have been developments in biomarker testing, which means that doctors can identify which lung cancer patients are likely to benefit from these new immuno-oncology treatments.  Again, this is progress and Ireland needs to be part of it.  At the moment, we are falling behind other EU countries with regard to timely access to the most innovative techniques.  In fact, we are last out of 13 western European countries when it comes to bringing new cancer medicines to patients.  This is a shame when we think of the progress made with regard to breast cancer and prostate cancer.</p>  <p>  What is the Government planning to do to make sure those with lung cancer have access to the innovative new treatments, include immuno-oncology therapy and combination therapies?  These are the treatments that are making a difference to survival rates of those with lung cancer in the countries that offer those treatments.  Lung cancer patients in Ireland need and deserve the same.</p></speech>

I know she has been a strong advocate in respect of cancer in Ireland for many years.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on lung cancer.  On average, 2,500 patients are diagnosed with lung cancer in Ireland annually with over 1,800 deaths each year attributable to this disease.  However, much work has been done to address this.  Survival rates for lung cancer are improving.  In the last two decades, lung cancer five-year survival rates have increased from 8% to 16% in males and from 9% to 21% in females.</p>  <p>  Prevention is a cornerstone of the national cancer strategy for 2017 to 2026.  It is estimated that the proportion of cancers attributable to lifestyle and environmental risks that can be modified is in the region of 30% to 40%.  It is vital that we are effective in getting the message across to the population that each person can impact significantly on their level of risk in developing cancer.  Effective health promotion and disease prevention initiatives result in less chronic disease.  The Government has already initiated policy to improve our nation's health through the Healthy Ireland programme.  The Healthy Ireland programme takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being with a focus on prevention.  With at least 85% of lung cancer attributable to smoking, Tobacco Free Ireland, the national tobacco control strategy, is an important initiative in reducing the incidence of lung cancer in Ireland.</p><p>It has the key goal of making Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  There is evidence that past changes in behaviour with regard to smoking have led to current better health for individuals and this is something which can be built on to promote further behavioural change.</p> <p> Increasing the number of cancers diagnosed at an early stage is a key aspect of the cancer strategy.  Cancers that are diagnosed at an earlier stage are generally more likely to lead to better treatment options and improve survival outcomes.  Raising awareness in people that unusual or persistent symptoms need to be checked out is a critical step in the early diagnoses of cancers.</p> <p> Recommendation seven of the national cancer strategy states that the HSE national cancer control programme, in partnership with the HSE's health and well-being directorate and voluntary sector, will develop a rolling programme of public awareness campaigns aimed at the early detection of specific cancers.  Work is now progressing on the development of such a campaign for lung cancer.</p> <p> Rapid access clinics for patients with suspected lung cancer have been established in eight designated cancer centres.  These clinics seek to ensure that lung cancer is diagnosed and patients enter treatment as soon as possible.  So far this year, 87% of patients referred to these clinics have been seen within ten days.  With the ongoing implementation of the national cancer strategy, I look forward to increasingly successful prevention measures for lung cancer with early diagnoses and effective treatment leading to further improvements for patients.</p></speech>

While there are common denominators for all cancers, we know lung cancer is predominantly linked with smoking, in spite of the fact that 20% of those with lung cancer have never smoked.  The stigma is also reflected in a survey which showed that 30% of those surveyed thought that non-smokers should have preferential treatment for lung cancer over smokers.  Is stigma preventing people from presenting earlier, especially in lower socioeconomic areas?  It is very serious because we know how vital early intervention is.</p>  <p>  Lung cancer needs to figure more prominently in the Healthy Ireland strategy.  There will be a cancer patient advisory committee and expressions of interest for membership had to be in by 19 October.  It is important that all cancers are represented there.  I hope that tackling stigma and early intervention would be part of the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  I have previously raised the issue of the heavy workload and pressure on nursing staff in the oncology wards in hospitals in Dublin with nurses, some still in their training years with no oncology treatment training, administering the medicines.  We have a national cancer strategy, so how will the steps to increase the number of lung cancer specialist nurses be implemented?</p>  <p>  We also need a patient advocacy group for lung cancer.  We need more of the "I am lung cancer" campaigns.  We know that BreastCheck has been effective.  We also need a lung check campaign.  The social inequalities associated with lung cancer could be looked at by the cancer patient advisory committee.</p>  <p>  We need to look at the cancer strategy with a checklist on the recommendations and the timeline.  We also need to take into account the facts about lung cancer which indicate that it needs more attention and work.  In his reply, the Minister of State said that 87% of patients referred to the clinics have been seen within ten days but we do not know what that is 87% of, or to what that translates in numbers.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the points she makes and will bring her views back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.</p>  <p>  I totally acknowledge the points that the Deputy raised in the debate.  Through initiatives under Healthy Ireland and Tobacco Free Ireland, it is hoped that we will see a reduction in smoking levels and a consequent decrease in the number of people diagnosed with lung cancer.  I am very committed to the implementation of the national cancer strategy 2017-2026 which was launched last year.  We are focused on preventing cancer, early diagnosis, the provision of quality treatment and the health and well-being of those living with and beyond cancer.  Our efforts, in recent years, have led to significant improvements in survival.  The five-year survival rate for lung cancer now stands at 16% in males and 21% in females.  I am confident these figures will continue to rise.</p>  <p>  Through the implementation of the national cancer strategy, I look forward to increasing successful prevention measures for lung cancer, with early detection and diagnosis leading to further improvements for patients.  Of course, I will bring the other points Deputy O'Sullivan raised back to the Minister.</p></speech>

I will make it brief and to the point.  We need to have ambition and vision for the greater metropolitan area of Cork.  We now have a situation where the south link road is effectively at capacity with about 87,000 vehicles using that stretch of road every day.  About 70,000 cars are using the Jack Lynch Tunnel every day.  The Minister will come back to me and point out that the Government is going to invest a large amount of money in the Dunkettle interchange.  Of course, that is not planning for the future, that is catching up with the present.  These issues are a result of the demand that is now placed on the Dunkettle interchange.  It is clear and obvious that Cork needs an outer, northern ring road and it needs to be planned.  Initial planning was sought for this a number of years ago, however it was shelved in the downturn.</p>  <p>  We are now in a strong upturn.  We need to put in place solid, coherent plans to address the issue of the imbalance in Cork city and the Munster region.  We need an outer, northern ring road from Killydonoghoe, north of the Glanmire bypass, stretching right across the periphery of the northern city, over Kerry Pike and down to Poulavone.  We should now bring about the plans that were there and enact them quickly to ensure sustainable planning and development is put in place that will not diminish the chances of us actually building a northern ring road.</p>  <p>  All of this is in the context of the expansion of the city boundary.  We are going to have all this particular area inside the city limits so it is appropriate now for the Minister to use his office to show his imagination and vision and his capacity to look beyond the local issues of the Stepaside Garda station and plan for real regional development.  The region and city is completely dependent on the tunnel at the moment.  If anything happens to it, or if there is a catastrophic accident in the tunnel, or it is closed for a long time because of maintenance, or if there was major structural damage done to the tunnel which meant it closed for a long time, the region would stop.  It is the only major arterial route across the River Lee from north to south.  The deep water port and the airport are in the south.  All the hospitals and universities are in the south, as is the institute of technology.  It is the gateway to the broader south-west region.  We are completely dependent on the tunnel for traversing from north to south.</p>  <p>  A northern ring route should be developed to ensure we are not dependent on the tunnel.  That would stimulate sustainable development over the short and medium term.  Nearly all of the industrial development in the city is now taking place south of the river.  It is almost impossible to get major multinationals or large companies to locate in the IDA centres on the northern side of the river.  Kilbarry is a ghost town.  There is now barley planted in it again.  It is one mile from Patrick Street and it is growing barley.  That is the contribution that park is making to development on the north side of the city.</p>  <p>  For many reasons, we need a northern ring route.  I implore and urge the Minister to be imaginative, like in the old days when he had the land use and transportation study, LUTS, which clearly marked out a vision for the future in planning and sustainable transport.  We need the Minister to step up to the plate and ensure that we revisit the national plan including the northern ring road.</p></speech>

I understood from the Topical Issue matter that was furnished to me that the Deputy was seeking to discuss the need for me "to carry out a full assessment of transport needs for the greater Cork metropolitan area in consultation with both local authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland".  The Deputy will forgive me if I answer the question he tabled.</p> <p> The national development plan makes it clear that the Cork local authorities, in partnership with the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are finalising a Cork metropolitan area transport strategy.  The national development plan includes a number of commitments in respect of transport in Cork.  These commitments will be included in the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, which will contain proposals relating to all modes of transport, including road network improvements; a revised, more extensive and higher-capacity bus system; enhancements to the commuter rail service, including additional stations; a future light rail corridor; and a number of bus-based and rail-based park and ride sites.  The Deputy referred specifically to investment in roads.  The national development plan proposes various major roads projects for Cork, including the N20-M20 scheme, which will link the cities of Cork and Limerick with a high-quality transport corridor.  The Deputy mentioned the Cork north ring road, which will be examined as a part of the overall planning and design of the M20 scheme.  The M28 project between Cork and Ringaskiddy and the N8-N25-N40 Dunkettle interchange upgrade scheme are also being pursued.</p> <p> On the public transport side, the national development plan commits to the Cork BusConnects programme, which will deliver a revised bus network for Cork city.  It will comprise the delivery of crucial bus corridors, enhanced services, cashless fares and account-based ticketing.  As part of the delivery of this programme, a network of park and ride sites, serviced by the more efficient bus network, will be put in place.  The Cork BusConnects programme has enormous potential to transform the bus system in Cork radically by making it much more efficient, reliable and attractive to new passengers.  The national development plan also provides that the Cork transport strategy will include an evaluation of a light rail corridor to serve the increased population growth up to 2040 that is envisaged by the national planning framework.</p> <p> The objective of the Cork transport strategy will be to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the Cork metropolitan area over the next two decades or so.  It will be used to inform transport investment levels and investment prioritisation over the longer and shorter terms.  It will also inform sustainable integrated land use and transport policy formulation at strategic and local levels.  The transport strategy is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I understand that a draft is expected to progress to public consultation early in 2019.  Feedback from the consultation process will be taken into consideration in the finalisation of the transport strategy for the Cork metropolitan area.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Southern Regional Assembly is finalising a draft regional spatial and economic strategy for public consultation.  Officials from the Department, the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland have worked closely with the regional assembly on the transport elements of the regional strategy.  The strategy will include a metropolitan area strategic plan for Cork, as set out in the national planning framework.</p></speech>

There is a small problem here.  The northern ring road is mentioned on just one line of the national planning framework.  The plan talks about the development of a motorway linking Cork and Limerick, which we would all welcome.  The fact of the matter is that it is planned to build a motorway that will run into 19th century roads.  We have no proper orbital route on the north side of the city.  Such a route is needed for many logical reasons, most importantly, the greater development not just of the north side of Cork city but of the region as a whole.  The region depends completely on the tunnel as the only way of moving from north to south.  As I have said, all of the main infrastructure - the deep water ports and the airport - is in the southern part of the region.  If anything were to happen to the tunnel, it could have catastrophic consequences for the economic development and the continued growth of the area.  All of the Minister's eggs are in one basket.  If we are to be brave and visionary, we need to accept that a north ring road needs to be developed to link the Dublin Road to the Poulavone area of Ballincollig.  This is an essential infrastructural requirement for the greater good of the region and for the more balanced development of Cork city.  The Minister knows the city well.  Anyone who visits it will see quite clearly that the north side is unable to attract industry because of a lack of access.  It needs to be opened up.  I implore the Minister, in the interests of local and regional balance and for the sake of ensuring we do not continue to depend on the tunnel, to provide that the north ring road is included in any assessment of infrastructural development requirements in Cork in short and medium terms.  There is a one-line reference to this project in the national development plan as it stands.  It is mentioned in the context of the development of the M20 into Cork city.</p></speech>

As he has said, the national development plan includes a reference to the Cork north ring road.  He has described this as "a one-line reference".  According to the national development plan, the scheme will be examined as part of the overall planning and design of the M20 Cork to Limerick scheme in the context of future linkages that might be "complementary".  I have mentioned the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, which will cover the period up to 2040.  It is expected to identify the need for schemes such as the Cork north ring road, as well as the possible timelines for such schemes.  This project is not off the agenda.  As the Deputy can see, it is being considered.  There is a reference to it in the national development plan, which says it will be examined.  I am not sure that the Deputy can ask for much more than that, especially in light of the phrasing of the Topical Issue matter as submitted to me.  It might have been better if he had referred specifically to the Cork north ring road, on which he concentrated throughout his remarks.  I understood that we would be debating the need for "a full assessment of transport needs for the greater Cork metropolitan area in consultation with both local authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland".</p></speech>

I think he has made a strong case.  I am not qualified to argue with it on the floor of this House at a minute's notice.  The Topical Issue matter that was notified to me addressed something else.  I will refer what he has said to my officials in the National Transport Authority and I will give him a more comprehensive answer thereafter.</p></speech>

Yesterday was the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  The full implementation of the UN convention, and the essential optional protocol that must follow it, would allow disabled people to have freedom, choice and control over all aspects of their lives.  It would allow them to participate fully and as equals in an inclusive society.  This act of empowerment will require resourcing, primarily through personal budgets, and the employment of personal assistants directly by disabled people to allow them to carry out tasks that their disabilities will not allow them to do independently.  This year has been a significant one for disability rights.  We need to make 2019 the year of delivery and implementation.  Mr. James Cawley and Ms Shelly Gaynor of Independent Living Movement Ireland made a presentation in the Oireachtas audiovisual room this lunchtime.  All of the members of the movement deserve the delivery of their rights and of equality, as does everyone represented by Inclusion Ireland, the Disability Federation of Ireland and Rehab Ireland.  Representatives of those organisations were also in attendance at today's event.  I urge the Government to make speedy progress with the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and to ratify the optional protocol.</p></speech>

When can we expect the right to education to finally become a universal right for all children, including children with additional needs and children on the autism spectrum?  We know there are long waiting lists for diagnosis.  This means children are being left behind.  Obviously, this has a major impact on their education.  I would like to mention a particular case in Thomastown, which is in my constituency, as a living example of what we are talking about.  A young girl who has been diagnosed with autism is being treated extremely badly by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  She was supposed to start primary school in September 2018, but due to her diagnosis and the non-availability of school places, she will be unable to do so until September 2019.  The Department has said that she is not entitled to any more years under the early childhood care and education scheme because the two years to which she is entitled under the scheme have elapsed.  I understand it is possible for over-age exemptions to be made under the scheme, but the Department seems to believe she does not qualify.  This means she is being as a second-class citizen.  Why is her right to education being affected simply because she has autism?</p><p>I will send the details of the case to the Minister of State and ask him to deal with it.</p></speech>

In March 2018, following many years of tireless work by campaign groups, disability advocates and wider civic society, the Government ratified the convention, the purpose of which is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities and to promote respect of their inherent dignity.  At the core of the convention is the realisation of rights that have long been denied to people with disabilities.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is at a standstill.  The failure to ratify the optional protocol is yet another setback.  The protocol has to be progressed.  On 9 November 2017 Deputy McDonald and I introduced the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2017, which will promote and ensure the rights of people subject to the Mental Health Act.  We need to move forward in order that Irish citizens will never be denied their rights, dignity and the capacity to make choices for themselves.  We need a new mental health Act that will meets the standards of the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

In County Louth I work with many groups and individuals who advocate for services for people with disabilities such as Parents and Friends of the Intellectually Disabled, the Louth respite group, WALK PEER and others, all of which I commend.  They have fought a battle a day with successive Governments over the lack of funding, planning and resources, which is contrary to the UN convention.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to update the House on progress to deliver on the rights contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since it came into force in Ireland on 19 April 2018.  It is something of which we are all very proud in government.  It was ratified at the United Nations in New York and I attended to represent Ireland.</p>  <p>  The topic is particularly timely, given that yesterday, 3 December, was International Day of Disabled Persons.  I attended a number of events with a lot of families and disabled people.  We are making good progress in making all of the convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate manner.  Considerable progress has been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  Two further priority implementation issues were raised by the Deputies.  They are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I am pleased to announce a date for Committee Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 has been set - 19 December - when it is proposed important amendments will be brought forward to enable an increase in the target for the employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector, from 3% to 6%, on a phased basis by 2024.  As the House is aware, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the decision support service within the Mental Health Commission, a body under the aegis of the Department of Health, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  Every effort is under way to ensure the decision support service will be ready for business as soon as possible.  While the director of the decision support service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work for implementation moves forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputies spoke about resources.  Budget 2019 provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality for the establishment of the decision support service.  A sum of &euro;3 million was also provided for the service in the Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality in 2018.  I promised that we would ratify the UNCRPD and I am delivering on that promise with the support of the Government.</p></speech>

As I set that date, the Minister of State is a little late, but I welcome him on board.  We will ensure Committee Stage is completed.  It is critical that Minister of State ensure Report and Final Stage will be scheduled as is humanly possible following the resumption of the D&aacute;il in January.  No dilly-dallying in taking those Stages on the floor of the D&aacute;il will be acceptable.  This is very important and I hope the Minister of State will afford himself the opportunity, in responding to me at the conclusion of the debate, to confirm that is exactly his intention.</p>  <p>  On the decision support service, it is absolutely unacceptable that we are looking at a situation where the main or critical elements of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will be commenced in 2020.  That is not what we were told previously.  When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality just over a year ago to discuss the legislation, we were told, to our shock and horror, that they would be commenced in 2019.  Now we are looking at their being commenced in 2020, not in the coming year, which is absolutely shameful.  Whatever the reasons for this protracted and further delay, the Minister of State is in the position to make sure it will continue no longer.  I ask that he take on board the very important need to move on the promise made in respect of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to ensure the decision support service will be fully up and running.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made no mention of the optional protocol.  When he appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality 12 months ago this month, he indicated that the UNCRPD and the optional protocol would be ratified in tandem on the same day, but that has not happened.  He has since appeared before the committee again when we addressed this issue.  I ask him to match his words with deeds.</p></speech>

That is my clear objective.  </p><p>On the issues raised by the other Deputies, Deputy Funchion mentioned a child with autism who had been left behind.  She should give me the details and I will follow up on the matter.  </p><p>Deputy Brady made a point about business owners being left out, the medical card and employment.  We will also look at those issues.</p><p>My objective is to include as many people with a disability as possible in the employment sector.</p> <p> I welcome the remarks from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I appreciate his support and that of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I welcome the debate in the House because it brings the disability issue into the mainstream of politics.  I will reflect on the remarks made by Deputies.</p> <p> It is important to remember some points when we are talking about rights and human rights.  I secured an additional &euro;150 million in budget 2019 for disability services.  I continue to drive through a wide range of practical reforms to improve the lives of people with disabilities and to focus on their ability.  We are making consistent moves toward the full implementation of all the requirements of the convention.  Considerable progress has been made this year and we have effective structures in place.  The structures include the national disability strategy steering group, assisted by the disability stakeholders group, which holds the Government to account.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is in the process of constituting its monitoring committee.  This will complete another piece in the jigsaw.</p> <p> Of course it is important that we acknowledge the need for services for people with disabilities.  I will set out five examples.  We have restored the carer's grant to &euro;1,700 for 101,000 families.  We have brought in the medical card extension for children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  A total of 11,000 children have benefited.  We have given an extra &euro;10 million through the Ability programme.  We gave an extra &euro;10 million in 2018 for the respite care houses.  The last of the 12 houses is being completed next week.  The past three budgets have seen a &euro;15 increase in the disability allowance.  We are moving along.  Do we want to move faster?  Yes, absolutely, and I will drive this legislation.  I will drive the disability agenda forward with respect for human rights for all citizens in the country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400036#JJ00800"><p>It is an honour to speak to the House as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I look forward to working with colleagues, who I know have put considerable work into this area.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about the background to the Smyth report.  The report was before Government recently and has been published.  The background, as Deputies are aware, is that the national broadband plan is an ambitious plan.  It set out to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland, regardless of how remote or rural, will have access to high-speed broadband.  In international terms this is a highly ambitious plan.  No one is to be left behind in terms of getting access to broadband.  The broadband specification set out, namely, a minimum of 30 megabits, will be considerably exceeded.  Indeed it was considerably exceeded by all three.  The plan aims to deliver fibre to the home in the great majority of cases.  It will be a high standard of broadband access.</p>  <p>  We all know from our lives about the importance of access to broadband.  We know about its impact on what people can do.  We know about the ease with which people can communicate, stay in touch and get options for business, leisure, social contacts and so on.</p>  <p>  The position is that the final tender was submitted to the Department on 18 September.  That is now under a process of detailed assessment and the assessment is continuing.  In parallel, the independent process auditor to the procurement process was asked to provide a report to the Taoiseach and me to assess whether the process has been compromised by meetings which took place between the former Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, and Mr. David McCourt.  Mr. Peter Smyth's primary role is as an independent consultant who has been contracted as process auditor in respect of the national broadband plan procurement process.  He was secured by an independent tender on the basis of which he was selected.  In that capacity he is required to audit the procurement process against the appropriate guidelines and processes.  The auditor is independent of the Department and in this capacity formally reports to the Secretary General as Accounting Officer for the Department.</p>  <p>  Last week the Government noted and accepted the conclusions of the independent auditor's report.  I imagine all those present have read the report.  Essentially, the auditor took four critical tests against which he judged what had occurred with regard to meetings, in particular meetings that were neither minuted nor where an independent person was in attendance.  The four tests are set out in page 16 of the report.  The independent auditor considered whether the former Minister was privy to any sensitive information that could have been of benefit to Granahan McCourt.  The second test was whether the former Minister took any decisions within the process that benefited Granahan McCourt.  The third test was whether the former Minister was in a position to influence changes in the tender documents.  The final test was whether the former Minister was in a position to influence the evaluation of the submissions.  Based on the consideration of these four elements, the independent process auditor was satisfied that the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, did not influence or seek to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The auditor went on in his general conclusions to say that the meetings between the former Minister and Mr. David McCourt gave cause for concern as they suggest an ongoing engagement outside of any formal need for them to engage with each other in the normal course of the Department business, including the business of the State-led intervention under the national broadband plan.  Mr. Smyth indicated that these meetings in and of themselves gave cause for concern.  However, when he considered them against the four tests and when he reviewed all the information to which he had access, including the decision register, the evolution of the tender documents, the evaluation process for the various submissions and the information that could have been available to the bidder through contact with the former Minster and so on, he drew the conclusion that he was satisfied that neither the former Minister nor Mr. McCourt had the opportunity to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt or otherwise.  He also concluded that the decision of the former Minister to resign, thereby removing himself from the process, insulates the process from any apparent bias created by his engagements with Mr. McCourt.  Those are the important conclusions.</p>  <p>  I wish to comment on the overall procurement process.  The process auditor has had access to all the key documentation over the 2.5 years of his engagement with the project to date.  This has given him extensive knowledge of the practices, procedures and processes relating to this procurement.  In his role, he has found appropriate guidelines have been adhered to in the procurement process.  He has confirmed that the processes and decision-making are fair and objective and follow agreed processes.</p>  <p>  It is now my priority that the procurement process is brought to a conclusion in a fair and transparent manner.  I propose to revert to Government in the coming weeks with a recommendation.  In bringing this process to a close I recognise, as do all my colleagues in the House, the profound benefits that high-speed broadband will bring to our citizens, urban and rural, living and working in Ireland.  These benefits and opportunities are at the heart of why the national broadband plan exists and why the Government is determined to deliver it.  We have all had personal interactions with many people throughout the country, especially in rural areas, who have been seeking a solution to the issue of connectivity.  Digital connectivity has multiple positive impacts on the lives and livelihood of citizens throughout the country.  The objectives of the national broadband plan aim to ensure that high quality reliable and future-proofed connectivity is available to every home and every business nationwide.</p><p>Some 1.1 million people live in the areas covered by the State intervention.  The towns, villages, parishes and townlands are home to communities which need this service to thrive and prosper.  These are communities with many self-employed people engaged in running more than 44,000 small to medium enterprises and more than 55,000 farms.  The direct effect of the State investment will ensure that all citizens across the country will have the same access to quality, high-speed broadband.  People of all ages and backgrounds will benefit from the roll-out.  The benefits of access to high-speed broadband are as diverse as the people whose lives will be affected by this major advance in service.</p> <p> As people who already avail of this service know, high-speed broadband is a transformative tool and is essential for the operations, compliance and services of businesses in every corner of the State.  Access to reliable broadband services has the potential to support net job creation.  This will happen through the growth of existing enterprises and the formation of start-ups in areas that previously did not have access to high-speed broadband.  Farmers, for example, are already keenly aware of the benefits precision farming techniques can bring to their lifestyles and Iivelihoods.  Agricultural benefits can be realised now and in the future by the adoption of smart farming methods.  These methods can improve productivity and herd nutrition and allow for data-driven crop management, all of which lead to techniques that can reduce carbon emissions and improve environmental outcomes.</p> <p> Digital resources are increasingly becoming part of the day-to-day education system.  Using technology can benefit children in the school and at home, but children will require access to broadband in the home to fully avail of these resources.  There are 674 national schools in the State intervention area.  The national broadband plan will ensure that these children benefit from an equality of opportunity available to all pupils and students in the country.  </p> <p> I am conscious of the time remaining so I will short-circuit my remaining comments.  I have already outlined the benefits of the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  The Government's commitment to broadband has acted as a catalyst to the industry, which has responded in rolling out high-speed broadband.  The increase in commercial availability has been dramatic.  We have close to 75% coverage for commercial broadband.  The challenge relates to the 23% in the intervention area, which covers almost 96% of the land area of the State.  Providing equality of opportunity, to which the Government is very committed, is a challenging task.  I hope we can develop a proposal that will commend itself, but at this stage evaluations are continuing.  I hope they will conclude soon so that I can bring a recommendation to the Government shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400037#KK00200"><p>My understanding is that each side will have six minutes as part of a dialogue with the Minister.  I thank the Minister for outlining the importance of the national broadband plan.  We have been hearing about it since 2012 and we know how important it is.  The people who do not have broadband certainly know how important it is.  My motivation throughout this entire debacle has been to try to ensure we get a contractor that can provide the necessary service to those 542,000 homes.</p>  <p>  I want to understand the motivation of the bidder throughout its rather unusual interactions with the former Minister.  I cannot understand the necessity for all the meetings, phone calls and private dinners.  I am not raising any issue about the previous Minister on this, but I wonder what the motivation of the bidder was.  I have been concerned about it for some time.  Mr. Smyth, in his report, rather bizarrely looks at only one side of the equation.  He seeks to understand whether some influence has been exerted, and concludes that there was no influence exerted, nor could there have been, because he accepts that at three private meetings at least no discussions took place about the national broadband plan.  He relies on the statements of the bidder and the former Minister in that regard.  I do not know whether that took the form of a questionnaire or whether he had face-to-face meetings with those concerned to establish the facts about that.  Perhaps the Minister can advise us in that regard. </p>  <p>  The Minister stated that, in the four tests used by Mr. Smyth, all appropriate guidelines and procedures were considered.  I want to highlight one particular guideline.  The communication protocol between the Department and external bidders sets out the procedure very clearly under two headings.  Under the heading on canvassing, it sets out the prohibition that applies and states that direct or indirect canvassing by a bidder, consortium member, bidder member or their suppliers or advisers in relation to the project or the procurement, or any attempt to obtain information from any of the agents or employees of the Department, its political representatives or its appointed advisers concerning other bidders, or a solution to a final bid tender or procurement in general is prohibited.  It then provides a remedy for such action, stating that any breach of the section will entitle the Department to immediately disqualify the bidder concerned.</p>  <p>  If there was more than one bidder the Minister knows that its lawyers would be down in the courts now arguing that the remaining bidder, which has clearly breached canvassing rules, should be excluded from the process.  Given that at least one of these dinner meetings in Mr. McCourt's home took place while the two previous bidders were in the race, it is astonishing that Mr. Smyth did not recognise a significant breach of the rules set out in the communication protocol.  The same applies in respect of section 7 of that document, which deals with the separation of functions within the Department's divisional units.  It states that it is recognised that the day-to-day functions of the Department, in carrying out its remit, may involve engagement with stakeholders who are bidders in the process.  Mr. Smyth relies on that to suggest that some of the meetings were casual in nature.  While that is the case, there were three meetings that were not and could not come under this heading.  It then sets out the protocol to apply in respect of any such communications, namely, that officials in the Department will not at any time discuss the NBP procurement process outside the NBP team.  We have direct proof that this happened.</p></speech>

We know, based on the minutes of the meeting in New York, that this happened.  That put the person concerned in a very invidious position, because that person was expected to take minutes on discussions outside of the process.</p><p>It has been reported that the programme director for the NBP tweeted this weekend, in response to an article posted by <i>The</i><i>Sunday Business Post</i>: &quot;A decision on the only game in town will hopefully be made in the next couple of weeks&quot;. </p><p>A second tweet read: &quot;A lot of theoretical nonsense [Ash], these guys have no understanding of the telecoms market which is very complex as you know and we have just dropped almost 20 million on getting the best advice possible from people who do understand telecoms.&quot;  The account in question has, I understand, tweeted around five times since it was created.  The communications protocol I outlined earlier states that, as a general matter, members of the NBP team shall not discuss or communicate in any way matters relating to the procurement outside of the NBP team.</p></speech>

It goes on to state that where communications with a third party takes place, whether oral or written, involving a member of the NBP team, the NBP team member will state that they cannot discuss any matters relating to the procurement process.  Can the Minister confirm that this person is in fact who he says he is on Twitter?  Has he carried out any investigation to establish that?  Does he believe it is appropriate for the programme director to engage in this kind of communication at this stage of the process?  Why did the programme director take it upon himself to make these unsolicited comments?</p></speech>

My point of view and that of my party is that we want the broadband plan to be rolled out yesterday.  It is supposed to be rolled out by 2020, but that commitment in the programme for Government is obviously dead.  I do not believe there was any intention on the part of the former Minister to gain personally from his meetings with Mr. McCourt.  However, it does show how easy it is for big businessmen and Ministers to meet and how often it happens.  As an observer of the process and seeing it at first hand, it certainly shocked me.  The problem with such meetings is that they show a certain panic on the part of the Government and departmental officials.  It illustrates the power of the one bidder who is left.  The Government has left the roll-out of the entire national broadband plan in the hands of one venture capitalist.  On the one hand, an American venture capitalist is the only bidder.  He can name his price, or the Government will lose him.  On the other hand, there is the French venture capitalist who owns Eir which was sold off by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1999.  That party owns a lot of the infrastructure on which it is to be rolled out.  The Government is trapped.  How is it going to find its way out?  Does it have a plan B?  Some have said in recent days that the process may collapse.  It is certainly shaky.  If it goes ahead as matters stand, it will be a shambles because of the way it has been compromised. </p>  <p>  There is one other thing I want to ask about.  Given the fact that the bidder had so much access to the Government and whoever else, do we have any idea if the taxpayer has been left exposed as a result?  We have heard figures of &euro;500 million and &euro;3 billion.  Where do Joe and Mary taxpayer stand in all of this?</p>  <p>  Six years ago we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, proposed an examination of the State infrastructure, the ESB network, the network of heavy duty cables across the State known as the backhaul system and the metropolitan area networks in 104 towns.  We proposed examining that infrastructure as the backbone of a publicly owned network.  Is the Government looking at it as a plan B?  </p>  <p>  Moreover, I want the Minister to address the issue of the contractor.  The bidder has changed substantially.  There were three parties involved in the process and the 300,000 premises that were easiest to reach were sold off.</p></speech>

If a local authority wants to fit a front door to a house, it must obtain three tenders if the cost is more than &euro;500.  We are talking about hundreds of thousands of euros of taxpayers' money.  For the life of me I cannot see how the Government can continue with the process.  Is the Minister satisfied with it?</p></speech>

There will be a process wherein different tenders will be evaluated.  That is always the case.  In the area of telecoms it is not exceptional to end up with just one tender.  It has happened in other areas.  The State has taken huge precautions to evaluate and match stride for stride the costs and all of the different elements that have evolved.  There is very detailed knowledge of the way the process has developed.  It has been designed to protect the taxpayer in terms of its exposure and in order that the process will provide the best value.  However, at the end of the day, the matter will have to be decided after the final evaluations have been carried out.  Independent evaluations are being carried out in looking at the robustness of the technology, value for money, governance and so on.  It will all be done very carefully.</p>  <p>  The State infrastructure, namely, the metropolitan area networks, MANs, and other means of access are being used under the plan.  The bidder has changed, but in all cases the bidder had to go through the various pre-qualification tests.  When the make-up of the bidder changed, the pre-qualification tests had to be gone through again.</p></speech>

When the evaluation is completed, it will decide whether it will be included in spending proposals in future years.  As this has not yet been decided, there is no figure for the final cost, nor has there been a decision by the Government to back any particular proposal.</p></speech>

The process has been a competitive dialogue which three parties entered.  They developed a high spec proposal to deliver broadband to homes.  They will use all existing infrastructure to minimise the added cost, but nonetheless delivering broadband with a speed higher than 100 Mbps to every single house in the country will be an expensive process.  The Government will have to decide whether the price, the value, the technology and the governance process are fit for State backing.</p></speech>

Given that a decision is due in a matter of weeks, there must be some assessment at this stage of the cost and of the likelihood of there being a successful bidder.  In other words, the people want to know whether Granahan McCourt will end up being the final bidder and, ultimately, whether they will end up paying a king's ransom through their taxes for the privilege of having Granahan McCourt as the successful bidder.  We have reached endgame on this one.  We are sick of being told that it is a matter of the tender process and it is secretive.  If I picked up the phone to the CEOs of a number of companies or if I scratched the surface hard enough, I would know fairly well that people are talking to each other informally anyway.  It is a small town.  In fairness, it is a small country.  What we want at this stage is for the primacy of Parliament to be recognised and for there to be some straight answers from Government in recognition of and out of respect for our mandates.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to give us some indication at this stage.  If there is only one bidder left in the room, what of the technical appraisals needed to be gone through at this stage of the process?  Given that it has gone on for years, if one is close to endgame there must be something that the Minister can impart to us by way of public information to which we are entitled at this stage in relation to the cost, the process and whether there will be a successful bidder or not.</p></speech>

That still may not meet the criterion.  It still may not be accepted, and I am not saying it is.  I can assure the Deputy that what is going on now is that detailed eye-to-eye work or fist-to-fist work, whatever way the Deputy would like to take it, to reach an agreement that is robust and that I can bring to Cabinet.</p></speech>

The Minister states it provides the best value for the public.  It is cheaper and more efficient, we are told, than to get a public utility company or a semi-State company to build it.  Would the Minister acknowledge that we made a bags of that and a contract that was supposed to cost &euro;500 million now looks likely to cost us over &euro;2 billion?</p>  <p>  When the dust settles on this farce and the State is on the hook for &euro;2 billion plus, at the end of this rainbow will we see a notorious character, Mr. Denis O'Brien, who came very lately into the bidding process, who may well be the biggest benefactor of all of this debacle, more so than the 750,000 people who are waiting to receive broadband?</p>  <p>  Lastly, what was the role, if any, of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in all of this?</p></speech>

In respect of any changes, they were satisfied that the process, which was independent from the Minister, then or now, was robust.</p>  <p>  On the question in relation to the narrow band, I do not accept the Deputy's assertion.  The position is that the auditor viewed this against a very wide range of issues, namely whether the former Minister was privy to any sensitive information that could have benefited Granahan McCourt; if he took any decisions within the process that benefited Granahan McCourt - the auditor concluded the former Minister did not; whether the former Minister was in a position to influence changes in the tender documents - the auditor concluded he was not; and whether the former Minister was in a position to influence the evaluation of the submissions, particularly the refined detailed solution and the final tender, and the former Minister was not.  This was not a narrow base.  This was a broad-based look at whether the process at any point had been undermined by the meetings which, admittedly, were not minuted and at which no witness was in attendance.</p></speech>

Clearly, there is advice on how one should manage such meetings.  I do not wish to comment in that regard other than to note that the auditor considered that some of the meetings were a cause for concern.  However, crucially, when he examined the context in which those meetings occurred, he concluded that neither Deputy Naughten nor Mr. David McCourt were in a position to influence the tender process.  In that sense, his conclusion is clear.</p></speech>

He may not be able to give a completion date, but when will the evaluation process be completed such that the provision of services can begin?

I pay particular tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, and thank him for his help and co-operation.  I wish to put on record that I do not care what was eaten or how many dinners or breakfasts there were.  I am interested in representing the people living in amber areas who contact my office on a daily basis, pleading for me to help them get broadband connectivity.  They do not care who attended dinners or what goes on in this House.  They want the Minister to drive this process on by the end of the month.</p>  <p>  I am not interested in post mortems or blaming anybody or trying to find faults with the procurement.  All I am trying to do is see whether this can be driven on in order that rural people in amber areas all over the country and, most importantly, those in County Kerry, are provided with broadband of acceptable speeds.  Whether for leisure, education or other purpose, proper broadband in one's home is as vital as sewerage, electricity and water connections.</p>  <p>  The Minister is highly competent and has been around the block.  He knows his way around the Houses of the Oireachtas better than anyone else.  I ask him to use his ability and the excellent staff of his Department to drive this process on and ensure that people get what they want.  I urge Members who are trying to chip away at and undermine the process, for God's sake, not to look behind the process or we will trip over what is in front of us.  All we want is progress and I wish the Minister well in that endeavour.  I am relying on him to ensure that the evaluation will be completed by the end of the month, the contract will be awarded and work will commence in early 2019.</p></speech>

I thank the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, for his great work as Minister.  It is clear that he was wrongly forced to resign.  I hope he is appointed to another job in Cabinet.</p>  <p>  How long it will take to ensure that the entire country, including County Kerry, has a proper broadband service?  Is the Minister certain that the right option is being taken?  Were all avenues explored with the ESB?  If we had started rolling out carpet when we started rolling out broadband, the country would be covered in carpet.  When the roll out commences, I ask that it be done systematically, similarly to how one would begin at the door if sweeping the floor.  The way it has been done to date has driven people across the country mad.</p><p>A house might have houses with broadband on three sides but have none itself, with no reason other than that it has to wait for the next phase.  There must be some methodology.  If a person is clearing the yard with the bucket on the machine, he or she starts on one side and keeps at it until finished.  The way broadband is being provided so far is purely haphazard.  People cannot understand what is happening or why they are left behind when people all around them, in front and behind, have broadband.  It just does not make sense.</p></speech>

It has to be said, however, that the auditor process is important.  Many acknowledged it was open to interpretation that there might have been a conflict of interest.  In practice it has been found that having examined all the evidence, the auditor has concluded what he has.  That is the reassuring thing.  I cannot give an estimate as to the duration at this point because we do not have a contract signed.  We can give an estimate of duration only when we know the next step.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the point the Deputies made.  The commercial people who have committed will go halfway up a lane and leave some houses without a service.  They remain in the amber area and it will be for the new contractor to pick up the others.  That is the way they have done it, however.  They have said, "Thus far and no further."  That has been done on commercial grounds by the individual companies involved.</p></speech>

The communications protocol covered bidder, Minister and officials.  Throughout the process, we have to ask where the officials were while all the meetings were taking place.  Some of the meetings were minuted and others were not.  Undeniably, they breached the protocol.  Why were the officials not advising against the kinds of interactions or refusing to leave themselves open to allegations of a protocol breach?  The tweet mentioned by Deputy Dooley seems to indicate a mindset in the Department involving a very senior official suggesting the decision has already been made.  Will the Minister confirm that this is not the case and that there is a robust process under way?  At what level is the official?  Will he be taking part in the process?  Can the Minister really describe this as a competitive tendering process if there is only one bidder?</p>  <p>  Will one of the tests be for affordability?  If not, there will be limited take-up and this will have to be revisited.</p></speech>

The proposal is that, in the vast majority of cases, the service must be available at the same price as in any other area.</p>  <p>  Obviously, when there is only one bidder left, one has to take far greater care in overseeing the process.  That is why it is going on the way it is going on.  There is a lot of work being done by the State whereby one does not have the normal two people vying on price.  The State has to do a lot of vetting and checking at each step on the road to determine whether what is being put forward is reasonable.  That is why all the evaluation is taking place.</p>  <p>  The decision has certainly not already been made.  The person who issued the tweet should not have issued it.  He has played a major role in this, however.  He has always been very important and passionate.  He recognised that what happened should not have happened, and it will not happen again.  Any such communication will go through the press office in the normal course.</p></speech>

What role will there be for Opposition spokespersons during the final stages of the process of assessing some of the technical issues so they can have some sort of understanding as to whether this is a proper deal or not?

I want to make it clear that it is the Department and not the Minister who is responsible for the governance and evaluation of the national broadband plan competitive dialogue procurement process.  On the conclusion of this evaluation, the Department makes a recommendation to the Minister, and the Minister then brings the matter to the Government for a decision.</p><p>It is important to put in context my engagements throughout this process.  During the debate here in this House last February, speaker after speaker highlighted the need to progress the project actively after Eir's withdrawal.  A member of the communications committee at the time said:</p><blockquote>It seems extraordinary that the tender has not yet been put in place.<br /><br />It may be considered unfortunate to lose one bidder, but surely it is careless to lose two bidders.  What happens if we lose the third bidder?  What is plan B?</blockquote><p>He went on to say:</p><blockquote>I think this is a national emergency that requires emergency measures.  I hope the Minister will act accordingly.</blockquote><p>That is what I did - act accordingly to keep the remaining bidder at the table.  At no time did I interfere or try to interfere in the process to benefit any bidder.  I facilitated every meeting request from all the bidders in the dialogue process.  The fact is that I, as Minister, was kept at arm's length from the detail of the procurement process, and I was asked to be present at some pivotal points in the process on the request of my officials.  Such meetings were directed by officials both in terms of the briefings before such engagements and the meetings themselves.</p><p>The Smyth report shows I had 40 meetings with all the bidders since my appointment as Minister in May 2016.  If one browses through the lobbying register, it is clear that meetings between the telecoms industry and Members of this House happen regularly.  Just like Deputy Dooley and others in this House, my job required me to meet representatives of the telecoms industry because it is responsible for connecting every home, business and farm in the country in order that no one is left behind in this technological age.  Should we have a closed-door policy for Ministers and an open-door one for everyone else just for the sake of these optics?  As Mr. Smyth states in his report, the facts are that I did not have information available to me that was not already available to the bidder or bidders by virtue of the fact of it being a competitive dialogue process.  My only objective throughout has been to keep the bidders in the process - both Eir until the time of its withdrawal and Granahan McCourt-Enet-SSE subsequent to the withdrawal of Eir - in order to ensure that every citizen in the country was treated equally by delivering broadband to the 1.2 million people who are without this basic, vital service.<br/><br/>Some of my engagements with Mr. McCourt have been the subject of incomplete reporting in recent days.  Eight of the ten engagements I had with Mr. McCourt were when Granahan McCourt was the sole bidder in the process.  I did not discuss the procurement process at any of the dinner engagements with Mr. McCourt.  Furthermore, Mr. McCourt did not at any time canvass my support or seek to lobby or influence me on the procurement process.  I did not give preferential access to any bidder in the process.  By the time SIRO withdrew in September 2017, I had met the NBP participants on 23 occasions - ten times with SIRO, Vodafone and the ESB, six times with Eir and seven times with Enet-SSE.  When Eir withdrew from the process in late January 2018, I had met the remaining NBP participants on 17 occasions - nine times with Enet-SSE and eight times with Eir.  This included meetings on electricity policy with both the ESB and SSE.<br/><br/>In recent months, a theme of innuendo and aspersions inside and outside this Chamber has emerged which questions the capability of the last remaining bidder to deliver.  This is not for any of us to determine now.  That is the job of the 80-strong expert evaluation team.  We must ask, however, what is driving this narrative and for what gain.  Is it to collapse the plan altogether, perhaps?  It may have that desired effect, which would cause more heartache for 1.2 million people in rural Ireland.  I appeal to colleagues to let the evaluation team do its job.  Over the past 34 months, some of the most capable people in Europe, with experience in highly complex procurement projects, have been working on this project.  I reiterate that at no time did I interfere or try to interfere in the process to benefit any of the bidders, and the Peter Smyth report concludes this.<br/><br/>Finally, another voice from last February's D&aacute;il debate:</p><blockquote>The frustration on the ground is reaching boiling point...  If it is not delivered soon, the benefits may be lost forever as investment will not flow to rural and regional Ireland.  Successive Ministers have failed miserably to bring this crucial national project to completion.</blockquote><p>My only objective and goal as Minister was to bring this project to completion for the families, business owners, workers and farmers of rural Ireland, who have been waiting for far too long to become equal citizens in this digital age.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I think everyone acknowledges how hugely important this project is.  Internet access is probably more important to rural Ireland than anything else if we want strong rural and regional development.  This is the infrastructure of the future, and the ambition we have for it is right.  I acknowledge the very significant work Deputy Naughten has put into this project.  There is absolutely no doubting the effort he has put into it and other parts of the Department's brief.  Clearly, from the questions that have been raised, people recognise that this is a very challenging project in many respects.  It is highly ambitious.  I do not know of any other country that has committed to this level of ambition.  I know of many that have fallen short of such a level of ambition.  My only determination at this stage is to bring this process to a fair and impartial conclusion in order that Government can take a decision as to whether this is a technically robust solution, whether the governance of all its aspects, including the risk to which the State could be exposed, is adequate and whether it represents value for money for the taxpayer.  I think these evaluations are at a point at which we will very soon be able to go to Government.  I assure Deputy Eamon Ryan that this information will be published and he will be able to see the evaluations that were conducted.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400042#PP00600"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, in relation to the Local Government Bill 2018, that:(a) pursuant to Standing Order 154, the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill, in relation to the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors and the establishment of urban area committees; and<br /><br />(b) Standing Order 154 is modified as outlined in Standing Order 200 to provide that the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the existing subject matter of the Bill, in relation to section 32 of the Official Languages Act 2003 and to repeal section 49 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, to facilitate the commencement of section 48 (amending the Local Government Act 2001) of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and to amend sections 2 and 13 of the Building Control Act 2007;and to make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.</blockquote><p>In my Second Stage speech on 18 October 2018, I mentioned that some further provisions, including in respect of the holding of plebiscites to consider the proposal for directly elected mayors for Cork city, Limerick, Galway city and county and Waterford and joint structures to facilitate local area and forward planning for urban areas that span county boundaries, would be brought forward on Committee Stage.  Two of the amendments I propose to the Local Government Bill 2018 relate to the insertion of a new Part of the Bill dealing with plebiscites on directly elected mayors and consisting of seven sections, and a new Part dealing with urban areas and consisting of four sections.</p><p>In late September, the Government agreed in principle to the holding of plebiscites on directly elected mayors with executive powers for the cities and counties to which I referred at the same time as the local government elections in May 2019.  This was subject to the inclusion of the necessary legislative provisions within this Bill and the future submission of more detailed proposals on the plebiscites and the questions to be put to the electorate, as well as the specific powers to be given to mayors.</p><p>The provisions I propose to add as a new Part of the Bill provide for the holding of plebiscites in Cork city, Galway, Limerick and Waterford on a proposal to provide by law for a directly elected mayor of those administrative areas.  The date for holding the plebiscites is to be set by the Minister but the intention is that this would be in May 2019, the date of the local elections.  The plebiscites are to be conducted in accordance with regulations that will contain the usual provisions relating to ballot papers, returning officers, the taking of the poll, voting and counting of votes, etc., and will need to be approved by resolution of the Oireachtas.  The persons entitled to vote in the plebiscites will be those entitled to vote at local elections to Cork City Council, including those being transferred next year from the county to the city; Galway City Council and Galway County Council, in anticipation of a merger of these two local authorities in 2021; Limerick City and County Council; and Waterford City and County Council.  Information for voters, which is to be published and distributed by the relevant local authority at least 30 days before voting day, is to include a summary of the functions and office of directly elected mayors for local authorities concerned, the impact on the relevant local authorities, other statutory bodies, the estimated cost and resource implications, the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal, and any other information the Minister considers appropriate in guidelines to be issued to the authorities.  Within two years of the holding of plebiscites, the Minister must submit a report to the Oireachtas specifying either legislative proposals to establish the office of directly elected mayor for any of the local authority areas concerned or his or her reasons for not submitting such proposals.</p><p>Section 30 of the Local Government Bill removes the ministerial power to change local authority boundaries by order in circumstances where the local authorities concerned are not in agreement about the alteration.  As a result, where there is no agreement, future boundary alterations will be capable of being effected only by primary legislation, such as under this Bill in the case of Cork.</p> <p> In the context of continuing urban overspill across county boundaries, I propose to establish a mechanism for local authorities to work together to ensure the proper planning and development of certain cross-boundary urban areas.  The relevant provisions in a further new Part of the Bill require the establishment of urban area committees within six months of commencement of the legislation where at least 1,500 persons or 15% of the population of an urban centre are living in the administrative area of another local authority.  This will apply to towns and cities with a population of between 1,500 and 100,000.  Those towns to which this is applicable are Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drogheda, Limerick, Portarlington and Waterford.  The urban area committee is to perform local area planning functions for the town or city and its contiguous areas as determined by the committee or, failing that, as ordered by the Minister.  Membership of the committee is to be equally drawn from both local authorities and is to consist of six councillors from the relevant local electoral areas, with three appointed by each local authority, plus the cathaoirleach of each of the local authorities.  It is also to include a minimum of two and a maximum of four non-voting members with relevant expertise in the areas of transport provision, infrastructure development, housing provision or business and trade.  Administrative support to the committee is to be provided by members of staff selected by the committee from nominations made by the two local authorities.  The main function of the committee will be the production of the local area plan for the cross-boundary urban area, including the appropriate zoning as an explicit function.  In the case of these areas, the development plan content for both local authorities will have to follow on from, and be consistent with, the local area plan that is made for the cross-boundary city or town and it will not be possible for either local authority to amend or revoke the local area plan approved by the committee.</p> <p> I also mentioned on 18 October that amendments relating to the placenames provisions of the local government code might also be brought forward if the urgency of progressing this Bill permitted.  I am proposing an amendment that repeals section 49 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and restates the content of the repealed section in Irish and English.  Section 49 amended section 32(2) of the Official Languages Act 2003 for consistency with changes to Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that were made under the previous section 48 of the 2011 Act.  It was, however, enacted in English only, whereas amendments to Acts enacted and enrolled in Irish are required to be bilingual.  It is proposed, therefore, to take the opportunity with this Bill to redo the 2011 provision in both languages, with a view to then commencing Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended.  This will facilitate the planned holding of a plebiscite by Sligo County Council on a proposal to change the placename of Inishcrone, or for some people, Enniscrone.</p> <p> I also bring to the attention of the House a further proposed amendment to the Bill, which is for the purpose of correcting errors in the title of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in sections 2 and 13 of the Building Control Act 2007 that omitted the word "the".</p></speech>

These are different from the substance of the Bill that we discussed some weeks ago.  Any proposals which address the issue of rebalancing and enhancing powers for local government, in particular the elected members, or tackle challenging issues that have arisen in urban areas as a result of planning in recent years are to be welcomed.  Anything that moves beyond normal thinking must also be welcomed.  The Minister of State alluded to a number of challenging issues arising from urban sprawl across county boundaries.  Anything that can be done in that respect has to be welcomed, especially considering the &quot;Death of the Town&quot; headline that screamed from the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i>last Friday.  That provides an interesting backdrop to the deliberations on the remaining Stages of this Bill.  </p><p>Mr. Stephen Purcell, in his report for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, concluded that a perfect storm was brewing in towns because of the impact of rents, commercial rates, out-of-town shopping retail centres, online shopping and, wait for it, the impact of the abolition of town councils.  The Minister of State will not agree with my view on the impact of that decision but, as the author of a detailed independent report commissioned by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland states, it impacted greatly on our towns.  Perhaps the Minister of State will reflect on that point, rather than slapping it down every time I mention it, because it certainly has merit, as Mr. Purcell noted.</p><p>The impact of online shopping featured prominently in that report and it has hit our main streets greatly.  This issue featured at a committee hearing in the House of Commons yesterday when the owner of Sports Direct, Mr. Mike Ashley, told Members of Parliament that the high streets in England, outside of the capital, are already dead.  There are major challenges that need to be tackled head on.  Anything we can do to promote urban spaces is to be welcomed.</p><p>On the composition of the proposed urban area committees, the non-voting members, who will not be elected members, will specialise in the areas of transport, housing, business and trade.  Imaginative thinking is to be welcomed if it brings a different discourse to what needs to happen.  There are challenges in the areas to which the Minister of State referred, including Athlone, Bray, Carlow and east Meath-Drogheda.  We need to ensure the living space of citizens in all counties is enhanced and they have access to good public transport, housing and urban spaces.  I hope that, as a result of these proposals, this will be an exciting time for local government and the discussions emanating from them will be positive.  </p><p>On the issue of directly elected mayors, I welcome the move as extremely positive for democracy in Ireland.  It will bring us into line with other democracies across the world, including countries in Europe and the United States.  Even the smallest local towns in the US have contests to elect a mayor and the office is not shared out by political parties as the spoils of war during the term of a council.  I hope the areas selected for the plebiscites, as outlined by the Minister of State, will be endorsed.  I also hope that the pilot project, when it is reviewed in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, will be considered for expansion to other major urban areas and that we can embrace this style of local government.</p><p>I look forward to the day when large urban towns, including my home town of Navan where I was privileged to be the mayor, Trim, Drogheda and Dundalk will also have directly elected mayors.  These should not be about someone having a title, wearing a gold chain or attending openings.  What is to be genuinely welcomed about the proposal is that the plebiscite will ask whether certain functions of the chief executives of the local authorities in question should be transferred to their cathaoirligh.  The Minister of State has spoken about this before.  He is passionate about the local government system and wants this debate to take place.  I hope change will be real and that it is embraced and endorsed and that there will be responsibility for local government.  I also hope that those who secure this responsibility recognise that they are answerable to the people in a real and meaningful way.  That will only be good for local governance.  The period ahead is an exciting one.  Its significance lies in the greater accountability it will deliver, with decisions being taken closer to the people.  That will be welcomed by citizens and I hope it is firmly endorsed.  When it comes to addressing these powers, I hope people understand that this will also increase their input into local government.</p><p>I welcome the amendments the Minister of State is bringing forward.  I look forward to the resultant discussions.  I hope the local government system will be further enhanced and strengthened.  The urban area committees will be very interesting for the counties impacted.  I hope those counties will recognise that this is an opportunity to address poor planning decisions.  They have not emanated from badness but naturally from the current system.  I hope we will be able to address some of the deficiencies present in larger urban areas and enhance living spaces for people through a diverse and different forum.</p></speech>

Last week I was prevented from tabling an amendment to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018 concerning the manner in which sexual assault trials were governed.  I will certainly be appealing against that decision.  In this instance, we practically have an entirely new Bill.  The Government has that ability, but it is a significant departure.  I appreciate that there is a timeline which has to be worked in terms of electoral registers.  I do not particularly want to see any delay in the Bill&rsquo;s progress because it has to be dealt with.  However, it is far from ideal that spokespersons on local government or Cork Members have to deal with 30 pages of amendments at such short notice.  I appreciate that the departmental officials have to do this.  However, for many of us, these are our local authorities.  The amendments concern the financial sustainability of our local authorities, with rules for development and local area plans.  We will have less than 48 hours in which to digest all of the amendments and then decide on positions on Committee Stage.  That is far from an ideal way of legislating and it puts us in a difficult position.  If we are to have directly elected mayors, they need to have real powers.  What is more, power does not need to be taken from councillors but from local authority chief executives.  My priority is to ensure both Cork local authorities are financially sustainable and have a clear manner of progressing.  I am not sure that the issue of city and county sheriffs has been properly addressed.  Their responsibilities are important in terms of the register.</p>  <p>  The Bill was published originally in August.  Both Cork local authorities prepared detailed submissions which they sent to Cork Deputies, the Minister of State and the Department.  They will not have an opportunity to respond to these significant amendments, not only on the plebiscites to be held and the urban area committees but also on the transition.  With some of the amendments I will agree, but with some I will not.  Ideally, they should have been dealt with in the Bill when it was published in August.</p></speech>

Those of us on the housing committee take our legislative responsibilities seriously.  As the Minister of State knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the holding of plebiscites.  I acknowledge the fact that on Second Stage the Minister of State indicated that he would bring forward these proposals.  The problem is that we have been given five pages of amendments which essentially are a new Bill 48 hours before the committee will have a chance to discuss and vote on them.  That means that we have had no Second Stage debate on the substance of what is separate legislation.  Neither have we engaged in any pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>Before we received the amendments, in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>yesterday Daniel McConnell had a story based on a leaked memo from the Cabinet in which the Attorney General expressed serious concern about them, allegedly on the grounds that it was not clear what the decision-making powers of the new mayors would be or what their relationship with existing councillors would be.  The same Cabinet memo highlights criticisms from the Minister for Finance who stated there were no costings associated with the amendments.  That is not intended as a criticism of the officials, but when Ministers put pressure on officials to produce complex legislation within short timelines, unfortunately, mistakes are made, as we have seen happen in the case of other legislation recently.  I am concerned that we are not being given sufficient time, particularly those of us who are new Members, to deal with these technical amendments.</p><p>I was previously a member of the Dublin elected mayors forum when the four Dublin local authorities examined the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  Some of the key issues centred on the powers and structures such a mayor would have, as well as costs.  Would powers be lost from local authorities as they devolved upwards?  Would powers be given to local government as they were devolved downwards from Government agencies?  From what I understand in talking to the Minister of State before today, there will be more legislation.  In some senses, we will be asked to take some important decisions at the committee tomorrow without having full information.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, we do not want to delay the substantive legislation tomorrow.  Members of the housing committee, whose job it is to scrutinise the Bill, will need a detailed briefing from departmental officials in advance of the committee session tomorrow which will allow us to tease it out.  It could be done in half an hour or 45 minutes and would allow us to go through all of the issues properly and would at least give us the benefit on Committee Stage of being able to debate and take decisions on them.  If the Minister of State gives us a commitment that we will at least have that additional preparation, we will certainly not stand in the way of the motion.</p><p>This is not to be partisan about the issues.  While we can have our political and policy arguments, it is our job at the committee to ensure the legislation will be right.  We take our scrutinising responsibilities seriously.  Producing substantial legislation at such short notice is not good practice.  I hope that when the Minister of State comes back next year with the next local government Bill and the substantive issues surrounding the powers of directly elected mayors, the costs and the relationship they will have with existing local authorities, we will not be in a similar position where, to meet a tight deadline, detailed amendments will be dropped in on Committee and Report Stages.  If the Minister of State is willing to give us that commitment, that we will receive a detailed briefing at some point tomorrow afternoon, we will certainly not stand in the way of the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400044#RR00400"><p>I have serious concerns about what is before us.  As has been said, effectively we have two large sections of amendments to the Bill that have nothing to do with its main substance.  Essentially, it is about the extension of the boundaries of Cork city and local authority arrangements for Galway.  Up to 128 amendments have been proposed, some of which are more detailed about the arrangements for Cork and the areas that will become part of the city which up to now have been part of the county.  That is fair enough.  However, in themselves they are quite detailed.  I would certainly like to have the opportunity to discuss them with my Cork colleagues before expressing a view on them.  I have the added difficulty that the Labour Party does not have any Member on the housing committee, meaning that we will not have an opportunity to vote on the amendments.  While we can attend, we cannot vote.</p>  <p>  I understand the amendments were brought forward because we needed more detail.  On Second Stage we all said we wanted to know more about the arrangements for the particular areas in Cork, but I am concerned about the other amendments.  I support the holding of a plebiscite on directly elected mayors.  I also support the concept of directly elected mayors.  In the limited time we have had to read what is before us, I thought I would get some idea from amendments Nos. 105 and 106 of the powers and functions directly elected mayors would have, as well as of their relationship with the chief executives of the local authorities.</p><p>However, the regulations only concern how to hold the plebiscite, including people's right to vote and the normal arrangements that are put in place for any election.  As far as I can see, nothing tells us exactly what the powers will be.  Surely that is crucial.  In my understanding, the whole point of having a directly elected mayor is to reorganise the relative powers between the executive and the elected members, but all I can see is amendment No. 109, which reads:</p><blockquote>The Minister shall, in respect of each administrative area in respect of which a plebiscite is held in accordance with this Part and not later than 2 years from the day appointed under <i>subsection (2) </i>of <i>section 33</i>, prepare and submit to both Houses of the Oireachtas either--(a) a report specifying proposals for the enactment of a law providing for a directly elected mayor for such administrative area, or<br /><br />(b) a report specifying the reasons for his or her not preparing and submitting a report under <i>paragraph (a)</i>.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>I assume the latter provision is because, since we cannot predict the result of a plebiscite, a mayor may not necessarily be appointed.  It seems that the Minister will make all of the decisions.  There is to be consultation and so on, but I am not sure that we will be doing our job as Members of the House if we just let this pass through without any understanding of what the mayor's powers or role will be.<br/><br/>The process is even more complicated in counties, albeit not so much in Cork, which will just entail the city.  In Limerick, Waterford and Galway, the people who will be taking part in a plebiscite will be from the administrative areas of the council of the city and county of Limerick, the council of the city and county of Waterford and, because those authorities have not been brought together yet, the council of the city of Galway and the council of the county of Galway.  There will be just one directly elected mayor for large county areas and cities in those counties.  That raises issues.  I expressed my concern on Second Stage that there could be a mayor from, for example, the back end of the county in Limerick representing the city.  I have nothing against the back end of the county, but mayors from other places normally represent large municipal areas, which will not be the case in this context.  As such, we have every right to have concerns about the powers and role of the directly elected mayor.<br/><br/>The next part relates to places where urban areas extend into other counties.  Limerick is included in this.  Obviously, I know more about Limerick than I do about the other areas.  I would like to know more about how this will work.  In Limerick, for example, there are two housing estates very close to where I live, but they are just over the other side of the river in County Clare.  I assume that that area is the main part that will be transferred to Limerick.  However, they are in County Clare currently and have been part of local area plans that are linked to Clare villages close by.  This was an issue at the time of the original proposals to extend the boundary, which were strongly resisted by people in County Clare but supported by some of those living in the housing estates immediately adjacent to the city because they had mostly come from the city.  The interaction between such areas and the parts of the counties that are adjacent to them pose difficult questions.  Many issues need to be teased out in this regard.<br/><br/>While I have many concerns about the Bill, the one matter I do not have a problem with is amending the error in the title of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, but that is hardly the most significant element of the Bill.<br/><br/>As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated, I am not sure how appropriate it is that we should be sending to Committee Stage a Bill that substantially differs from the Bill that we debated on Second Stage and to which we had given some thought.  We now have little time to give to the two sections that have been attached to it.  There has been much debate in recent years about the issue of directly elected mayors and much support for it.  Ironically, a great deal of that support has been in the Dublin area, which is not included in this legislation and has been postponed to a later date.  Given that there is a question of democratic representation at local level anyway, this significant issue deserves much more scrutiny than it will get on Committee Stage tomorrow if we use this mismatched approach to deal with what is almost a new Bill.<br/><br/>The Minister of State has been asked to give a briefing, which I hope will extend beyond the members of the committee to anyone who wants to attend.  I would have preferred more time.  Does it have to go to the committee tomorrow?  Can we not take longer?  We have very little time to examine it.</p></speech>

Obviously, the clock is ticking on getting this business done.  The problem rests with the slow pace in getting matters to this point.</p>  <p>  I am not going to comment on the issue of directly elected mayors now as I will make my comments at some other time.  In the time available to me before the next debate commences, I will focus on issues relating to the boundary changes in Cork and the staffing levels in the two local authorities that are to be newly constituted there.  My understanding is that negotiations are taking place between the city and the county, with a focus on determining how many whole-time equivalent positions serve the transition areas and transferring that number over.  The negotiations were to have been completed by now, but I understand that there may be white smoke halfway through the first quarter of the new year.  I am concerned that the original deadlines have not been met.  The time for concluding the negotiations and then seeking expressions of interest in February will not make matters impossible, but it will be tight, given that the new arrangements will come into place at the end of May or beginning of June.  I will be watching the new deadlines like a hawk.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise a number of points about the fire service, including the Cork city fire service.  Its staffing level stands at 140, with operational firefighter numbers the same today as they were in 1975.  The Minister of State has raised his eyebrow, but that information comes from a reliable source.  International best practice calls for 1.031 firefighters per 1,000 people.  Under a section 85 agreement dating to 1999, the city fire service has duties and responsibilities that extend into the county, including the transition areas that are being transferred into the city, but they are the responsibilities of a backup service for the county fire service, which has lead responsibility in those areas.  It is not good enough to say that the Cork city fire service has responsibility for those transition areas in any case, given that there will be an increase in the level of responsibility from backup service to lead service.</p><p>If the numbers were to remain at 140 with the extra population coming into the city as a result of the transfer, the number of firefighters per 1,000 of the population would fall to 0:66, which is a bit higher than Poland and a bit lower than Slovakia.  It is too low and is unacceptable.  I am not in favour of boosting the city's numbers at the expense of the county and leaving fire services in the county short.  What should be looked at here is an increase in the number of firefighters for services that are already depleted by austerity and that have been stretched in recent years.  I want to register that a dip in the numbers in the city fire service to a ratio somewhere between that of Poland and that of Slovakia is not acceptable.  I do not think it would be acceptable to firefighters or the people in the area.  I stress that I am not in favour of strengthening one at the expense of the other.  Recruitment is something that needs to be looked at.  I was going to make some points about the electoral register and directly elected mayors but time is ticking and we have another important debate tonight so I will save those points for another day.</p></speech>

Concerns have been expressed by various Deputies.  I will not repeat them.  I agree with them.  My interest in this Bill concerns the proposal to amalgamate Galway city and county, which takes up three or four lines in the Bill.  The rest of it concerns Cork.  On top of that, and I will return to that point, we are now being asked to look at an entirely new Bill in this manner.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that a briefing should be given but it should be given to all of us.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies and I met with the Minister of State and his officials.  I was horrified by the lack of understanding of Galway city and county and the fact that the proposal to amalgamate them was based simply on the logic that bigger is better.  It completely ignored the interim report.  It took the one recommendation that they should be merged and ignored what was set out - the conditions precedent, which said that staffing and resources had to be looked at prior to any merger.  In the Minister of State's speech, we were told about directly elected mayors, about which I will keep an open mind.  It involves Limerick and Galway city and county.  It is in anticipation of the merger of the two local authorities.  I have tabled an amendment.  I understand Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Grealish and Fitzpatrick have tabled amendments to remove the proposed merger between the city and county.  Is the Minister of State going to ignore that and just go right ahead?  Is that what democracy means?  Is the Minister of State going to listen to us?  I am a committed Galwegian.  I love my city and want it to grow and develop but I fundamentally object to the notion that bigger is better when it is not based on any evidence.  The Minister of State may recall the packed meeting in the audiovisual room only two weeks ago involving a presentation where we were to make our decisions based on evidence.  Evidence has gone out the window with regard to this and we have nebulous concepts like bigger is better when we know that is not true.  I have already mentioned the Lisbon Treaty, which contains a commitment to making decisions closer to the people on the ground and not removing them.  Yet we are going ahead with this.  We started off with a Bill where the Cork boundary was to be extended, which is a matter for the Cork people to look at.  Galway was stuck in with two or three lines telling us that bigger is better and that we were going to take the first step, ignoring the interim report and the vast majority of elected Members on the ground.  We come in tonight and get the Minister of State's speech and the amendments, which I have not had a chance to go through in detail.  The Minister of State is asking us to do this and for what?</p>  <p>  I will speak about Galway.  One major problem is the excessive power in the hands of management - unelected people.  The second major problem is the lack of oversight by the Department regarding the lack of a master plan in Galway.  We have higgledy-piggledy developer-led development, no master plan and no oversight by the Department.  The former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, agreed with me when I stated during Leaders' Questions that Galway has returned to developer-led development.  The site at Ceannt Station is over 14 acres, eight of which are being developed by a person on behalf of Ceannt Station completely in isolation from the public lands in the docks and the other public lands in Galway.  The Government seems to think this is okay.  I ask myself why I talk about this and go into the minutiae of it when the major problems in Galway are lack of democracy; the fact that when decisions are made by local councillors, they are ignored; a major housing crisis; and a major traffic problem.  All of these problems have solutions.  We have proposed solutions.  I do not come in here and object for the sake of objecting.  I come in here with solutions relating to Galway.  A total of 22,000 people signed a petition.  I am actually underestimating the number.  I collected the signatures with a committed number of people on the ground, most of whom are non-political, that said we should not put in another road and we should look at public transport, including light rail, particularly in the context of Galway, which has an opportunity to be a thriving but green city.  What do we get?  We get ignored and told that it is not possible.</p>  <p>  Park and ride has never been implemented.  We put it in our city development plan in 2005 and it has never been rolled out while traffic congestion builds up.  Until this year, we had not built a single local authority house since 2009.  These are the real problems on the ground.  I will not go into the hospitals issue; it is for another day.  Yet the Minister of State has us looking at a Bill that has metamorphosed into a completely different Bill and is asking us to approve it and push forward to committee level as quickly as possible.  This is not democracy.  This is a diversion from the real problems on the ground but, most importantly, it is an undermining of democracy at local level that will put more and more power into the hands of unelected officials in the guise of directly elected mayors.  I am particularly upset when something is done under false pretences.  We are talking about directly elected mayors but there is no mention of the powers they might have or how they might interact with the system on the ground.  I have the greatest of concerns about these proposals and I do not think this is the way to proceed.</p></speech>

I agree with the previous speaker.  There is not one shred of democracy in this Bill.  The proposed boundary changes will have a detrimental effect on the county of Cork.  The loss of revenue from areas such as Glanmire, Blarney and Ballincollig will result in a significant drain of revenue from the county in the long term.  I represent rural areas in west Cork, some of which are the most disadvantaged in the country.  We cannot afford any loss of revenue in the long term.  The proposed transfer of a large area from Cork County Council to Cork City Council is a land grab that will have a significant detrimental effect on Cork County Council.  I believe the Blarney Tower and adjacent hinterlands should remain within the Cork County Council area and not be transferred to the city.  This would result in a population of 6,357 people remaining within the county.  One only has to look at the quality of our roads, particularly in west Cork.  They are a glaring example of what under-investment and lack of revenue can do to an area but what will happen after this?</p>  <p>  I propose that Cork local authorities commence a joint review of operation of the financial settlement.  If after the completion of a review, Cork City Council fails to comply with subsection 13, the Minister may, after consultation with the oversight committee and within a period of no later than three months, make a settlement amending a financial settlement.</p><p>Further to this, in the event of Cork City Council being unwilling or unable to make the contribution to Cork County Council, for whatever reason, the Minister, on behalf of the State, will guarantee the payment to Cork County Council.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State where does democracy work here?  Every Cork county councillor, whether from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or independent, totally opposes the proposed changes and they have conveyed this view to the Government and Oireachtas Members.</p></speech>

The views of councillors and Members have been totally ignored in the Government's effort to bulldoze this Bill through.</p>  <p>  We also need to include in the Bill the local authority changes in west Cork where, up to now, nobody who has been elected to represent the people has been allowed a say.  The hinterland of Clonakilty, from Ring to Timoleague, including Courtmacsherry, Lislevane, Darrara and Butlerstown, reverts to the west Cork municipal district.  Ring village is only two miles from the town of Clonakilty.  It makes no sense to move it to the Bandon-Kinsale district.  People in these areas made submissions opposing this change, as did I.  We have not been listened to or consulted.  The findings have been made by the independent commission, which is astonishing to say the least.  The Minister of State does not have to agree to these findings and I ask him, if he has any respect for democracy, to refuse to agree to their findings.</p>  <p>  We also need to reinstate all the town councils in County Cork that were abolished in 2013.  Some of the decisions of the current and previous Governments on rural Ireland beggar belief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400047#UU00400"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill again.  The Minister of State knows my view.  I am not in favour of the Bill.  As I stated on Second Stage, it is disingenuous and an insult to the intelligence of the people of Galway to have just two lines in the Bill stating that a new chief executive will be appointed to oversee the merger of Galway city and county.  Galway is the second largest county in Ireland and there will be significant difficulties if this proposal proceeds.  If there is to be a merger of Galway city and county, there should be a proper debate in the House and the change should be provided for in a separate Bill, rather than being lumped in with Cork.  Galway is a diverse county, containing Clifden, Cleggan, the Aran Islands, Inishbofin and a medieval city with a mayor.  The county council is starved of funds.</p>  <p>  I recently spoke with the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, who represented the same constituency as the Minister of State.  His officials put a similar proposal to him when he was Minister and he rejected it out of hand, saying it would have been a disaster.  Now we have the Minister of State bringing the same proposal to the House.  I will not support the Bill and I ask Members not to allow Galway to be lumped in with Cork in a Bill of 28 pages that only mentions Galway on two lines.  That is terribly wrong.</p>  <p>  I do not agree with the proposal to have a directly elected mayor.  The system in Galway is working exceptionally well.  We have a mayor over a five-year term from different parties or independents.  I ask the Minister of State, if he pursues a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor, how it would work in Galway.  Is there to be a chairman of the county council and a mayor of the city, or is the elected mayor to oversee the city and county and try to work with a chief executive?  What powers will the mayor have?  It will be an absolute disaster.  As far as I know, this model is not working in Limerick where there is no agreement between the chairperson of Limerick County Council and the mayor of the metropolitan area of Limerick.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to support my amendment to withdraw any reference to the merger of Galway city and county from the Bill.  He should introduce a separate Bill if there is to be a change in Galway.  There is no support for his proposal among the elected representatives in Galway.</p></speech>

This type of legislation is important for local government and local government reform.  I know the Minister of State is not the same person as his former colleague, Mr. Hogan, to whom Deputy Grealish referred.  Galway should not be tacked on to this Bill, as previous speakers have said, that is so ravaging and damaging to Cork.  I can speak from my experience of what the Government did in Tipperary when it amalgamated north and south Tipperary county councils against the wishes of the people.  It destroyed our county and our county town of Clonmel and took away all the services.  The Government abolished town and borough councils and did not care.</p>  <p>  Democracy is being taken away from the local members.  The Government doubled the size of the areas for the county councils and gave them no say whatever.  The Government now wants the issue discussed.  The county manager, Joe MacGrath, was brought into a workshop from which the press was shut out.  Council members might as well be idle.  Drawing up local area plans and tabling and discussing amendments to them is a waste of time.  Our county development plan has not been reviewed and has been extended again.  We badly need development.</p>  <p>  We need more accountability and more powers for the elected members, not for the chief executive officers.  We do not call them county managers anymore but CEOs and they are all powerful.  At a civic reception now, we must bow and defer to the CEO.  The elected representatives who face the people should have some say and not be subject to subterfuge and deceit, as they often are.  They should not be bullied and intimidated by workshops behind closed doors to which the media are not allowed access.</p>  <p>  As regards housing, the Government has failed abysmally.  I heard this morning on the radio that Tipperary County Council has now appointed a new official to count and draw up a list of vacant houses.  We have been talking about this issue for 12 years.  There are houses that have been vacant for 30 years, 20 years and ten years while we have a housing crisis going on and 3,000 people waiting for houses.  We have not even built a dozen houses in Tipperary in recent years.</p>  <p>  Reform is needed and is not happening.  As I said, we cannot have this going on, with power being taken away from the people who are being shut out completely.  The Government did this with the LEADER groups and all the other functions that take away power from the people.  It has been a smash and grab and the county councils are now just rubber stamps for the county managers and CEOs.  That is all they are.</p></speech>

It is something we have been thinking and talking about for more than ten years.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the Bill is being rushed at the last minute.  As I commented to the Taoiseach earlier today, we read in the newspapers that the Minister for Finance was bitterly opposed to the proposals because there was no costings and the Attorney General was bitterly opposed to them because there was no detail on the powers.  I find it hard to believe that something that has been so long in the making and doing is being delivered in such an inappropriate, incomplete and, dare I say, incompetent manner.</p>  <p>  Two years ago, the Green Party's first contribution to Private Members' business in this D&aacute;il was to introduce a Bill for directly elected mayors.  We asked for consultation and did not press our Bill to a vote.  The Government said it would engage with the other Opposition parties and not a single instance of such consultation or co-operation took place.</p>  <p>  The Green Party supports the Bill because it wants to see directly elected mayors in all our cities and towns.  We also want to see a directly elected mayor in Dublin, although that is not happening at the moment.  We want to see one in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford because those cities need new leadership.  The leadership provided for the past 20, 30 and 40 years has led to a sprawled model of development that has hollowed out the centres of our cities and resulted in out-of-town retail centres taking over.  The car dominates every Irish city and town causing gridlock.  This does not work.  We want these mayors to have real powers over the chief executives, working with the chairs of the strategic policy committees so that we start to get housing, transport, local environment and culture right.</p>  <p>  We will support the Bill, which we want to see passed.  However, we have to mark a protest at the way it has been introduced and the lack of consultation with Opposition parties.  We all have an interest, expertise and experience in local government.  The Minister has to commit tonight to engage in a proper process of consultation with the Opposition parties in order that we get this legislation right.  In saying that, I am not being party political.  This is in all our interests, whoever is elected as mayor, because we all know the current system does not work and needs to change.  It probably needs to change in Cork more than in any of the other cities because Cork has sprawled.  It is like the words of the John Spillane song, "Johnny don't go to Ballincollig, Johnny don't go to Carrigaline" because Cork, like every other city, has sprawled in spades.  Part of the problem was that the county was living off the city in ensuring that its development on the edge of the city gave it a rate base, but no consideration was given to the strategic development of the city.</p><p>We fear that this sort of approach to development in Cork might still go ahead.  Places like Monard, which is 1 km from the proposed county-city boundary, could be developed if the county continues to play the game of getting development at any cost even though, as I said earlier, the Cork transport system is now coming to a gridlocked halt.</p> <p> This proposal needs to be backed up with real budgets to give cities the flexibility to start investing in the public transport solutions they need.  Cork needs a light rail system.  Like Galway, Waterford and Limerick, Cork needs significant public transport projects that must be led by political leadership.  This has to extend to putting housing beside public transport.  There are four railway lines going into Limerick, but there is no real connection between that transport infrastructure and the development of the city.</p> <p> Galway is a disaster in transport terms.  If Cork wins the booby prize for worst sprawling development model, Galway is surely the worst example of bad transport planning on the planet.  When the Galway orbital road with all the roundabouts was being built 20 years ago, a road engineer said to me that as sure as eggs are eggs, all of the roundabouts would lead to gridlock and would have to be taken out.  Nothing is changing.  The only transport proposal in Galway involves even more orbital roads.  There has been no real radical thought about how public transport might stop the city from developing in the way it has been developing.</p> <p> There have been some positive developments in Waterford.  We would like to see whether the greenway could be run right through the centre.  We support the proposed development on the north side of the River Suir.  While it is not all negative, Waterford - God help us - could do with a lift.  It should be the capital of the south east.  The mayor of Waterford should really be the leader of the south east.  There should be a focus on Waterford Institute of Technology and on the industrial history of the city as part of an effort to relaunch Waterford as a counterbalance to the development of the other cities.  Political leadership is needed to make that happen.</p> <p> We support this initiative.  We want the plebiscites.  We want to know - in the coming weeks rather than in the coming months - what exactly the powers will be.  This will ensure people know what they are voting for.  We want to know when the mayors will be in place if the plebiscite is approved.  I asked the Taoiseach about this earlier today, but he was unable to give an answer.  If the people say "Yes", is it envisaged that mayors will be directly elected three months or six months later?  Will the mayors be put in on top of the CEOs of the local authorities?  Will the chairs of the strategic policy committees in the councils be used as a cabinet for the running of cities?  Is this the approach that will be taken?  It is the sort of approach that we might propose and suggest.  The Minister needs to start discussing this with the rest of us.  If he does not do so, and if we do not get this right, I am not sure we will get the plebiscite through because when the time comes to vote, the people will rightly ask what they are voting for and whom they can trust.</p></speech>

We saw one part of the Local Government Bill 2018 a week ago.  It is coming in dribs and drabs.  I do not fully understand where the Minister of State is going when he talks about the powers that elected or unelected committees will have.  What is he using?  I would like to go back to Galway.  As Deputies will be aware, the first thing that is written about Galway in the document is "show me the money".  I do not see where we can keep going forward until the money comes.  I thank the Minister of State for his engagement with us.  We will be constructive with him.  I want to make it clear that as far as I am concerned, the money for the municipal areas and especially the peripheral areas needs to be brought up to the same level as other parts of the country.  People are not objecting to what is proposed for Cork.  Maybe there are Deputies who have objections.  Those involved are working hard.  Galway has been in at the back of it.  It appears that there are some good ideas in this proposal for local areas like Athlone.  We need to thrash it out so that we can know what is in it.  The document is coming in quick at us.  I know we will get a chance on Committee Stage.  We will be constructive at the committee.  There is a lot of toing and froing in the case of Galway.</p></speech>

At 5 p.m. tomorrow, my officials will meet Deputies to discuss some of the issues of concern that have been raised and I will do so as well if I can.  An email outlining the details of that meeting will be sent earlier in the day.  Many of the issues that have been raised tonight with regard to certain provisions, especially those relating to Galway and Cork, are more suited to the Committee Stage debate.  Certain sections of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 set out the legislative proposals for the holding of plebiscites.  The provisions of the Local Government Bill 2018 are essentially a reflection of that.  My experience over the years I have spent in both Houses has been that local government Bills generally tend to have many parts to them.  Everybody was fully aware on Second Stage that there would be substantive amendments on the urban area committees and on the plebiscites.  We flagged our intention to introduce such amendments.  The Government has yet to make a decision on the functions of directly elected mayors.  What we are talking about this evening, and will be talking about tomorrow, is the mechanism for allowing the plebiscite to be held.  I am open to the idea that after the memorandum has been discussed and - I hope - approved by the Government, the House should have a full discussion on people's views.  I happen to agree with much of what has been said, particularly by Deputy Eamon Ryan, because it is in line with how I envisage the position.  No decision has been made by the Government.  Therefore, we cannot discuss the specific role.  However, we can discuss how we see the plebiscite taking place.</p></speech>

Some of the remarks I made last week caused some upset.  I apologise for that.  It certainly was not my intention.  Some questions have arisen from the amendment before the House.  For example, people have asked why we are not permitting ultrasound.  This amendment would make ultrasound mandatory.  A woman would not be allowed to give her permission or her consent.  That is really at the crux of this.  Ultrasound is a diagnostic tool that should be available for a doctor when deciding what is best.  A woman should be able to consent to the use of any diagnostic tool.  She should be able to give her opinion.  She should not be bypassed.</p></speech>

We are proposing the deletion of the current notification system as outlined in the Bill and replacing it with a system that would work to give us some useful information in ascertaining whether the introduction of safe abortion in Ireland had had the same impact as in other countries.  The way the Bill has been drafted is based on the notification provisions in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  This is overly cumbersome and inadequate to develop the public health data a new reproductive healthcare service requires.  The provisions, including the obligation to notify the Minister for Health each time a termination is carried out, as well as providing the Medical Council registration number, have no public health rationale and only serve to perpetuate abortion stigma.  The collection of data such as county of residence and so on is not appropriate.  We would instead prefer to see useful statistics that would help us to improve reproductive healthcare for women and girls.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

I know that we are all motivated by the same idea of ensuring we will have adequate data in order that the legislation can work appropriately.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly asked why we would we take what was already in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and replicate it in this legislation.  I have considered the matter carefully.  Given that this is a new service, that there is such significant public interest in it and that we are seeing the Irish College of General Practitioners emergency general meeting and the like, it is prudent to leave those requirements in the legislation.  However, being honest, I envisage that when we get to the point where we will review the legislation in three years' time, some of the detail will no longer be required.  I do not think we should have forever and a day reports being made to the Minister for Health of the day on individual matters.</p>  <p>  In Britain those responsible collect data related to county.  I used this information a good deal during the referendum campaign.  We were able to quote how many women from each county in Ireland had travelled to the United Kingdom to access a termination.  Having such information will enable me and my successors as Minister to ensure there is geographic equity.  Moreover, if there is not, I will be able to direct the HSE to ensure that if there are parts of the country in which there is a particular problem in accessing the service, that it is provided there.  It is absolutely the intention of the HSE to publish such data on an annual basis.  I have already given that commitment in the House and will lay the relevant report before the House.  In addition, the HSE will be answerable to the committees of the Houses.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the minimal amount of data necessary will be collected to fulfil the function and ensure data protection obligations are met.  The HSE collects statistical data that can be published and will be publicly available in the way similar reports are published on all other aspects of the health system.</p><p>I do not believe it is necessary for a provision to be included in the Bill in order for this to be done.  It is appropriate that we keep the current provisions for the beginning of this service.  We are committing to reviewing the legislation in three years, and I would be very happy for the issue to be reviewed then.  It is important, at the early stages, that we have that information so that we can very closely monitor it as policymakers.  Ultimately, as Minister for Health I am responsible for policy in this area, so being directly involved is appropriate on this occasion.  </p></speech>

I have always agreed with that, even though many on the pro-life side may have sought a reduction in information on access to abortion.  I have always believed that information is key when people are making decisions.  Information is not a burden and it is not a threat to anybody.  This amendment does not seek to reduce access to information about abortion.</p>  <p>  Some people will say that the type of information collected will be used in a particular way in an effort to stigmatise or create difficulties for people who seek to access abortion.  I point to the position in Britain, where a four-page document is collected by the doctors involved in the provision of abortion.  That information is then used for research and policy development and helps people understand exactly what is happening within the system.  Elected representatives can then develop legislation to address some of the issues found in that research.  In the Committee on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution we found out that the main reasons for abortion are socio-economic.  Information on people's socio-economic situation allows us to understand exactly who the people most affected by abortion are.  If that information is not collected, it becomes much harder to focus resources necessary to alleviate some of those socio-economic problems.  </p>  <p>  In New York State a number of years ago, there were more abortions carried out on African-Americans than there were live births in a particular year.  There are variations in the rate of abortion among certain sectors of society.  If the information is deleted or ignored, we are blinded to particular experiences, and as a result it is far more difficult to address those particular experiences.  We should not be afraid of collecting information on this particular service.  The more information we have the more likely it is that we will be able to design better policy in the future, and the more likely it is that we will be able to review the delivery of these services with an educated mind.  </p></speech>

This is totally in line with data recording as it exists in the UK at present and with the requirements sought by most pro-abortion organisations, such as the Guttmacher Institute.  We understand the view that the public interest in research and data must be weighed against the public interest in confidentiality of patient information.  This amendment respects that balance completely.</p>  <p>  In the United Kingdom, registered medical practitioners are legally required to notify the chief medical officer of every abortion performed.  The UK department of health receives these notifications by way of form HSA4, to which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred, and undertakes statistical processing and analysis on an ongoing basis.  A statistical bulletin is published around May each year containing a table of information derived from those notifications.  We also know from the UK that the recording of abortions, under ground E of the 1967 Act, which provides for instances where there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical disabilities and abnormalities as to be seriously disabled, is seriously under-reported.  We are not making that up.  During 2013, it was brought to the attention of the UK department of health that the number of ground E notifications was lower than the number reported to the congenital anomaly register.  A matching exercise was carried out for notifications for 2011, 2012 and 2013 data.  Results from this matching process suggest that a UK department of health notification was made for 54% of the records.  This meant there was potentially an under-count presented in the ground E notification table when it was published.  In response to this, the UK department of health asked the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, to consider the possible reasons for the under-reporting of abortions on the grounds of foetal abnormality and to make recommendations for improvements.  Results from the matching exercise and the RCOG recommendations show that between 2011 and 2013 there was a 17.8% increase in submissions of abortion notifications for foetuses with Down's syndrome.  Those are interesting figures.</p>  <p>  This clearly points to the need to be as prescriptive as possible in terms of the data that are collected so that we can avoid under-reporting and prevent skewed statistics from being place in the public domain.  This is very important.  The facts and figures are available to our neighbours across the water.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment on the recording and notification of termination of pregnancy.  In general terms, it will assist in advancing the creation of an objective, verifiable knowledge base that can then feed into the development of evidence based public health policy.  At the level of basic ethical principles, we also believe that at the very least we must give the life and death of the unborn child statistical significance in the context that it has already been decided not to afford the unborn child any constitutional protection or significance.  For the record, and because it now seems that we have to be very clear about such things, we have no other motivation in bringing this amendment forward.</p>  <p>  Recently, the broader issue of how information or data are used or presented has figured prominently in many areas of our political life.  The potential impacts were considered to be so serious that we saw the establishment by the Office of the Taoiseach of an interdepartmental group focusing on the security of Ireland's electoral process and disinformation.  One of the primary concerns identified by that group's report, published in October, related to the potential effect that the widespread use of social media can have in accentuating any concerted programme of disinformation.  In light of that, we can say with some certainty that the more controversial the subject, the more clearly established is the requirement for the collation of comprehensive, detailed, accessible and fact-based data.  This point has been acknowledged by pro-abortion groups.  In one particular case study report, one such group looked at meaningful attempts to evaluate the impact of a new abortion law.</p><p>Where health data collection systems are inadequate, and where the private sector provides the majority of legal abortions but is not required to report them, the incidence of legal procedures cannot be accurately reported.  It ended by noting that public health advocates, international donors and researchers around the world should continue to strive to improve the completeness of reporting of legal abortions, the recording and accurate classification of abortion-related maternal deaths and the attainment of robust estimates of overall maternal mortality, as well as of both legal and safe terminations and unsafe terminations. <br/><br/>To speak more locally, my colleague Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, said the following during the Committee Stage debate on this particular amendment:</p><blockquote>The reason we are collecting so much data is that this is a very serious issue.  This is an exceptional situation in historical terms.  Up to this, we have only allowed for the ending of life in cases where the life of the mother was under threat. ... This is a radical departure.</blockquote><p>The point also was made on Committee Stage that this amendment is very much in line with the data categories required under the existing UK law around the recording of terminations.  It also was noted that this represents international best practice.  Surely we should have systems in place to ensure this here in Ireland.  <br/><br/>In his reply to a similar amendment put forward by another Deputy on the other side of the debate, the Minister said at the committee that if one looks at the website of the UK Department for Health and Social Care, as he did during the referendum campaign, one sees the amount of data that is collected and sent to that Department.  While the Minister did not suggest we should mirror what they do, he did accept they collect a considerable amount of data and stated quite clearly that he had no difficulty with this.  The Minister also indicated that if the question was simply around the modality of how the information is gathered and put before the Oireachtas or into the public domain, he would be happy to consider it further.  <br/><br/>I raise these points now merely to point out that while the committee had issues on how the information should be gathered, there was no fundamental disagreement on the necessity of recording the various statistical data sets.  It also was argued in the committee that it was somewhat unnecessary or unhelpful to be as prescriptive about the kind of information that ought to be collected as is this amendment.  On this point, Deputy Donnelly asked if the data that are to be collected are usually provided for in primary legislation or in follow-up regulations.  He also made the fair but incomplete point that it would be onerous for those tasked with the drafting of public policy if they had to amend the primary legislation in a few years to allow for the collection of certain information.  This is a highly incomplete point because had the Deputy read this amendment carefully, he would have seen that provision is made for &quot;such other information as may be prescribed&quot;.  <br/><br/>We all know that the annual statistics on abortions recorded in England and Wales are based on detailed abortion notification forms submitted by clinics and hospitals to the chief medical officer at the Department of Health and Social Care.  That Department then monitors the forms to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the Abortion Act 1967.  The UK departmental guidance note for completing the abortion forms, which is intended to help doctors and clinical staff, also makes clear that certifying doctors are expected to have enough evidence of the woman's circumstances to justify forming a good-faith opinion that the ground for the termination exists.  Since we are dealing here with an assessment whose outcome involves the potential death of one human being, is it not only appropriate that some consideration is given to the circumstances offered as justification for the abortion in the first place?  If there is evidence that a certifying doctor has not formed an opinion in good faith, then those performing the termination are not protected by the Act and may have committed a criminal offence by terminating the pregnancy. </p></speech>

Are we really going to look for not just the age and marital status but the ethnicity of the people who receive services this country has democratically decided should be available to women to allow them to address and control their fertility?</p>  <p>  We had a very detailed debate in this country about the issue and our citizens voted in favour of these changes.  What is the inclusion of "ethnicity" about?  Is this a measure to find out if immigrants in this country avail of services concerning their health as women?  Is that what it is about?  Why do this amendment's proponents want to know the service users' ethnicity?  Is that a code word to ask if these are people of colour or ethnically Irish and like the rest of us?  Would the answer to that mean these issues should somehow be approached in a different way?  Is it implied that people who are of a different ethnicity somehow have less regard, feeling or care where these issues are concerned then do ethnically white Irish people?  The Deputies should seriously consider withdrawing this amendment because it is needlessly offensive.  To be perfectly honest, it owes more to the language of South Africa prior to the ending of apartheid-----</p></speech>

I listened really carefully for all of last week.  I did not speak at all in order to listen very carefully to the comments made by the 20 or so Deputies who have consistently sought to oppose the legislation, as their democratic right.  I do not know how they thought it out, but this kind of language strikes me as being from the school of the deep south of the United States, where in various states there is a very active and continuous attempt to frustrate any woman trying to avail of services concerning pregnancy, either within her own state or by crossing state lines.</p>  <p>  I also want to ask about the tone of this amendment.  This is really designed to extract information from women that will shame them.  We all know people who have unfortunately suffered multiple miscarriages and in some cases have never been able to give birth to a live baby.  I know a lot of people like that.  Ironically, most of the people I meet nowadays in Ireland with difficulties around pregnancy have trouble becoming pregnant and having a baby they very much want.  We need to cop on to where Ireland is at the moment.  Members know the statistics.  Most women giving birth in Ireland are in their 30s or older, and most of the babies are very much wanted.  I do not see why one must attempt to set up a structure to shame all women.</p>  <p>  The language of this amendment is straight out of an Ireland of a long time ago.  I assume this amendment was written by some clever lawyer, rather than the Deputies here.  We all use lawyers to help us with the drafting of amendments.  Are these drafters the successors of the people who locked women in Magdalen laundries and put their children in orphanages and industrial schools?  It took a very long time before this House even addressed those issues.  Are we really using that same language tonight?  Why?  Why do we feel compelled to use it?  This is a difficult, personal and private issue.  Do not attempt to use this Bill as a mechanism to shame women and to shame and frighten doctors.  </p><p>We have just got several multiple-page amendments, which seem to have a parallel purpose, namely, to frighten and shame doctors who seek to provide these services.  One needs to have regard to what the people voted for.  This particular Bill amendment will not do anyone in Ireland any good.</p> <p> Listening to the debate last week, I never once heard proposals from any of the Deputies to provide for serious high-quality information to young people on how to avoid becoming pregnant and how to positively manage their fertility in order that, hopefully, they would never need to have recourse to termination.  Neither did I hear whether the Deputies wanted, for instance, to have education for young men in order that they would have a sense of their responsibility in supporting their partners in planning in such a way that any pregnancy that occurred would be wanted.  That is what women all over the world have done since the right to control fertility via birth control information was introduced more than 100 years ago.  We are celebrating 100 years of women having the vote.  That period was also the time when the biggest conversations began about birth control and information being available to women.  I plead with the Deputies involved that they might be better off simply withdrawing this amendment because it certainly is out of kilter with the respect shown by both sides during the debate and with the way the people of Ireland voted.</p></speech>

Everyone has a right to his or her opinion but this is difficult to take on board.  This amendment, particularly paragraph (f) that has been alluded to, looks like an attempt to rerun the referendum.  I am trying to consider a situation where, say, a woman would go to a doctor and for some reason would have to go within days to another doctor who is not her GP and would be put through an inquisition.  Part of the reason we decided on 12 weeks at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was because women were buying medication over the Internet, self-medicating and putting themselves at risk.  That is exactly what will happen, if this amendment and if the one that is associated with it, amendment No. 43b, which would criminalise doctors for not collecting the information that has been specified in amendment No. 43, were carried.</p>  <p>  This is not about public health policy.  This is about making women feel guilty.  It is about making women feel ashamed.  That is not part of good health policy.  This is objectionable.  It has been tabled for all the wrong reasons.</p></speech>

As it stands, the Bill requires far less information to be gathered than is gathered in the UK.  Why is this?  Surely it is in the interests of the health service and the new abortion system to maximise the amount of information that will be compiled to allow us to monitor trends.</p>  <p>  All the information will be gathered in strict confidence and anonymously.  We gather all kinds of detailed information on all kinds of procedures, from routine procedures to more serious ones.  This amendment would simply gather details on where the abortion took place, the point at which the termination took place and various other details.  We gather this kind of information for every other procedure carried out by GPs and in hospitals.  Why would anyone object to doing likewise for abortions?</p>  <p>  All information published on foot of this would only be published in the same way as the Department of Health and the HSE statistics in a format that only gives national or regional pictures of the information and which in no way identifies any particular person or her particular case.</p>  <p>  Surely even supporters of the Bill want the maximum information to be gathered.  It would allow improvement over time.  If we do not seek to gather this information, we will have no way to monitor trends or to see how the Bill is operating in practice.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for review of its operation by the Minister after three years.  How is such a review to be carried out properly without all possible information on how the Bill acts in practice and being able to ascertain who is availing of the services?</p>  <p>  I do not believe that it is adequate for the Minister to provide for gathering this information by regulation.  The information requirement needs to be set clearly in stone in the Bill at this Stage.  For this reason, I will support amendment No. 43a.</p></speech>

I cannot see why not.  If other countries are doing it, I cannot see why there is a big hang-up here about doing it.</p><p>It is important even for events such as where a woman may have a second or third abortion.  If that was happening, it should surely set alarm bells ringing somewhere to see if there was abuse or some reason a woman would have to go through this sorrowful event more than once in her lifetime.</p><p>It is serious and deserves the consideration of Members.

I have concerns, in particular, as previous speakers outlined, regarding the inclusion of ethnicity.</p>  <p>  I wish to point out that if this amendment is passed, it refers to section 14, which is early pregnancy.  We put in the 12-week limit for two reasons, namely, to deal with rape and incest and to deal with the issue of abortion pills.  Imagine being a rape victim.  If that was not traumatic enough, before one could get a termination one would have to answer a series of questions on one's previous pregnancies, including live births, ectopic pregnancies, any previous terminations and spontaneous miscarriages.  One's ethnicity and marital status would have to be recorded.  It is archaic.  It is racist.</p>  <p>  I wish that we did not even have to debate this tonight.  It is a poor reflection on this Chamber that there are individuals within it who would expect doctors to ask rape victims these questions and who, if the doctors do not do so, would jail the doctors.</p></speech>

It seems likely that abortion will be introduced in Ireland in the coming weeks.  Efforts have been made to get the Bill through the D&aacute;il by hook or by crook.  Last week, I spoke on the large numbers of women in the United Kingdom who undergo as many as eight abortions.  I and many experts are highly suspicious that there is a strong possibility that many of those women are being abused.  However, no records are kept to help to identify that and ease their plight.  We must ensure that such practices do not happen in this country.</p>  <p>  The recording of ethnicity is proposed because in other jurisdictions women of vulnerable minority groups are more likely to be targeted by abortion providers who want to make money from them.  Only through the collection of these data can we identify whether certain socio-economic or ethnic groups are at particular risk and should be provided with additional supports in terms of pregnancy prevention.  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortion services in the United States, was a known eugenicist who targeted African-American and vulnerable communities.  Many in this House will say that this would never happen here, but we cannot be certain of that.  That is why I have repeatedly proposed that the wording of the Bill be amended to offer protection to such women.  Amendments Nos. 43, 43a and 43b present an opportunity in this regard.  They have been put forward to protect women, rather than to disadvantage them in any way.  I ask that the Minister acknowledge that the amendments have been tabled in a genuine effort to protect women.</p>  <p>  There is nothing wrong with collecting data.  Obviously, the data would form part of confidential medical records, but at least we would know if a large number of women are having eight abortions, as is the case in the United Kingdom, and would be able to protect such women from abuse.</p></speech>

They repeatedly refer to the importance and benefit of the collection of data.  Of course, the collection of data is important and of benefit and provision for it is made in the Bill.  Furthermore, amendment No. 42 allows for the collection of data on a different level.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 43, 43a and 43b are malicious and vindictive.  It is very interesting to note that they are signed by nine men and one woman.  How are those men not ashamed of themselves for demanding the personal data of women they do not even know?  How can they hold their heads up and not feel the shame that this must bring on their gender?  The amendments are filled with malice.</p></speech>

There is no mention of the collection of data on socio-economic issues in amendments Nos. 43, 43a or 43b even though we know that such issues affect proportionately more women than certain other issues when it comes to making a choice on termination.  These amendments are the height of hypocrisy.  They are malicious and vindictive and should be withdrawn.</p></speech>

The crux of their genesis was revealed in some of the recent contributions which indicate that alarm bells should go off once a woman has had two or three abortions.  To develop a point made by Deputy Burton, where would those alarm bells go off?  Would there be a red light in a convent or local church?  Is this some sort of policing of promiscuity?  Is it about policing pregnancy?  Is that the intention of the proposers of these amendments?  The amendments hark back to views held in the past.</p>  <p>  Reference has again been made to many women in the UK having eight terminations.  It has been made clear in this Chamber, at committee and through the Citizens' Assembly that no woman ever gets up in the morning and decides to have a termination as a logical way to proceed with her day.  Such decisions are normally made by people in the most difficult of circumstances.  The people voted on the provision of a 12-week window within which women would be allowed to make their own decisions without being told what they should do with their bodies by the promiscuity police, pregnancy police or any other police.</p>  <p>  These amendments are not what they purport to be.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith stated, the collection of data is provided for in the legislation.  These amendments are about power, control over women, shame and surveillance.  Those who have put their names to the amendments should be ashamed in front of the women in their lives.</p></speech>

When the amendments arose on Committee Stage, there were repeated references to the United States and the United Kingdom as if we did not have a Constitution and the right to make our own laws and put our own protections in place.  Such protections have already been put in place.  I stated at the time that I did not believe that the wording used in the amendments had been formulated by a Member of the House.  It is my belief that they originate outside the House and have been cleverly worded to give rise to suspicions and to allow a sense of control, strength and power in a particular direction.  As a modern society, we should have moved past that.  There was and is no basis for it.  It is insulting to the House for the amendments to be tabled again in the clear knowledge that they borrow from other jurisdictions.  We have the right to make our own laws and are so doing and have done for many years.  It is to be hoped that we will do so for many years to come.</p>  <p>  Like many other speakers, I believe there is no place in the legislation for amendments which specifically target a large sector of society, give the impression that its members are not equal citizens and create the basis on which they can be treated as second-class citizens.  That is a poor recognition of the role played by Irish women in public and private life and throughout every sphere of society.</p><p>It is terribly sad to think that, at this time in our development - the 21st-century - that people see fit to bring forward such appalling and restrictive amendments.</p></speech>

Last week, a Deputy was driven to tears by the level of aggression directed at her.  Is it possible that we can have a debate without introducing this fractiousness all the time?  Members talk about others seeking to shame.  There is an effort on the part of some Deputies to shame those on the other side of the debate in order to close them down and censor them.  There is nothing wrong with Deputies asking questions and engaging in honest debate.  It is unbelievable that other Deputies are seeking to censor and create uniformity of thought and that groupthink exists in this Chamber.  It is important that those with opposing views have an opportunity to put them respectfully without others seeking to delete them with aggression and calling them names.</p>  <p>  People have been ratcheting up the debate in the past half an hour, calling this proposal an inquisition.  It is a four-page document.  It refers to the type of information collected in many other western European democracies.  In the 35 years of debate on the eighth amendment, I have never heard people state that the British system is built to shame women.  All we are looking for is information that is collected in other countries, such as Britain and New Zealand.  There is a higher incidence of abortion among certain ethnicities and among those with disabilities or living in poverty.  If one is from a poor background, one is far more likely to be aborted.  If one is disabled, one is far more likely to be aborted.</p>  <p>  If one collects information purely for policy development and not to identify individual women in any way whatsoever, one is simply adding to the available information so policymakers can become involved in developing solutions to some of the socio-economic problems people experience.  There is absolutely no malicious intent.  Our proposal is simply to bring a democratic norm in other European countries into our law.  The only motivation for people not to want to collect this information is a desire to hide what is happening in the country in the future.</p></speech>

We are entitled to research and table amendments for the right reasons and for compassionate reasons.  Just because people want to hide and cover up, they behave as they do.  They talk about England all the time.  The attacks by Deputy O'Connell and others, including Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, are an effort on their part to get the headlines and see who can be the most vitriolic about us and demonise us as if we were backward people.  We get this all the time.</p>  <p>  As for the ethnicity reference, it is in the UK legislation on abortion on foot of a recommendation from the UK equality authority in 2001.  We are always talking about the United Kingdom and saying we have to send our people there but when it suits us, we do not want to have what they have in their legislation.  The data are just for records, nothing else.  We are as compassionate as anyone else.  Nobody here has a monopoly on compassion.  By God, they do not.  That is one thing sure and certain.  What we propose is the monitoring of statistics related to abortion and the abortion rate among minorities.  Do the Deputies objecting feel there is a problem with the UK abortion law, which they told us was so liberal and which should have been made available to people here?  They have a problem with the UK equality legislation, the research arm of International Planned Parenthood Federation and the Guttmacher Institute.  That is what the Deputies are saying.  The simple amendments we have brought forward were tabled respectfully.  We ask for a respectful debate.  I welcome the Ceann Comhairle back to the Chamber in order that we might have a respectful debate.  The Deputies should stop demonising us as if we were evil.  The staff in Am&aacute;rach Research have outlined, quite clearly, many of the issues that arise.  Hundreds among the 1,000 interviewed have said that they want these things as well.  We are not being emotive.  We are not delaying the legislation either.  I resent the remark made today by the Taoiseach that we are filibustering.  We are not.  If one checks the record, one will see that most of the time was taken up by the other side on the first night.  Tonight, indeed, we are not speaking for our full time but we are entitled to table, move and debate amendments without the vitriolic attacks of the Deputies who want to demonise us.  They are vying for headlines, asking who could be the most wicked.</p></speech>

We are going to have widespread abortion provision in this State from next year.  To be honest, I am not interested in the sideshow arguments that have been taking place here over amendments that are not going to pass and rows that have long been settled.  What I am interested in is considering the Bill before us.  The collection of information is critical in developing health policy, for sure.  It is absolutely the case that data such as those on county of origin can be useful but they do not have to be provided for in primary legislation.  They can be dealt with in guidelines.  What is problematic is requiring the collection of information about doctors, their Medical Council number and so on.  It is precisely problematic in the context of where we have come from in this State and some of the difficulties that exist.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister that in three years or so we probably will not need these provisions.  If one follows that logic, however, the problem is that by putting in these provisions now, one is actually tying the hands of doctors, creating a climate of fear, perpetuating abortion stigma and making it more difficult to provide health care.  Rather than helping to gather information to determine whether our health policies are working and whether we are ensuring reproductive help has improved and fewer people need to travel, it is making the situation more precarious and forcing more women to continue to travel.  It is regrettable that the Minister is saying we need to wait three years to get what may be a better Bill.  We can provide for the collection of information by means of guidelines; we do not need restrictive conditions.  The Minister should seriously examine the amendment we have put forward because it genuinely improves the Bill.</p></speech>

I believe in the necessity of keeping data and ensuring that they are compiled because they may help people in the long term.  I have heard Members talking about different nationalities.  There are those in parts of this country who do not have the same social and economic opportunities as others.  We need to compile data, as we do so in all aspects of life, so that they might help the women of this country in the long term.</p></speech>

There are important data asked for in the amendment, including the address at which the termination took place, the age and marital status of the pregnant woman and the country she is from.  Also sought is the length of the pregnancy at the date on which the termination of pregnancy took place.  That is important.  The amendment would require data on whether the pregnancy was singleton or multiple, the date and the method of foeticide, if used, and where the termination of pregnancy was a selective termination, the original number of foetuses and the number to which they were reduced.  Where a termination of pregnancy is carried out under section 12, the amendment would seek data on the condition affecting the foetus and the method of and grounds for the diagnosis of that condition.  Data would be compiled on whether a live birth followed the termination of pregnancy, and, if so, the care given to the baby and its outcome.  This reference in paragraph (m) is vital.  I appeal to every Member to examine it because there is nothing wrong with it.</p><p>There is everything right about demanding that the baby is properly looked after.  We have asked for this before, it is part of this amendment and I am asking for it again because every baby who is alive deserves every medical intervention to ensure they stay alive after birth.  The wording of the amendment is "if the death of the woman occurred as a result of the termination of pregnancy, the date and cause of death".  These are all very important and laudable things to ask for.  I will take no rubbish from anyone directing it at us because those Deputies are wrong, and when people are wrong, they are never right.</p></speech>

We were long enough shouting about all the other countries and the great abortion laws they have.  Now we seem to be running away from them.  What are we scared of?  What are we trying to cover up?  I have mentioned women having eight abortions.  I am not one bit ashamed to do so because I am protecting women by doing so.  Right across the world, where there are multiple abortions, there are many horrific reasons for them.  The woman could be abused in such a situation and this needs to be highlighted and recorded.  They need to be protected.</p>  <p>  The insults thrown at us from across the floor are astonishing, to say the least.  I fully support anyone giving their views and they are well entitled to do so, but I am talking about the insults they throw across at us.  We have our views, which may be different to theirs.  Their actions are undemocratic, but that is the way they feel.  Last week one Deputy across the floor insulted, in my view, thousands and thousands of women across the world, one of whom lives in Ireland, by stating that survivors of abortions were simply a fairy story.  One lady decided she had had enough of listening to that Deputy and recorded her views about what happened to her.  She lives in Ireland and she gave her own story.  She is a survivor of a failed abortion and she was highly insulted by the Deputy's comments that she was part of a fairy story.  She is not part of a fairy story.  She is a human being who lives in this Irish Republic.  We should not be ashamed to discuss these issues as they come before us.  This is the sad situation in which we in this D&aacute;il have left ourselves.  Deputies are trying to put fear into us and are feeding the media with the wrong stories, but we will keep speaking here because this is totally wrong.  I believe we should record all data to protect women.</p></speech>

This information is needed in the interests of the health service and the new abortion system.  All information would be strictly confidential.  Such information is recorded by GPs in hospitals for every other procedure, so why would anyone object to doing likewise for abortion?  All information would only be published in the same way as all Department of Health and HSE statistics.  I repeat that the Bill provides for the Minister for Health to review its operation after three years.</p></speech>

I have always been of the belief that all types of data, information and records are very important, in particular when it comes to anything to do with medical care or healthcare.  I would have thought that as much record keeping as possible is in the best interests of the person involved, in this case the mother and the situation in which she finds herself.</p>  <p>  I, too, must say I was very much taken aback by the Taoiseach's statement today.  I certainly cannot blame the Ceann Comhairle because he cannot be held responsible for what comes out of someone else's mouth.  However, the Taoiseach should have retracted the statement he made today on the record of the D&aacute;il, quite simply because it was factually incorrect.  I am not blaming the Minister for it.

The Minister would even have to admit himself at this stage that there is no such thing as any wastage of time by this group.  For anyone on the other side to say there is is extremely unfair, and for the Taoiseach to have put that on the record of the D&aacute;il today was inherently wrong.</p>  <p>  I was contacted today by many doctors.  I am sorry that I cannot recollect the precise word used, but one Deputy on my right-hand side earlier said of the doctors who walked out at the weekend that it was a fake protest.  That is what she was trying to say.  The doctors, nurses and midwives who have what I would call serious conscientious objections are entitled to their viewpoints.  They are professional people working in healthcare.  If they have concerns, my goodness, they are perfectly entitled to meet and, as in any meeting, if they have a disagreement and if there is a walkout or a protest, they are entitled to that.

We are supposed to be living in a place where people have free speech and can protest if they want to do so.  That is the whole idea of democracy.  For some Deputy to stand up here and go accusing doctors of letting on to be something they are not is outrageous and a slur on our medical profession.  The medical profession has difficulty in dealing with this issue and will have further difficulty in dealing with it.  I spoke to many medical people over the weekend who are extremely concerned about what will happen in January.  As Minister for Health, Deputy Harris should know first-hand all the other issues there are.  He continuously says here that we cannot talk in the context that everything else should be right before we go doing this.  I am not even saying that to him; what I am saying is that the medical profession has it well flagged to senior people in the HSE that this will cause problems in January that they cannot even foresee or quantify at this stage.  The Minister himself knows this is the truth but is not admitting it.  I would like if he did.</p>  <p>  I will repeat on the record that the Taoiseach should withdraw the nasty things he said today, which were factually incorrect and untrue.  To prove my point, I could talk for another three minutes if I wanted to do so - I am entitled to do so - but I will not, just as I did not speak for my full allocation of time last week.  So tell that to the Taoiseach and tell him to stick it.</p></speech>

It is disgusting to see that they are being twisted and taken out of context.  I want to put that on the record before I begin.</p>  <p>  Data recording in the context of amendment No. 43a is not seen as another box-ticking exercise.  It is seen as being fundamental to the integrity of the operation of the Act.</p>  <p>  It was also suggested on Committee Stage by Deputy Coppinger that comprehensive data relating to the practice of abortion should not be recorded because we do not collect similar kinds of data for the extraction of wisdom teeth.  I have the transcript of that debate with me.  While I am sure that the Deputy was not being facetious, it highlights again how we simply cannot adopt an approach whereby we place abortions, the ending of the life of the foetus, into the same category as some minor or relatively inconsequential procedure.  </p>  <p>  We are talking here about an intervention where the sole outcome is the ending of at least one human life.  The Minister will also note that the amendment refers to the recording of data related to foeticide.  This is in line with existing requirements in the UK.  Notification must be made there of the method used, specifically if the foeticide was surgical or medical, and depending on the method used.</p></speech>

Here is the way I have approached this Bill.  I approached it by doing exactly what I told the people I was going to do.  The draft legislation published in March outlined the information we would require to be collected if the people voted "Yes".  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is right.  We would get the impression from some people tonight that this Bill does not endeavour to collect any information.  Of course it does.</p>  <p>  Some people believe it is too much information.  Deputy Clare Daly has made that point.  She would like to do it in a different way.  I respect that view.  Other people would like much more information to be collected.  I believe that this Bill endeavours to collect the minimal amount of information required to make sure we can properly monitor the rolling out of these new services in our health service and make informed decisions as policymakers.  If we removed the requirement on me to have that information, we would also be removing the requirement on me to make a presentation to the D&aacute;il by way of report each and every year.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that amendment No. 43b would place a criminal sanction on a doctor for not complying with this information.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="23:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400061#JJJ00500"><p>I move amendment No. 45:</p><blockquote>In page 15, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;Parental notification</b><br /><br /><b>23. </b>(1) A termination of pregnancy in respect of a pregnant minor may only be carried out in accordance with <i>section 10 </i>where a copy of the certification referred to in that section has been served on a parent of the minor at least 24 hours before the termination of pregnancy is carried out.<br /><br />(2) In respect of a pregnant minor, a copy of the certification referred to in <i>section 11(2) </i>shall be served on a parent of the minor&mdash;(a) before the termination of pregnancy is carried out, or<br /><br />(b) where it is not practicable to do so before the termination of pregnancy is carried out, as soon as may be but, in any event, not later than 2 days after the making of that certification.(3) A termination of pregnancy in respect of a pregnant minor may only be carried out in accordance with <i>section 12 </i>where a copy of the certification referred to in that section has been served on a parent of the minor at least 48 hours before the termination of pregnancy is carried out.<br /><br />(4) A termination of pregnancy in respect of a pregnant minor may only be carried out in accordance with <i>section 13 </i>where a copy of the certification referred to in that section has been served on a parent of the minor at least 72 hours before the termination of pregnancy is carried out.<br /><br />(5) Service of any certification required to be served under this section shall be carried out in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be recorded in any notification required to be forwarded to the Minister under <i>section 21</i>.<br /><br />(6) The High Court, upon application made to it by any interested party, and if satisfied that it is in the best interests of the minor concerned, may make an order dispensing with any requirement for service provided for under this section.<br /><br />(7) An application under <i>subsection (6) </i>shall be made on notice to the parent or parents of the minor concerned, unless the High Court is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it may justly proceed to hear and determine the application without notice to the parent or parents of the minor concerned.<br /><br />(8) In this section&mdash;<br /><br />&ldquo;minor&rdquo; means a woman who has not attained the age of 16 years;<br /><br />&ldquo;parent&rdquo; includes-(a) a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964,<br /><br />(b) any other natural or legal person acting in <i>loco parentis </i>in respect of the pregnant minor under any statutory power or order of a court and,<br /><br />(c) in the case of a minor who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 2010, or, where the child has been adopted outside the State and that adoption is recognised by the State by virtue of any statute or rule of law for the time being in force, the adopter or, where relevant, the surviving adopter.&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>There was a little bit of confusion on Committee Stage about this amendment and we spent a long time debating the pros and cons of parental notification.  Obviously people from my side of the debate were of the belief that, for a girl under the age of 16 who was facing a crisis pregnancy - a pregnancy at that age would be a crisis pregnancy - any parent in the country would like to know about the potential decision that girl was going to make so as to offer her support, love, care and advice if possible.  People here would be shocked, horrified and hurt if their child had an abortion under the age of 16 without their knowledge.</p><p>We had the debate for about an hour and most people on the pro-choice side argued that we should not have parental notification at all.  It later transpired, because a question was asked by Deputy Donnelly of the Minister, that parental notification existed within the law anyway when it came to health and medical procedures.  I think at that stage the Minister said parental notification was necessary which made the first half of the debate defunct to a certain extent.  It is important that we nail it down a little bit.  If there is confusion at ministerial level and among the opposition about an issue like this, maybe there is a need to put parental notification in the legislation itself.</p><p>This amendment simply requires parental notification for an abortion performed on a minor in non-emergency cases.  It makes an exception where it is in the minor's best interests to dispense with such notification, because there was obviously a fear that, in some circumstances, parental notification would make the situation worse for the child, especially if there was abuse within the family.</p><p>The age of consent for surgical, medical and dental treatments in this State is generally 16.  However, sometimes procedures can be performed below that age without parental consent.  I think this is where the confusion lies.  Consequently, it is important to include specific provisions for notification as this amendment does.  It is important also to separate out that this is not consent.  We are not looking to build consent into this.  These amendments are so mild, in reality.  They are just looking to build in notification in the Bill.</p><p>Again, we discussed it on Committee Stage.  I know a lot of people in the Chamber do not want comparative analysis with other European countries because, obviously, other European countries seem to have racist tendencies when it comes to these types of things, but there is a comparative analysis with other countries.  Consent is required in many other European countries and the age of consent for this parental consent is 18.  It shows how far our country has gone that simply the request for parental notification at the age of under 16 is a challenge for some within a debate here.</p><p>The amendment recognises that parents should be involved in matters which have potentially far reaching consequences for their children.  Abortions have medical, emotional and psychological consequences that can be very serious and lasting, particularly when the patient is at such a young age.</p><p>I think this is a reasonable effort to codify in primary legislation to ensure the confusion that arose on Committee Stage does not arise anywhere else in society in future.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting one of these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400062#KKK00200"><p>The first thing I have to say with regard to consent is that I hope we live in an Ireland where we have moved on from the sort of under-the-cover darkness and horror that existed when younger people got pregnant in the past.  They had to cover it up as if it was a shame to be pregnant.  They had to hide it.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall awful cases in which youngsters gave birth on their own in the cold and rain after hiding their pregnancies, which resulted in the death not only of the baby but also of the mother.  Young people had to be ashamed of being pregnant, but there is no shame in being pregnant no matter what age the person is.  The point I would like to drive home is that when a young person is pregnant - she may be a minor, but the point I am making applies regardless of what age she is - we all want to see her having the support of her parent or guardian.  How can a parent or guardian be supportive if he or she is kept unaware of the situation for one reason or another?</p>  <p>  I believe there is an age of consent.  If a person under that age is pregnant, questions must be asked about the consequences.  What was the situation that arose up to that point?  Was there mistreatment of that young person?  What were the circumstances?  I believe it is vital in all of this for the parent or guardian to be in a position to give support, encouragement, help and advice, and to be kind and nice to that young person.  That is what parents are for.  Obviously, we do not want to see young people being pregnant at too young an age.  It is not good when they are only youngsters themselves.  If a young person finds herself pregnant, it is not a bad thing for her to find herself in that situation.  In such circumstances, I would want her to have the full support of everybody, including her parents or guardians.  That is what parents are for.  That is what the State is for.  We are all supposed to be here to help, encourage, give advice and be kind and nice at a troublesome time in a young person's life.  I would like to think that is the reason I have put my name to this amendment.  I just think it is right.  It is proper to make it a requirement for parents or guardians to be notified so they can assist in every way possible.  That is all I want to say on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400062#KKK00300"><p>The age of consent for medical treatment in Ireland is 16 in virtually all situations.  I believe this age of consent should apply to the most serious situation - the provision of termination of pregnancy.  We cannot allow a child under the age of 16 to have a termination of pregnancy without the knowledge or consent of her parents.  We would not allow this to happen in the case of any other serious procedure, so we cannot allow it in this case.  Parents have a right to know about a serious situation like crisis pregnancy that arises for one of their children.  Such circumstances have potentially far-reaching consequences for children from a medical and emotional point of view.  We cannot allow a child to face into a crisis pregnancy alone and without the knowledge and support of her parents.</p>  <p>  Twenty-one European countries have a requirement for parental notification in cases involving women under the age of 18.  Forty states of the United States have a similar law.  These are jurisdictions with liberal abortion regimes.  If these countries and states deem that parental notification is necessary, it must be for a good reason.  The amendment before the House recognises that parents should be involved in decisions that have far-reaching consequences for their children and ensures the doctors involved respect the Constitution.  This position is supported by international best practice.  This is not about consent; it is about notification.  There is a major difference.  For this reason, I support the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-12-04a.645" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400062#KKK00400"><p>I will not spend too long on this matter because it was dealt with comprehensively on Committee Stage.  The proposers of this amendment have failed to mention that many girls - children under the age of 16 - are not supported by their parents.  In many cases, it was being raped by their fathers that caused them to become pregnant.  Essentially, this amendment would open the way for the rapist to have a veto over the right of a girl to have an abortion.  We went through this in detail on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, these situations are not unusual.  They are very common.  Actually, they are more common than they should be.  Such cases are frequently in the news.  Not every parent is supportive.  That is the point.</p>  <p>  I want to make a general point about this debate.  The main objective of these amendments, which are being proposed by Deputies who are anti-choice or anti-abortion, is to stop people from having abortions and, if they decide to go ahead and have an abortion, to make it as difficult for them as they possibly can.  They are using words like "consent", "support" and "information", but I have to report to the D&aacute;il that as this evening's debate was starting, the START group of doctors was holding a training and education event in Limerick and had to change to a secret venue due to harassment by anti-choicers who were ringing the local hospital to make threats about what would happen if the training and education event went ahead.  Doctors are entitled to discuss how they will provide this service.  Those who want to provide it are allowed to meet in groups to discuss the matter.</p></speech>

They are continuing on with their old methods of harassment, abuse and intimidation.  The meeting went ahead tonight, albeit in a secret location due to the actions of people who do not stand for support, consent and information.  I am reminded of the Taliban attacking women's education.  Such horrific methods are being used in this country even though the population expressed resounding support for the right of people to have this information.  This is not accepted by the people who are coming up here and spending nights on end with this kind of drivel.  I think their methods have been borne out by the information I got from doctors in Limerick earlier today.  Those doctors who want to recognise a woman's right to make this decision, and who recognise the huge mandate given by the people of this country, are entitled to meet without being harassed by the usual suspects and will not be prevented from doing so.  I really think that is important.  I do not know if Deputies realise how dangerous it is for people not to have information and for doctors not be able to get training.</p>  <p>  I want to say something about what happened on Sunday.  I have spoken to many doctors about this.  We keep hearing from the anti-choice Deputies about all of the doctors to whom they speak.  We speak to doctors too.  The feeling among the doctors to whom I have spoken is that many doctors will provide this service.  We need to send out a message of encouragement to many women in this country who are worried right now-----</p></speech>

Obviously, the media cannot resist a row.  It reported the events of the weekend in that vein.  There are enough people who are committed to providing this service.  It will happen.  The Minister needs to move might and main to ensure that the training of doctors takes place because they are entitled to it.  The Minister also needs to move might and main to ensure there is accessibility to ultrasound facilities in areas where it is needed.</p></speech>

Of course it is not and should not be required in every situation.</p><p>Affidea, which is a private X-ray company, is located in certain areas but would not have the reach that would be required.  The Minister needs to move very quickly over the next few weeks to ensure it happens.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that there will be heavy advertising of the 24-hour helpline.  It is very clear that some people do not want people to have information and do not want women and pregnant people to have access to these services despite the vote in favour.  It is very important for people in isolated areas or very vulnerable people.  This is what is so annoying.  The people who will suffer will be very vulnerable women and girls who are the people the Deputies allegedly care about.  It is very likely it will be very young people, possibly in direct provision, who are possibly afraid and who have possibly been sexually abused or raped.  Technically anyone under 16 has been raped.  It is absolutely vital the Minister sees that those issues are dealt with.  There are 120 or more doctors in the START group alone.  There are loads of other average GPs who will provide this because they deal with it every day.  It is not an alien concept.  They are dealing with women who are pregnant and in crisis and they want to be able to help them not shift them away.  As long as the pathways are put in place, the service will go ahead in January and it is vital it does.  It is vital it is made known to women, girls and pregnant people who are out there.  Despite the best efforts of the so-called caring Deputies to delay this by tabling time-wasting amendments they know will not get any support, they will not succeed.</p></speech>

I do not agree there was confusion.  There was debate.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae spoke earlier and I compliment him on what he said because I know he spoke out of genuine concern for young women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies.  We have lots of examples.  He is quite right about it.</p>  <p>  However, what we were and are concerned about is quite common, as Deputy Coppinger said.  We were not able to find out exactly what the benefit would be of informing the parent or guardian if the parent or guardian was culpable.  There is no use saying it does not happen.  It has been in the courts on numerous occasions.  It happens on quite a regular basis.  It happens quite regularly in the UK, the United States and all over the globe.  There is a history of young girls and children in absolutely appalling situations and the perpetrators being in their own households.  In some cases it is only found out years afterwards.</p>  <p>  We were trying to determine how best to handle that kind of situation so as not to give an advantage to the perpetrator in the event the perpetrator was in the household.  In certain circumstances it might give the perpetrator an advantage to escape from the country, to walk away and not be seen again.  Our feeling at the time was that in ordinary family circumstances, the support of the parent is regular, necessary and laudable but it does not happen in all cases.  How to deal with those particular situations was the issue we raised on Committee Stage.  It is still a valid issue and one on which I look forward to hearing more from the Minister.  Where a young woman in such circumstances was the victim of abuse within the family, it might put her at much more serious risk if the perpetrator was tipped off beforehand.  It was at that stage we decided the GP has a significant and important role to play because he or she will be the first port of call.  The GP would presumably have some knowledge of the family and some local knowledge and would be in a position to advise the girl or woman in a particular way and would be able to intervene in a very useful way.  That is why we spent so much time discussing the relationship between the patient and the GP in order to be absolutely certain we did not leave a weakness in the legislation that would be capitalised on by people of unsavoury character.</p></speech>

As my colleagues and I have repeatedly stated, the amendment introduces an additional requirement for the lawful termination of pregnancy under sections 10, 12 and 13 where it involves a pregnant minor, under the age of 16 years.  In such cases, it would be necessary for a parent of a minor to be provided with a copy of certification made under those sections before the termination of pregnancy is carried out.</p>  <p>  I will not be lectured here about being anti-choice.  We are not one bit anti-choice.  We are pro-life and proud of it.  I will not accept Deputy Coppinger's words about our alleged care for young people.  We care as much as anybody else.  That is why we have a debate on this issue in as sensitive a manner as we can.  It was said we do not care.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I will not take seven minutes to speak on the amendment.  We have been accused of filibustering.  The records will show we did not, do not and will not.  We are moving amendments that we tabled with good intentions.  We speak to them with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Acting Chairmen.  It is our right.

We moved to repeal the eighth amendment but not for this draconian, drastic and savage legislation.  It is ironic.  I did not attend the lighting of the Christmas tree this year for the first year ever.  In three weeks' time we will celebrate the birth of our Lord and here we are tonight passing this Bill.  It is ironic.  I am sure the irony is not lost on many people.  We will not be accused of that.</p>  <p>  There are 21 countries in Europe and up to 40 states in the US that have age limits on parental notification.  It is quoted as best international practice but when it suits some people we cannot even mention it but we will mention it.  As has also been pointed out, provision is made for the High Court to dispense with the parental notification requirement if it is satisfied it is in the minor's best interest to do so.  Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned Cavan and Longford and the awful cases we had.  There have been horrific cases.  We have all been horrified by them.  We want to support young girls and teenagers.  We are all for proper sex education and proper education across the board.  It is not to go off on a tangent.  I am a parent and so are many of my colleagues.  We like to have our young girls and daughters educated properly and educated to protect themselves and for the people around them to be respectful.</p><p>We have to be respectful ourselves.  This amendment does not make any change to existing laws governing the giving of consent on or on behalf of minors for surgical or medical treatment.  Even those receiving vaccines in schools were asked to sign consent.  It is not something new or draconian that we have drawn up.</p> <p> We are responsible and we have been responsible.  We are not anti-choice or anti-care.  The word "allegedly" was put on the record of the House when someone said we allegedly care.  That is a total misuse.  It is misconstruing the amendment.  It represents misuse of language and it is objectionable language.  It is an effort to silence us but we will not be silenced.  We have a democratic right for the time being and we are mandated to represent people here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is a great privilege &ndash; is m&oacute;r an pribhl&eacute;id &iacute;.  We are proud of it and we will do our humble best and get advice where we do not have the experience or the full knowledge &ndash; we are not prophets.  We will get the help.  Of course we get help with amendments.  No one here has a monopoly on compassion.</p> <p> It ill-behoves the Taoiseach, as Deputy Healy-Rae said, to have said today in the House that we are filibustering.  I hope he withdraws it when he looks at the record.  When history recalls the record of who spoke, for how long and who spoke in a respectful manner during the debate, it will show something different.  All we ask for is respect and to be respectably allowed to put our amendments, speak to them and have votes on them.</p></speech>

A person cannot get a termination under the section.  The provision does not exist.  Section 10 provides for definitions.  That is one fundamental flaw in the measure.  There is no reference to section 11 and, therefore, there is no need for notification to a parent under section 11.  That section relates to a risk of the life or health of a pregnant minor.</p>  <p>  The amendment states that under section 12, a doctor would have to notify the parents of the minor at least 48 hours before the termination of the pregnancy is carried out.  Section 12 relates to the risk to the life or health of a pregnant minor in an emergency.  That is where she is on the verge of dying.

To be helpful, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has admitted that there are errors in the amendment.  Before I get to the substance of why the amendment is not necessary, I wish to point out that the amendment simply would not work because the Deputy has referred to the wrong sections.  The Deputy has referred to section 10, which is the definitions section.  Section 11 relates to risk to life and health, section 12 to emergency situation, and section 13 to fatal foetal abnormalities.  The Deputy has not referred to the early pregnancy section, which is section 14.</p>  <p>  Even if the Deputy believes passionately in this - I passionately oppose it &ndash; he could not pass the amendment in any event.  If people are to be credible in saying that they are trying to put forward their amendments, they should do the decent thing and withdraw this amendment.  They should not allow us to waste time on an amendment that could not be passed because of the drafting error.</p>  <p>  The broad issue of consent is important.  The question of consent is already dealt with by the Medical Council, the regulator of our medical profession.  Consent is also dealt with in the HSE guide to consent for young people, a copy of which I have before me.  Consent is not something unique to this part of our health service.  Our health service has to deal with issues relating to consent.  The rules of consent will be the exact same in this case as they would be in respect of any other service.</p>  <p>  The point Deputy Coppinger made is important.  Sadly, there are times when a parent can be a perpetrator.  There are times when a young girl needs to see a medical professional.  She may not be coming from a happy family background.  Often she may be coming from the perspective of having been the victim of abuse, including familial abuse.  Our medical profession, the regulator and the HSE know full well how to deal with the issues of consent without us needing to put it in legislation.  This amendment is genuinely technically flawed and should be withdrawn.  We should move on to the next amendment.</p></speech>

I gave Deputies the opportunity to speak.</p>  <p>  This amendment is yet another one in respect of which it feels as though it should not be needed.  It should go without saying that the parents of any pregnant minor would be, at the least, informed that their daughter was requesting an abortion.  Those of us who are parents would be upset if our young teenage daughter came home with a tattoo, let alone if we found out that she had an abortion without our knowledge.  Can anyone imagine the heartbreak a person would feel if he found out that his daughter had gone through something so traumatic on her own?  What if she went through it with no support from him and he was given no opportunity to help her see that she had other options?  What if he could have supported her and her baby - his grandchild?  It could be the first grandchild had his or her life ended out of the fear and panic of a teenager too embarrassed to tell her parents.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this is the experience of other countries like our neighbours in the UK.  It is routine there for young women and girls to have abortions without their parents' knowledge.  Common sense tells us that if we do not legislate for parental notification requirements, we will face the same experience.</p>  <p>  In the UK, the British Medical Association makes it clear in the 2018 version of the guide, The Law and Ethics of Abortion, that the patient must be given the appropriate consent for abortion from the age of 16 years.  Individuals should be assumed to have the capacity unless proven otherwise.  The guidelines also state that those under 16 can consent if they are deemed competent and that patients - adults and children &ndash; have the right to confidentiality.  This cannot be overridden except in exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  We do not yet have clear guidelines for consent to abortion in Ireland.  However, the Irish general guidelines for consent for medical treatment also allow some exceptions to parental consent for minors under 16.  It is not unreasonable to assume that some young girls aged 16 and under would have abortions without the consent of their parents.  This shocks most people.  To clarify this, I refer to information provided on the HSE website regarding consent to medical treatment.  This includes information that persons over the age of 16 can give for consent for surgical medical and dental procedures.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act 1997 is relevant.  It is clear that a person's 16 or 17 year old daughter could have an abortion without that person's knowledge.  However, the position in respect of girls under the ages of 16 years is less clear.  Initially, it seems as though children under the age of 16 will require parental consent for medical treatment.  Part 2 of the national consent policy of 2017 deals with consent to treatment for children and minors.  Section 2.2 on page 50 states that in the case of children under the age of 16, a parent or legal guardian can consent to the treatment of the child.  It appears to suggest that there is no Irish law allowing children under the age of 16 years to consent to medical treatment.</p><p>However, there is a much more worrying statement on page 54.  This policy acknowledges that in health and social care practices, it is usual to involve parents and legal guardians and to seek their consent when providing a service or treatment to a minor under the age of 16.  However, the minor may seek to make a decision on her own without parental involvement or consent.  In such circumstances, it is best practice to encourage and advise the minor to communicate with and involve her parent, parents or legal guardian.  It is only in exceptional circumstances that, having regard to the need to take account of an objective assessment of both the rights and the best interests of the person under 16, health and social care interventions would be provided for those under 16 without the knowledge or consent of parents or legal guardians.  It is clear that in some circumstances young girls under the age of 16 may be allowed to make the decision to have an abortion without parental consent if they are deemed mature enough.  This is of significant concern to many parents throughout Ireland, and I am sure it is of significant concern to many of us as we consider these amendments. </p> <p> This becomes even more concerning when the chances of suffering negative physical and mental health consequences after an abortion can be even higher for a teenage girl.  The 2017 UK statistics are more concerning again.  The UK Government publishes comprehensive data on abortions, and table 4B of the abortion statistics for England and Wales in 2017 shows that 7,343 girls under 18 had an abortion.  More than 1,000 of them were under 16.  The statistics show that 21 girls under 16 had their second abortion, and two girls, aged 16 and 17, had their seventh abortions.  Do we want multiple abortions for our young women?  The statistics quoted do not include Irish women.  However, in 2017, 64 Irish women had abortions in England or Wales.  Do Members believe that if abortion becomes legal for minors without parental consent that these figures will not increase dramatically?</p></speech>

I listened attentively to Deputy Durkan, who said there are sad cases and serious, bad cases where young girls are abused by parents or guardians.  It is sad when that happens.  We all abhor that; it is very wrong.  I am sure that we all feel for the girls in that situation.  We totally and absolutely hate it when that happens.  I honestly believe that there are far more good parents and guardians than there are villains and blackguards.  The good parents who care for their children and who would not abuse them in any way are the people I am talking about.  They adore and love their children, and it would hurt them very much - and it would not help the young girl either - if an abortion was carried out without their knowing about it.  As Deputy Durkan said, we rely on the GP or healthcare official the girl attends in the first instance to do the right thing.  That health worker might get to know that it would not be in the best interests of the girl to notify the parent or guardian, and I am sure that is what he or she would do at that stage.  The law provides for a situation where a health care professional, a doctor or someone else finds out about something like this, and he or she is bound by the law to notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that such a thing has happened.  The matter is dealt with professionally and legally after that, and there are rules and regulations that protect the vulnerable or abused girl in that regard, as I understand it.</p>  <p>  For the benefit of loving and caring parents and guardians, it is only right that they are notified in circumstances where the girl is aged under 16.  It is right that they should be notified to ensure that they could adequately deal with the young girl after an abortion.  It is an emotional time, and there are psychological consequences following on from an abortion, which are sometimes so serious that they will last for a long time.  This is particularly true where the patient is immature.  A person who is underage in many cases is far less mentally and emotionally equipped to make so major and irrevocable a decision as the decision to have an abortion.  She cannot foresee the immediate and long-term consequences.  It is important to guard against a situation where a frightened child might make that decision on her own at such a young age, without her parents even knowing, when that decision can have such life altering consequences for her.  We have all heard of how children can get upset when they do not have the comfort and loving care of parents at certain times.  They can have mood swings and get so upset that unfortunate, desperate things happen.  We should legislate for the good parents, because I honestly believe that there are far more good people than bad people in this world.</p><p>As I said at the outset, it is really sad and bad when we read about things that happen to young girls.  Again this week we heard in the media about what happens to girls around the country.  However, I honestly believe there are far more good parents and guardians and it is for those people that we should legislate.  We are all well meaning and trying to do our best for young girls who find themselves in this unfortunate position.</p></speech>

We did discuss it in detail on Committee Stage.  This amendment takes into consideration that abuse could be occurring in the family unit.  We have seen examples of that and we are all very aware of it.  We also have seen examples of abuse that occurs outside the family unit.  If we deny parents the right to be notified about their daughter, we could in effect be covering for a perpetrator outside that family unit.  What do we do in those cases?  Nowadays abuse is taken very seriously, rightly so.  We have Tusla, and there is an onus on each and every one of us to report any suspected abuse, as well as on teachers, schools and so forth.</p>  <p>  The majority of parents are good parents.  I acknowledge there have been cases, as I have outlined, of abuse within the family unit but does that mean we should let a perpetrator get away?  We are talking about a minor who might be in a vulnerable situation.  As we all are aware, online grooming of minors is on the increase.  There could be a case where a minor gets pregnant and feels very vulnerable.  The right of those parents to know should not be denied.  This is a very reasonable amendment based on common sense.  As I have stated, we have taken into consideration that there are cases where parents cannot be notified.  We are cognisant of that.  However, we cannot let perpetrators outside of the family unit, or rather the immediate family unit, get away with abuse.  We know that abuse has been covered up in the past.</p>  <p>  There is much talk in this House about moving on and making our society better and safer for our young people, particularly our young girls.  If we do not notify parents, perpetrators of abuse and paedophiles will get away.  We cannot have that sort of system either.  As legislators, we are asking for the right thing to be done.  We are asking for reason and common sense to be implemented in this situation.  This needs a common-sense approach.  We cannot allow perpetrators or those who are involved in grooming girls online get away with a horrendous act that needs to be punished.  We must make sure that no loopholes are given to that type of person.</p></speech>

We are talking about children who become pregnant.  This issue arose a lot during the debate on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The eighth amendment's powerlessness to assist a child of 12, 13, 14 or 15 years who became pregnant, either accidentally or through rape or incest, was most mentioned by people as the reason they voted to repeal it in the numbers they did.  I know the movers of this amendment all campaigned on the issue and went from door to door as well.  If they have respect for the views of the voters who voted in such significant numbers to repeal the eighth amendment, they must be aware that over and over again, those views hinged on the issue of children.  A 12 year old is a child.  Someone in this situation has barely passed puberty when she becomes pregnant.  What parent would not want to assist that child and what child would not want that parent to be of assistance to her provided, of course, that it was not in her own home that the child was violated and raped?  I suggest the Deputies reconsider.</p>  <p>  This is designed to have a chilling effect on the child, in order that she is as confused as possible-----</p></speech>

Regardless of whether the amendment is flawed, a debate on parental notification is important.  I was not present at the committee so I did not have the benefit of what other Members heard there.  I would welcome clarity on the issue of medical consent.  For example, if a young girl below the age of 16 needs an appendicitis operation, she needs parental consent.  I assume if a young girl needs a surgical abortion, she would also need parental consent.  The Minister should confirm this on the record of the House.  I refer to the case of a young girl under the age of 16 who needs a medical abortion and who attends her GP, as a young girl who presents to her GP looking for the birth control pill normally has to have medical consent.  It is extremely important that this is put on the record of the House.  I did not quite hear all the Minister has said.  There was a little bit of noise in the Chamber.  In the interests of trying to be helpful, I think it is extremely important for the Minister to put that on the record of the House.  There are a lot of misconceptions about parental consent among the public and in the media.  I understand what parental consent is.  In relation for medical matters, the requirement applies under the age of 16.  I will conclude and ask the Minister to respond, if that is acceptable to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

As I have said in the House, the normal rules of consent apply.  Parental consent is required where somebody is under the age of 16.  Apart from the flawed nature of the amendment, there is no need to put this in legislation.  We already have provisions for medical consent.  It is in the Medical Council guidelines and the HSE's policy of consent for young people with children.  There are obviously exceptional circumstances and we have discussed them already.  However, the rules on medical consent are exactly the same for this procedure as for any other.</p></speech>

Whether it is well meaning or not, the amendment is technically flawed.  It refers to pregnancies covered by section 10, which concerns notification.  This means that when it refers to sections 11, 12 and 13, we have no idea those are the ones it means.  The amendment would cause an awful lot of confusion.  It provides for a period of two days for this, 48 hours for that and 72 hours for something else.  The amendment could have sinister consequences.  As has been well noted, it could lead to rapists being informed that their daughter has presented pregnant to a local GP and it allows any interested party to get involved via the High Court.  Finally, as the Minister has just clarified, it is completely unnecessary.  This is what I want to make absolutely clear, and the Minister might comment further when he gets a chance to wrap up.  The current law, as set out in this Bill, states that if a girl who is 15 years old or younger presents to a GP seeking a termination, she must have parental consent.  That is the existing law, which will continue under this Bill, and anybody who says this is not the case and anybody who says that a 14 year old girl can walk into a GP's office without consent is intentionally or unintentionally misleading the House and the public.</p></speech>
