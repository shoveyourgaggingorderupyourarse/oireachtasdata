    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800003#A00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p> <p> Deputies will know that last year, during the second lockdown, many universities moved to remote learning and, as a consequence, students who had prepaid for student accommodation or were in student accommodation in or near campus had to vacate their licences early.  As students do not have the same protections under the Residential Tenancies Act as other renters when it comes to exiting licence agreements early, many students and their families were significantly out of pocket.  There is a widespread practice of students being required to pay rent for three, six and in some cases the full nine months in advance of taking up their student accommodation.  That meant thousands of families across the State lost substantial sums of money because there was no requirement for student landlords to repay those moneys.</p> <p> Many of these families had been hit very hard by Covid.  Some were on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, or the wage subsidy scheme and were, therefore, experiencing hardship.  The loss of &euro;3,000, &euro;6,000 or &euro;9,000 was a great financial blow for the families in question.  If these had been standard private rented tenancies, the tenants could have given a 28-day notice.  They would have forgone the first four weeks' rent but they would have been refunded any rent paid beyond that period.</p> <p> At the time, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, rightly complained students were not being given fair play.  The USI contacted both the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Opposition housing spokespersons urging us to change the law to give students the protections they so rightly deserve.  I am aware the Minister met the USI and he has always engaged constructively with it on these and related matters.  I and other Opposition politicians did likewise.  Those engagements on the Opposition side led to the Bill before us today.  It is a USI Bill; it was designed and led by the USI.  The Bill has the support of 56 Opposition Deputies who have co-signed it.  I believe others who have not signed it will also support it.</p> <p> The Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers provided considerable assistance on the Bill and we thank OPLA staff for their work on it.  The Bill does three very simple things, two of which are Covid-19 related protections and one is a permanent change to the protections for students.  First, if a student in student accommodation is forced to leave that accommodation early because of future Covid-19 restrictions, he or she would be able, as all other tenants are, to give a 28-day notice and get refunded for any additional rent paid in advance beyond that notice period.  Likewise, if a student is not able to take up pre-booked accommodation due to Covid-19 restrictions, he or she will be able to issue a 28-day notice to exit that licence early and be fully refunded for any additional rent paid in advance beyond the notice period.  These are fair and eminently sensible changes.  Landlords would have 28 days' rent covered and any rent paid beyond that would be fully refunded.</p> <p> The permanent change proposed in the Bill is that the practice of pre-charging students for three, six or nine months be ended.  It is simply an unfair burden.  This is particularly true in respect of working families in many parts of Ireland who are sending their sons and daughters to universities in the cities and towns and must come up with such large amounts of cash when, in general, regular renters pay a deposit of one month's rent as well as one month's rent in advance.</p> <p> The core message of the Bill is that we should give students fair play.  Let us ensure student renters are given exactly the same protections as all others.  Where landlords are served with an early notice of termination, they will, under this Bill, get four weeks' rent.  If that is good enough in the private rented sector generally, it should be good enough for student landlords.  Equally, the Bill provides that students will get fair play and be refunded any rent paid beyond four weeks.  Crucially, once we get to the other side of Covid, the practice of requiring the prepayment of thousands of euro by hard-pressed working families will come to an end.</p> <p>This is a reasonable and sensible Bill.  I urge the Minister, as he did previously when he worked, while in opposition, to protect students, to work with the current Opposition and pass the USI's Bill in order to ensure fair play for students.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800005#C00200"><p>As my colleague stated, the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents and Other Protections) (Covid-19) Bill 2021 seeks to end the rip-off relating to students and their families.  I would first like to commend the USI and the previous speaker, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and his team for the work they have done on this Bill.  In addition, I acknowledge the 56 Opposition Deputies who have already signed up to the Bill.</p>  <p>  We are living through a housing crisis that has a real impact on access to third level education, especially for people living outside the cities and large towns.  Despite Ireland having the highest fees in the EU, accommodation is, for many families, the biggest financial barrier to getting students to third level education, particularly those from rural Ireland.  Students are often in low-paid, part-time work or rely on the support that their families can afford to give them.</p>  <p>  Students are treated differently by landlords, particularly those in purpose-built student accommodation, where they are often asked to pay a full semester's rent in advance.  We have to be cognisant of the financial situation of students themselves, who have not been able to get employment in the pandemic, and of their parents and siblings, who have lost employment.  In recent days, figures released by Social Justice Ireland show that a quarter of working families are living in poverty.  These are the same people who we have allowed to be robbed in the past year because they are paying upfront for something which, under law, they were prevented from using.</p>  <p>  Approximately 30,000 students live in privately provided, purpose-built student accommodation.  When the pandemic hit last March, it exposed the severe injustices students face in the rental market.  They were on the hook for accommodation they no longer needed and the vast majority never received refunds.  Since Fine Gael entered government, it has given &euro;87 million in tax breaks to the providers of purpose-built student accommodation.  Despite the huge amount of public money they have received, many of these landlords have refused to issue refunds.  I must, however, commend the landlords who issued refunds straight away.</p>  <p>  During the summer and after the experience of the first wave I and others repeatedly warned of the risks that would be faced by student renters if college moved online again.  Students were given the optimistic assessments and positive headlines when they needed the Government to be straightforward and realistic with them.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, said on 31 August that "students were treated a bit shabbily"when colleges closed their doors at the beginning of the pandemic.  I agreed with him in that regard.  He went on to say: "If ever ... there were further restrictions and colleges had to close, we need to make sure that all the students get refunded."  That was a month before it was announced that students would not be returning to campus.  In October, after colleges had moved online and reports of students again being denied refunds began flooding into all our offices, I asked the Minister how he would ensure that students received refunds.  The answer was that he had no powers directly available to him under the existing legal framework relating to private accommodation.  When I raised the issue with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the housing officer, I was simply told that the matter did not fall within the remit of the Department.</p>  <p>  I commend the USI and everybody who has worked on this Bill.  The Government should have introduced emergency legislation in this area in the first instance.  However, it is never too late to do the right thing.  Student renters were cast aside again.  They were the subject of too many promises and were left under-protected.  We can never allow that to happen again.  The aim behind the Bill is to ensure that students will not be left in the position I have outlined in the future.  If the Bill becomes law, a student will be able to end a tenancy in purpose-built student accommodation by serving the landlord with a notice of termination of 28 days and get a refund.</p> <p>We owe it to the students of Ireland and their families to right the wrong that has been done to them since the beginning of the pandemic.  If one of us went into a shop and paid between &euro;5,000 and &euro;9,000 for something, as these families have done, and were then ordered to leave the shop without getting what we paid for and were told we would never get our money back, we would not accept it.  Why should student renters be treated differently?  There is a real opportunity here for us to work collectively across the House to put this right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800006#D00200"><p>The legislation brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in this morning is very important and will deal with a significant problem that has caused hardship and stress for families in my constituency of Laois-Offaly and other rural counties from where people must travel.  Recent reports estimate that 3,019 students from County Laois and 2,984 from Offaly attend third level college.  Many of these students have to secure rental accommodation in Limerick, Galway and Dublin as there is no third level college in the constituency.  Traditionally, both counties have had lower than the State average level of attendance at third level, and this is important to note.</p>  <p>  Under current legislation, student accommodation is treated differently from all other rental accommodation, as landlords are permitted to charge students more than one month's rent in advance, often charging three or four months' rent or the whole term in one go.  This means students from counties such as Laois and Offaly who attend Galway have to pay an average of &euro;5,000 in one instalment and could be asked for up to &euro;9,000 if attending a college such as UCD in Dublin.  Some families may have more than one child attending college at the same time.  This is a huge outlay for many families, especially for those households who cannot access SUSI grants.  The Minister is familiar with such families.  These families are trying to pay mortgages, most are likely to have two cars on the road to access their work or to run their businesses, and they have other substantial outgoings.</p>  <p>  Many students paid their rent in lump sums prior to the Covid outbreak last year.  Some were never compensated when they returned to their parent's homes under national health guidelines.  I have dealt with many such people.  This is very unfair.  The Bill, supported by the Union of Students in Ireland, will give greater protection to student renters and ensure that in future refunds will be provided where accommodation is unusable due to public health restrictions.  It will prevent landlords from charging students more than one month's rent in advance and it will ensure student renters are treated in the same way as other renters.  This is important legislation that will provide students with more secure and fairer rental situations.  I commend all of the Deputies on the Opposition benches who have supported the Bill and I hope Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party will also back it.  I call on all Deputies to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800006#D00300"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  The fact it has garnered such support from a wide range of Opposition Deputies, 56 in total, shows just how vital the legislation is.  We know that rents continued to increase in the academic year 2019 to 2020 and into the 2020 to 2021 academic year, despite the pandemic exposing the unsustainable and twisted nature of accommodation inflation as rents in the capital rose by 0.3% over the pandemic period.  This also begs the question as to where this unresponsive upward spiral of growth is going to end.</p>  <p>  There is no invisible hand regulating supply and demand.  Rents continue to rise even amid a global pandemic.  In 2020, Ireland was the fifth most expensive country in Europe to rent a home.  This proves again the effect the pandemic has had on Irish families.  We know a battle ensued when students were told to go home, and prevented by law from using their accommodation.  A huge number of Clare students contacted my office at the time and I remember how distressed and confused they were.  They were not getting fair play.  These students and families were already struggling to meet rent demands for their accommodation and this lack of fairness compounded the issue.  Many have had to go to moneylenders just to get by.  We need to ensure this does not happen again.</p> <p>We need to ensure that student renters are given the same protection as other renters.</p> <p> This Bill is needed to protect the rights of students who have not been afforded their entitlements as tenants who have, as they say, been milked for all they have been worth for years.  This Bill, for example, will prevent landlords from charging one month's rent in advance.  I believe it is as good a time as any to re-evaluate the precarious rental situations of many students and take concrete actions towards rectifying the discrepancies in the supply of and making student accommodation accessible and affordable in the future.</p> <p> I call on all Deputies to support this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800007#E00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin, Ailbhe, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and all the team that contributed to this important legislation.</p>  <p>  This is a motion for grafters.  It is for workers.  It is for those who saved for years, paying their mortgage, USC and property tax, and who got nothing in return.  Some have been trying to give their child an opportunity that they did not get.</p>  <p>  People from all around Kerry, from Listowel, Rathmore and Cahirciveen, have been in touch with my party's office because when the lockdown happened, they had no lobby group or union to advocate for them.  They looked for help and none was forthcoming.  There was no rebate, no refunds, only reality for those.  They found that the system was stacked against them.  The odds were against them.  There was no tax incentives for them, but tax incentives for the builders who were allowed to loosen the construction standards and allow for co-living arrangements, and the colleges by and large were allowed to outsource accommodation.</p>  <p>  This Bill is why we are in Leinster House and in the convention centre today.  It is help for accommodation during academic term times.  It is to help with one month's notice and to refund relevant payments.  This is the type of legislation that we should all be associated with.</p>  <p>  So much for "We are all in this together".  These students, who cannot go abroad to college, could not enjoy the college experience and were left with nothing.  This is the type of legislation that I want to be associated with and I urge the Government Deputies to support it also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800007#E00300"><p>As a Deputy with Maynooth University in my constituency of north Kildare, I am very happy with what is being proposed here in this Private Members' Bill, PMB, from the USI.</p>  <p>  Maynooth University plays such a huge role in my local community and in providing educational life opportunities across the State.  Students in the State have paid a big price in their educational life, not to mention their social life, during this coronavirus pandemic.  They have also been unable to get part-time employment to help subsidise their living costs during Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Due to Government decisions and lack of decisions, lockdown became our sole defence against the virus.  This has not made it easier on the students in Maynooth and in every college across the State.  I have spoken to students in my home town of Maynooth who, on the promise of college attendance from the Government, found places to rent in the town yet did not attend a single lecture in the university throughout the year.  These students and their families forked out outrageous rents for accommodation they did not even need.  Many of them put themselves into debt.</p>  <p>  This Bill will protect them in three thorny areas: the payment of rent in advance, notice and refunds.  On rent in advance, it proposes a period of one month as opposed to a term or the full academic year which has been a massive burden on middle-income families who do not qualify for SUSI grants because of the half-baked assessment criteria.</p>  <p>  Notice to leave would also be set down as 28 days, and refunds on deposits would be guaranteed.  There has been untold worry and stress in families over the past year trying to get refunds on rents paid when students had to either come home early on account of Covid restrictions or not take up their place at all.</p>  <p>  With Covid, life has been difficult for all of us, but it has been very difficult on students.  People need protection when they are faced with this insecurity and it is the Government's duty to step up there.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to protecting students and their families and this Bill does exactly that.</p>  <p>  I commend my comrades, Deputy Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Broin, on working with the USI to bring forward this Bill and I call on everybody in the House to vote for it.</p></speech>

The Bill specifically includes safeguards relating to student rents and the protections that should apply to students.  I agree with previous speakers that lessons should be learned from the pandemic and that where additional protections are required, we should put them in place.  I thank USI in particular for its input into the preparation of this Bill.  As was mentioned earlier, this is the USI's Bill.  It is the union's work and its legislation.  I really welcome the engagement the USI has had with Opposition parties and the Government.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I have met USI representatives, as have Deputy McAuliffe and several Deputies opposite.  It is good to see that students can bring their issues forward, with proposed solutions.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the House that a working group comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will ensure that there is ongoing co-operation between the two Departments and that we will act in tandem as much as possible, particularly on the issue of student accommodation which is still an area of concern.</p>  <p>  The Bill before us is both helpful and timely, as is this morning's debate.  I am pleased to support pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned measures introduced last year by the previous Oireachtas, involving the co-operation of many on the housing committee including myself, Deputy &Oacute; Broin and the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, relating to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  We worked with the USI on those measures and I want to continue with that collaborative approach.</p>  <p>  The key objective of the Bill is to limit the amount of rent payable in advance by students, thus limiting their exposure to losing quite significant sums of money.  There are some elements in the Bill which we will need to work on.  In that context, I advise Deputies that my Department, in consultation with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, has been working on the general scheme of a housing and residential tenancies Bill that will provide similar protections across the entire residential rental sector, not just the student accommodation sector.  I will provide more detail on this later but I accept and recognise that this Private Member's Bill aims to help students in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Government Bill, which I expect to bring forward and enact this year, will help all tenants in the long term.  We need to ensure that we have long-term fixes and not just reactions to what has happened during the Covid pandemic.  I will work to ensure that the best aspects of the Bill before us are teased out and integrated into that legislation.</p>  <p>  As it stands, the Residential Tenancies Acts do not prescribe specific terms and conditions regarding the payment of rents, deposits or refunds for inclusion in individual letting arrangements in the private rental market, including the student-specific accommodation sector.  Contract law governs such arrangements and the specific terms associated with them and the obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the student and the landlord.  However, I am committed to working with all interested parties to see how we can strengthen this and provide clarity in those areas.  The Acts now provide that disputes relating to non-refunding of deposits and rent setting may be referred to the RTB, on foot of changes made in the last Oireachtas.  I intend to ensure that this continues to be the case.  Any further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act to govern specific terms and conditions regarding refunds payable on foot of Covid-19 under individual letting arrangements in the student-specific accommodation would need to be carefully considered.  That is why I welcome the opportunity for this Bill to go before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise Deputies that the general scheme of the housing and residential tenancies Bill that I intend to bring to Government for approval in the very near future includes proposals to restrict the amount of any upfront payments of rent and deposits across the entire private rental sector, not just the student accommodation sector.</p> <p>I want to go further than that by restricting the level of deposits across the sector.  That Bill is being worked on as I speak.</p> <p> To give Deputies some insight, subject to Government approval, the Bill will aim to provide that all tenants in the residential rental sector, including, but not limited to, students, would only be required to make an up-front payment on tenancy commencement that does not exceed an amount equivalent to one month's rent plus one month's deposit; thereafter, only one month&rsquo;s rent can be payable in advance; a landlord will be legally obliged to adhere to this practice; and non-compliance by a landlord with this obligation could be referred by a tenant for dispute resolution to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  I will be working through those provisions individually with the joint committee.</p> <p> The provision in the Government Bill for a maximum up-front payment would protect all tenants and counter discrimination, in particular for lower income groups.  That is what we want to do.  This debate and the Bill brought forward by the USI is timely.  I want to bring in some of the changes across the rental market, not just specifically to students.  I welcome the debate and look forward to the Bill going for legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

I also thank the Government for allowing this Bill to progress to pre-legislative scrutiny in order that we can examine some of the measures in it.  There may be legal questions with some of its provisions but the joint committee will examine these.  I also thank the Opposition for using its time to allow this Bill to be introduced.</p>  <p>  The Bill deals with student-specific accommodation and includes safeguards in relation to student rents and other protections.  It is billed as the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents and Other Protections) (Covid-19) Bill 2021.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I have engaged with the Union of Students in Ireland.  I thank the USI for dealing with each party as it has allowed us all to support the principles of the Bill and bring forward solutions.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 is not the only obstacle with regard to student accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I supported the protests by the students' union at Dublin City University about the Shanowen shakedown and we subsequently supported the amendments made by the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  That whole debacle highlighted the complex area of student accommodation. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to hear what the Minister has just said to the House.  I have not heard him outline so specifically the proposed general scheme of a Bill on tenants reforms.  I hope I did not misunderstand him but he appeared to inform the House that he intends to limit the up-front payments to which so many students are subjected.  I hope those reforms will be with us long after Covid-19 has gone so that students will benefit.</p>  <p>  The Minister outlined to the House that the Government would bring forward measures that students and all tenants will be protected from initial rent payments up front.  Students and tenants will welcome the news that up-front payments will be limited to one month's rent plus one month's deposit, and that, thereafter, monthly payments will be made one month in advance.  In addition, landlords will be legally obliged to adhere to that practice and sanctions of up to &euro;30,000 will apply to landlords who breach that requirement.  Students and tenants will welcome this commitment, particularly families who do not have access to large savings and have been discriminated in the market by being forced to compete with others who can pay three, four or five months' rent in advance.</p>  <p>  Students living in student-specific accommodation will welcome the Government's commitment but it will also benefit students outside student-specific accommodation.</p> <p>The Minister made previous commitments about the maximum termination notice period for students by which many are affected.  He has brought forward proposals to match the ambition of the USI's Bill.  I congratulate the USI.  This is a great example of the House working together to deliver a solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800010#H00200"><p>Students have suffered significantly during the pandemic.  Many of their families are now dependent on the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy payments.  Many are struggling not just financially but also due to the Covid-19 restrictions.  For the current student body, most of the traditional third level experience has been absent.  The experience of the current cohort of students is in videoconferencing and online lectures attended from their kitchen tables.  For the most legitimate of reasons relating to protecting public health, students have been asked to stay away from their college campuses.  They adhered to this advice and remained in their local communities, yet for many, the semester's accommodation is still expected to be paid for in full.  We have introduced this Bill because we believe that student renters deserve greater protections and so that students will receive refunds where accommodation is unusable due to health restrictions.  The aims of the Bill are simple and fair.  The ambition is to ensure that student renters are treated the same as other renters by ensuring that landlords cannot charge student renters more than one month's rent in advance.</p>  <p>  The University of Limerick is a superb institution that contributes greatly to the life and energy of Limerick city.  In normal times, it is wonderful for the city to be injected with an array of ethnicities and a collection of students from all 32 counties, with the accompanying GAA jerseys in the colours of those counties.  I look forward to the day when public health allows for the return of these students.  They have been sorely missed.</p>  <p>  When we look at the on-site accommodation fees that families are expected to pay, it is difficult to imagine how any family could send one child, let alone two, to a third level institution.  The cheapest accommodation that I found was for a single room with no en suite in an eight-bed house.  The total rent for an academic year came to over &euro;4,000.  Aside from application fees, the rent has to be paid in three instalments over the academic year.  Accompanying this price is an ominous warning which reads, "Should you make an application for a full year place with us and cancel mid-way through your stay, you will lose your full deposit, be liable for the full year rent and will be unable to apply for accommodation with us in the future."  While the university issued refunds, it was extremely disappointing that they were sometimes firmly resisted before relenting.</p>  <p>  I also looked at some of the off-campus accommodation options where the fees are higher and which still require a full year's payment, with a four-instalment plan available.  This locks students in and gives them no opportunity of choice.  This is a tremendous amount for many middle-income plans, especially for those with more than one child in education.  For many of those families, a series of thresholds make them ineligible.  The Bill is supported by 56 Deputies.  I encourage all Deputies to support it and the USI too.</p></speech>

I also welcome the initial response from the Minister.  I live in Dublin West, as the Minister knows.  It is a community which, like his in north County Dublin, has a substantial youth population and a diverse population.  We have thousands of students who attend college and who travel the length and breadth of the State.  Every year, when students get the word that they have got their places in college, it soon turns into a time of stress and worry if they have to live away from home.  I have had three children in college.  They were lucky enough to be able to live at home and not have the worry and stress of having to find money, including money for accommodation.  I do not know how parents do it.</p>  <p>  As described by previous speakers, students are paying thousands of euro upfront, along with other substantial costs that can put college out of reach for many working families.  Many of those working families do not qualify for SUSI or for any grants or supports whatsoever.  It is extremely difficult for them to send their children to college.  This Bill would prevent providers of student accommodation from charging one month's rent in advance.  This would be a significant help to students and their families.  We must learn the lessons of the pandemic and address the concerns raised by the USI about students and their parents not being able to access refunds when they had to leave or could not take up student accommodation.</p>  <p>  The people of this country were asked by the Government to adhere to strict guidelines and the provisions of the relevant legislation.  They did that, and many thousands of students did not take up accommodation that had already been paid for.  What did they get for that support for the Covid-19 regulations?  They were denied rent refunds for unused accommodation by many landlords.</p> <p>Let us support them now and agree that this Bill allows for prompt refunds in such instances.  This Bill would also enable a student to end a tenancy in student-specific accommodation by serving the landlord with a 28-day notice of termination.  This is a reasonable request and a reasonable Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="10:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800011#J00200"><p>There is a myth in this country, namely, that there is free access to education and that anyone can go to third level education, get a degree and even, apparently, get a well-paid job.  All of that, unfortunately, is simply a myth.  The issue much of the time is that universities rely on financing from students, whether international or EU, to fund their activities because they are not adequately funded by the State.  If students do make it to university, no student should be seen as a cash cow.  However, there are many financial barriers to third level education.  Without even going into the detail of such aspects as the student contribution that students must pay, there is the simple basic fact that rents are simply out of reach for most ordinary students.  That is especially the case in Galway city, where I am from, where we have the second highest rents in the State.</p>  <p>  What I really like about this Bill is that it is specific about students' needs.  It looks at those challenges faced by students, and specifically those students in purpose-built student accommodation.  The strength of this Bill is that it has come from the students themselves, from their experiences and from their union.  I remember very clearly that last September students were told to act like everything was normal and to put the deposit down on their student accommodation.  In that same week, however, they were then told that all the university lectures would be online.  The resulting situation was one where many students had already put down their deposits, and they did not see those deposits again.  The students' union in Galway city dealt with 30 different refusals of a return of deposits in respect of one student accommodation provider because it was simply left up to the landlord.  </p>  <p>  Even this morning, I spoke to one student who has been waiting for seven months to get her deposit back.  She has basically given up.  This Bill, however, would legislate for that type of situation.  It would also mean that students could give 28 days' notice in respect of purpose-built student accommodation, and that is important because we all know life does not always work out the way we planned.  Some of this student accommodation costs approximately &euro;7,000 a year and therefore this is an important issue.  I am glad everyone will be supporting this Bill and it is important it is enacted.</p></speech>

Like him, many people from Belfast settled in Dundalk due to the conflict and they played a significant role in republican and community activism.  My thoughts are with Marion and his family and I thought I needed to make mention of it.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Conway-Walsh and the USI on dealing with an issue that concerns giving protection to students.  We have already heard it mentioned frequently here that students, because of the pandemic, found themselves in a difficult situation regarding huge deposits and being unable to get their money back.  This Bill will provide protections regarding a decent time to present notice.  It will ensure protection regarding refunds and mean we will not have the awful scenario of people having to put a deposit of three, six or nine months' rent money together to give to a landlord to ensure they have accommodation to enable them to attend college.</p>  <p>  There are already many obstacles in respect of who can access SUSI grants and many other things that happened long before that issue.  Many interventions are needed from the State to rectify all these issues.  However, this is a simple Bill and I welcome the support of the Government for it and for the tenants concerned.  We just need to ensure that this happens.  </p>  <p>  In my town of Dundalk, we are delighted we have Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKiT .  We must, however, deal with the overall housing crisis.  People who work in companies such as PayPal can bunch together.  We are talking then about people who can avail of the housing assistance payment, HAP, those who cannot and students all fighting for a limited amount of rental accommodation and all paying high rents.  We are talking about rents of &euro;1,000, &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400. </p> <p>I have spoken to the Minister about that previously.  We must deal with the entire issue.  We must deal with the issues that Louth County Council is facing in respect of land banks.  I welcome the support in dealing with the issue in respect of students but we must deliver on the housing crisis across the board.</p></speech>

We also thank Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Conway-Walsh for putting Second Stage of the Bill on the cl&aacute;r.</p>  <p>  It is most welcome to hear the Minister indicate the Bill will pass to Committee Stage.  There is cross-party consensus that it is something that needs to be done.  We have known for years that students have been absolutely rinsed in terms of rent.  However, what the pandemic has brought to the fore is that they have continued to be rinsed by paying rent for accommodation without having the use of it.  It has been incredible.  Unfortunately, it took this unique global event and circumstance to get the legislative impetus behind this Bill.  It looks like it is going in the right direction.  </p>  <p>  Our hope is that it will get to Committee Stage and pass that Stage soon so that it can become law.  I welcome what the Minister said in respect of implementing the best parts of the Bill.  In advance of Committee Stage, I would be interested in hearing the Minister's thoughts on what are the worst or weak parts of the Bill, so that we can be prepared for the Committee Stage debate and can ensure the Bill passes in a form that most closely resembles its current form.</p>  <p>  This is a good Bill and one that should be impossible to block, given how much sense it makes and how much it will help people who need it.  It should give us a moment to view how we, as a society, have viewed students.  One of the previous speakers from Sinn F&eacute;in - I think it was Deputy Farrell and apologies if it was not - used the term "cash cows".  Non-EU students, including American students coming to Ireland to do master's degrees, are viewed as cash cows.  However, students availing of student accommodation, the very basics of shelter, in order to pursue their studies are also viewed as cash cows.  That is wrong.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  We must view students for what they are - an investment in our future and the progression of our country and nation - and stop viewing them with euro signs over their heads.</p>  <p>  We have seen a proliferation of purpose-built student accommodation crop up in our major cities.  Why is that the case?  It is because it has been very profitable for either universities, large funds or wealthy investors to create this purpose-built student accommodation.  It is not for ease of access for students or to lower barriers to access third level education but to make money, and a lot of it.  </p>  <p>  One of the more egregious corners of our economy is how we are rinsing so many different elements of society for rent.  We pride ourselves as a nation in saying that everyone will have access to education, the ceiling is high, the sky is the limit and young people can do whatever they want but that is not the case.  The barrier still exists.  Sometimes the barrier to third level education is generational in nature, access has not existed in a family or individuals in a community who go to third level are outliers rather than the norm.  That must be changed in terms of how we promote third level in secondary schools and how we make it easier to access it in terms of understanding what needs to be done.  For many people, the barrier to access is financial and economic in nature.  For some people, it means they cannot pursue what they want to pursue because the course they want to do may be in a third level institution that is outside of the city in which they live.  In Dublin, many students will have an advantage in that they may be able to live at home.</p> <p>However, many people cannot afford to move to Dublin.  Likewise, many people who live in Dublin want to go to Cork or elsewhere to study.  Some want to attend agricultural college, for example, or simply want a different experience, but they cannot afford it.  This Bill tackles that issue and it needs to pass through Committee Stage as soon as possible.</p> <p> I welcome the soundings we are hearing so far.  We are proud, as a party, to support the Bill.  Students need proper, affordable education and there must be an easy pathway to access it.  We cannot have a situation where students end up financially crippled as a result of pursuing education.  Whatever the qualification, whether it is obtained at university, a further education institution or in a trade, once people obtain it, they are ready to contribute to society and build their lives and communities.  They must not be left crippled with debt, whether from the cost of accommodation, fees or anything else associated with getting that qualification.  We need to invest in our young people and support them.  We must ensure that the ceiling on what they can do is raised as high as possible but the hurdles they have to jump are not so high that they cannot get over them.</p> <p> Going back to my original point, for too long there has been an explaining away of the hardships of securing accommodation and going to college or university as some kind of rite of passage.  That is a load of absolute rubbish.  Getting affordable shelter above their heads in order that students can live and study in comfort is not a rite of passage.  It is a right, and we need to support it.  This Bill supports that right and I hope it will go through the Houses as soon as possible.</p></speech>

If it continues at the same pace, we will be in a situation where most of the students who were penalised last year for complying with public health measures will be in difficulty again.  I see the Minister is leaving the Chamber as I am making this important point.  The students will have left college by the time this issue is dealt with by the Government.

It is only fair to the USI, which has worked on these proposals, to let it know what is planned.

I thank him for that and I appreciate that these issues will be discussed on Committee Stage.  However, it would be useful to have his explicit view on the question I raised in order that we know where we stand.  I thank the Minister for being willing to engage on that point.</p>  <p>  The essence of these proposals is that students and their families were penalised last year for following public heath measures.</p> <p>This should have been dealt with as a matter of urgency at the time rather than it being left to students and their families having to lobby and, in most cases, to achieve improvements.  We were dealing with other matters quickly via legislation and there should have been leadership from the Government at that point.</p> <p> Other Deputies made the point that charging in advance is a major burden on families and is very unfair.  That practice needs to go.  The essence of this is that students and their families should not be treated differently from other tenants or renters, as this is deeply unfair.  We know that many people have had a very tough year and that students have had a particularly tough year.  Most of them have been studying from bedrooms and it is very difficult that this amounts to their participation in college life.</p> <p> This legislation must be seen in terms of wider reforms that are required to protect the rights of renters.  I welcome the Minister's comments that he will do the latter.  Renters in Ireland have faced some of the highest levels of rent increases in the European Union over the past number of years, with rents increasing in Ireland by over 40% over the past 13 years.  That is double the European average.  In the capital city, Dublin, rents for apartments are more expensive than any other capital city in the European Union.  That has happened over the past number of years under the watch of Fine Gael, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, and the current Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael coalition Government.</p> <p> Part of the problem is State payments to private landlords to support low-income renters in insecure tenancies.  Those payments are fast approaching the &euro;1 billion mark.  It is fine if the Minister is anxious to leave because I do not wish to delay him.</p></speech>

Rents are not being recorded properly and this should be addressed in the legislation that the Minister mentioned.  This has implications not just on rent pressure zones and undermining the 4% increase protections but also for the State in the context of long-term leases.  As the Minister knows, such long-term leases are being signed on the basis of market rents.  I know from documents released to me under the freedom of information process that those market rents, in some cases, were not subject to independent valuations.  That matter must be tackled.</p>  <p>  What has happened with housing or the renting process for students is part of a wider problem of housing and renting being turned into a financial commodity in this country.  We have seen that through the privatisation of emergency accommodation for people who have lost their homes and with the long-term leasing of social housing.  We see reports this morning of investment portfolios being advertised to investors based on the guaranteed 25-year long-term leases that the State is signing.  Apartments are being bought up en masse by investment funds, which is driving up rents and the cost of housing, including for students.  We also see the favourable tax treatment for these investment funds, poor regulation and high rents that are being propped up because when investment funds are not able to fill empty units and do not want to lower rents, they sign a long-term lease with the State.  We have seen subsidies for developers through the shared equity scheme that the Government is seeking to introduce.</p>  <p>  We need a referendum on the right to housing and, specifically, on the wording in that regard to be agreed by the Government so we can move forward with it.  We need to remove most grounds for evictions, as we have seen in most other northern European countries.  We must remove the possibility of people being evicted into homelessness, which will require a multipronged approach.</p>  <p>  I met student representatives, including those from Aontas na Mac L&eacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn, the Union of Students in Ireland, earlier this year and was absolutely horrified by some of the real-life experiences and stories from some of the students who had been renting, including how they had been treated, been dehumanised and been exploited.</p> <p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It behoves all Members of the House to prevent that type of exploitation of students, who are often at a vulnerable stage in their development.  It might be the first time students have moved out of home and it can be a daunting experience to come to college as a first year.  Then one hears about some of the terrible treatment and the trauma and anguish caused to young students who are heavily exploited and treated in a terrible way because there are insufficient protections in place for them.  They are put under mental health stress during what should have been a very positive time in their lives.  That should remind all Members that it is important to have this issue urgently addressed.</p></speech>

Most importantly, I commend and congratulate the USI on what already appears to be a successful campaign of people power.  That should be said.  As a result of its campaigning on this issue, it appears that it has forced the Government to respond, somewhat belatedly, in respect of an issue that has been raised from the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Indeed, the issue of the lack of proper rights for student tenants predates the Covid crisis, but it has been particularly highlighted during it.  An absolute minimum requirement to support our students is that they should be extended the same rights as other renters or tenants, although it should be said that the rights of renters and tenants who are not students are also completely inadequate.  However, at a minimum students should not have to pay more than a month in advance and one month's deposit, and they should be able to get refunds where they are unable to take up accommodation because of Covid-19.  The fact that the Government is allowing this Bill to progress to Committee Stage and that it is also talking about a Bill of its own to cover the same issues is a victory for people power.  I hope students understand that.  It is campaigning and people power on the part of students that is forcing change.  They deserve the biggest credit.</p>  <p>  This Bill touches on just one of a large number of barriers.  I should say that barriers continue to be erected.  It is not just that they are not being dismantled, in many ways barriers are continuously erected against students, particularly working-class students and those from lower-income families, to be able to access third level, higher, further and postgraduate education.  Students are caught up in the disaster of the housing crisis and extortionate rents.  The situation is being exploited by investment funds in the context of shockingly extortionate, so-called purpose-built student accommodation and by universities that are increasingly acting more like big business than places of education to support students getting through their education and fulfilling their potential.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  We must control the price of student accommodation.  We need purpose-built, public student accommodation with affordable rents in order that students can afford to study in comfort and that they and their families will not be not put under massive financial pressure, a pressure that is added to by the disgrace of the student contribution fee, which is one of the highest in Europe.  Then there is the total inadequacy of grants, for those who can get them, in terms of finding accommodation.</p> <p>I highlighted this issue recently.  I will use this opportunity to raise it again because another aspect of the story emerged this week .  This is just one instance in terms of postgraduate education whereby psychologists, who face huge fees of &euro;7,000 to &euro;15,000, must work on placement for free and are then somehow expected to pay the rent.   How are they supposed to pay these rents?</p> <p> To add insult to injury, however, this week, the HSE advertised assistant psychology posts, with a full range of duties at 20 hours per week, for people who are mostly trying to get on to doctorates of psychology, where they would work for the HSE for free.  They would deal with clients and GPs, write reviews, deal with the literature and do all the work of psychologists while working for free.  How are they supposed to pay the rent?  It is absolutely unbelievable.  The head of the HSE is getting in the region of &euro;400,000.  A massive pay increase is being talked about in respect of the Department of Health and yet student psychologists are being asked to work for free for the HSE.  It is unbelievable.</p></speech>

Some students have been hit with a bill of &euro;9,000, in UCD for example, before they even buy a book.  Then, with lockdown last year, many of those students have been completely unable to make use of their accommodation.  They ask for a refund and their landlord tells them take a hike.  This is a rip-off of students and their families, pure and simple.</p>  <p>  We need to pass this Bill and progress it is as rapidly as possible through Committee Stage, without any messing around by the Government, to protect the interests of students.  One month's rent in advance should be more than enough.</p>  <p>  This Bill would also provide those who have been ripped off with a chance to get the refunds they so desperately need.  It is a real issue right across the country, including for students in the Tallaght campus of Technological University, TU, Dublin.  They are straightforward reforms to give renters a break and stand up to the corporate landlords who dominate so much of the student accommodation sector.</p>  <p>  We need to fundamentally transform third level education in this country to remove all these barriers, including the astronomically high costs of accommodation, to provide genuinely free education.  We need to scrap all forms of fees and provide a proper living grant for all students to cover the cost of education and make it accessible for all.  It also needs to be linked into a general campaign to transform rental conditions, that is, proper rent controls and investment in quality public housing and genuinely affordable housing. </p></speech>

The idea is that if a student cannot take up the place he or she has rented for public health reasons, whether he or she is ill, has to isolate or is unable to travel, the rents and related charges should be returned.  The vast majority of people would say that is basic common sense.  It is, however, a common sense with which the corporate landlords have not agreed over the space of the past year and more.</p>  <p>  Last year, in Cork, for example, the Uninest facility on Western Road, which is used by many University College Cork, UCC, students and which charges them an arm and a leg for accommodation - &euro;9,000 worth - initially refused to give back the moneys that had been paid by students who were unable to take up their accommodation because of the pandemic.  I congratulate the students' union, the students who protested and the campaign which forced a change on this particular issue.</p> <p>While the corporate landlord in this case was forced to step back, still to this day, it has the legal right to do exactly what it did last year.  These are completely unfair, unjust and extortionate policies.  This Bill is about removing that right and, of course, it should be.</p> <p> I also add my congratulations to the Union of Students in Ireland.  It cannot trust the Government on this issue, however.  How many Bills have we seen which the Government, for PR reasons, backed away from on Second Stage and then buried in committees?  The pressure must be kept on Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, which to its shame has been slow on this issue.</p> <p> We need to scrap fees, introduce a decent living grant and for students to be able to afford rents which must also be reasonable.  That is another whole debate which we will have here again sometime.</p></speech>

While many have highlighted this issue today, 12 months ago, during the first lockdown, I was pressing this issue.  It was not just the private providers who were involved.  The University of Limerick refused to give students back their funds for its own campus accommodation.  Many landlords, including the University of Limerick at the time, turned their backs on students who had paid substantial deposits and upfront payments for accommodation.</p>  <p>  Sadly, this was replicated during the back end of last year and into this year.  These students have been told they are not getting their money back, even though they cannot utilise the accommodation, either on or off campus, because of the Covid-19 restrictions in place.  I have pointed out on several occasions that the commercial private accommodation providers are not only availing of financial supports from the taxpayer but also tax incentives for much of this accommodation.  These incentives need to be withdrawn forthwith from those providers unwilling to assist students.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, told me that, while he has urged private accommodation providers to be flexible in finding solutions, given the particular circumstances as a result of Covid-19, he has no specific powers in this area.  Many of these accommodation providers acquired lands under licence or on the cheap from public bodies.  Approximately 200 of them are in receipt of tax refunds at present.</p>  <p>  When I questioned the Minister for Finance on this specific issue last July, he said he could not do anything regarding tax reliefs introduced previously.  In the past 12 months, however, we have brought in emergency legislation that has restricted the liberty of every single citizen because of the health emergency with which we are dealing.  If we can restrict the movement of individuals across the country because of a health emergency, we can also revise these tax incentives where landlords are not prepared to refund to students the substantial deposits which they have received from them to date.</p>  <p>  On top of that, many of these commercial landlords are receiving the pandemic unemployment payment or their employees are availing of it.  They are also availing of the wage subsidy schemes, rate relief schemes and other incentives.  It is immoral that, on the one hand, these private providers ignore the genuine calls from students who cannot avail of accommodation while, on the other, they avail of the State incentives in place.  Under emergency provisions, the Government can deal with this issue.  It needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  All third level institutions should provide clarity to students as to how their courses will be delivered from next September.  Will they be delivered on a blended basis?  If so, will it be possible for students to access these courses remotely in order that they do not need to pay substantial deposits now to secure accommodation?  The universities and third level institutions can provide the clarity now rather than waiting into the future.</p>  <p>  Part of the registration fee, which every single third level institution collects from students, goes towards sporting and recreational, as well as health, facilities.  That element of the registration fee should be refunded immediately.  There should also be a reduction in these fees in light of the fact that students are accessing education online.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Naughten, raised the important issue of private landlords refusing to refund rents to students who were forced to attend colleges by means of an online course and, therefore, did not require accommodation.  It is not right that these landlords, many of which avail of the Government's support schemes during this current pandemic, refuse to refund rent deposits to students.  This is happening in every part of country and I have dealt with several of these cases in Dundalk.  Even third level colleges and universities have tried to do the same.  The Government needs to look at this issue.  As my colleagues have suggested, those who avail of the Government's support schemes while refusing to refund students must repay any supports they receive.</p>  <p>  I run a constituency office in Dundalk which is pretty busy, the same as that of every other Deputy.  For the past ten years, successive Governments have failed to address the housing situation.  It is time we all worked together and put all party-political considerations behind us to tackle the housing crisis.  I find it annoying I have people attending my constituency office who cannot get a council house.  In Dundalk, a two-bedroom house in a council estate is currently for rent for &euro;1,400 a month.  The council sold this house several years ago to a landlord who is now charging this rent.  What chance has a normal family to afford a house?  If a family got a mortgage from a bank, they would pay between &euro;800 and &euro;900 a month, which is affordable.  This does not make any sense.</p>  <p>  Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, is looking for technological university status.  Up to 5,000 students attend DkIT from the surrounding counties, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  However, 80% of their parents never got an opportunity to attend third level education.  With SUSI and other grants, their children now have an opportunity to make something of themselves.</p>  <p>  I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for several years now.  There are 100 vacant local authority houses in Dundalk.  It makes no sense whatsoever that they should be vacant.  The local authority blames the Government, claiming it will not give it the funding to restore these houses.  Many people attend my constituency office on Mondays and Fridays who are willing, along with their friends and families, to get these houses up and running.  I know many people who bought their own house and gave up their council house or cases where the local authority tenant passed away.  These council houses could be vacant for between 12 to 18 months at a minimum, falling into disrepair with the radiators, for example, stolen, with burst pipes and so on.  It makes no commonsense whatsoever.</p> <p>All we need is someone to grab the Government, the local authorities and others by the scruff of their necks and make simple solutions.  People need houses and people need homes.  That is all they want. Children come to me with their parents and all they ask is for me to get them a home.  It makes no sense whatsoever as if you walk down the main streets of Dundalk, you can see the large number of shops that have vacant facilities above them.</p> <p> As for us not having enough money, we have had a very hard time in this country over the past 12 months.  Despite this, we were able to find not millions but billions to help us to get back up on our feet again.  All people want is to get an education and I ask the Government to help them get an education.  People want a roof over their heads and I ask the Government to put a roof over their heads.  People want a health system where they can still get treatment even if they have not got money or health insurance.  These things are simple facts.  It is about time all the parties in this House got together and all voted together for the good of people in Ireland.  Let us give people an education.  Let us give them their health.  Most of all, please let us give families an opportunity to have a roof over their heads.</p></speech>

It is very important that what happened last year - and each and every one of us remembers what happened last September - does not happen this year.  The colleges were supposed to open and it was bad foresight by the Government, though I am not blaming any one Minister, that one week after the colleges were supposed to open, it was decided they were not opening at all.  Many parents from all around the country had paid for their children's accommodation and the students themselves had helped to pay the costs as well.  It was frightening to think, as Deputy Naughten mentioned, that the University of Limerick would not give back the fees to many of its students.  That was wrong.  It was wrong also of private landlords to hold on to the money when students were not using the accommodation.  I sympathise with landlords who were themselves in financial difficulty with the banks and so forth but those who were not should have given the students back their money, as the students were not using the accommodation.</p>  <p>  It affected students in rural areas more than those in cities.  Students in County Kerry must travel to Tralee or to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin.  It is a very worrying time for parents who seek to have accommodation in place for their children, to have a safe and proper place for them as for many students, it is their first time away from home.  It is a very trying time for parents and students struggling to get going.</p></speech>

Our students and younger generation have suffered greatly during Covid-19.  The pandemic has exposed the severe economic injustice students face in the rental market.  Thousands of students and their families have been forced to pay for accommodation they were prohibited from using.  It is no longer acceptable for the Government to act as a spectator while wholesale financial exploitation of students continues.  The speedy and successful passing of legislation is vital to ensure students of third level institutions are protected.  It is incumbent on all Oireachtas Members to right the wrong which has facilitated the fleecing of students and their families when it comes to student accommodation.  Many students in west County Cork are, together with their families, under this kind of stress and I am being contacted about it on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has said he does not have the tools to do anything.  Its sponsors believe this Bill provides the Minister with the necessary tools and now it is up to him.  Emergency measures must be put in place to allow students to rent with some degree of confidence in light of the uncertainties still remaining ahead of the new academic year.  According to the USI, students should, at the very least, be allowed partial refunds for university and college accommodation because they are not spending as much time there due to the pandemic.  Students and their parents should not be financially penalised for following Government guidelines.  A Government support scheme to refund returns of rent for students may also be needed, as some landlords' properties may have been taken over by the banks.  Some students feel they should not be paying for accommodation when they are not there.  Many students renting student accommodation currently pay a term in advance.  This usually runs from September to May and can cost from &euro;5,000 on average in Galway to &euro;9,000 on average at UCD.  Students and their parents paying for this accommodation are generally from outside Dublin and Cork and are from rural counties with no universities.  In many cases parents are paying costs for more than one student at a time.</p></speech>

I first thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this very important legislation.  If a person goes into a shop to buy goods, he or she will not pay for them unless they receive the goods and leave the shop with them.  We had a situation where students did not avail of accommodation yet at the same time, they, their parents, grandparents or families paid for that accommodation and never got a refund.  That is fundamentally wrong.  I very much respect the people who provide accommodation and who have mortgages and all that to pay.  However, at the end of the day it is inherently wrong for a person to pay for accommodation he or she did not use or avail of.  That is the point I wanted to make.  I support the Bill.</p></speech>

I must declare an interest as I have a dalta &oacute;g, a first year who has passed and flew through it.  The money was taken from people of a Friday evening but what happened that very night or the morning after was really selfish and degrading.  Many students and their families struggle to make this money and the costs are not cheap.  They put it together but then, that weekend, they were told there would be no on-campus tuition and they would be working from home.  It is a real three-card trick.  We were all told we were in this together and at that time, I thought we were.  I understand the expense for the people who provide accommodation as well, many of whom did stump up and helped out as best they could with refunds.  However, some of them resolutely refused and it was downright blackguarding, downright wrong and we should have legislation to deal with it because we were depending on people's goodwill and us all being in it together but it did not happen.</p>  <p>  Students have had enough trauma and first year students especially had gone through a traumatic year with the leaving certificate and with a new system of examination and everything else.  This affected all students from first year upwards and those in continuing education.  Therefore we must have some kind of legislation.  Families are asking and pleading for it.  They have been put to the pin of their collar.  Many of them are out of work themselves, are depending on the PUP, have mortgages to pay, you name it.  We all know the different stresses there can be in households.  They vary but they are difficult and it is not easy.  We must have legislation because the colleges and insurance providers must do more in this regard and must try to help the families of the students because the students' focus should solely be on furthering their careers.  They should be able to fully invest themselves in that and not be worried about issues at home and at the dinner table.  This is a hard and difficult time for everybody.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great work of parliamentary colleagues who have brought it forward.  I acknowledge also the USI, which I understand to have played a significant role in shaping the Bill.  I support the basic thrust of the Bill, namely, that students who are unable to access rental accommodation because of Covid restrictions should be able to access reimbursement of paid rent without undue burdens being placed upon them.  There is a lot of talk about the barriers for students and the barriers for those who wish to progress to third level.</p> <p>Students were treated unfairly by many landlords and property management agencies that refused to refund their deposits.  This was a major issue of concern last summer.<br/><br/>We all accept that this exploitation has been be going on since last year.  Almost one year ago to the day, on behalf of students in Laois-Offaly, I engaged with the then Minister of State with responsibility for higher education and former Deputy, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to secure quicker refund levels for third level students who had paid for on-campus accommodation they could no longer use.  Ms Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor had stated publicly that the Government would wish to see <i>pro rata</i>refunds issued to students in privately owned accommodation.  As I said at the time, while the response from the then Minister of State was an acknowledgement of the problems that students were facing, it did not go far enough.<br/><br/>This Bill goes some way towards ensuring that the right to a refund is established.  It has always been my view that consideration was going to have to be made in respect of introducing a statutory obligation directed at private or on-campus accommodation companies which refuse to engage with students.  Students face average costs of between &euro;700 and &euro;790 per month for campus accommodation in Dublin, Cork and Maynooth according to the latest data we have from <i>daft.ie</i>.  That is an enormous sum of money for students and their families to be down, especially when they have paid in advance.  Action needs to be taken.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who also drove matters in the context of the drafting of this Bill.  I was happy to sign the Bill on behalf of the Independent Group.  I am speaking in support of the Bill, which I hope will get support from all sides of the House.  I hope we can bring it through to Committee Stage as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  This is a straightforward issue.  The situation is that students paid their college fees and arranged and paid for accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other towns and cities.  They then found themselves limited to online courses and were effectively barred from their college campuses due to Covid restrictions.  They should be entitled to have their deposits and any rent paid refunded.  This Bill will enable them to receive refunds.  There is also a strong case for at least a partial refund of fees.  These issues are dealt with in sections 1 to 7 of the Bill.  Sections 8 and 9 are important in giving students who are in dispute with their landlords the right to refer the issues to the RTB.  Beyond the issue dealt with in the Bill, there are other important changes which need to be made to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, such as giving students in digs the right to appeal to the RTB.</p>  <p>  I also want to make some points on private, purpose-built student accommodation in the south inner city, a large part of which I represent in the constituency of Dublin South-Central.  There are 15 of these student specific developments under way in the area.  Some will have their own gyms and cinemas and rents will range up to &euro;2,000 per month.  This is way beyond the means of the average student and his or her family.  The south inner city needs urgent regeneration, as does the north inner city.  There are a large amount of derelict buildings and the area suffers from a general air of neglect.  Jobs, public housing and facilities for the community are needed.  We are getting private student accommodation for the well off and hotels for tourists.  Not many young people from the inner city will be able to get college degreed and they certainly will not be studying medicine in light of the huge fees involved.</p>  <p>  The higher education system in Ireland is skewed against young working-class people.  Fees should be abolished and every young person should have a choice of a college placement or an apprenticeship.  The Government should support this Bill wholeheartedly, get it through Committee Stage and have it enacted.</p></speech>

It is a great example of the left working together with civil society groups on an important housing issue.  The Bill, tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, was developed in conjunction with the USI.  As awful as the Covid-19 pandemic has been, in some ways it has brought opportunity and we should ensure we make positive societal and policy changes when we can.</p><p>One would be forgiven for thinking that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was still in his previous role as Minister for Health.  I feel like we hear more from him on Covid-19 issues than on the myriad issues affecting tens of thousands of third level students, although he may also be off making TikTok videos and getting the T&aacute;naiste to make cameo appearances.  That seems exactly like what our third level students need.  Maybe the Minister will be releasing songs in an indie style, trying to get Michael Fry to duet with him.</p><p>The website<i>www.citizensinformation.ie</i>contains the following information in the section on third level students and Covid for those who are renting:</p> <blockquote> 	You are expected to pay rent during the emergency period.  Any rent arrears built up will be payable, but landlords have been asked to show understanding and reach local arrangements in these circumstances. </blockquote>  <p>Ah yes, because landlords have been notoriously understanding, empathetic and generous when it comes to issues in the rental market.  The recently published European Universities Association&rsquo;s public funding observatory report looked into 32 higher education systems over the past 15 years or so.  The report indicates that there were 155,000 students in Irish universities in 2008, with a budget of &euro;1.5 billion and 19,300 full-time staff.  By 2020, the number of staff had not changed and the budget had been reduced to &euro;1.4 billion but there had been a 37% increase in the number of students to 213,000.  Students have been penalised by the inadequacy of Government action and the lack of planning and decisiveness on the part of many third level institutions.  Students have to be on-site for lectures, find a room to rent or move only to find out that their lectures will be remote.  For many more rural areas, this has been a positive, as long as there is an adequate broadband connection to enable students to partake in online learning.  It means that smaller towns and villages have not haemorrhaged as many young people as usual.</p><p>On students living at home and studying close by or moving away and renting.  It all comes down to choice and access.  According to the statistics available on the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s website, students in the 2018 and 2019 term from Donegal were most likely to attend UCD, Dublin City University or Trinity College Dublin.  Only 2.6% are recorded as attending Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT.  However, when one compares that with those ranked as being in disadvantaged areas according to the deprivation index, it rises to 6.9% of students attending LYIT and 20.7% attending National University of Ireland Galway.  In 2018, just 1,450 students graduated from LYIT, 57% of whom were female and 43% of whom were male.  The majority of those students were studying business, administration and law, with the second most popular area of study being health and welfare.  Those are interesting statistics about deprivation and the access students have.</p><p>The Bill before us relates to rental obligations and notice periods and will provide for certain landlords to refund payments, if necessary, relating to Covid-19.  The Bill amends a number of sections of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  It inserts a new section 13A and a new section 17A.  It amends section 23 and inserts a new section 23A.  It also amends sections 60, 66, 75, 78 and 115.  It is a detailed and comprehensive Bill and would make a real difference to those covered by its terms and provisions.</p><p>It is more than one year since Covid hit and we introduced a range of protections for residents throughout the country.  Rents were frozen and evictions were banned while people were being asked to stay home and stay safe.  Some protections were introduced in March and then in October 2020, and another eviction ban was introduced for any time when we were to be restricted to travelling 5 km from home due to Covid-19 restrictions.  This also allowed for a ten-day grace period after 12 April 2021.  Rental laws were introduced to protect tenants who may have been economically affected by Covid-19 and fallen into rent arrears.  The rent freeze and a 90-day notice period for ending a tenancy will be in place until 12 July 2021 but none of this applies to students.</p><p>A conversation has been taking place since the beginning of the pandemic with regard to how students and student accommodation should be treated.  Many students have licence agreements, in-house shares or rent-a-room options and therefore do not benefit from the full suite of tenancy protections, or any in some cases.</p> <p>This is why I co-signed this Bill, why I am happy to support it and why I urge the Government to accept it.  Students have endured serious upheaval and confusion owing to inaction and indecision on the part of the Government and institutions alike.  They should not be out of pocket for it too.  It should not all be to benefit the private sector.</p></speech>

He will also know the biggest issue facing students is Covid-19, so he will excuse me for continuing to speak about it.  If we get the next few days, weeks and months right, we will begin to address and rectify so many of the difficult and horrific challenges young people in this country have faced.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and all of the Deputies who signed the Bill for their honest attempt to address the very difficult circumstances that many students have found themselves in as a result of this pandemic.  I am very pleased that the Government is in a position to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and move to pre-legislative scrutiny.  I note that this has been welcomed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others.</p>  <p>  I welcome the intent behind the legislation.  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage outlined, on behalf of his Department and the Government, outlined our approach to this matter and our commitment to incorporate the matters raised by the USI in the forthcoming residential tenancies legislation.  It is very important that the Bill advances on its journey through the Oireachtas.  As the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, I particularly thank the USI for the work it put into the legislation and the detailed consideration it gave to a range of issues on specific protections required in legislation for students.  I stand with them and by them on this.  I also thank the USI for more than this, because what the legislation has done is allow us to kick-start or restart an urgent conversation that must take place and that must be followed by action on student accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was correct when he told the House earlier that the majority of students in university or college-owned accommodation received refunds, credit notes or other flexible arrangements when they were not in a position to take up their accommodation because of Covid-19.  I thank the sector for this.  What this actually showed very clearly was the benefit of college-owned accommodation, why we need more of it and why we cannot be so reliant on private supply when it comes to student accommodation.</p>  <p>  As part of this debate, we need to have a broader discussion urgently on the issue of student accommodation in the context of overall housing supply.  We cannot continue to allow a situation where third level students are almost pitted against young workers and young families in trying to secure a limited number of houses, apartments, flats or whatever.  All this does is drive up prices and pressure for everybody.  We need to look at what more we can do to support students, and I acknowledge the efforts the legislation makes in this regard and I wish to see it incorporated in legislation.  We also need to ask ourselves what more we can do to make sure there is more on-campus college-owned accommodation.</p>  <p>  For a start, and this is my view as the Minister with responsibility for higher education, we need to address the anomaly that exists whereby a university can use its borrowing framework to build on-campus college-owned accommodation but a technological university cannot.  When all of us in these Houses voted for technological universities we did not vote for them to be second-tier universities.  We need to rectify this anomaly and I have begun discussions with the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Finance and others in this regard.  Our technological universities have an opportunity to transform education throughout the country and address regional imbalance.  If our technological universities have an option to build on-campus accommodation, all of a sudden students will have an opportunity to move to the regions and live on campus and our technological universities will thrive.  The benefits of this could be significant for students and housing supply.  I am very pleased to tell the D&aacute;il today that I have started work in this area and am engaging with my officials and are engaging with other Departments.  I look forward to updating the House on this matter in the very near future.</p>  <p>  As colleagues know, there is a national student accommodation strategy, which was launched by the previous Government in July 2017.  It sets out a number of actions to increase the supply of student accommodation and to try to ease some of the pressure on the private rental sector.  The strategy was developed by the former Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with the former Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and in consultation with stakeholders across the third level sector.  It set a target of providing 7,000 additional student accommodation bed spaces by the end of 2019 and the provision of 21,000 bed spaces by the end of 2024.  I am pleased to say the 2019 target was exceeded, with 8,300 bed spaces completed by the end of 2019.  As of the end of 2020, more than 10,000 bed spaces have been completed.</p>  <p>  I ask colleagues to be clear that I do not want my view to be misrepresented or distorted.  I do not believe the strategy goes far enough, for the reasons I have just outlined.  It is important and that it needs to continue to play a part and not only hit but exceed its targets.  Alongside this, we need a strategy that relies less on private operators and more on college-owned accommodation.  This is what our students want, what their parents want and what our institutions want.  I look forward to having an opportunity to return to the House shortly to discuss badly needed progress in this area.</p>  <p>  Regarding legislative change, today&rsquo;s debate has been very constructive.  I have listened to almost all of it and it has helped to tease out some of the important issues at play and the reasonable points made by students, their parents and Deputies have been highlighting.  As mentioned by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the issues raised in the Private Members' Bill are under examination with a view to introducing Government legislation this year.  However, it is important that we allow the Bill to pass Second Stage.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute again to the USI.  I want to particularly take this opportunity, in case I do not have another one, to pay tribute on the record of the D&aacute;il to the USI's outgoing president, Lorna Fitzpatrick, for her tireless work.  She has led the USI at a time of massive difficulty and challenge for everyone in the country and for students.  Through my weekly engagement with Lorna on the Covid steering committee, she has constantly raised the issues faced by students to the very top of government in a very robust manner and I thank her for this.  She sits on our Covid steering group and the issue of accommodation is something she regularly raises.  She has also led a very important conversation on mental health and student well-being, and I am pleased to tell the D&aacute;il today that as part of her work in chairing a new student well-being and engagement group she has presented me with a series of recommendations and more actions we can take now to try to improve student well-being.  I expect to be in a position to announce news on this very shortly.  Lorna will soon leave her post, and I very much welcome her successor, Clare Austick, and I look forward to working with her.  Today, I want to pay tribute to Lorna for her advocacy and her work.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had an impact on every one of us but we can all agree it has had a massive impact on young people, and perhaps this has not been discussed enough.  They have suffered enormously.  We can never endure another college year like this one.  To be clear, intensive planning is under way in the third level sector and I will publish a plan and an update in June as to how we get our students safely back to campus at the start of the new academic year.  We want our students back on campus in a safe way.  This does not mean the online learning will cease entirely but we need to see a much bigger increase in on-campus attendance.  The college experience is about more than a Zoom camera and students sitting in a boxroom or at the corner of the kitchen table of their mothers and fathers.  It is about development, socialising and meeting people and we need to maximise on-site activity.  We will be helped by vaccination and the roll-of rapid testing.  I will be pursuing pilot programmes next month in NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and UCD and in student accommodation.  Despite the pandemic, more than 6,000 students remain in on-campus student accommodation and as we roll out this study, accommodation will be a key part of where we will deploy rapid testing.</p>  <p>  The Government does not oppose the Private Members' Bill.  The Government welcomes the Bill.  I will work with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Government colleagues and I will consult the USI and student accommodation providers to ensure that protections for student renters are enhanced.</p>  <p>  My Department is less than a year old.  We have an awful lot of work to do.  It is a Department for third level education.  This means not just higher education but also further, community and adult education.  In less than a year, we have seen the roll-out of the free laptop scheme, the doubling of the student assistance fund, the reform of SUSI announced, the first increase in postgraduate grants and income thresholds in a decade, for the first time we have seen a new fund for educational disadvantage, the expansion of student Wi-Fi through eduroam, more college places, action plans on sexual harassment, CAO reform under way, a new apprenticeship action plan to try to end the elitist attitude we have when it comes to further education and a significant increase in funding for mental health and well-being.  We have a great deal more to do and I am very aware of that.</p>  <p>  Education can be and is the great leveller in society.  We in the House often debate all that is good and bad about our higher education sector but we cannot leave behind those who study in further or community education.  Through my work in the Department I have seen women living in direct provision travelling from Leitrim to Tallaght to access the incredible services of An Cosan.  I have seen the women of SAOL in inner city Dublin recovering from addiction committed to, and advancing, their education.  I have seen a once homeless man take up an apprenticeship in TU Dublin and he now has a job and a home.  Excuse me for slightly moving off topic but I want to be clear, and the Oireachtas wants to be clear, that we must support students from all walks of life to reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  Accommodation can be a barrier that many face but so too is the broader cost of education and the narrow and sometimes elitist attitude and understanding that as a society we can attach to educational options.  We need to embrace multiple pathways.  Now is a time of change.  It is an exciting and challenging time full of opportunity for further and higher education.</p> <p>I look forward to working with colleagues across the House on these issues.<br/><br/>I thank the USI for initiating this debate.  Some good will come from this, in terms of additional protections for student renters, but much more must come from it in terms of better, more comprehensive provision of on-campus college-owned accommodation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800021#T00200"><p>I wish to begin by welcoming the Government's support for this Bill and by commending colleagues and the USI on their work in relation to this.</p>  <p>  Of course, this Bill is not only about removing the lump sum that parents and students are expected to pay at the beginning but also is about removing the barrier that is there.  There should not be a student in this State who is unable to move to go to college because of the cost of accommodation.  It has been a major issue for students, for their parents and for their families for many years.  I welcome this Bill here today.</p>  <p>  The large sums of money that parents and students are to pay upfront follow much sacrifice made by them in gathering that money together well ahead of the college year, and that has been a huge difficulty.  I dealt with a student who is in NUI Galway.  Last year, his parents paid &euro;5,000 for his accommodation.  The course went online, the accommodation was never used and the provider refused to pay a single red cent of that back.  From speaking to colleagues and knowing the position of students in other colleges, the amount of &euro;5,000 was quite low when compared to what other accommodation providers charge.  It was difficult to have to go back to that family and say I was sorry that they were not going to get a refund of &euro;5,000, knowing what they had sacrificed in order to make that money and to allow their son to get to college.  We need to see an end to that.  I remember the accommodation provider at that time telling me that Government had not restricted the use of student accommodation in the Covid restrictions and, therefore, the accommodation could be used.  It was ridiculous.</p>  <p>  In the past, it was sometimes the case that one might go into student-specific accommodation in the first year and then one would go into private rental accommodation for the second, third and four years if that was the case.  Now that is even limited because of the cost of rent and the lack of availability, and students are staying in student-specific accommodation for longer.</p>  <p>  It is so important that we have clarity for the students who will, hopefully, be going to college in September.  These accommodation costs are looked for ahead of September and we need clarity for these students and their parents in order that they are not put in a position where they will lose thousands of euro.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800021#T00300"><p>I commend and thank the Union of Students in Ireland, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Conway-Walsh, and everyone who worked on this legislation.  The fact that this piece of work is student union-driven is important.  It means this solution is coming directly from the people most affected and shows the meaningful role young people and unions can play in making positive change.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that students have missed out over the past year and throughout the pandemic in doing lectures online, coping with bad network connections and sometimes trying to work off their mobile phones, as well as not being able to have face-to-face human interactions with fellow students.  On top of that, many of them had to deal with the logistical nightmare of sorting out their accommodation.</p>  <p>  Student accommodation is an issue that disproportionately affects rural areas, like my own county of Wexford, more than others because most students have no choice but to move away to attend third level education due to poor transport options and the lack of availability of courses more locally.  Hopefully, a university for the south east will be a step in the right direction in that regard.</p>  <p>  Over the past year, with most classes moving totally online, many students are paying for accommodation they cannot avail of.  This is not right.  Extended profiteering from this pandemic should be scorned.</p>  <p>  This Bill legislates for the prompt refunding of accommodation fees if the accommodation is not taken up or is vacated due to Covid-19 related public health restrictions.  This is an essential protection for many families.  For example, one of my constituents was in a position where she paid &euro;5,000 for accommodation she did not use over the past year and she was told that they would only get &euro;800 of this back which she still has not received.  Her mother and father are self-employed and are only barely hanging on.</p>  <p>  Leaving Covid-19 aside, student tenants need decent digs and greater protection.  If this Bill becomes law, a student in student-specific accommodation will have the legal right to serve a landlord with a notice of termination of 28 days.  Providers of student-specific accommodation would also be prevented from charging more than one month's rent in advance.  These protections together will alleviate some of the financial strain ordinary students and their families face when trying to access third level education and accommodation and would spread the cost and make it more manageable for working families.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of discussion about looking after the mental well-being of young people.  There is no doubt that providing students and their parents with stronger protective laws in the area of student accommodation can only have an enduring and positive outcome for years to come.  For that reason alone, this Bill should be supported by all Deputies who value and care about the younger generation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800021#T00400"><p>I wish to start by thanking the USI, in particular, the president, Ms Lorna Fitzpatrick, and the vice president for campaigns, Mr. Craig McHugh, for all of the work that they have done in progressing this important legislation.  I would also like to thank all of the 56 Opposition Deputies who co-signed the legislation - my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in but also Deputies from the Social Democrats, the Labour Party, People before Profit, Solidarity and RISE, and from Independents 4 Change.  It is also heartening to see that this Bill is passing through the House today unanimously.  Every Deputy who has spoken has spoken in favour of both the spirit as well as the substance of the Bill and that is a welcome fact.</p>  <p>  In particular, I welcome the commitments by both the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to support this legislation, although I urge a small note of caution.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage mentioned a residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.  It is not in the priority list of legislation that was published last week and therefore, while work on the heads of that Bill is progressing, it is unlikely we will see that until the early autumn.  It is unlikely it will progress until late in or by the end of the year.  Unfortunately, students do not have that time to wait.  I urge both Ministers who spoke today but also members of the Oireachtas housing committee to allow this Bill to progress to committee as a matter of urgency for us to undertake the necessary pre-legislative scrutiny and, if possible, to pass this Bill in advance of the residential tenancies Bill from the Government in order to give students the protections they deserve as early as possible.  That would be the most preferable outcome.  Having said that, we will always work with Government on progressive changes to the Residential Tenancies Act and I look forward to the heads of Bill being published by the Minister whenever they are ready.</p>  <p>  It is important for anybody watching this debate to fully understand that the passage of this Bill today unfortunately does not mean these protections come in immediately and therefore, I urge USI and students across the State to continue campaigning for the full enactment of this legislation.  In fact, there is quite a lot of work for us to do to continue that.</p>  <p>  As other Opposition Deputies have said, this is a good example of what happens when civil society, which is raising a real concern for the constituency it represents, engages with progressive politicians from a range of parties, tables good quality legislation scrutinised and enhanced by the office of parliamentary legislative advice and leans on the Government to do something that the Government may well have done in its own time but will certainly now be forced to do at a much speedier pace.</p>  <p>  I would also like to make a couple of comments on the Minister, Deputy Harris's comments on the student accommodation strategy.  This is obviously an area of work on which my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, leads out but given that I have the opportunity to respond, I do not think my colleague will object.  I welcome the admission by the Minister that there are significant flaws in the student accommodation strategy that s now expiring.  The Minister is correct.  It always over-relied on private sector provision to the detriment of not-for-profit on-campus provision by universities and institutes of technology, ITs.  The Minister is correct that the inability of ITs to borrow meant that they were not able to provide on-campus accommodation.  It is something on which I and my party have been calling for Government to take action for three years.  I genuinely welcome that.  That could be significant.  However, that, in and of itself, will not allow the scale of on-campus or near-campus student accommodation necessary to be provided.  The Minister will be aware that the Government's strategy identified a 20,000 bed-space shortfall at the start of the strategy and notwithstanding an increase in provision, public and private, there was still to be a 20,000 bed shortfall by the end.</p>  <p>  I commend two other ideas to the Minister and maybe he can discuss these with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The first is to look at some of the supports that are currently being provided to local authorities and approved housing bodies for the delivery of affordable cost-rental accommodation.  Similar funding streams could be provided by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to assist universities and ITs to structure their loan arrangements in such a way that they can have longer maturities and, therefore, lower rents for students.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Second, there are very significant capital provisions for AHBs that reduce the overall borrowing costs by providing softer loans to be repaid to government at a future date.  A combination of some smart thinking about the financial underpinning of on-campus student accommodation by universities and institutes of technology, if the Government was of a mind, could go a long way.  </p> <p> I thank Deputies for supporting this Bill and urge everyone to keep the campaign going to get this legislation passed by all Houses and signed by the President to give students the fair play they deserve as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

There is now some light at the end of the tunnel.  As more vaccines come on stream, all of us hope that we can start to catch up with others and that more people will start getting back to work.  For all of us, particularly for those who have not seen a day's work in over a year, a return to working life cannot come quickly enough.  However, the reality as we meet today is that there are more than 400,000 workers relying on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and a further 310,000 depending on the wage subsidy scheme.  There are tens of thousands of workers who have not seen a day's work in over a year and many of them are wondering if they will return to work at all.  There is still great uncertainty for workers, particularly in the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.  I refer to those who are prevented from going to work due to public health restrictions and for them, income supports have been absolutely vital in keeping their heads above water and just making it to the end of each week.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Taoiseach failed to give a concrete assurance that income supports will not be cut during this emergency.  Indeed, speaking on RT&Eacute; on Monday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, was equally unclear as to what those on income supports might face come the end of June.  The Government's lack of clarity is causing great anxiety for those who have seen their incomes collapse through no fault of their own.  They are already dealing with the stress of not knowing when they will be able to earn a living again, while also trying to keep their families safe during this pandemic.  The pressure on them is immense and the least they deserve is certainty that the income supports on which they depend will not be pulled from under them.  </p>  <p>  The plan to reopen the economy, which the Taoiseach will announce tomorrow, must include an absolute assurance that while public health advice prevents workers from going to work and businesses from operating, income supports will continue.  I very much hope that this will be for the short term.  None of us wants this to go on forever.  It cannot go on forever because people need to get back to work.  Now is not the time for the Taoiseach or his Government colleagues to be floating ideas about cuts or the phasing out of supports.  Workers still have rents, mortgages and bills to pay and food to put on the table and many have children to provide for.  The PUP has been their lifeline and any decision to cut supports would be grossly unfair.  In fact, it would be devastating for these families.  These are families who watched on as the Taoiseach signed off on an obscene pay hike of &euro;81,000 for the new Secretary General of the Department of Health and as he delivered pay hikes for super junior Ministers and judges and pension hikes for former Taoisigh.  There cannot be one rule for those at top and another for those struggling to get by.  That is exactly what happened following the previous crash but it cannot be repeated now.  </p>  <p>  We face immense challenges but they are not insurmountable.  We can build a stronger, fairer Ireland but only if we have a fair recovery driven by investment, stimulus and, above all, a determination to protect the well-being of workers and families.  That must start today.  The Taoiseach is being cautious and careful with the reopening.  I ask him to be equally cautious and careful with these families and to clarify that the supports they rely on will not be cut or phased out as long as there is a public health emergency.</p></speech>

It is not the public health restrictions <i>per se</i>that have done that, but the virus.  The public health restrictions are there to protect people and society from the virus.  That is the context.  As a result of the virus and Covid-19, the Government has introduced unprecedented interventions to support incomes and jobs and to keep as many businesses viable as possible so that when we emerge from Covid, those businesses can restart and reboot, maintain jobs and create further jobs into the future in the context of a national recovery.  To date, approximately &euro;28 billion has been provided for Covid-related spending programmes, almost half of which was on the PUP and wage subsidy schemes.  That is in addition to core programmes, including in the areas of enterprise and the labour market, and a range of other supports that were provided.</p><p>The Government has been very clear, proactive and ahead of the situation in clarifying some time ago that it would retain all supports until the end of June.  We said there would be no cliff edge in terms of the withdrawal of supports.  We have been very clear about that.  </p><p>The Government strategy for getting the virus case numbers, hospitalisation levels and intensive care admissions down has worked.  The people of Ireland have made it work by adhering to the guidelines and regulations.  The vast majority have done so and, as a result, we are in a much better position than anticipated or modelled, which is good.  Obviously, we are dealing with a variant that is particularly transmissible but, that said, what we said at the end of March we would do in April has been done.  We have secured the reopening of schools and childcare facilities.  Residential construction has resumed, as has outdoor sports training for under 18s as well as tennis, golf and a number of other areas.  We have delivered what we said we would deliver.  We also said we would examine a whole range of areas for the month of May.  </p><p>The important economic point to make is that as sectors reopen and people return to work, there will be a natural reduction in the number of people availing of pandemic supports.  The macroeconomic advice from the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the European Central Bank, ECB, is to maintain the approach we have adopted so far of underpinning income and business supports so that we can recover from the devastating impact of this pandemic on the economy and people's livelihoods.  Many sectors are suffering and have endured a lot.  Retail, hospitality, tourism, travel and aviation have suffered globally and at a European level as well as in Ireland.  The Government has a range of initiatives under way, including the national economic recovery plan, which will be designed to calibrate supports to help businesses to restart and reboot, the national development plan, the submission we will make for funding under the European recovery and resilience facility and the Brexit adjustment reserve.</p></speech>

I was not putting a question to the Taoiseach in respect of the natural reduction that will accrue as people return to work and businesses reopen.  I am asking for a simple statement of assurance for those workers in sectors that have not reopened, and that may not reopen in such a speedy fashion, that they will not face cuts or reductions of any sort come July.</p> <p> We are coming into the month of May at the weekend.  In a spirit of fairness for workers and their families, it is only fair that they have clarity that for as long as they cannot go to work and certain businesses cannot reopen.  On foot of the public health emergency and in line with public health advice, those workers, businesses and families should retain the full level of support that has been afforded to them.  I simply want clarity and a full statement on that point today.</p></speech>

Some &euro;7.3 billion has been paid out to date.  We have made it very clear that there will be no cliff edge fall-off in the context of the supports.  We stated, well in advance, that supports will continue until the end of June.  We are making progress in reopening society and the economy.  That is important in order to get things moving again.  We must then look at how we can help sectors that have suffered more than others to restart, create employment and get people working again.  It will be a key objective of Government to get people working again.  Our approach all along has been to support people through income supports and to support enterprises through wage subsidy schemes and other programmes designed to keep businesses intact.</p></speech>

I am going to ask him about it again this week and will probably do so every week.  Unfortunately, when I raised this matter last week, dare I say it, the Taoiseach made quite a cynical charge, which was that, in essence, asking questions about the roll-out is somehow not putting on the green jersey.  The Taoiseach knows I put on the green jersey numerous times throughout this crisis and will continue to do so.  Please do not go down that line again.</p>  <p>  Transparency is the Taoiseach's friend here.  With respect, this is the only opportunity any of us gets to ask him questions about the most important issue facing us as a country.  I note the change in language over the past 24 hours.  The Minister for Health has asked us not to be fixated on the June date - or, I jes, or the "31 June" date - or on the 82% or 55% targets set by the Government.  The Taoiseach has said that he is pursuing this, so there has been a change in language.  It is important to point out that I and others are not fixated on it either.  This is not a "gotcha" moment as the Taoiseach once referenced.  These are figures and dates that the Taoiseach and the Government have set.  I, and the rest of us, want to see this substantially achieved, whether it is 79% or 81%, or by the first week in June.  We want to see it substantially achieved and to work with the Taoiseach in that spirit, to be fair.  Everyone is dependent on this; workers, those trying to reopen businesses and people whose lives would be affected if they were infected.  I welcome the fact that there have been announcements in respect of the under-50s who have been infected - they will only need one jab - and vaccinations for pregnant women.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach and I want him to answer them.  As was eloquently pointed out by Mark Coughlan on "Prime Time" last night, the majority of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines are coming at the end of June.   In view of the fact that in order to reach 82%, everyone up to their late 20s would have to get their first jab by the end of June, how will the Government ensure that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will be used for 50- to 59-year-olds without skipping that cohort and going down to younger cohorts, before then coming back to it?  Is that being considered or what is the plan?  Logistically, it is very difficult to see how it can work without doing so.  The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is coming in late June but people from 50 to 59 years of age are supposed to have had their first vaccination by then.</p>  <p>  In the context of the actual number of people who will be vaccinated, we are now at 190,000 a week.  We were meant to be at 250,000.  That is fine, that is slippage.  However, in order to reach the target, we would have to be at 450,000 vaccinations a week by the middle of June.  Is that achievable?</p>  <p>  There are 480,000 people in the current cohort of 60- to 69-year-olds.  The Taoiseach is among their number and I congratulate him in that regard.  Some 260,000 have registered, which means that 220,000 have not.  What is our plan collectively to ensure that the majority of people register?  That is a huge number of people who have not registered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800023#V00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising these important issues.  Of course, it is extremely important to raise the vaccine question.  Vaccines are a vital part of our overall strategy to keep the pressure on this virus and to protect people.  First, to protect people's health and well-being and then to protect society and enable it to return to near-normal activities.  The vaccines have been very effective and impactful in reducing ill health, death and rates of transmission among those who have been inoculated already.  It is very evident in hospital settings in terms of front-line healthcare workers, nursing home settings and from what the data is showing for the over-70s.  More than 95% of the latter will have been vaccinated this week.  That shows the efficacy of the vaccines and the need to keep rolling them out.</p>  <p>  Last week, approximately 183,000 people were vaccinated.  The objective is to get vaccines out as we get them in.  Some 27.5% have received their first dose and about 10.9% have received a second dose.  The delivery schedule for quarter 2 is still on track if everything comes in.  Everything we have said to date, working with the task force, has been based on supply, orderly delivery schedules and so on.  That has not happened all of the time, as we know.  We had issues with AstraZeneca which lost us some weeks.  We received different advices for Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson which meant the HSE had to go back to operationalise that advice and go back to the logistics.  Again, the HSE will now take a number of days to go through the advice from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, in respect of the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines and work it into its planning.  The HSE will continue vaccinating, obviously, but will come back with a revised approach following the advice from NIAC.  That is understandable.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that that 4.5 million vaccine doses are due in during quarter 2, which is a very high number.  The delivery schedules come later in terms of the precision from week to week as to when particular shipments will come in.  There was very good news today about Pfizer BioNTech.  The largest ever delivery of Pfizer vaccines - 191,800 - to this country has arrived.  Pfizer has proved to be particularly reliable.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy's questions, the NIAC advice is being worked through.  The modelling the task force in the HSE has done is on the basis of 450,000 a week and on utilisation of vaccination centres, GPs, pharmacists, the community and the allocation of all available resources.  That is the level of modelling that has been done.  The objective is to get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can and, notwithstanding all the obstacles and challenges that have arisen, to keep close to those targets by the end of June.  Those involved are ready to go at it once we get the supplies in on schedule.</p></speech>

The HSE has done a good job.  It has faced very difficult challenges with the criteria changing all the time.</p> <p>I acknowledge that.  Of my three questions, the Taoiseach answered the one I asked about achieving 450,000 vaccinations a week.  He said that figure is achievable and is being projected.  He answered that question directly, which I respect.</p> <p> Unless some miracle is going to happen, I do not understand how we will logistically manage the 50 to 59-year-olds with the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine without moving ahead and vaccinating the younger cohorts.  The projections just do not work out that way, as Mark Coughlan pointed out on "Prime Time" last night.  I had the same thoughts.  In addition, some 220,000 60 to 69-year-olds have not registered.  We must collectively have a plan.</p> <p> Of the 247,000 people who have been infected, 100,000 are aged under 50.  If we take out the small percentage of those who are immunocompromised, how are we to identify those who are to receive just one vaccine?</p></speech>

They have to wait for 12 weeks for a second dose.  If a green certificate is introduced, those aged over 70 will have received either a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and will be fully vaccinated and those aged over 50 will have the Janssen vaccine and will be fully vaccinated.  The Taoiseach can see why 60 to 69-year-olds are concerned about a green certificate and not being fully vaccinated because they have to wait for three weeks.  How will that be dealt with?</p></speech>

It is clear, however, that we will have to get moving and get vaccinating with available vaccines as they come in.  The HSE will operationalise the advice it has received.</p>  <p>  People are continuing to register and there has been good momentum with people registering for the vaccine in the 60 to 69 age cohort.  The vaccines work, are effective and the benefits clearly vastly outweigh the risks.  The important point is that every vaccine that one is offered is a safe vaccine.  We do not have the capacity to provide a menu of vaccines for people to choose from.</p></speech>

We have to continue as programmed and that will continue to be the case.  We have to get the vaccines out as quickly as we get them in.  The HSE is examining the advice from NIAC and will come forward in the next number of days with its up-to-date plan on the operationalisation of some of that advice.  Some of that is challenging, as the Deputy just referred to.</p></speech>

The previous Government issued guidelines that prevented housing development outside the M50.  The Mahon tribunal found that, in effect, the planning policy adopted by Governments facilitated the practice of payment for zoning.  Now, new planning policy is effectively demanding dezoning of large amounts of serviced lands in every rural town and, indeed, within the M50.  Should the Government pursue this Stalinist policy, it will not achieve housing targets.  Not only that, but it will create an environment where payment for planning permissions will return.  Low income families will be forced into ghettoes and everybody knows the social problems that will ensue.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may not be aware that up to 80% of land in rural towns will be effectively dezoned during the current development plan formation process.  In Wexford town alone, 600 acres of mostly serviced land will be effectively dezoned.  Planners repeatedly say that commercial considerations are not planning considerations.  They clearly live in a parallel universe, as does the Planning Regulator.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that, in order to ensure the Government meets its housing targets, the following will not happen in the formation of county development plans across the country.  The first matter is that no serviced lands for housing with existing planning permissions will be effectively dezoned.  The second is that no tiered zonings will be applied to existing serviced owned lands, such that planning departments of local authorities can arbitrarily decide what lands get planning permission and what lands do not.</p></speech>

There is no shortage of zoned land or projects that have received planning permission, but the projects have not started.  There is a big issue there that needs to be dealt with from a housing provision perspective.  Some on the building sites say that there is a viability issue.  That needs to be worked out and examined.</p>  <p>  There is a broader policy with regard to spatial planning, developing brownfield sites and making sure that we get compact development in cities and in towns so that we utilise existing services and avoid excessive suburban sprawl.  That is an important planning consideration.  In many of our cities and towns, we have schools with capacity.  We have a range of services with capacity.  It makes sense to target those areas for additional housing or the refurbishment of existing buildings to provide for residential units.  Substantial funding has been provided by Government in the urban regeneration and development fund to enable those areas to have the infrastructural investment to enable housing and apartment developments to take place within cities and towns on a significant scale.  There is also a significant investment in water infrastructure, which is vital and has been a barrier to some construction projects.</p>  <p>  In respect of county development plans, we do not interfere in the decisions that councillors may take or that councils as a whole, taking advice from their officials, will take in respect of county development plans.  I take the Deputy's point that if land is good and serviced, we do not want to take it out of commission either because we need to build as many houses as we possibly can to catch up.  Covid-19 has reduced capacity with the lockdown and shutting down of construction, so we need to build on average at least between 33,000 and 35,000 houses a year, as per the ESRI reports, to deal with the housing crisis.  We are intent, as a Government, on providing for social housing and also affordable housing, and to give every support that we can to young people to be able to buy their own homes and realise a legitimate aspiration.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised another part of the equation which I mentioned at the start of my response.  There is the issue of a hell of a lot of land which has received planning permission but where little has happened.  That is a concern.</p></speech>

That is why developers are not building.  High densities have been pushed on them.  There is no viability in the development and, therefore, planning permissions have been granted but buildings will not be built.</p>  <p>  I am glad to hear the Taoiseach confirm that there are issues with the policy, particularly dezoning serviced sites.  It would make absolutely no sense.  I hope the Taoiseach can appreciate that doing that would very quickly - not eventually - drive up the price of the land that is left.  Does the Taoiseach believe that dezoning almost 80% of the zoned land in Wexford would make the remaining lands cheaper?  That is not the purpose it would serve.  Dezoning serves to do one thing, which is to put us back in a position where we are hosting another Mahon tribunal.</p> <p>It is utter madness.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that he will instruct the Minister to ensure that fully serviced lands with planning permission, which was extended during Covid-19, is not dezoned.</p></speech>

It is Ireland's oldest national park and covers 26,000 acres of mountains, lakes, woodland and heath.  The nucleus of the national park is 4,300 ha.  Unfortunately, a fire started there last Friday and lasted for three days.  Between 2,500 and 3,000 ha are believed to have been damaged or destroyed in the fire, including an active hen harrier habitat and the hunting grounds of three or more of the extremely rare birds which live in the park.  That is devastating for the ecosystem.  It is the worst fire in the national park since 1984.</p>  <p>  I thank Kerry County Council's fire service for the excellent work it did.  I also thank the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the Air Corps, the Garda, Civil Defence and local emergency groups.  I also thank local volunteers, those people who came out in places which I adore, such as the Black Valley.  I also thank all the other organisations and local volunteers from the tourism and boating sectors.  All these people rallied together to try to save our national park.</p>  <p>  In a proactive rather than reactionary way, I went on the record of the D&aacute;il seeking more resources to be given to the NPWS to manage our park.  I will explain why.  We all know it is a beautiful place but the national park is a living thing I am passionate about.  Examples of what we need are more wildlife rangers and more workers on the ground to do the maintenance and repairs and undertake the care the park needs.  A national park is a living and breathing thing.  We cannot look at it, say it is beautiful and we have thousands of acres of it and conclude that all is fine and the park will mind itself.  It does not mind itself.  I know the Taoiseach appreciates good things, including the countryside.  I respectfully ask him, as the Head of Government, to tell his Ministers to put the additional resources we need in place.</p>  <p>  No one in Kerry, least of all me, was impressed when Ministers tried to make a photo opportunity of running down to Kerry and standing on a rock in water trying to make out everything was great now that they were there.  Why were they not there when I was looking for additional funding for the NPWS and when I said the number of wildlife rangers had fallen from ten or 12 to five and that at one time we had more than 100 people in total working in the national park?  We will be down now to less than half that figure.  We need resources and I am asking the Taoiseach to provide those resources.</p></speech>

Without question, the devastation in Killarney National Park over the weekend, which we all saw on our television screens, was absolutely devastating.  It was heartbreaking to see such a beautiful area impacted so severely.  It is estimated that about 2,500 ha, which is close to half of the terrestrial area of the habitat, have been extensively damaged.  As the Deputy said, that is having a severe impact on flora and fauna.  More work is being done to quantify the extent of the damage to the national park.</p>  <p>  I extend my deepest appreciation to the NPWS, Kerry fire service, the Air Corps, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Killarney Water Rescue and the local meitheal, all of whom worked tirelessly and to extraordinary levels to quench the fires at the weekend.  They did heroic work and saved a lot.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation and the NPWS will be following up with other authorities, including the Kerry fire service, to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the blaze.  The fire spread very rapidly due to the prevailing weather conditions and the cost to wildlife is immeasurable.  Thankfully, there was no loss to human life and we welcome that aspect of it.</p>  <p>  Spontaneous fires are not a natural phenomenon in Ireland, so the circumstances regarding how this fire started need to be determined.  There will be a comprehensive investigation in that regard.  I accept the Deputy's point around the need for a strong, visible presence on the ground to discourage and prevent any unauthorised burning in the countryside and to protect the park.  Funding for the NPWS has nearly doubled this year.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, Deputy Noonan, have decided to accelerate the recruitment of wildlife rangers and to increase the national intake from the recruitment campaign that is under way to 60 new wildlife rangers.  That was announced yesterday, and it will mean a significant addition to the NPWS team.  That will respond in a positive way to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  It was important that the Minister and Minister of State went to the park yesterday to see the damage at first hand and also to pay tribute to all those involved in working to quench the fire.  I thank the Department and Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, with whom I was in constant contact throughout the weekend, for his commitment and the commitment of everybody in trying to deal with this situation.  It is heartbreaking to see our beautiful national park in Killarney impacted so negatively and severely as a result of this fire.</p></speech>

That is one suggestion.  We also need to bring in scientifically qualified people to go through the burned areas.  We must learn a lot about what we are going to do about the situation on the ground and scientific research must be done in that regard.  We have young students suitably qualified in environmental courses in University College Cork, UCC, and the Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT.  I ask that during the summer these people be given the experience of working in the burned areas of the national park researching those data and trying to help us in future.</p>  <p>  It is believed this fire started late of an evening, which is worrying.  We need to establish why this has become such a common occurrence.  It is nearly as sure as night follows day that we will have fires at the end of a dry spell, in particular in the national park.  This fire took a real hold.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful that 60 wildlife rangers are coming, as the Taoiseach stated.  As I told him, we have five wildlife rangers now.  If we were given five, six or seven more from the 60 recruited nationally, we would be extremely grateful.</p> <p>The Taoiseach should not give the impression that 60 wildlife rangers are coming to Kerry, because if that was the case I would be jumping for joy at this moment.  I am sure the Taoiseach is not going to give us all 60.  On one final point, we need more general operatives on the ground.</p></speech>

I think 60 is a significant increase.  Funding for the NPWS doubled in the budget.  This is an area in which I am interested.  I want to support the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in respect of the NPWS to give it stronger capacity in future in terms of our wildlife, national parks and biodiversity.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has made a very good suggestion on utilising this terrible event perhaps to provide for a specific research-type project that would involve supervised research students and seek to understand the impact of fires on habitat, but also mechanisms that we can develop to restore the habitat as quickly as we possibly can.  That is a good idea and I certainly will talk to the Minister and Minister of State to see if something can be developed on that score.</p>  <p>  It is not for me to comment on operational issues around recruitment and so on but it is always the case that the knowledge of the experienced person can be of value to the new recruit.</p></speech>

This is a shocking development.  There would be no threat to public health because the taxi drivers were going to be in their cars.  That was clearly outlined to the Garda, yet the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, has banned the protest on public health grounds.  Given that the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021 is up for debate today and the acting Minister for Justice will be in the House, I request that she make a statement on whether this interpretation of the public health guidelines to ban a legitimate and safe protest by taxi drivers is in line with the Government's view of public health guidelines.  She should also find out what on earth Drew Harris thought he was doing in using public health as an excuse to ban a legitimate protest by taxi drivers.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by taxi drivers from Tipperary who planned to come to Dublin in their cars tomorrow.  They have been wiped out by the "condemic".  It might be an unusual step for us to raise this here but these are unusual times.  Are we living in a totally totalitarian state whereby we cannot protest safely in cars?  This is unbelievable.  We saw what happened in County Longford at the weekend in a church.  It is disgraceful.  Are we going back to the time of Hitler and the Nazis?  What the hell is going on here?  We must pull up Drew Harris, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na boss man.  I do not like these antics.

As the Taoiseach knows, serious concern was conveyed to the Government through the Business Committee from a range of Opposition Members, including Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  The NMPF is a major planning framework.  It has legal consequences for our coastal communities, inshore fishermen, environmental NGOs and a range of organisations that want to have their say and come before the Oireachtas committee to do so.  Rather than facilitate that discussion through the Oireachtas committee, the Government is going to ram the framework through, with five minutes speaking time allocated to each Opposition party.  It is completely wrong.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Taoiseach, at this late hour, to put the debate back for another week and allow the environmental NGOs and inshore fishermen to have their say on this matter and advise us of the problems that might exist.  It is much too important to be rushing through.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to put the debate back, at least for another week, to allow for proper consultation, rather than rushing it through with minimum scrutiny tomorrow.</p></speech>

There has been a lack of scrutiny of the national marine planning framework.  It is a highly significant framework, which has major implications for our marine environment, those who work in fisheries and renewable energy.  It is highly regrettable that the Government does not seem to have learned lessons from Derrybrien, where the State is paying out some &euro;15 million in fines for rushing through planning legislation without proper debate and scrutiny.  I ask, at this late stage, that the motion be withdrawn and that, when it does come back to the House, proper time is scheduled for the debate and proper participation to give more space for scrutiny.</p></speech>

It is totally unacceptable that the Government is doing this.  Initially, it was to be a motion without debate but it was then changed to provide for a debate of less than an hour on a matter as important as this.  I must call this out for what it is.  It is simply a case of the Government ramming things through without consultation.  If the Government has got itself into trouble in relation to a European directive, that is its difficulty.  It should be explained to us.</p>  <p>  The framework is too important to deal with in 45 minutes.  It has huge implications for the sustainable use of our seas and climate change.  If the Government is seriously interested, it must schedule a proper debate on the motion after the committee has considered it.  I understand there are two relevant committees.  I do not mind which of them deals with this but neither of them has had the opportunity to examine this framework which the Government wants to pass without discussion.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I ask that the motion be withdrawn and we have the framework looked at by the committee.  The matter is too serious.

I do not want government by paralysis.  We have a cross-Government approach and we have been four years involved in developing Ireland's first marine spatial planning framework.  This is good and we need to get moving in terms of the resources and how we protect those resources in our seas, and do it in an orderly way.  That is what the national marine planning framework is going to do.  It is the marine equivalent of the national planning framework.  It sets out a long-term spatial planning framework out to 2040 and gives a clear decision-making framework for marine regulatory bodies over a long term.  It is structured under three pillars of forward planning, whether on land or marine, namely, the environmental, the economic and the social pillars.  It ranges across all areas of human activity, particularly in terms of aquaculture but also offshore renewable energy.  We have talked about offshore renewable energy for a long time.

I held back on speaking to Thursday's business until now.  The Ceann Comhairle knows I raised this matter at the Business Committee last Thursday.  The idea we will pass a motion on the national marine planning framework on the basis of a 50-minute debate is utterly unacceptable.  For the Taoiseach to suggest that we are somehow trying to paralyse the process is utter nonsense.  Unless we have proper planning of the marine environment and offshore development, we will end up with the sort of wild west we had in housing that led to the crash.  It is happening as we speak and fishermen are being ridden over roughshod in Dublin Bay and the Codling Bank by private companies that have grabbed the offshore and that are only interested in profit.  There is no proper regulation in this regard.  There are serious threats to biodiversity in the offshore, particularly the near offshore.  This matter requires proper scrutiny and it should not just come under one committee; any committee with an interest in it should be allowed to scrutinise it and stakeholders should be allowed to give evidence.  The idea that the Government would try to push this through with no debate at all or, as is the case now, with five minutes for each party to contribute, is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I reiterate, in reference to a previous matter, that the taxi drivers would have been in their cars.  An operational decision was not made in this regard.  Rather, it what is happening is political policing.  We should have a statement from the Minister for Justice about this matter.</p></speech>

I also flatly dispute the Taoiseach's presentation of how the committee has dealt with the matter.  The draft plan, which will have a legally binding effect on our marine territory, which is seven times the size of our landmass, was only published a number of weeks ago.  The committee had one very detailed briefing from officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I thank them for that.  Members of the committee wanted one further scrutiny session.</p> <p>We wanted the national inshore fishermen to make a presentation to the committee and to hear from environmental non-governmental organisations which have concerns about marine biodiversity.  We proposed that this could take place during the recess week when the committee was not meeting.  If that had been facilitated, we would now be dealing with the substantive matter.</p> <p> There are grave concerns about the impact of aspects of this plan on biodiversity and on the community of inshore fishermen.  I cannot understand why the Government would deny proper scrutiny.  The consequence of not doing this right is the type of paralysis the Taoiseach outlined.  If the Government makes a mess of this, applications for much-needed offshore wind generation, something we all support, will end up being as the subject of a judicial review brought by environmental groups or inshore fishermen because their interests are not being adequately protected.  This is another example of a Government that does not want scrutiny.  It is not just the housing committee that wanted to deal with this matter, the Joint Committee on Climate Action also wanted to deal with it.  My reading of section 72 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 is that any committee could consider this matter and if a committee lays a report or an opinion before the House, the Minister would have to have legal regard to it.  Perhaps the reason the Government does not want scrutiny is that it is fearful it will expose some of the weaknesses in a planning framework that is mainly positive, and that it would be forced to act to protect marine biodiversity and inshore fishermen.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said it has been in development for four years, but nobody has consulted the inshore fisheries community and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, there has been no proper scrutiny of it.  The fisheries community and all of us acknowledge the importance of wind energy.  What the community wants is to be consulted.  At present, we are only in the site investigation stage and inshore fishermen have been severely impacted in terms of their incomes and the future of the sector.  They have yet to be consulted, so 45 minutes for a debate is, quite simply, ridiculous.  If it has to be passed in the first quarter of this year, as the Taoiseach said, why did the Government wait and allow blatant avoidance of scrutiny ?</p></speech>

It is only right that we get time to debate these issues in a proper manner.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach does not want proper scrutiny in the D&aacute;il.  I know the Taoiseach has been attacking the fishermen personally.  As soon as he was the temporary Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he proceeded with the penalty points that kicked the fishermen further in the teeth.  It was the same with Brexit.  He fell asleep at the wheel on that issue.  There is a major issue with regard to the weighing systems relating to catches and Europe is cracking the whip against the Irish fishermen, but the Taoiseach will not even provide a proper amount of time to debate the issue.  What is he scared of?  Are the inshore fishermen not to be respected in this House?  Are ordinary fishermen not to be respected?  Are the ordinary users of Irish waters not to be respected?  Some parts of the framework may be fine, but it still requires proper discussion in the House.  I ask the Taoiseach to step back and, for once, stand up for and stand by the fishermen of west Cork and the remainder of the country, not stand against them as he has continued to do since he took office 12 months ago.</p></speech>

Those fishermen find themselves in the High Court defending their fishing rights over the rights of the cable layers, who have not been instructed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to lay the cable under the seabed.  There is a real conflict here and it is paramount that we discuss this matter fully in order to avoid this happening in the future.  I concur with my colleagues.  All of us are in favour of renewable and wind energy, and we do not want the lack of scrutiny in this House to be a problem raised in the future.</p></speech>

This is a reasonable request from parliamentarians who are committed to scrutiny of legislation, etc.  The Taoiseach knows it is the right thing to do.  I ask him to listen to the Opposition and the committees on this, to pause and to remove it from the Order Paper for tomorrow.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach's answers up to now have been weak and unacceptable.  He spoke about a paralysis.  The only paralysis relates to an absence of debate and reasoned opinion from all Deputies.  It is our job to scrutinise this marine planning framework.  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach was listening to us.  I know it is difficult, but this our the only opportunity to raise matters.  The Taoiseach's answer in the context of paralysis is simply weak and unacceptable.  I ask him to withdraw this motion, let it go to the committee and be brought before the House for proper and robust scrutiny.  If we have learned anything from Covid-19, it is that we cannot return to doing things the way we did them previously because that means we will be heading for disaster.</p></speech>

It has not happened before and I want to get on with it.  For God's sake, how long has the marine planning Bill been in and around this House while being developed?  I am determined to get it done without hanging around or more indecision and a lack of matters being brought to a conclusion.  We need all three, which will be a major suite of reform in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s marine planning system, setting out a clear, long-term vision for how Ireland wants to use, enjoy and protect our precious seas.

It is the c&uacute;pla focal here and there to pepper speeches, photographs to be posed for and a language for a few hours in class every week.</p><p>The truth, however, is that the Irish language is a wonderfully rich cultural gift and an irreplaceable part of the diversity of this planet.  It is a unique infrastructure of thought and a magic door to an Aladdin's cave of cultural jewels that stretches back hundreds of years.  It has been the voice of Irish people for thousands of years.</p> <p>Shockingly, this generation may well be the last in which Irish is spoken in the Gaeltacht as a community language, according to the figures currently circulating in the census data.  To give a picture of how serious the collapse of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht is, the census shows an annual drop of 11% in daily speakers of the language.  Only 500 children between the ages of three and four speak Irish as a daily language in the Gaeltacht.  That is a shocking figure.</p> <p> The language is hanging on by a thread.  It is incredible how the State treats the language.  The majority of Gaeltacht children who want to attend preschool must do so in English.  Up to 94% of principals in Irish language medium schools, Gaelscoileanna, find it difficult to employ additional teachers with fluent Irish.  A company in Donegal in receipt of funds from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, recently told its workers only to speak English.  It is an unbelievably strange system where we provide funds to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to create jobs in the Gaeltacht for Irish language speakers, only for those companies to tell their workers to speak English only.</p> <p> We had an incredible situation recently where a Chinese couple, out of respect for the culture and heritage of this country, sought to apply for Irish citizenship in the Irish language but were told to get stuffed.  They were told that they could not do it and had to apply in English.  Across the country, we have numerous other examples of Departments, county councils and other elements of the State, when interacting with Irish speakers, forcing them to speak English.  I hear regularly of compulsory Irish in the education system.  The truth of the matter is that, for most people who speak Irish every day and for most people in the Gaeltacht, it is compulsory English with which they must deal.  That is hardly ever mentioned in the media or political circles.</p> <p> This is a simple Bill based on the understanding that we need to give prominence and respect, as well as pride of place, to our language.  Towns and their distances from certain locations on road signs are indicated in both languages.  The English language, however, is by far the most prominent.  Accordingly, it is the English name to which the identity falls and stays in a person's mind.  The Bill simply seeks to give parity to both fonts on a road sign, like a proposal suggested by Conradh na Gaeilge to the Government.  The Bill does not seek to change all the road signs as it would lead to major costs and difficulties for the State.  Instead, it seeks the changes as road signs are replaced.</p> <p> I raised this issue with the then Minister for Transport, Tourism, and Sport in 2014, Deputy Varadkar.  He initiated a pilot project but, unfortunately, it was soon dropped.  T&aacute; mise ag iarraidh ar an Aire anois go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; rud t&aacute;bhachtach don teanga; go gcabhr&oacute;idh s&eacute; le muintir na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; thar timpeall na t&iacute;re stop a chur le meath na teanga thar timpeall na t&iacute;re; go dtabharfaidh s&eacute; comhionannas don d&aacute; theanga ar chomhartha&iacute; b&oacute;ithre thar timpeall na t&iacute;re; agus n&aacute; lig s&eacute; bliana dul thart ar&iacute;s mar gheall ar an smaoineamh seo.  Cabhraigh liomsa an Bille seo a chur tr&iacute;d an D&aacute;il chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir, go gcuirfimid an rud seo i bhfeidhm chun go mbeimid in ann cabhr&uacute; leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht.</p></speech>

This is a significant increase on previous years and welcome news.  Most of the money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau has been extricated from the communities in which the criminals have been active most.  Accordingly, it must be returned to these communities.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always advocated that any money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be put back into communities to tackle disadvantage, as well as to fund prevention, treatment and rehabilitation drug services.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised this issue over ten years ago.</p><p>I represent the Dublin Mid-West constituency and I am from north Clondalkin.  Parts of my constituency have been ripped apart by drug use over the years.  This Bill will require the Minister for Finance to carry out a review of financial supports required for those disadvantaged communities affected by crime.  It aims to reinvest the money generated through the seizure of assets by the Criminal Assets Bureau in these communities with a view to alleviating the impact of crime and enhancing crime prevention measures.  Any of this money invested in our communities needs to be on top of allocated resources and not seen as a replacement.  It must also not hinder community organisations applying for any additional resources which they require through normal funding channels.</p><p>It is no accident that most of the money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau originates in areas like mine, which are highly disadvantaged.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that a fund will be created to provide additional funding for investment in community safety projects from the proceeds of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  While community safety is important, so too is building community resilience.  Drug task forces, family resource centres, youth organisations, unemployment services, sports clubs and others which work in disadvantaged areas should benefit from this fund.  I have had positive feedback from the Government parties when I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il before.  I hope this Bill receives cross-party support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800031#DD01000"><p>This legislation is straightforward and there is widespread support for the idea behind it.  We also welcome the Government's idea of a community safety innovation fund.</p>  <p>  We have been dealing with a drugs pandemic for a considerable time.  While it may impact across society, it particularly affects working-class areas, such as those in my own area in Dundalk.  In the past fortnight, I have been dealing with issues regarding drug debt intimidation.  I must commend the work of the Garda in this regard.  This legislation is supported by the Garda chief superintendent in Louth, Christy Mangan, who has spoken in the media before of his fear of losing a generation to cocaine.  Recently, we had raids in Dundalk with &euro;17,000 worth of cocaine and cannabis being seized.</p>  <p>  The wider issues related to drugs need to be dealt with outside of the House.  We need a citizens' assembly to be established, which is a commitment in the programme for Government.  We must ensure the money in question goes to the right places, such as addiction services and intervention services in working-class areas, which are required.  Natural justice is also involved and we need wholesale change in this regard.  I support some of the soundings from the Government about community safety partnerships, which should be far more prevalent than joint policing committees, as well as a multi-agency approach to dealing with this problem and criminal gangs.</p> <p>I call on all Members to support this legislation.  I welcome the work the CAB has done, including raids that have happened in my own town against criminal gangs.  I welcome the work of the drugs units dealing with this level of organised crime but I am absolutely fed up with criminal gangs who are forcing parents, grandparents and siblings to pay off debt, which ends up being significantly more than the initial debt.  This is utterly criminal and we have to literally put their lights out.  This legislation means that if they hurt us and our communities, we will hurt them.</p></speech>

How much we are spending is the wrong metric to be looking at.  We should instead be looking at outcomes.  Where social housing is concerned, the outcomes we should be looking for are how many people are being housed and having their housing needs met and how secure that accommodation is.  At this stage we have 140,000 people on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies and more than 8,000 people who have lost their homes living in emergency accommodation.</p><p>A headline in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>reads &quot;Social housing portfolio guiding &euro;21m&quot;.

Part V long-term leasing is part of this problem and I seek to address it in this Bill.  The aim of the Bill is to improve the provision of affordable and social homes.  It does this by revising the Part V arrangements and seeks to repeal provisions introduced by the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 under the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Kelly, which allowed Part V obligations to be met through leasing.  The reason for removing leasing as a Part V option is to ensure affordable and social homes are secured for long-term use by the State, which is a much better use of resources and much better value for money.</p><p>I am bringing forward this Bill because until recently, the number of Part V homes that were being leased was very low but over the past year we have seen a very considerable increase in that.  Those numbers will not show up in the official figures for another two to three years, when the Part V delivery is concluded but we are currently seeing them show up in planning permissions and deals being concluded and agreed.  Analysis done on Part V by the <i>Business Post</i>show that in 11 different deals, 384 homes are going for long-term leasing instead of acquisitions under Part V.  These homes will be rented to the State by developers for between 20 and 30 years at an average rent of more than &euro;20,000 per year and the annual cost of these 384 homes will be &euro;7.8 million in rent or &euro;181.6 million over the course of the 20 to 30-year deals.  The State is in line to pay an average of more than &euro;490,000 to rent each of these homes over the lifetime of the deals, a price significantly above the market value of each home.  Documents released to me under freedom of information, FOI, showed that in some cases, developers have been getting the State to sign up to these leases without independent valuations taking place.  Last weekend, analysis was published, again by the <i>Business Post</i>, showing that market rents are being recorded at artificially high levels rather than the actual levels of rent being paid.  It is of course these artificial valuations which are being relied upon when long-term leases are being signed.  This, therefore, is bad value for money.  Analysis and commentary from Mr. Dermot Desmond estimated these long-term leases are using an outlay of about four times what would be done with direct build, so we could be getting four times the amount of social homes for a similar outlay.</p></speech>

The Cabinet committee on Europe oversees the implementation of programme for Government commitments on the European Union and related issues.  It last met on 22 March 2021 in advance of the meeting by videoconference of the members of the European Council on 25 March.  It discussed the agenda for the European Council, including Covid- 19, the Single Market, industrial policy, digital matters and the economy, relations with Russia and relations with Turkey.  The Cabinet committee also discussed the agenda for the euro summit, which followed on from the European Council and which focused on the international role of the euro.  In addition, it discussed the conference on the future of Europe, which will be launched on 9 May.  Previous meetings of the Cabinet committee on Europe took place on 16 July 2020, 8 October 2020 and 8 December 2020.  It will continue to meet as appropriate, including to discuss issues on the agenda of the European Council.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to international policy and foreign affairs are discussed by the full Cabinet as and when appropriate, mostly on foot of memoranda to Government brought by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I also engage bilaterally with the Minister on such matters, as appropriate.  International matters also arise in the context of the European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy and other external policies of the European Union.  When appropriate, these are included on the agenda of meetings of the Cabinet committee on Europe.  The next meeting of the Cabinet committee on Europe is expected to take place in advance of the upcoming European Council meeting scheduled for 24 to 25 June 2021.  The agenda for this meeting is yet to be finalised.</p></reply>

Him and about 70 other democracy activists are facing sentences of between ten and 30 years each.  They are persecuted by the Saudi regime, which, let us remember, carved Jamal Khashoggi into pieces in the Saudi embassy in Turkey, almost certainly at the behest of Crown Prince bin Salman.  This young man will get 20 years in prison for a tweet even though he is a totally peaceful activist.  Even Nancy Pelosi has called on the Saudi regime to release Abdulrahman.  I ask that five days before this sentence, if the Taoiseach believes in anything like the right to peaceful and democratic protest and the right to dissent, he would call out the Saudi regime and ask for Abdulrahman's release.</p>  <p>  This is shocking stuff compared with what some people have to put up with, and I would not make the sort of loose comparison that Deputy Mattie McGrath made earlier on.  However, I find it worrying that under the guise of public health restrictions we are seeing political policing by Drew Harris of a protest planned tomorrow by taxi drivers that would have been fully compliant with public health guidelines.  The Taoiseach should call that out too.</p></speech>

There is a &euro;750 billion fund in place under the EU's pandemic recovery plan, as we know.  We will get &euro;853 million in grants in 2021 and 2022 but our allocation for 2023 has been substantially reduced from &euro;420 million to &euro;68 million, a loss of &euro;352 million.  Is that confirmed?  That is what was reported in The Business Post.  The Taoiseach can tell me in his response.  Have we lobbied for additional funding or what are the exact figures?  Are the media reports correct?  To the Taoiseach's knowledge, how much funding will Ireland receive under the recovery and resilience fund?</p>  <p>  It is reported that this funding will go towards something I would welcome, namely deficiencies in our ehealth system, a centralised data centre and the retrofitting of State buildings.  An ehealth project would allow for the secure electronic sharing of patient information lab results and prescriptions between medical providers.  That will play a vital role in the situation where we have seen a huge negative deficit in our public health infrastructure.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that this funding will be used for ehealth, retrofitting and a centralised data centre?  When will this funding be confirmed?</p></speech>

In that vein, India is in peril.  Medical staff are on their knees, hospitals are overwhelmed and crematoriums cannot keep pace with the number of people who are dying due to the coronavirus.  I am aware of the welcome news that over 700 oxygen concentrators have been sent to India by Ireland but we have to do more and more has to be done globally.  It was India, along with South Africa and several other countries, that brought forward the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver, which is coming before the World Trade Organization to ensure vaccine justice and equity for low and middle income countries.  The richest nations account for 16% of the global population but hold 53% of all purchased coronavirus doses according to the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy.</p>  <p>  We need to act on the words: "No one is safe until everyone is safe".  Even if COVAX, the global Covid-19 vaccine mechanism, were to be fully funded this year, it would still only vaccinate 20% to 25% of the population of the world's 92 countries.  At the current rate, these countries may not reach 60% coverage until 2023 or later.  We need to defend people, not profit, and show solidarity with India and all low and middle-income countries.  We need to lead by backing the TRIPS waiver before the World Trade Organization meeting on Friday.  What is our position on TRIPS?</p></speech>

Of particular note was the formal acknowledgement by MEPs of the unique circumstances of the North of Ireland and the role given to the Assembly in respect of the Irish protocol.  When ratifying the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, the Parliament also expressed the need for ongoing and enhanced dialogue with the North.  It is evident, therefore, that the North needs an institutional voice within the European Union.  The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement protects the Good Friday Agreement and trading arrangements and yet the North no longer has any institutional mechanism by which it can engage with the European Union on these matters of fundamental importance.  What discussions has the Cabinet committee on Europe had on this matter?  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with his European counterparts in seeking a solution for the North in this regard?</p>  <p>  Has the committee had further discussions on the EU's relationship with Turkey?  Turkey's withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention is extremely worrying and it is incomprehensible that the Turkish President would unilaterally reverse the decision to be part of this convention through a presidential decree.  It is through this prism that we should view President Erdoğan's efforts to humiliate Commission President Ursula von der Leyen publicly, because it seems Turkey remains a cold house for women.</p></speech>

That right is now being undermined by the actions of the Garda in this State.  Last Thursday night, garda&iacute; brutally broke up a peaceful picket of Debenhams workers at Henry Street, arresting a number of supporters and throwing workers, who were mothers and grandmothers, on the ground.  The shop steward, Jane, was left naked from the waist up.  Similar scenes were repeated in Tralee the following evening.  Garda&iacute; were taking these actions to facilitate non-essential, illegal, strike-breaking work, which successfully removed non-essential retail stock from Debenhams.  Now we hear stories about the taxi drivers, with taxi driver organisers being told that they will be arrested if they turn up to peacefully protest, socially distanced in separate cars.  How can Drew Harris continue as Garda Commissioner if he is ordering garda&iacute; to break up and prevent legitimate protest while facilitating illegal, non-essential, strike-breaking work?</p></speech>

More than 360,000 were infected in the same day.  The images on our television screens are ones of horror, showing a shortage of oxygen, car parks converted to crematoriums and a shortage of wood for funeral pyres.  Meanwhile the <i>Financial Times</i>reports: &quot;As industry lobbying has escalated in Washington, companies have warned in private meetings with US trade and White House officials that giving up the intellectual property rights could allow China and Russia to exploit platforms such as mRNA, which could be used for other vaccines [heaven forbid] or even therapeutics for conditions such as cancer and heart problems in the future.&quot;  Similar lobbying is taking place in Brussels.  The EU is sending some oxygen but it is standing shoulder to shoulder with the US in fighting attempts at the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property rights for vaccines.  Ireland is in the front line of the EU countries which are fighting this, and the Taoiseach knows it.  I appeal to him to reverse the Government's position on this issue before the crucial WTO TRIPS, or trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, council meeting on Friday.</p></speech>

We had all hoped that the pandemic would lead to a new solidarity.  However, the EU, US and others refuse to allow a waiver on vaccine patents.  The TRIPS waiver, as it is referred to, would allow countries in the global south to produce the vaccine themselves.  It is sickening that this is not happening.  Ireland needs to take strong moral leadership and we need the Taoiseach to do that.  On Friday, a World Trade Organization meeting will decide on the issue.  WIll the Taoiseach assure the Irish people that Ireland will fight for intellectual property rights to be waived to help save lives?</p></speech>

I will pursue that.  There are a range of issues around human rights and freedom of assembly.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our ambassador will engage to support the avoidance of what would be a very severe penalty and the release of the individual concerned.</p>  <p>  A new development, although not unprecedented during the last year or so, is the degree to which Deputies accuse An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda Commissioner of political policing.  This has nothing to do with the question about the European committee.  The accusation should be withdrawn.  It is a very unfair accusation to make and it seeks to undermine the objectivity and operational independence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner who have been given a very unenviable task in terms of the current public health situation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised the recovery and resilience fund and the &euro;915 million available to Ireland to draw down in the first phase.  The second tranche is in accordance with various economic criteria.  The Deputy will recall that these include models of economic performance in GDP and employment.  Ireland's economy has been growing in GDP terms in the last two years which may impact on our second phase drawdown.  We are close to submitting a plan and have been engaged with the Commission on this.</p>  <p>  The two key themes of the recovery and resilience plan are creating jobs in the green economy and digital transformation.  The Government, and I personally, have been keen to ensure there will be significant inclusion around health digital transformation.  For decades, we have been talking about bringing health into the modern era.  The Covid pandemic has illustrated the degree to which health has caught up in some respects.  We developed very good technology very quickly, including the Covid app and even the vaccine technology system.  There will be provision in the plan for a contribution to e-health, in particular, to take a once-off opportunity using this fund to try to accelerate technology application in our health system.  That is a clear objective. </p>  <p>  Deputies Gannon and Cairns raised the issue of India.  We have provided significant resources.  We are a small country but we will continue to do so.  It is devastating what is happening in India.  It illustrates the danger of the virus and how rapidly it can get out of control.</p>  <p>  On the issue around intellectual property, we need to examine this in some detail.  I can recall in 2003 when SARS was potentially becoming a global pandemic, the world had zilch by way of manufacturing capacity or co-operation among pharmaceutical companies or between pharmaceutical companies and governments.</p></speech>

The assembly adapted its methods to comply with public health guidelines.  The results of the assembly's voting on key recommendations were announced on Saturday, 24 April.  Its final report, which will set those recommendations in context, is expected in June.  The assembly has agreed 45 priority recommendations covering a wide range of areas set out in its mandate.  These include recommendations on the Constitution, politics and leadership, care-giving and childcare, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, pay and the workplace, and social protection.  The assembly's report, when finalised, will be for consideration by the Oireachtas in the first instance, and I look forward to working on the recommendations. </p>  <p>  Under the programme for Government, the Government aims to establish a citizens' assembly in 2021 to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  This assembly will be established with a new chairperson and new members.  Consideration is being given to the appropriate methodology for future citizens' assemblies, but any decisions in this regard will be guided by the experience of the current assembly.  An independent researcher has been appointed to monitor and record, among other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the assembly, which will also assist in decisions on future assemblies' use of virtual meetings.  I understand that the Citizens' Assembly, which commissioned the independent review, plans to publish it.</p> <p> The programme for Government provides for the establishment of citizens' assemblies to consider biodiversity, matters relating to drugs use and the future of education.  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from the relevant Departments on the approach to be taken with these assemblies.  It is envisaged that they will be established after the Dublin mayor Citizens' Assembly has completed its work but the specific timelines relating to each assembly have yet to be worked out.  Citizens' assemblies do very valuable work in guiding policy and giving a sense of the direction that the public would like Government to take.  They take time to set up, however, and run especially in these times of the pandemic.  Although the timing of the citizens' assemblies outlined in the programme for Government may not yet be confirmed, there are ongoing and new initiatives being carried out in each important area, such as biodiversity, drugs, and the future of education.</p></reply>

Second, the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality reported at the weekend and offered 45 very good recommendations.  My party has been fighting for many of the latter, for almost half a century in some cases.  I will ask a number of quick questions on this.</p>  <p>  The assembly recommends the deletion of Article 41.2, the article relating to women in the home.  Does the Taoiseach intend to act upon this recommendation?</p>  <p>  The assembly recommends, specifically in the context of gender equality and non-discrimination, that Article 40 be amended because it protects family and private life.  Will the Taoiseach look at that article also?</p>  <p>  Given what the Taoiseach is announcing tomorrow in the context of maternity services, we all know that the HSE's clinical director in this area has recommended that, in the context of maternity services, access should be given to all partners of women who are due to give birth at certain stages of the process, whether it be 12 weeks, during labour recovery or at other critical points.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that there is consistency in the approach taken by maternity services across the country in this regard?</p>  <p>  My colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, has been campaigning in respect of the gender pay gap issue for years.  As the Taoiseach is aware, there is a big difference between the pay of women and that of men.  Senator Bacik has brought forward a Bill on the issue.  Will the Taoiseach support that Bill or does he intend to opt for the Government Bill which, I understand, is in the process of being drafted?  What is the timeframe in this regard?</p></speech>

Many of the issues identified in the programme for Government as being ones on which we should have citizens' assemblies deliberate are extremely positive.  If one were to ask people right now what they believe we should have a citizens&rsquo; assembly deliberate upon as a matter of urgency, I believe a very large number would say that we need one on the mental health crisis which is affecting young people and many other age cohorts and which has been magnified by the Covid-19 crisis.  In general terms, the problem in this regard stems from the failure to resource basic mental health services in order to allow them to address it.  The Taoiseach should consider that.</p>  <p>  There is also an issue with regard to education.  I do not think we can wait for a citizens' assembly to be established.  I raise again with the Taoiseach the matter I have raised in recent weeks, namely, that relating to the psychologists and the desperate need that we have in this regard.  We are 400 psychologists short of the number we were promised in A Vision for Change.  I have pointed out that the fees and the unpaid placement work that students are having to do is acting as a huge barrier to getting psychologists qualified who could help address the mental health crisis that exists across a range of areas in respect of which there are massive waiting lists.  The HSE advertised this week for assistant psychologists to work for it for 20 hours a week for nothing.  That is outrageous.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to investigate that because these young psychologist trainees should be paid.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the families of the Stardust victims put forward proposals to ensure that they would all have legal representation at the inquest.  Those proposals were cost-effective and based on international best practice.  They were not agreed to by the Government, which suggested that families should go down the legal aid route.  Assurances were given that the families would get representation through that means.  We now have a situation where it appears that the majority of families will not receive legal representation and they are yet again protesting outside the D&aacute;il, which is something they had hoped they would never have to do again.  The inquest will not be able to start or carry out its work properly if all the families are not legally represented.  This is causing great anxiety and distress for the families.  Will the Government engage with the families and their legal representatives on this issue and seek to resolve matters in order that the inquest can go ahead and that all the families can be legally represented at it, as the State will be?  The State is currently carrying out its legal work in preparation for the inquest and the families should also be able to do so as well.</p></speech>

One of recommendations resoundingly approved by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly is that the legal right to collective bargaining be guaranteed for all workers in order to improve wages, working conditions and rights in all sectors.  Yet, many big companies in this country still refuse to recognise or engage with trade unions.  Workers at Amazon, Google, Facebook, Deliveroo, and many other companies are getting organised and are facing major resistance from their bosses.  This Saturday is made May Day - International Workers' Day - and People Before Profit will be launching our trade union recognition Bill, which will force companies to recognise and engage with unions in acting upon that proposal from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  Will the Taoiseach support that proposal and commit to change the law to compel employers to recognise unions?</p></speech>

This week, once again, our system, in the manner in which we teach our children, has been exposed either in the buildings that they are in or in the lessons that they are being taught as being unsuited for purpose.  In this instance, what happened was not related to the pandemic but rather to religious institutions and how they are permitted to instruct relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programmes, not according to facts or constitutional rights but according to church teaching and ethos.  The particular programme to which I am referring is called Flourish.  It was developed by the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference, which has stated that church teaching in respect of marriage between a man and a woman cannot be omitted.  Among some of the other harmful issues are preachings against lone parents and the LGBTQI+ community.  This is an issue that does not just impinge on children.  Speaking at the Irish National Teachers Organisation's annual conference in March, its vice president, Joe McKeown, stated that up to 4,000 LGBTQI+ teachers are hiding their sexual orientation because they feared that their jobs or promotion prospects could be harmed if their school patrons discovered their true identities.</p>  <p>  Some 90% of our primary schools operate under the Catholic ethos.  Parental choice does not exist and our young people deserve better RSE than we had.   The programme for Government contains a commitment to achieving a target of at least 400 multidenominational primary schools by 2030 to improve parental choice but this raises bigger questions regarding the role of church and our education system.  Will the citizens' assembly on the future of education consider ways and the extent to which it can suggest solutions or alternatives to religious institutions in our education system.</p></speech>

I refer to the two ancillary recommendations that are essential to preventing crisis pregnancies.  Those recommendations were put forward by the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  It is almost three years since those recommendations were made.  They were backed up by the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, including by members of the Taoiseach's party.  The basis of the recommendations is that there should be free contraception available to women and that there should be non-ethos-based sex education.</p> <p>What has happened or will happen to those two recommendations that have been left lying undealt with?  In light of that, what will happen with the important and fundamental incremental changes the Citizens' Assembly at the weekend recommended on the issue of care?  The recommendations included: to improve the terms and conditions of those in paid employment as carers, to give them access to pensions, to ensure the choice in care and independence of older persons and persons with disabilities would be guaranteed and to change the carer's allowance, the respite and the pensions for carers and their families.  This is a hugely important cohort of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of family carers throughout this country who year on year save this State billions by looking after people in need with disabilities, elderly people with care needs and family members who they love.  They give a huge amount of commitment but get no pension and no proper pay for doing an amazing job.  Hats off to them and to the Citizens' Assembly for recommending the changes.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on the call by the assembly to amend the notoriously sexist Article 41.2, which states that mothers have duties within the home.  This was part of the Constitution in order to give constitutional status to the social teachings of the Catholic Church.  It is backward, sexist and sectarian and it is right that it should be removed.</p>  <p>  The role of carers and care work, including decent pay, job security and pension rights, should be recognised.  We need to go further than removing sexist language and endorse the call by the assembly for increased spending on a publicly-funded childcare model, bring an end to the gender pay gap, make the minimum wage the living wage and improve maternity leave rights.  I hope that the call by the Citizens' Assembly is heeded by the Government.  I do not have any great faith that it will be.  If it is not, I hope it leads to massive pressure from below for change on these issues in Irish society.</p></speech>

There are only three full-time vacant home officers in this State.  At at time when we are in the worst housing crisis in the history of the State and people are crying out for housing, does the Taoiseach know how frustrating it is for people and families to look at vacant houses in their community where there is criminality, gangs, antisocial behaviour and dumping, and they are lying idle for months and years?  In my constituency of Cork North-Central and for the whole of Cork city, there is one part-time vacant homes officer.  It is estimated that there are 1,777 vacant homes in my constituency and we have one part-time vacant homes officer.  This is the Taoiseach's plan to solve the housing crisis.  Will the Taoiseach commit to providing funding for all local authorities to end the scourge of vacant homes in their communities and provide people with the housing they desperately need?  In Cork city, only two houses were returned under the repair and lease scheme and only 47 under the buy and renew scheme.  We need action now.</p></speech>

Christopher was a fully healthy boy and his parents are heartbroken.  A large number of elements of the law were broken, not least that a senior practitioner signed off on the abortion but never met or examined the mother.  The family has met two Ministers for Health and the Chief Medical Officer.  I know the Taoiseach is aware of the case because he has spoken to the family directly.  However, 25 months later, the family still has not had justice for what happened to Christopher.</p>  <p>  Peter McKenna has written a detailed report on the family's case.  That report lies on the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly's, desk and has lain there for weeks without the information being given to the family.  The family cannot get access to that report at the moment.  The Minister once told the family that they could trust him but yet, his office has told the family that if they want to get access to the report, they can ask for it under the freedom of information, FOI, legislation.  That is a phenomenally disgraceful response to parents who have had the life of their son ended in a hospital illegally in this country.  Will the Taoiseach say today he will put an end to the difficulties this family is experiencing and they will have justice?</p></speech>

It is not the first time that proposals on deleting that have been tabled and I would be interested in pursuing that.  Its practical application no longer exists and it does not operate in practice.  Working in collaboration with the Oireachtas, I think the Government would be in a position to pursue that issue and to assess the recommendations generally from the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality.  We would look at all 45 recommendations to examine them and take decisions in respect of them.  </p>  <p>  I will talk to the leadership of the HSE in respect of the recommendations from the clinical director that maternity wards and services be open to partners and that there be uniformity in terms of the application of that across the country.  That is proven to be a difficult issue for many people.</p>  <p>  On the gender pay gap, I would be supportive of all measures we could take to reduce that pay gap and have equality in respect of pay for similar work.  We will bring forward a legislative proposal.  I will check where that is in terms of the timelines.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that mental health is a subject that could well be dealt with, in parallel to ongoing action by Government and the health services.  It is a topic that would be worthy of consideration by a citizens' assembly.</p>  <p>  On the recruitment of more psychologists, we have provided additional resources.  In respect of the position the Deputy outlined, I am not aware of the details of that.  There is a general view the Deputy has been articulating that everybody in training or student life should be fully paid.  There are widespread implications of that approach.  It is a more complex issue than presented.  I do not know whether that is the case here or not.  I do not know the specifics of the case the Deputy has raised but I will pursue it.  </p>  <p>  On Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point, I will inquire of the Department of Justice in respect of the families and relatives of the victims of the Stardust tragedy and legal representation.  We will see if we can get that issue sorted to get the issue moving and the inquest under way.</p> <p>Other points were made by Deputy Murphy regarding the trade union recognition Bill.  Under the Labour Employer Economic Forum, or LEEF, framework, there is engagement with IBEC and ICTU on the way to examine in considerable detail the issue of trade union recognition.  The terms of reference have been drawn up for that work and it will progress.</p></speech>

The focal point of the programme was the traditional political discussions and meetings with President Biden, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, and the Friends of Ireland caucus.</p>  <p>  In these meetings, I discussed Ireland-US relations, and the importance of the transatlantic relationship and economic ties.  We discussed facing global challenges together.  I welcomed the renewed support of the United States for the Paris Climate accord, the WHO, and the UN Human Rights Council.  We also discussed a range of issues relating to the UN Security Council, and our common readiness to support others on their path to justice and peace.</p>  <p>  With President Biden I discussed Covid-19, including the public health situation in both countries, and the measures our Governments have put in place to get our economies ready for recovery.  We spoke about vaccine roll-out, and the logistical challenges faced by the EU and US of accessing sufficient supply for our peoples.  We spoke about the importance of maintaining open supply chains to support vaccine production and delivery.  We also reaffirmed our shared commitment to the COVAX initiative.</p>  <p>  I thanked the President and members of Congress for their support during Brexit for an EU-UK agreement that protects the Good Friday Agreement, and which was achieved through the Northern Ireland Protocol.  I welcomed the bipartisan resolution in the US Senate, reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements promoting peace and stability on the island of Ireland.  We discussed the challenges that have arisen in Northern Ireland since the beginning of the year.  I also briefed President Biden and Vice President Harris, as well as the Friends of Ireland, on my Shared Island initiative.</p>  <p>  In my meetings with President Biden I highlighted the continuing difficulties facing the undocumented in the United States and supported President Biden's call for immigration reform.  I expressed the Government's appreciation for the strong backing to date in the Administration and across the aisles in Congress for the E3 visa Bill, which we hope will be introduced in the Senate shortly.</p>  <p>  After my meeting with Vice President Harris I joined her in congratulating the newly announced 2021 Frederick Douglass global fellows, who will travel to Ireland this summer, the public health situation permitting.</p>  <p>  My virtual programme over the course of three days also included a range of other community, trade and economic-focussed events, as well as events to mark the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the Friends of Ireland, including marking the particular contribution of John Hume in this regard.  I also had telephone contact with the President in the aftermath of this election.</p></reply>

I am hearing different stories and information from both sides of the pond on this.  As the Taoiseach knows, President Biden intends to visit the UK and he could include Ireland as part of that.  The Taoiseach might confirm whether he has officially invited him and, if so, will he give us some details?</p>  <p>  One of the main components was the issue of vaccines.  I have raised this issue previously.  Through the People's Vaccine Alliance various people have come together to fight for this.  We all know what is going on in India at present.  It was proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO to ensure we can get vaccines throughout the world quickly.  This is the biggest test of mankind for many centuries with regard to how we will get it out quickly.  The open sharing of information and technology will end the pandemic quicker.  Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of patents and intellectual property with President Biden?  If so, what was the discussion like?  I presume the Taoiseach is supportive of the WTO TRIPS waiver and I presume the Government will support it.</p>  <p>  I heard what the Taoiseach said about the issues of the Northern Ireland protocol and people who are undocumented.  Will we appoint an envoy to represent Ireland as we had previously?  If not, why not?  Was there any discussion on future travel and movement between the US and Ireland?</p></speech>

This, of course, is very welcome.  I hope we will see similar energetic political action from the Government in Dublin to press these two issues of full support and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a bipartisan resolution last month equally expressing full support for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and no hard border in Ireland. The resolution also very helpfully states that any new trade agreement between the US and Britain must not only consider the obligations under the Good Friday Agreement but that those obligations should be met.  This is the critical clause because we have had a succession of experiences of non-delivery on agreements that have been struck.</p>  <p>  In this vein, will the Taoiseach tell us whether he has briefed President Biden and Vice President Harris on recent events in the North?  Has he discussed the implementation of the New Decade, New Approach and Stormont House agreements with them and the outstanding issues that have yet to be delivered?  Will the Taoiseach also tell us whether he discussed with the President the economic strategy for the US emerging from the pandemic and the proposal for a global minimum corporation tax rate?</p></speech>

Given that is roughly half the length of time of the illness the real figure is way higher than this.  It is an incredible situation because hospitals should be the location of cure and protection but in reality for many people they were the place where they caught this deadly virus.  I know many families who had loved ones who went into hospital for non-Covid reasons, caught the virus and died.  While there is no doubt that hospitals did their best in many cases to keep out the illness there are serious examples of mismanagement also.</p>  <p>  The biggest issue I have, and perhaps the Taoiseach will answer this, is that staff were asked to work in a seriously understaffed manner. We had Be on call for Ireland, to which 70,000 people signed up, and this time last year only 54 of them had been employed.  At the start of this year, there were still 700 people who had the right qualifications and were ready to go into the health service to help but they were not employed.  We know that in January and February, hospitals were grossly understaffed and under pressure.</p></speech>

Even the United States Government, as I have pointed out to the Taoiseach previously, has used wartime legislation to direct private companies to do certain things to respond to the coronavirus.  This is in the heart of capitalism, if we like.  It does not go far enough as far as I am concerned but even the US understands the need to use emergency measures to tell for-profit commercial companies what they had to do in response to the coronavirus.  Shockingly, the Government and the European Union are dancing to the tune of the vaccine producing companies that do not want to share the vaccine formulae and technology with countries such as India and others where we see disaster unfold.</p> <p>It is morally obscene when we know that in order to see the back of this pandemic, we need the world vaccinated.  The awful terrifying cost of that is being seen in countries such as India, notwithstanding, by the way, the shocking right-wing irresponsible attitude of the Indian Government, which was like Trump and Bolsonaro.  Nonetheless, it is unconscionable that Europe is holding out against a waiver of intellectual property on vaccines.</p></speech>

In the US, they have launched a $2 trillion post-Covid stimulus plan but here, the Government is reported to be set on repeating the mistakes of 2008 with a troika-style programme of &euro;8 billion or more in austerity.</p></speech>

The proposal to cut the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, from June would see millions of euro taken out of the economy, hurting those who have already paid the most in terms of Covid when what we need is public investment.</p>  <p>  I would also ask have they discussed the Biden proposals for a minimum global corporation tax rate, which, according to UCD academics, would result in a 50% reduction in the corporate tax take here?  Does the Taoiseach agree with them that this is the end of the road for Ireland's corporate tax haven strategy?  Does the Taoiseach not, therefore, agree that instead of being a corporate tax haven or pursuing austerity once more, we need an eco-socialist plan of investment in green jobs, public housing and an Irish NHS?  Instead of cutting the PUP, we should be implementing a wealth tax on the billionaires and major corporations who have seen their wealth skyrocket during this pandemic.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister but the words have no meaning unless we act on it.  That means, between now and the next meeting of the World Trade Organization, WTO, this House would welcome the Taoiseach making contact with Joe Biden and the European Union and urging them to drop the intellectual property rights on the vaccine in order to support the motion that emanates, interestingly enough, from India, the country that is currently suffering the most.  India and South Africa have the motion in front of the WTO to relax the intellectual property rights to allow the production of vaccines at scale.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must be as distressed as everybody else was looking at the scenes coming from India.  It is horrible.  However, it is not only about India.  There has to be a motive of selfishness on the part of the Taoiseach and Joe Biden, which is to protect all of us.  Because it is a pandemic, by its nature, none of us is safe until every man, woman and child in India is safe also.  It makes no sense to continue to impose intellectual property rights on vaccines in the middle of a global pandemic.  It can only make sense to a greedy, selfish cohort of capitalists who see this as an opportunity to make fast profits.  I ask the Taoiseach to put Ireland on the right side of history and make that phone call to Joe Biden and the European Union.</p></speech>

There have been many simplistic conclusions drawn here, which are not merited and do not stack up.  Europe has led the charge in terms of vaccine production and export for the entire world.</p>  <p>  A month or two ago, Deputies in this House were criticising Europe in terms of its slow distribution and manufacture of the vaccines.  The reality is Europe, through its pre-purchasing agreements, has done an awful lot to ensure proper research and production of vaccines, which are being exported all over the world and the barriers have not been put up to stop it.  That is important.</p></speech>

It is not that simple and the Deputy should not pretend it is that simple either.  One of the largest manufacturing sites is in India.  AstraZeneca has been manufacturing in India and India has put a ban, of necessity, on any export from India.  Earlier in this period, Europe thought it would be getting vaccines from India.  Now we have to do everything we possibly can to help India.  We are sending out materials etc.  We will do whatever we can.  We will support whatever is the correct policy approach.  We have been strong supporters of the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, COVAX, programme.  Europe is one of the largest contributors, if not the largest contributor.</p>  <p>  In respect of the meeting with President Biden, at the time, in March, we did not discuss the intellectual property issue.  The focus rather was on supply chains because the biggest barrier was on that whole manufacturing, production and supply chain area, in terms of getting a sufficient quantity of components to enable vaccines to be produced quickly.  No matter where one goes in the world, all of those components will be required in that supply chain.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800038#LL02400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for providing me with the opportunity to set out the provisions of the Planning and Development, Heritage and Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  This technical Bill is necessary to allow for the transfer of functions relating to heritage under a number of enactments to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Normally, such transfers of ministerial functions are effected through orders made under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  A number of powers and functions in relation to heritage have already transferred to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under the Heritage (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2020.  However, two problems arise in relation to the transfer of the remainder of the functions relating to heritage to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which must be addressed by the Bill.  First, section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 prohibits the primary Minister under the Act - the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage - from exercising any power or control in respect of any particular planning case.  Section 30 must now be amended to provide for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to lawfully exercise certain heritage functions proposed to be transferred from the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, in particular certain functions regarding commenting on planning applications and draft development plans from a heritage perspective.  Second, the Supreme Court decision in the Mulcreevy case of 2004 holds it to be impermissible to use secondary legislation in the form of transfer of functions orders to merge into one Minister functions that the Oireachtas, in primary legislation, that is, an Act, had intended to be divided between two separate Ministers; this being seen by the court as breaching a key constitutional principle that only the Oireachtas can make and amend primary legislation.  There are certain legislative provisions relating to heritage in which this problem arises and must be addressed by the Bill.</p>  <p>  If the Bill is enacted and commenced, the remainder of the heritage powers and functions held by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media may be transferred to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage by a transfer of functions order.</p>  <p>  The Bill contains three parts.  Part 1 - preliminary and general - of the Bill contains standard provisions in relation to the Short Title, collective citations, construction, commencement and expenses.</p> <p> Part 2 contains five chapters and 13 sections the purpose of which is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Wildlife Acts, the European Communities Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations of 2011 and planning matters relating to heritage.</p> <p> Section 3 is a standard provision providing that in this part, the "Act of 2000" means the Planning and Development Act and "the Minister" means the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Chapter 2 contains eight sections related to amending the Planning and Development Act,  2000.</p> <p> Section 4 amends section 13(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by the substitution of "to the Minister, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media" for "to the Minister, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht" and similarly amends section 13(8)(c) of that Act.  Section 13 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 deals with the adoption by planning authorities of variations to development plans.  With regard to sending notice to specified bodies regarding proposed variations and notice to such bodies on the making of a variation, it contains references to "the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht", as the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media was titled in 2014, along with references to "the Minister", the latter being the primary Minister under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 and now titled the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Without amendment to primary legislation, the merging, by means of a transfer of functions order, of the notification to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media under the section with the notification to the Minister exercising the function of primary Minister under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, namely the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage, would result in a Mulcreevy problem.</p> <p> Section 5 amends section 30(2) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 to allow for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to exercise certain heritage functions transferred or proposed to be transferred to him or her in particular, certain functions regarding commenting on planning applications and draft development plans from a heritage perspective.</p> <p> Section 6 amends section 51 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by providing that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall prescribe the form of a record of protected architectural structures.  The text of section 51(2) of that Act raises problem a from the point of view of the judgment in the Mulcreevy case.  Section 6 of the Bill solves this problem by providing for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make regulations regarding the form of a record of protected structures without needing to consult with another Minister.</p> <p> Section 7 amends section 52 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by providing that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall issue guidelines to planning authorities concerning development objectives for protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest and for preserving the character of architectural conservation areas.  As already stated, the text of section 52(1) of the 2000 Act raises a problem from the point of view of the Mulcreevy judgement.  Again, this amendment solves this problem by providing for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to issue the guidelines to planning authorities without needing to consult with another Minister.</p> <p> Part XAB of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for consultation by the primary Minister under the Act, namely the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media was titled at the time of enactment, as to whether the compensatory measures specified by a competent authority in an imperative reasons of overriding public interest case are sufficient to ensure that the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network, that is, European sites which are special areas of conservation or special protection areas, is protected, where the making of certain land use plans specified in the Act or the granting of consent for a proposed development under the Act would adversely affect the ecological integrity of a European site, but it is proposed that it should still go ahead for imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</p> <p> Sections 8 to 11 amend sections 177X, 177Y, 177AB and 177AC within Part XAB of the 2000 Act.  These sections provide for the transfer and merger of the consultation functions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in Part XAB of the Act to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage resolving the Mulcreevy problem in Part XAB.</p> <p> Chapter 3 contains one section relating to amending the Wildlife Act 1976 and one section relating to amending the Wildlife (Amendment) Act,  2000.  Section 12 amends section 59(3) of the Wildlife Act 1976 by providing that where the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is regulating access to or use of the foreshore for nature conservation purposes, those regulations shall be made: following consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works; with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and where the regulations relate to foreshore in relation to which functions are vested in a Minister of the Government other than the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the consent of that other Minister of the Government.</p> <p> Section 13 amends section 16(2)(a) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000 so that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall seek the observations of any Minister or Ministers of the Government as the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances in respect of the proposed designation of a natural heritage area rather than seeking the observations of certain specified Ministers.  The Ministers from whom observations would be sought would depend of the functions of those Ministers which may vary over time.</p> <p> Chapter 4 contains one section relating to amending the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  Section 14 amends the designation of sites as special areas of conservation and special protection areas and direction provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 by providing that, in the designation or direction process, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will inform another Minister or Ministers of the Government of developments.  As with the amendment to section 16(2) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, the Ministers to be communicated with would depend on the functions of those Ministers which may vary over time. </p> <p> Section 15 provides, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, when he or she is performing a function in respect of heritage to: make a planning application to a planning authority; make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la; make a request for a declaration to a planning authority, a referral for a decision to apply for a determination to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to exempt development; and do any act or thing pursuant to the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 relating to any of these matters.</p> <p> Part 3 contains two sections and these relate to amending the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p> <p> I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to outline the provisions of the Bill.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' views on it.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this largely technical Bill as it is essential to ensure the transfer of all of the necessary powers and functions to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as it is now called.  I would like to use the few minutes available to me to address a number of matters that are being dealt with by way of this transfer and to seek a response from the Minister of State, if possible.</p>  <p>  We have all been deeply saddened by the scenes of devastation in Killarney National Park.  The Minister of State visited the park, saw the devastation for himself and spoke about it publicly.  It must be said that one of the key problems that we have is the lack of independence, powers and adequate funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  I know that the Minister of State is absolutely committed to trying to address those three problems.  A consultation process is under way and I have corresponded with the Minister of State to seek an assurance that before the outcome of that consultation is finalised, he and his officials will engage with the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and seek its input into the process.  This is a really good opportunity for us to try to transform the NPWS into an agency not unlike the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or other similar independent, well resourced bodies.  If the Minister of State is looking for an ally in the work he is doing in respect of that, he certainly has one on this side of the House.  </p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State also has a specific involvement in the consultation process and, subsequently, the legislation pertaining to marine protected areas.  This is such an important piece of the growing architecture of legislation and institutions to ensure that our marine environment is properly regulated and that the multiple uses we all want to see of the marine area, whether they are economic activities such as fisheries or renewable offshore wind generation or activities to protect marine biodiversity, are all done in ways that are mutually reinforcing.  Many of us are concerned that the long time lag between progressing the Marine Planning Bill, the marine planning framework and the legislation on marine protected areas is not best practice.</p> <p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>That is not the fault of the Minister of State.  I know this is an area that he is passionate about.  However, our committee has been told by marine biology experts that the time lag is a big problem and even if the marine protected area legislation comes to the House before the end of this year and is passed, there will still be a lengthy time lag before designations take place.  Of course, designations are of no value unless they are adequately enforced and regulated.</p> <p> I urge the Minister of State to do everything he can to ensure that as the legislation is introduced, designation activity, where it's appropriate, is prioritised along the east cost where a first tranche of major offshore wind energy project would be seeking planning permission and that the genuine concerns of inshore fishermen and the communities for whom they provide economic stability are not disregarded.</p> <p> There is a concern among environmental NGOs that deal with marine biodiversity and the inshore fishermen's association that the interests those two groups advocate for may not be as high on the priorities of other partners in government as I am convinced they are for the Minister of State and, therefore, it is an issue he needs to raise in the Department and in his engagement with his line Minister.</p> <p> I express concern that there are further delays in the advancement of the State's architecture policy.  This is important work and good work has been done by the officials but it has been quite some time since the initial consultation concluded.  Many of us on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government are keen to participate in that.  The Minister of State has willing partners.</p> <p> With respect to the historic monuments legislation and specifically the national monument of Moore Street, we need to see greater urgency in progressing these Bills.  As our committee chairperson who is sat beside the Minister of State, Deputy Matthews, will tell the Minister of State, we have a heavy Government legislative schedule but we cannot allow heritage to continue to be marginalised in the way it was under previous governments.  The Minister of State and the housing committee members would like to play as positive a role as possible in advancing those as well as the other issues the Minister of State has responsibility for.</p> <p> We are certainly happy to pass the Bill and look forward to having the Minister of State in front of the Oireachtas housing committee to talk about these matters and others that are important to all of us.</p></speech>

I wish to ask the Minister of State about the heritage side of things.  Recently, Cork City Council unanimously passed a motion put forward by my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, Councillor Kenneth Collins and Councillor Henry Cremin, to rename Anglesea Street in Cork city MacSwiney Street after Terence MacSwiney, the former Lord Mayor, who died and his family, for their activism and work and in recognition of the whole MacSwiney family.  That type of heritage and renaming is something we need to promote more.</p><p>I highlight another issue in Cork city because some <i>ad hoc </i>groups are trying to change our heritage and our history.  There is an area in Cork city that some people are calling the Victorian quarter.  The Victorian quarter does not exist; it is not an official place.  An <i>ad hoc </i>group of people decided to come up with this marketing tool.  It is wrong because Mac Curtain Street was named after Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain who was murdered in his home in Blackpool by Black and Tans and Royal Irish Constabulary, RIC, officers who drove to his house on what was then called King Street and killed him.  It was renamed Mac Curtain Street in honour of Tom&aacute;s.  A group of people want to call it the Victorian quarter.  They are trying to change our history and heritage.  When I was a councillor on Cork City Council, I put forward a motion that this should not be allowed and I ask the Minister of State that no <i>ad hoc </i>group should be allowed to make up names because they think it is a marketing tool.  We must respect our heritage and history.  I know the Minister of State cares about this subject and I hope he will take it on board.</p></speech>

I have seen it over many years in regards to groups such as the Kells Anglers which have been the custodians of the River Blackwater and look after its stock and quality.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the communities along the River Boyne rallied in defence of it.  In the space of a number of days, over 6,000 people in a small rural area joined an online campaign in support of the environment and the River Boyne.  The "Save the Boyne" campaign now has over 8,100 followers.  There is a planning application that will be judged on its own merits and I will not get into that.  I commend the forum and its active members and the local angling clubs, community groups and businesses on their efforts and interest in protecting their environment and on protecting our inland waterways.  It was something to be proud of and to be commended.</p>  <p>  On their behalf, Government needs to work with these communities and support them.  That goes for the Government's agencies as well, in terms of local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Irish Water and other authorities.  From my experience as a public representative and working with these communities, they have a mixed experience of working with these agencies that have an official responsibility to protect our natural and built heritage.</p>  <p>  On a related point, I raise the Hill of Tara.  As the Minister of State knows, it is one of the richest archeological landscapes in Ireland.  Over 230,000 people visit the Hill of Tara on an annual basis.  I do not live far from it.  Increasing numbers of people have visited during Covid-19.  Where is the Hill of Tara conservation management plan?  It is work in progress since 2018.  I commend stakeholders such as the local Rathfeigh Skyne Tara, RST, group and the Friends of Tara group.  It is clear what needs to be done to conserve the area, but also to enhance it in terms of public amenities, parking, toilet facilities and interpretive centres.  There is significant opportunity which needs to be grasped.  I encourage the Minister of State to provide an update and to ensure the work gets done.</p></speech>

I particularly focus on the broadcasting point of view in relation to this Bill.</p>  <p>  Over the last year, we have seen the critical importance of our community radio stations.  I am thinking of shows such as the Patricia Messinger show on C103 or county sound, as many of us affectionately know that station, which are so important to keep people informed and Community Radio Youghal in my home patch in the Cork East constituency.  They play an exceptionally important role in keeping people informed of what is going on in their communities and having local, legitimate voices from their communities giving them the correct information where possible.</p>  <p>  The Government must ensure they get every support possible because they have suffered badly as a result of the fact that there is not as much advertising revenue coming into radio stations as before the pandemic.  This is because businesses are, obviously, suffering and cannot afford to advertise, particularly those that are shut, and so much of that business has disappeared.  It is important that the Government continues to ensure we do everything to protect those industries and broadcasting.  Legislation such as this is exceptionally important.</p>  <p>  I have said umpteen times since I got elected that as the youngest Deputy elected to the D&aacute;il in a long time, I have grown up with technology and see the damage it is doing to so many people.  We have seen the rise of political forces the likes of which have never been seen which are driven by conspiracy theories, whether around Covid-19 or the Government's efforts to save people's lives over the last year.  It has been deeply troubling.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has suffered badly as a result of it.  The abuse public representatives, from county councillors to Government Ministers and the Taoiseach, are getting as a result of it is frightening.</p> <p>We have to understand the power of social media.  The Government needs to make sure we are doing what we can to ensure legitimate, correct information is getting out to as many people as possible.  It is not about policing social media.  I am not talking about putting further restrictions on social media.  However, from the Government's point of view, it is important that we make sure we use social media to get legitimate information to people.</p> <p> I am concerned about the idea of banning advertising online.  Doing so would mean that public representatives who are elected with constitutional functions, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities, whether they are county mayor, chairperson of a municipal district or county councillors, and Ministers and their Departments would not be able to get legitimate information out.  It would create a false situation with an entire platform, across multiple social media companies, where there is no way of getting correct information boosted online.  That is important.  If I say anything here over the course of the next year, I ask the Minister to take that information away with him.  We will suffer in the long run if we do not do anything about it.  Every parliamentarian in this country and anyone who is listening today should watch "The Social Network" on Netflix.  It is an exceptionally important film that shows how social media can manipulate how people think.  We all need to understand the negative power that may have for democracies in the next couple of years.</p></speech>

We are dealing with a number of issues.  This is obviously a technical Bill.  We all support it since it is necessary.  A number of Deputies have already spoken about heritage.  We welcome that much work is done by bodies on protecting heritage sites and ensuring continuity of such but there are difficulties.  It is a problem that we have with communication across the board.  When I spoke on the climate change legislation I stated there was an onus on the Government and the Minister to engage with farmers and others who have a difficulty when they hear of heritage, wildlife moves or climate change.  I have met the IFA and other organisations over many years and I have seen that there is a group of people who accept that the world is changing and that we all need to work together.  We absolutely need communication at Government level to ensure that happens.  It has been a failing across the board to date and is something that we need to deal with.</p>  <p>  I add my voice to Deputy James O'Connor's comments on the difficulties with online services.  We have to have a major showdown or conversation with the social media giants to ensure they do not publish everything, that we have controls and constraints and that people are getting the real deal and not just algorithms that provide them with nonsense on top of nonsense.  That leads to danger, especially in the current pandemic.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which I understand is technical.  We will support it.</p>  <p>  As the Minister will be aware, I am incredibly passionate about this area.  I have spent many years working either as a scientist or internationally as a policy adviser on this issue.  I am honoured to be able to talk to the Legislature about heritage and the issues that we need to focus on.  When we are looking at the transfer of functions, I understand that they are necessary under the current structure, but the Department with responsibility for housing is not the right place to have the heritage function.  Our biodiversity and issues relating to biodiversity do not belong with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They should be with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  We have a fundamental problem in this country in that we try to compartmentalise the environment.  We say that climate change goes into a particular box, the environment goes into another box and biodiversity goes into another box.  Anyone who has ever worked or studied or has any interest in our environment will understand that it does not work that way.  Every single aspect of our environment is interconnected and our relationship with our environment is interconnected.  If we are going to make the changes we have to make to address climate change and biodiversity loss, we must have a cultural shift.  The way in which we deal with these issues has to start at Government level.  They should not be separated out.  We should not have one committee saying it cannot look at the issue of biodiversity because the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is looking at it.  We need to look at these issues together, connect them and make sure we have coherent policies and whole-of-government approaches to these issues.  I understand and acknowledge that the Minister is passionate about this area and I imagine I am probably preaching to the converted when I raise it.  We need a cultural shift and I will continue to raise and support such a shift.</p>  <p>  For the unfortunate week that is in it, it would be remiss of me not to mention the fires in Killarney National Park.  I welcome that the Minister went to visit the site and also that he was first on the ground when a fire occurred in Wicklow.  I had a look through the D&aacute;il records for the past years and there is a playlist when it comes to these fires.  When there is a fire in an area, the relevant Minister will describe it as devastating for our environment and flora, say it should not happen and is illegal and speak of needing stricter enforcement and stronger measures.  A list of things is rolled out each year when these fires happen.</p>  <p>  We have to move past that playlist and photo opportunities.  We need to put concrete actions in place.  We have potentially lost 7,500 acres of an area we should be protecting.  Our national parks are areas where nature should be protected and safe.  What we have seen is an ecocide.  When we see what is happening in the Amazon, we say it is disgraceful and should not happen.  This is our Amazon and we cannot accept it any longer.  I hope the Minister will put concrete measures in place.  I understand farm payments are stopped in affected areas but it is only for one year.  I recommend that we consider stopping farm payments for ten-year periods because when a fire such as the recent one happens, it can take ten, 20 or 30 years for the land to recover.  That needs to be acknowledged in farm payments.  It is not just about intensive measures and penalties.  At the moment, the Government is incentivising people to start these fires.  We need to flip that on its head and get these people to protect and value the land they have under their guardianship.  That will be key.  Farmers are great at doing what one asks them to do.  They are good at getting their job done.  We need to make sure their job is protecting land on behalf of the State.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</p>  <p>  As I have stated a number of times, we need active management plans that make biodiversity and nature conservation the number one priority for our national parks.  I ask that the Minister consider that too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800041#OO00400"><p>I will raise two issues related to the Bill.  The spate of gorse fires in recent months is regrettably predictable.  Every year, these dangerous fires destroy large parts of our landscape.  The devastating fire in Killarney National Park has featured prominently.  It should also be noted that there were several fires near Dunmanway, Clonakilty and Bantry in west Cork last week.  Several units of the county fire services and Air Corps were involved in getting them under control.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, wildfires are not a naturally occurring phenomenon in Ireland.  Although we often do not know the exact cause, the most likely explanation is that those fires were started deliberately.  In recognising this reality, we must also face up to the policy context of gorse fires.</p>  <p>  Government agriculture policy and the Common Agricultural Policy are some of the key drivers that shape our landscape and the types of activities that are rewarded and punished.  Unfortunately, both the CAP and the policies of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are geared towards certain types of farming and have neglected the needs of upland farmers and more marginal land for years.  Only last week, the Opposition sought to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine oppose changes to the new CAP which would see the exclusion of rich carbon soils, including uplands and drained peatlands, from the basic payments.  Unbelievably, areas with gorse and heather have also been removed from the list of areas for which payments will be made in the new environmental scheme.  The Minister has to work with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to put in place ambitious policies for sustainable use of these lands, including habitat restoration schemes, afforestation and payment for carbon sequestration.  Planning and heritage legislation cannot be treated in isolation from agricultural policy, given its significant role in the Irish landscape and environmental impacts.</p> <p>This is a cross-departmental issue which requires greater focus and commitment from the Government.</p> <p> On a related point, section 13 of this Bill concerns the designation of natural heritage areas, NHAs.  I urge the Minister to make progress on advancing proposed natural heritage areas for these 632 sites of significance for wildlife and habitat.  While some of the protection is given by the proposed category, places such as Garrylucas wetlands near Kinsale need full protection.</p> <p> I have raised the status of several sites in west Cork, such Garrylucas, with the Minister of State and through parliamentary questions he has informed me that a review of the sites is foreseen.  We need this review now and we need the proposed sites to be properly recognised.  Community groups are working hard to value and enhance these natural heritage areas and the least they can expect is that the State would do its part too.  Damage to uplands and natural heritage sites usually falls under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage but it overlaps with the responsibilities of many other Ministers, especially that of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  To ensure the protection and responsible and sustainable use of these areas, we need a cross-departmental approach that is clearly working towards the same goals.  Unfortunately, this has been lacking.  We need the Minister of State to take an active role in providing greater coherence in Government policy to support farmers and landowners in managing the landscape.</p></speech>

I think the right place for it is down in the Customs House with the planning, local government and water sections.  I am particularly delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, take on this role, given his lifetime of experience, activism and commitment to protecting our natural, built and cultural heritage.</p>  <p>  Our built heritage is of vital economic and social value.  Throughout our regional towns and cities, we have spectacular examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture.  Sadly, these buildings are often neglected and derelict and they are often subjected to alterations which badly damage their architectural merit.  When these buildings are not listed on the record of protected structures, there is little can be done to stop that.</p>  <p>  Our town centres first policy, which is also under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, seeks to bring life and vibrancy back to our town centres and to sustain local economic growth.  Many of the unused and vacant heritage buildings in our towns can, with the right supports, provide town centre residential use and bring life and living back into those towns.  I look forward to the progress that will be made by the Department on the town centres first policy.</p>  <p>  Our natural heritage has long been neglected.  Our wildlife and the habitats in which it exists are under constant pressure.  Loss of habitats, fragmentation, destruction of ecological corridors, pollution, invasive species, herbicides and pesticides, intensive land use, water quality and climate change have all created the biodiversity crisis in which we live.  It is a long list of issues which we must tackle.  We have no choice but to do so.  Increased protection for urban trees must also be introduced and not just a reliance on tree preservation orders.  A clean, healthy and functioning environment is a necessity for all life, for communities and for our economy.</p>  <p>  The forest fires on which other Deputies have commented today are not new events; they are annual events.  Some are accidental but many are deliberate actions to clear land.  The destruction in Killarney is heartbreaking but I expect to see something similar in Wicklow and other locations soon.  I really and truly hope I am wrong about that but it will not be surprising if it happens.  It will be condemned by everybody, and we will see loss of habitats and species that are already under severe pressure.  There must be concerted action on this issue between the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address this problem.  Investigations must be thorough and those responsible must be held to account and penalised for their actions.  I welcome the significant increase in funding for the NPWS, the increase in resources and the proposal to create a wildlife crime unit, which is vitally important.</p>  <p>  I also stress the importance of our marine environment.  It is a vital part of our entire ecosystem.  We must invest urgently in research and data gathering to progress the designation of marine protected areas.  We are committed to designating 30% of our sea area as protected but we need to act quickly.  I look forward to continued engagement with our environmental NGOs and with the Minister of State's Department and to the outcome of the ongoing public consultation on marine protected areas.  The Minister of State has a long list of issues to address in the heritage section.  I know from meetings with him and his departmental officials that he is committed to the task and I look forward to continuing to work with him and with our Oireachtas joint committee on these matters.</p></speech>

One aspect of legislation it amends is section 52 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This provides that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage shall:</p> <blockquote> 	issue guidelines to planning authorities concerning development objectives&mdash;  	(<i>a</i>) for protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, and<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) for preserving the character of architectural conservation areas.  </blockquote>  <p>I urge the Minister of State to use his newly-found freedom under this Act to protect the Hill of Allen from inevitable destruction if it continues to be left unprotected.  It is home to Aylmer&rsquo;s Folly, a tower which was built in 1859, and to an ancient burial chamber and burial mound.  On St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day, lights shone from the tower and were visible from all over Kildare, and this was a beacon of hope in these dark times.  I ask the Minister of State to take steps to add these structures to the record of monuments and places, the register of historic monuments, and ask that the option of bringing the site into public ownership be explored by the Department.</p></speech>

Obviously, once the Minister of State has these powers, I would like to see him intervene to protect the Moore Street battlefield site and the legacy of 1916.</p>  <p>  However, I want to focus on the question of development and housing development in particular.  Successive Ministers, including the recently retired former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister before him, Deputy Kelly, and many others, have brought us to the point where if we look around some of our cities now what we see is dereliction and the neglect of buildings.  I heard a piece about Cork city in that regard this morning.  Around my city of Dublin, however, it would not be necessary to go far from where I live into Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 to see how strategic development zones, SDZ, and strategic housing development, SHD, plans have utterly destroyed what should be considered proud heritage sites.  </p>  <p>  I refer in particular to the Coombe and parts of Dublin 8, which are the oldest parts of the oldest city in the country.  They have been given over to the vulture funds and to the developers who care little for the character of the inner city and those living there.  They only care to see development undertaken on a massive scale.  Dublin 8 alone is littered with aparthotels, student accommodation, co-living developments, buy-to-lets and all sorts of stuff which bypassed councillors and normal democratic planning through the strategic housing development process.  Not only have these developments not dealt with the housing crisis and the lack of housing in our city, they have actually exacerbated the crisis and made the situation worse.</p>  <p>  Therefore, we must pay a great deal of attention to our heritage and to protecting structures and seeing that as important but we must also pay attention to the people who live in the cities.  We must ensure their heritage and environment is not destroyed by the total nonsense and greed of developers without paying attention to what is needed, which is public and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  I cite the Dublin 8 area in particular, but I also refer to the area along the canal between Drimnagh and Bluebell.  In the next few years, the population there will almost treble because of the addition of another 4,500 apartments.  That is being done without any thought being given to the required strategic infrastructure, namely, schools, transport, shops, post offices and doctors' surgeries.  None of that has been given any thought.  It is the same in Cherry Orchard and Dublin 8.  Unless a Minister or a Minister of State really gets a grip of strategic development for city living soon, this city and other cities are going to be in desperate trouble due to the lack of resources, the overcrowding in badly-built accommodation and the lack of the required social and affordable housing.  I do not see how our heritage can gain one way or the other from that scenario.  We must protect our heritage but we also need to protect our people and development within our cities.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800043#QQ00100"><p>In the wake of the vandalism and illegal destruction by developers of the home of the revolutionary hero, The O'Rahilly, I submitted a question to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, asking whether an investigation had been carried out in relation to this destruction.  I expected that the Minister responsible for heritage, having seen the level of destruction of that heritage, would have taken it upon himself to hold an investigation, particularly in light of the fact that when I asked the Taoiseach a question in the D&aacute;il just before that, the Taoiseach responded by saying, "Given the significance of The O&rsquo;Rahilly in terms of the war for independence and his historic significance, to go in yesterday at dawn to destroy the building is absolutely shocking and unacceptable."  Those are the Taoiseach's words.</p>  <p>  I also thought the Minister would have investigated it because I raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in advance of the building being knocked down.  I told both the Minister and the Minister of State that the building was under significant threat of demolition in advance.  No action was taken, the building was demolished and a significant element of the heritage of this State was floored forever.  When I asked the question, shockingly, the answer I got back from the Minister was that he has "no official responsibility" for holding an investigation into the destruction of the home of The O'Rahilly.</p>  <p>  From what I can see, it is a typical example of Ministers saying it is not their responsibility, that one should look elsewhere and deflecting to other Departments.  I ask the Minister of State whether, if possible under the new regime, he will undertake an investigation into what happened to that building.  Will he ensure that we find out who was responsible for the destruction of our heritage?  Also, will he go about seeking for that building to be rebuilt and returned to its former state?</p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise in the short time I have is that of Moore Street.  The Moore Street battlefield site is the birthplace of the Irish Republic.  It is where the men and women of 1916 risked everything for an independent, democratic republic.  Part of the reason why the Minister and the Minister of State are able to be Ministers in this Republic, is because of the sacrifice of those men and women.  </p>  <p>  Yet, Moore Street is in a shocking situation.  It could be an international heritage hub or a cultural hub for the people of Dublin and the rest of the country.  It could be a market to rival the great markets of the rest of Europe.  What is Moore Street now?  It is an outdoor toilet.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.  If one speaks to many of the people who work on Moore Street, they will say that there is violence, drug use and people defecating in that street.  Moore Street has been allowed to fall into that level of dereliction by at least two Governments in the last while.  It is an incredible situation.  The Government actually owns buildings on Moore Street and is refusing to rejuvenate those buildings and turn them into heritage sites where people can engage and learn about the sacrifices of the men and women of 1916.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to take it upon himself to make sure that he does not leave office in the same manner as repeated Ministers with responsibility for heritage, leaving Moore Street standing in dereliction.</p>  <p>  The final point I wish to raise concerns Slieve na Calliagh, which is located in Loughcrew in the north-west part of County Meath.  It is a phenomenal passage tomb.  It is a tomb to rival Newgrange.  I have heard archaeologists refer to it as "Newgrange without the lipstick".  In other words, it is probably a more real example of what a passage grave would have looked like.  At the top of Slieve na Calliagh, one can see 18 counties.  In the past week, people have scribbled graffiti on neolithic art that has been there for thousands of years.  The tomb lies there and anyone can go up and lift anything they want from it.</p>  <p>  I ask that under this new regulation, the Minister and the Minister of State commit to safeguarding that particular site in order that the people of the world can celebrate the value that it has and can engage and learn about the people who lived at that time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800043#QQ00200"><p>I welcome the Bill, which largely tidies up the Mulcreevy judgment problem and ensures that the primary legislation complies with statutory instruments enacted.  I also welcome the move of responsibility for heritage to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As my colleague, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, has highlighted the issue of The O'Rahilly house and what happened there, it is beneficial that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage now has oversight in the area and that responsibility for heritage falls under its remit.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister will still be allowed to put on a heritage hat, as it were, and comment on proposed planning applications where there are heritage aspects involved.  Indeed, the Minister will be able to ask for full heritage studies in advance of SDZ planning or before An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes note of applications.  This is to be welcomed.  We have a rich and historical heritage in Ireland and we must do our best to protect it.  It is the envy of the world and one of the main drivers of foreign tourism into Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Under the Bill, there is support for the broadcasting sector.  As other Deputies have done, I would like to call for support for local radio stations, specifically, WLR FM and Beat FM in Waterford.  They provide a tremendous public and community service.  Like many businesses, they have seen their advertising revenue plummet.  I ask that the Government continues to provide support to these businesses and to the sector.</p>  <p>  Going back to the issue of heritage, I want to talk about heritage in my own county.  Waterford city is the oldest city in the country, dating back 1,100 years.  In the environs of the city is the oldest Viking site in the country, and probably the largest Viking site outside of mainland Europe, dating from 850 AD.  There are plans in the future to put some interpretation on this, and I hope that the Department will be supportive in the provision of revenue for that.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight two other initiatives that are presently ongoing in Waterford, namely, the development of a new time museum and a silver museum.  I hope that the time museum will soon be designated as the national Irish horological museum.  I invite the Minister and the Minister of State to come to Waterford for the opening of this museum. It contains examples of European clockmaking dating back to 1550 and Irish clockmaking dating back to 1680.  These exhibits are unparalleled anywhere else in the country.  I hope that they will help to drive tourism.  Indeed, the new Waterford silver museum is opening, which contains exhibits of Irish and British European silver that are unique in some parts of Europe.  I commend the previous Government on introducing section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Credit must go to the Government which has allowed people to claim tax benefits there and to provide exhibits to that museum.</p>  <p>  I also echo the comments of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and others about the Moore Street situation.  I would also like to see support for that centre and for plans to be developed in order to protect its structures.</p>  <p>  On another point in respect of heritage that will come up shortly under the national climate Bill, we will be looking at the issue of landscaping in terms of heritage.  I would point out that in the south of Ireland, there is a very different topography to that found in the west.  We have a significant amount of hedgerows.  I wonder how these are going to be calculated in the climate Bill.  It may be a discussion for another day, but I wish to flag that there are a significant amount of hedgerows in the south of the country.  They are part of carbon sequestration.  I would like to see how they are documented within the climate Bill.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the issue of the national marine planning framework, which is going through at the moment and is opening up the country to significant wind development, particularly along the south, south-east and south-wests coasts.  Again, as part of our national climate strategy we have not spoken about Government interaction with international data centres.  I contend that much of the wind generation that we are proposing to put offshore is going to be used up in powering these data centres.  In essence, there will be no green coupon for Ireland in terms of climate mitigation.  This is an issue which I hope this Department can take up with the Departments of Finance, and the Environment, Climate and Communications to ensure that we have a strategy that makes sense going forward.</p>  <p>  I welcome this largely technical Bill.  I extend a warm welcome to the Minister and the Minister of State to come to Waterford when the time museum opens shortly.  I hope it will be designated as the national horological museum in future.</p></speech>

It is an important Bill and its provisions should not be underestimated.  It enables the transfer of heritage functions from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  I want to use this opportunity to highlight the wealth of heritage sites in County Clare.  From east to west, there is an abundance of natural sites in the county, including native woodlands, cliffs and caves, as well as settlement sites, such as castles and walled gardens.  These sites tie us to, and remind us of, our history, roots and ancestry.  They also serve as tourist attractions that allow revenue to flow into less urbanised parts of our island.  At present, there are tree sites in Clare under the management of the commercial property company, Shannon Group plc, namely, Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen Castle and Knappogue Castle.  The issue that is brought to my office on a regular basis by constituents revolves around their concern that a commercial property company, driven solely by profit, is responsible for the management and preservation of these ancient historic sites of our shared heritage.  I and other elected representatives have raised this matter in the past and put forward proposals that the Office of Public Works, OPW, or Clare County Council become the steward of these sites and assume responsibility for managing them.</p>  <p>  I request that the Minister of State look into this matter.  I invite him to engage with the elected representatives in the county and liaise with potential stakeholders, including Clare County Council and the OPW.  I will conclude by mentioning the Trojan work the council has done in reinvigorating interest in the Cliffs of Moher and creating a huge amount of footfall there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800044#RR00300"><p>I propose to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.  This is a technical Bill, the purpose of which is to amend existing legislation to allow the transfer of functions relating to heritage under a number of enactments to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  These powers and functions come under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, the Wildlife Act 1976, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.</p><p>My expectation is that this Bill will further help to protect wildlife.  That is welcome, especially in a week when the Government introduced a new farm scheme, the results-based environment-agri pilot programme, REAP, as a successor to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  The REAP, which is being piloted in rural Ireland, exempts farmers who have heather on their farm from participating.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is not responsible for agriculture but, in the name of God, how could a Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government, which also includes the Green Party, attack our wildlife in the way it has?  I have very serious concerns for our wildlife arising out of this initiative and I ask the Minister of State to intervene personally, with his fellow Ministers.</p><p>This has happened before.  When farmers were penalised for having gorse and heather on their land on that occasion, it led to a community group in west Cork taking legal action against the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is a terrible infliction on the people of rural Ireland when, whether we like it or not, those plants are present on most farms.  At that time, I said to the people in the Department's office in Portlaoise that the decision would lead to an inferno throughout the country.  Sadly, that turned out to be the case, as people had to burn their land because they were being seriously fined.  If the REAP is introduced, I am afraid it will lead to the destruction of habitats.  It is a very serious issue.</p><p>This Bill gives the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage new powers.  I am concerned that those powers may not be exercised fairly.  Two years ago, the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, struck out a democratic vote in a committee of the Oireachtas on heritage legislation.  That vote would have seen verge-cutting dates extended, which would have helped with an issue that is a nightmare for rural communities.  She did so with the stroke of a pen.  I chaired the meeting of the committee, of which I was Vice Chairman, in which the vote was clearly carried that the verge-cutting season should be extended a month both ways.  That was a fabulous provision that would have given people a chance to have safe roads.  However, the then Minister, Deputy Madigan, attended some meeting or other, after which she came in and struck out that provision with the stroke of a pen.  My worry is that if we give too much power to people, power is taken from this democratic D&aacute;il.  I am very concerned to ensure that does not happen in this instance.  There is nothing worse than having overgrown verges, which are a great danger to parents travelling with children in their cars.  The overgrowth causes accidents on rural roadways.  I said to the then Minister at the time that she was surrounded by tar and chipping and it was lovely for her that she did not understand how it is to live in a rural community and have to cut verges.</p><p>I want to talk about the broadcasting aspect of the Bill.  The State must change how our main broadcaster works and the monopoly on funding that exists.  RT&Eacute; commands the full licence fee, which gives it tens of millions of euro, but will not put out a fair and balanced programme one day after another.  In its reports on the climate action Bill that went through the D&aacute;il last week, RT&Eacute; had speaker after speaker on television and radio, all of whom were &quot;Yes&quot; people.  The Rural Independent Group is the only group in the House that has raised concerns about the provisions of that Bill and we were not allowed a minute to voice them on any programme.  This raises a very serious question about the fairness of our national broadcaster on this and other issues.  I have been inundated with calls, emails and texts from a public furious at the way RT&Eacute; has been allowed to carry on.</p><p>Today is a turning point.  The Rural Independent Group will make sure we call out this disgraceful carry-on.  The only way that the tables will turn in a fair and distributive way is if the television licence money is spread out to other media providers, including Virgin Media, Gript and local radio stations and newspapers.  The situation of local radio stations has been raised before in the House.  In Cork, we have C103, RedFM and 96FM.  They are fabulous radio stations that get very little of the funding they need from the State.  We also have local newspapers, including the <i>Southern Star</i>and <i>The Echo</i>.  Perhaps the television licence should be renamed the television, radio and newspaper licence and the fees distributed fairly.  The State's money should be spent in a fair and proper way as we move forward.  We cannot continue to fund a State broadcaster that decides to keep out one side of a story and has no fair balance.</p><p>I will finish by talking about sculptures.  We have some fabulous sculptures in west Cork, including one in Crookhaven.  The Ceann Comhairle said he would like to go to Waterford.  We would be delighted to see him down in west Cork, in Mizen Head, the Beara Peninsula, Clonakilty or any of the beautiful places there.  The Taoiseach and many others like to swim there.  The Ceann Comhairle would be most welcome to come and see our sculptures.</p></speech>

I approached the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, a short time ago to raise an issue I have written to him about before, namely, Knocklofty House Hotel, the wonderful, majestic and historic building on the pleasant banks of the River Suir in County Tipperary.  The Ceann Comhairle may be surprised, given that a bust of Queen Victoria and a statue of William of Orange are to be found there, that I want to keep the building safe.  I do so for the very particular reason that it is part of our built heritage.  It has 365 windows looking out to sea.  There is an amount of history in it, about Labhraidh Loingseach and the fiddle that would only play and bh&iacute; dh&aacute; chluas capaill ar Labhraidh Loingseach.  I will tell the Minister of State the story when he goes there.  He would be most welcome.  When he goes to Waterford, he can go trasna na habhann to Tipperary.</p>  <p>  Knocklofty House was home to Lord and Lady Donoughmore, their family and, indeed, the Guinness family.  I remember knocking on the door one day as a young man selling grass seeds.  I was greeted by the lovely Lord Donoughmore, in fairness to him, and his two Alsatian dogs.  I thought I was going to be eaten alive but, no, I got a lovely welcome.  I have a story about the house from back in the troubled time.  It was not a case of "d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i".  I got it directly from my father, who was an active service member in the old IRA, and proud of it, in the third Tipperary brigade.  He was in the Newcastle battalion, the greatest of battalions.  In the business I was in back in the 1980s, I was involved in clearing some of the orchard attached to Knocklofty House.  Those freedom fighters dwelled and practised in that orchard.  They later got refuge in some of Knocklofty's outhouses and other buildings during the troubled time when they were on the run.  They were looked after there pleasantly.</p>  <p>  Lord Donoughmore went over to the House of Lords and condemned the actions of the Black and Tans in Ireland and what was going on here.  His house was spared.  It was never burned, like many houses in Tipperary were burned to the ground.  We must keep that memory and the heritage of the building, including the statues of Queen Victoria and William of Orange, even though one gets a one-sided story about King Billy when one goes to Belfast City Hall.  It is our heritage and we must look after it.  The building has been raped and plundered and the lead taken out of the roofs.  I thank Jonathan Flood, senior planner, and Tony O'Mara, technician, in Tipperary County Council, who have come out to look at the building at the request of me, Councillor M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath and others.  A Facebook page has been set up to save Knocklofty House.</p> <p>It is a wonderful part of our built heritage, as I have said.  When I was young, there were 50 or 60 people working there with a big bell, like a church bell, in the yard to call people to their meals.  So many families were looked after and fed there, and many who went on to do great things had parents who worked there.  I remember one, Mr. P.J. Cullen, who worked there as a gardener when the gardens were spectacular.  The house has gone to rack and ruin and we must do something to preserve it.</p> <p> I know it is caught between vulture funds and the owner in the courts but it should not be allowed to fall into a state of disrepair.  Weddings, fun fairs and county council meetings were all held there.  LEADER programme launches were held there as well.  It should not be the way it is now because it is part of our heritage.  The Minister of State is welcome to come see it.  I and many others want to have it restored.  It is very important to learn from the history we have, especially in this decade of commemorations involving all traditions and none.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimhe go l&eacute;ir go Tiobraid &Aacute;rann theas agus Knocklofty House.</p> <p> I welcome today's announcement that 60 new heritage officers or wildlife rangers will be appointed.  That is very welcome because they have a difficult job.  However, we need balance.  I was appalled when Deputy Madigan, a predecessor of the Minister of State in the Department, threw out, like a bucket of water over a gate,  two years of hard work done by committees, farmers and different groups who were trying to bring about sensible hedge cutting on roads and dangerous areas.  It is not about going into fields when birds are nesting or where they normally nest.  The safety of cyclists, motorists and pedestrians must come first at all costs as far as I am concerned.</p> <p> I also have a concern about RT&Eacute;.  There should be fair distribution of funding.  Television licence fees are paid by the majority of people.  Tipp FM and Tipperary Mid West Radio must get a fair share, along with community radio stations and even smaller operations.  They should be allowed some of this funding.  It is time we dealt with the matter as the funding is not fairly distributed.  TG4 must be supported and we must look at broadcasting, including podcasts, in a different way.  It is not a monopoly any more.  It is important that the heritage and history of people all around Ireland is heard, and not just in Montrose or Dublin 4.  Ireland does not end at the Naas Road and RT&Eacute; should be made aware of that.</p></speech>

Ireland&rsquo;s heritage, including that which is built, natural, cultural and linguistic, tangible and intangible, is of fundamental importance to all aspects of our society, identity, well-being and economy.  However, our heritage faces many challenges, including those stemming from land use change, climate change and biodiversity loss, dereliction and a lack of awareness of the value of heritage.</p><p>The Government is making a significant investment in the heritage sector with a view to addressing biodiversity loss, habitat restoration and species protection. It is also undertaking essential investment in our national parks, nature reserves, heritage estates and national monuments.  For example, earlier this year, funding of &euro;1.35 million was announced for local authority biodiversity projects, including &euro;500,000 for projects targeting invasive alien species.  A significant funding increase in 2021 to &euro;1.89 million means that the NPWS farm plan scheme has been expanded.  Some &euro;14 million, including &euro;5 million from the carbon tax fund, has been allocated to the conservation, management and restoration of protected raised bogs in 2021.</p><p>Our national parks and nature reserves have remained open for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has been important to keep this 87,000 ha network accessible to the public in order to provide areas where people can get fresh air, experience nature and exercise, while still being able to adhere to physical distancing protocols.  It is very important we have these facilities accessible to the public and keep them open.</p><p>More and more we are looking to nature to assist in solving some of the biggest challenges society faces.  This includes in cities, where it can offer a range of benefits, from sustainable urban drainage to air purification to urban cooling.  It also includes rural areas.  Nature-based solutions, such as protecting and restoring wetlands, peatlands and coastal ecosystems, and the sustainable management of marine areas, forests, grasslands and agricultural soils are essential for emissions reduction and climate adaptation.</p><p>The intention behind the Planning and Development, Heritage and Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2021 is not to alter existing Government policy or to introduce new policy.  It is a technical Bill, the primary function of which is to facilitate the transfer of the heritage powers and functions to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under a number of enactments currently held by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  In that regard, the overall objective is to give legislative underpinning to the full transfer of these powers and function to the Minister through amending certain primary and secondary legislation as required.</p><p>This transfer arises as part of the reorganisation of ministerial and departmental responsibilities following the formation of the Government in 2020.  The heritage powers and functions come under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Wildlife Act 1976, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  Issues arise, which the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, mentioned, that require primary legislation in order to fully implement the transfer of the powers and functions from one Minister to the other.<b></b>The purpose of the Bill is to amend certain sections within the various Acts, the 2011 regulations and the Broadcasting Act 2009 and to make provision relating to certain planning matters relating to heritage.</p><p>In summary, the proposed amendments in the Bill with respect to the heritage functions provide for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to: be sent notice regarding proposed variations to planning authority development plans and the making of such a variation; undertake certain heritage functions without needing to consult with another Minister, for example, to prescribe the form of a record of protected architectural structures; lawfully comment on planning applications and draft development plans from a heritage perspective; and seek the observations of any Minister or Ministers, as the Minister considers appropriate, in the process of the designation of sites as natural heritage areas.  The Minister may also keep them informed of developments in the designation or direction process for special areas of conservation and special protection areas by, for example, causing a copy of the particulars of a candidate special area of conservation to be sent to another Minister or Ministers; causing notice of the designation of a site as a special area of conservation or an amendment to or the revocation of the designation of a site as a special area of conservation to be sent to another Minister or Ministers; causing notice of the designation of a site, an amendment to or the revocation of the  designation of a site as a special protection area or of a decision not to designate a site as a special protection area to be sent to another Minister or Ministers; and causing a copy of any direction given under regulation 28(1) of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 to be sent to another Minister or Ministers.</p><p>The Ministers to be involved in the process would depend of the functions of Ministers, which may vary over time.  For example, they could include the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, food and the marine, the environment, climate and communications and rural and community development.  This could be done to make regulations with respect to access to or use of the foreshore for nature conservation purposes and to engage in the planning process with respect to the heritage function, such as in making an application for planning permission or an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, notwithstanding section 30(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which prohibits the Minister from exercising any power or control in any particular planning case.  This will ensure, for example, that the Minister is in a position to lodge planning applications for developments, which may be required as part of the heritage brief.</p><p>Some of the proposed amendments set out in the Bill have been prepared to allow for the amended sections in the relevant Act or the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 to function without further amendment in the event that ministerial heritage functions were, at some future time, separated again from planning functions.  Examples include section 13 which amends section 16(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, and section 14, which amends the designation of sites as special areas of conservation and special protection areas and direction provisions of the 2011 regulations.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I should also mention that in various sections of Part 2 of the Bill, there are standard saver provisions providing that no amendment by the Bill shall be construed as to affect the continuance or validity of anything done under the relevant provisions of the Wildlife Act 1976, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  We are working hard to deliver on the ambition set out in the programme for Government with respect to heritage.  This Bill will assist us in that process.</p> <p> The Bill also provides for technical amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009 to allow for the transfer to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media from the Minister for Transport of consultation and consent functions held by him under the Act that are now inconsistent with his role.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, mentioned, Part 3 of the Bill contains two sections amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 arising from the establishment of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in 2020.  Responsibilities for broadcasting and sport, previously under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, now rest with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  However, the Minister for Transport has retained consultation and consent functions under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  In order to facilitate the completion of the transfer of these functions to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, it is now proposed to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 as set out in sections 16 and 17 of the Bill.  We are pleased to be in a position to do this.</p> <p> With regard to outdoor amenities, I wish to announce that Scragh Bog Nature Reserve, which was closed for a number of months due to issues there, will be reopened during the May bank holiday weekend, hopefully, on Monday.  This is very important for the many people in Mullingar who were advocating for it to be opened.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of Dearbhla O'Sullivan who set up an online petition to highlight this issue and how important it is for people in Mullingar.  It is a treasure on the outskirts of the town.  The Government is spending &euro;170,000 in capital expenditure to upgrade it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800047#VV00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021 is a relatively short but significant item of legislation.  I am very pleased to introduce it to the House.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the repeal of the second or subsequent mandatory sentences in the areas of firearms and misuse of drugs.  It also addresses similar mandatory type offences in older legislation dealing with the concealment of stolen goods, illicit distillation and licensing laws.</p> <p>The Supreme Court ruling in its judgment of 15 May 2019 in Wayne Ellis <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality, found subsection 8 of section 27(A) of the Firearms Act 1964, regarding possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, to be repugnant to the Constitution.  The subsection provides for a mandatory sentence of a minimum of five years for a second or subsequent serious firearms offence.  The court held that the Oireachtas may impose mandatory penalties but only if they apply to all persons.  It is not constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to specify a mandatory penalty that only applies to a limited class of persons, such as those who had previously committed one or more listed offences.  The application of a penalty in such cases is the administration of justice and under Article 34 of the Constitution may only be administered by the courts.  The Attorney General has advised that this subsection, and all similar provisions on the Statute Book, should be repealed and that no further sentencing hearings should proceed until the relevant legislation has been amended.<br/><br/>The full implications of the judgment for existing sentences have yet to be worked through by the courts.  I understand a number of cases are under way and Deputies will appreciate that I cannot say anything that might be regarded as prejudicing existing proceedings.  In this context, however, my attention has been drawn to paragraph 22 of the judgment of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton in the Ellis case, in which he states:</p><blockquote>	This does not mean, and should not mean in this case, the automatic release of the offender.  The correct disposal of the matter requires further submission as to the imposition of a just sentence before the Court of Appeal. </blockquote> <p>I understand that the issue in these cases is that the appropriate sentencing regime be applied.<br/><br/>The purpose of this Bill is to rectify the constitutional infirmity identified by the Supreme Court for the purpose of determining future sentences in these cases.  The Supreme Court ruling does not affect provisions in the statute which provide for presumptive minimum sentences where there is judicial discretion and the issue is not addressed by the Bill.<br/><br/>The scope of the Bill is therefore limited.  The sentencing provision that was the subject of the Ellis case was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  The 2007 Act had a number of similar provisions affecting a number of firearms offences and certain drug offences.  While the court had discretion in the case of a first conviction, its discretion was fettered in respect of a second or subsequent conviction and there were mandatory minimum penalties that had to be imposed.  The Bill provides the courts with discretion in respect of a second or subsequent firearms conviction in this regard.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for the repeal of all instances within the Firearms and Misuse of Drugs Acts in respect of a second or subsequent conviction being mandatory.<br/><br/>The first three sections of the Bill refer to pre-1922 legislation that is still in force in Ireland.  These older Acts have unusual provisions, with a type of mandatory sentence for repeat offenders.  These, too, are in conflict with the judgment in the Ellis case and are being amended accordingly.<br/><br/>Section 1 relates to section 49 of the Dublin Police Magistrates Act 1808 and mandatory penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to the concealment of stolen goods.  Section 2 relates to section 40 of the Illicit Distillation (Ireland) Act 1831 and penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to illicit making of malt and distillation of spirits.  Section 3 relates to section 32 of the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act 1860 and penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to wine licences for refreshment houses.  Section 4 relates to the amendment of section 15 of the Firearms Act 1925, which provides for penalties for the offence of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life.<br/><br/>Section 5 relates to the amendment of section 26 of the Firearms Act 1964, which provides for penalties for possession of a firearm while taking a vehicle without authority; section 27 of the Firearms Act 1964, which provides for penalties for use of firearms to assist or aid escape; section 27A of the Firearms Act 1964, which provides for penalties for possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances and section 27B of the Firearms Act 1964, which provides for penalties for carrying a firearm with criminal intent.<br/><br/>Section 6 relates to the amendment of section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, which provides for penalties for a range of offences relating to the  misuse of drugs.  Section 7 relates to the amendment of section 12A of Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, which provides for penalties for shortening the barrel of shotgun or rifle and similar offences.  Section 8 relates to the amendment of section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, which provides penalties for the commission of a scheduled offence where a person has already been convicted on indictment of a scheduled offence within a specified period.  Section 9 relates to the amendment of section 24 of the Parole Act 2019, which provides that a person serving a minimum term of imprisonment under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 shall not be eligible for parole before expiry of the minimum term.  Section 10 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement.<br/><br/>My Department is also considering the implications of the judgment for existing criminal cases where the persons concerned may have been convicted of a relevant offence but a sentence has not, as of yet, been imposed by the courts.  Further to legal advice, I will give consideration to the tabling of a Committee Stage amendment that would clarify the sentencing regime that would apply in such cases.  There will, of course, be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail any aspect of the Bill that Deputies wish to explore further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800048#WW00200"><p>First, we welcome this legislation, which as the Minister of State said is to deal with the Supreme Court case of Wayne Ellis <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in May 2019 and the anomalies that threw up.</p><p>It is clear from that case, if we look at the reality, that what was really happening is a person's prior conviction for various offences was being used as means to give him or her a larger or more severe sentence for a particular case that was before the court when they were being convicted.  It meant that, in a way, a person's past was being used to inflict an additional punishment on the present.  While we see that situation certainly coming into play with regard to bail applications and things like that, it is something we have to reflect upon.</p><p>That is not to say there should not be some measure to bring that into consideration in situations where people have a history of particularly extreme violent offences.  What the Supreme Court and Mr. Justice Peter Charleton said, however, is that this should be up to the judge in each individual case.  It must be looked at on an individual business.  It cannot be done on a general scheme, as was done in many varied aspects of pieces of law that have to be amended on foot of all this.</p><p>The truth is that many people in communities across the length and breadth of the country are suffering hugely because of issues of drug abuse and the crimes around that.  Drug gangs are putting huge pressure on communities with intimidation and all sorts of terrible things are happening.</p><p>Many people in ordinary communities sometimes feel very aggrieved when they see people who they know are doing terrible things in their community.  They are worried about the light sentences these people receive and how they do not seem to be dealt with effectively or efficiently by the judicial system on one hand, but also that the Garda does not seem to have the resources to deal with it.</p><p>That comes into focus when we look at all this.  We have to really consider who the victims are in all these cases.  The victims are thousands of people in communities across the entire country, but particularly in what we would call the black spots where we have particular problems in urban areas.  Often, these problems are most magnified.  Inner city Dublin is probably a case and an example, as are parts of Limerick and Cork and also other cities around the country.  As we know, Dundalk has recently been one of the focal points of much of this.</p><p>The communities who live in these areas tell us that they live in fear and feel that the Garda and the authorities are not in control.  That is the first job of work that must be done to resolve these situations.  Control needs to be taken back.  Every effort needs to be made in those particular areas to put resources in to ensure that control can be taken back and then to break the cycle of criminal activity within these communities.</p><p>The most important thing to do, however, is to try to work on measures to have that control taken away from the criminal gangs and put back into the hands of the authorities, and particularly, into the hands of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In reality, members of the Garda are the only ones who can do this in these situations.  I commend the work they have done in many places around the country and in many of these areas where they have a very tough job facing down these violent criminal gangs.</p><p>The reality is also that when people in these communities report things to the Garda or seek assistance, such assistance comes but it can often be late.  People can often find it frustrating.  I spoke to a woman recently who told me about contacting her local Garda station.  She was told there was no car available to go out to a very serious incident that was happening on her road.</p> <p>That issue would be echoed by many people in communities across the country.  The basic resources the Garda need to deal with these problems are not in place.  There needs to be a huge effort to ensure we can gain back control in these communities.  To regain the confidence of the people in these communities, we will have to put the resources in place.  That will require much more community policing.</p> <p> There is this notion among the senior ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that every garda is a community garda.  The truth is that this is not the experience of many people.  There is an awful lot of specialisation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with dedicated units for various action, which are needed.  The emphasis on the community garda, however, who is known in the area, with whom people will work, have a relationship and trust, is needed.  The community garda to whom people can tell things in confidence has been taken away from many communities.  That needs to be restored as an absolute priority.</p> <p> For the many young people who get caught up in these gangs, it is almost a life sentence in itself.  Once they get a toe in the water, it is like quicksand.  They are sucked in and there is no coming back.  For many young people and their families, we must find a way of breaking this tragedy.</p> <p> I recently watched the excellent film, "Michael Inside" which I am sure the Minister saw, which is about a young man in inner city Dublin who gets caught up in a drug gang.  He is asked to keep some drugs in his house but it is raided by the Garda drugs squad and he gets a short term in prison.  He is sucked into that gang mentality of being on one side or the other.  With the best of intentions, his grandfather who he lives with tries to help him out.  However, there is no way out of it.  Thugs intimidate him and push him into a certain situation.</p> <p> Speaking to people on the ground, they tell me that what is in that drama is very real to the lives of many people living in these communities.  The film tells a story about the failure of services and the authorities to be able to break that cycle, to move in at the right time to ensure that the young man in questioned is not forced into a gang.  The end of the film is tragic with the young man in prison watching another prisoner smoking heroin.  Obviously, the message of the tale is that this is the direction in which the young man will end up.</p> <p> Many of these young people can be saved.  The situation can be reversed and it is not hopeless.  This is the message that the Government and the authorities need to bring to these communities.  Many communities have thrown their hands up in the air, considering it all to be hopeless and over.  We cannot allow that to be the narrative.  The narrative must be a positive one.  We must believe that we can move this into a different place, that we can defeat these violent drug gangs and everything they do.  We must believe we can reverse the misery, as well as the lifestyle of horror and terror that they bring to communities.  We can bring hope back.  However, we need to make sure the resources are put in place to do that.</p> <p> The first thing we must do is get control back of these communities.  That is an action that can only be taken by the Garda.  We must ensure we put enough community garda&iacute; on the streets in these communities.  Tough action must also be taken by the Garda to deal with the heroin houses or the one or two places in an estate where we know people deal drugs.</p> <p> The local authorities have a role to play as well.  They are slow to evict people from local authority housing who they know are involved in criminal activities.  The local authorities claim they do not want to do that because they will get into a litigation process which will cost them a lot of money which they cannot afford to spend.  The Minister of State needs to look at how we can have co-operation between the Department of Justice and local authorities to ensure they can move it to a different place.</p> <p> The essence of this Bill is about sentencing.  It brings a focus on what we are sentencing for.  We are talking about violent crime and misery in communities.  We need to do everything we can to defeat these drug gangs.  While all Members are united in trying to do that, unfortunately, the actions do not move beyond here.  We need to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

As Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, this is only part of the wider picture.  It all depends on the mechanisms by which legislation is enforced.  The personnel involved in this are our garda&iacute; who are on the front line.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, it is all very well for us to talk about the need for supports in communities, as well as the need for us to tackle drug-related and gang-related crime, the scourge of communities the length and breadth of this State.  My community in north County Dublin is no different and is not immune from this.</p><p>The best way to tackle this scourge is by resourcing community garda&iacute; and not pretending that every garda is a community one.  Not every garda can be a community garda.  A community garda is the one who is on the ground, picking up those little bits of intelligence.  The community garda is the one talking to the kids from an early age and who knows the communities.  It seems sometimes that there is not enough value placed on that work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is essential, however.  Legislation can only ever be a small part of the jigsaw.  The men and women who enforce it are the biggest and most important part.</p><p>The verdict of the Supreme Court held that, while the Oireachtas can impose mandatory penalties for offences, it can only do so where those penalties apply to all persons equally.  Specifically, the Oireachtas cannot create a mandatory penalty which only applies to a particular class of persons, such as a person who has previously committed a particular offence or offences.</p><p>Rectifying these matters is necessary and reinforces the importance of the independence of our judicial system.  Last week, the Supreme Court made an extremely important ruling on the Workplace Relations Commission.  This decision of the court needs to be legislated for as a matter of urgency.  The ruling by the Supreme Court in the case of Tomasz Zalewski and the Workplace Relations Commission outlined several issues relating to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, which are inconsistent with the Constitution.  While the Supreme Court rejected the challenge to the Workplace Relations Commission, finding that it was not offensive to the Constitution, the seven-judge panel did, however, rule that aspects of certain legislation are inconsistent with the Constitution.  It is imperative that changes are made to the referenced legislation as soon as possible to ensure that its operation is brought in line with the Constitution.</p><p>It is for that reason that I have engaged with the Minister of State with responsibility for employment, Deputy English.  I have shared with him legislation I have drafted which will address these issues, bringing both the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 in line with the Constitution.  Following the ruling of the Supreme Court, I have sought to address the issues such as the ban on public hearings before the Workplace Relations Commission, the absence of a requirement to give evidence on oath, as well as the lack of a specific reference in the legislation to a right to cross-examine anyone giving evidence, among others, by way of the Workplace Relations (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p><p>There is no doubt that rectifying these issues is an area where the Opposition and the Government agree and that solutions be enacted as soon as possible.  I met with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on Tuesday morning and had a positive engagement with him.  It is important that legislation, whether it is mine or the Government's, is enacted to transpose the decision of the Supreme Court into law.</p><p>Leafing through this Bill before us reinforces the need to keep a keen eye on our legislation.  It is important not to lose sight of the opportunities we have as legislators to update Bills in order to cut issues off at the pass to ensure they do not have to be escalated to the Supreme Court.  Will the Minister of State consider the notion of putting in a review clause to deal with anomalies quickly?  While there are review clauses in some legislation, they tend just to be box-ticking exercises.</p><p>I wish to raise a small issue but one which has affected us all at some stage as we go about our work, namely, the lack of consolidated Acts online.</p> <p>The Law Reform Commission has many consolidated Acts online but there are also many which are missing.  There would be great benefit in supporting the commission to get as many consolidated Acts as possible published online.  The latter would help all of us so I ask the Minister of State to take that suggestion on board.</p></speech>

There are a number of Acts which this Bill will affect.  The Minister of State has mentioned them, as have my colleagues.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that this issue is being dealt with but we need to go further.  We need to think of the human rights of victims of crime and we need to do more on crime prevention.  Garda visibility is a key part of crime prevention and detection.  We need to invest in our justice system. Sinn F&eacute;in in government will recruit 800 Garda members per annum to gradually increase the strength of the force above 16,000.  We have one of the lowest policing ratios in Europe and this must change.  We will review the need for new Garda stations in areas that are under siege.  We must also ensure that the Garda stations we have are fit for purpose and that garda&iacute; are available when needed.  The Minister of State will have heard Teachta Martin Kenny talking about sGarda car.  The same thing has happened in my area as well, on many occasions.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will speed up civilianisation by recruiting 550 Garda staff per annum.  This will free garda&iacute; from office work which they really should not be doing and where it is not essential for it to be carried out by sworn members.  Garda&iacute; should really be out on patrol on the streets instead of in offices doing this work.</p>  <p>  We also have the farcical situation whereby up to 50% of all front-line garda&iacute; do not have the adequate training and clearance to pursue cars at high speed, according to the Garda Representative Association.  This is a significant problem given that many stations cover vast rural areas and if garda&iacute; cannot pursue criminals at speed, it seriously hampers their ability to tackle crime.  We need to form rural crime task forces in all rural Garda divisions.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will implement the Commission on the Future of Policing recommendations on technology and provide garda&iacute; with the tools to tackle crime in rural and remote areas.  Years of neglect and indifference to rural Ireland must stop, and stop now.</p>  <p>  We need to reform joint policing committees to give them more powers and give local communities more influence on policing.  We also need more community wardens for county councils to assist with planning safer communities.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will bring community garda&iacute; back up to 2010 levels and put in place restorative justice schemes complementary to, and not as a substitute for, civic policing.</p>  <p>  Finally, I want to address the epidemic of illegal dumping that is plaguing rural Ireland.  We must resolve issues around CCTV use and work together to ensure communities can be protected from this blight on our landscape.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800050#YY00300"><p>I wish to signal the Labour Party's support for this short but important item of legislation.  The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Ellis <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice on 15  May 2019.  According to the Supreme Court:</p> <blockquote> 	[The case raised an] important and difficult question of the constitutional boundary between the respective roles of the Oireachtas and the Courts in deciding what is the appropriate sentence to be served by a person convicted of an offence. </blockquote>  <p>As the Minister of State indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to deal with all other legislation that suffers from the defect identified in the Ellis case.  That case concerned a firearms offence for which the Oireachtas had prescribed a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, but only for a second or subsequent offence.  The court outlined principles relevant to the separation of powers and the respective roles of the Oireachtas and the courts in determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted.  Both the Oireachtas, as part of the lawmaking function, and the courts, as part of the administration of justice, have a role in determining a sentence.  However, there is a clear distinction between the prescription of a penalty, fixed or otherwise, and the selection of a penalty for a particular case.</p><p>It is constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to provide in legislation that a specified penalty will apply on the commission of a specified identified defence that all persons convicted of a particular offence, such as murder, shall be subject to the same fixed prescribed penalty.  That is not in breach of the separation of powers, although it would be subject to separate constitutional constraints which require a rational relationship between the penalty and the gravity of the offence - it would not, for example, be open to the Oireachtas to prescribe an outlandish penalty for a relatively minor offence.  Otherwise, however, the selection of the punishment to be imposed on a particular person convicted of a particular offence forms part of the administration of justice role which, under the Constitution, is exclusively a matter for judges sitting in our national courts.  The convicted person has a constitutional right to receive a sentence appropriate to his or her degree of guilt and to his or her relevant personal circumstances.  The legislation in this case has sought to provide a fixed or a minimum mandatory sentence which did not apply to all persons convicted of that offence but only to that limited class of offenders determined by reference to one characteristic of the offender, namely, that an individual offender had prior convictions.  Prior convictions always form part of the consideration of the factors by a sentencing judge in reaching what he or she determines to be the appropriate sentence.</p><p>The question to be determined here was whether it was permissible for the Oireachtas to legislate for a mandatory minimum penalty which is not universally applied to all persons convicted of that particular offence.  The penalty applied only to a limited class of persons who committed the offence and the class was determined by reference to only one of the potential relevant circumstances in which the offence was committed only one of the characteristics of the offender would be taken into account in determining the sentence.  The court, looking at that, held that the Oireachtas had impermissibly crossed the dividing line in that constitutional separation of powers between the prescription of a general sentence for an offence and the selection of the appropriate sentence in each individual case.  This, therefore, has wider implications than simply the case at hand and that is why a number of statutes, all listed by the Minister of State and referenced by some of my colleagues, are being amended.</p><p>It raises also the broader issues I have dealt with in contributions in this House over the years, including the broader issue of the appropriateness of mandatory sentences is in any event.  The classic arguments for mandatory sentences are first that there is clarity, so that somebody who is about to commit an offence understands there is a very serious penalty prescribed in law; for example, anybody contemplating murder knows there is a mandatory life sentence if he or she is convicted of it.  The second argument concerns consistency.  It is important that a sentence is not determined by the individual judge or the geographical location and that there is clarity in the context of sentences.  The third argument is obviously what is in the mind of Members of the Oireachtas in determining criminal sanctions, namely, the effect of a deterrent.  Thus, clarity, consistency and acting as a deterrent are the normal arguments put forward for mandatory sentences.  However, there is an argument against, namely, that every case is different and every set of circumstances is unique.  As we listen in more and more to court cases or read about them in our national newspapers we understand the various differences involved in sometimes very serious criminal activity.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Flexibility must be given to professional and competent judges to form their decisions on what is the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances that cannot be in the minds of legislators and that apply or occur in any individual case.</p> <p>  The advent of the Judicial Council and the availability of advices from their peers on sentencing lessens the need for mandatory sentences.  I am mindful of the experience in other jurisdictions.  Often in times of heightened concern about relatively small numbers of offences, people are genuinely frightened, particularly elderly citizens in our communities.  They feel particularly vulnerable to crime and reading about it, hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television genuinely frightens them.  There is often a political response to that because politicians are summoned to public meetings, there are concerns that there is not enough strength in the law and quite often, as is our tool, legislators reach for stronger legislation.</p> <p> If one looks at the experience in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States for example, sometimes that has resulted in disastrous consequences.  If one looks at the general incarceration rate in the United States, it is quite shocking.  What is even more shocking is the three-strikes law if one commits three crimes.  Whatever the third crime is, such as not paying alimony or a road traffic offence for example, if it is an indictable offence one faces mandatory life imprisonment in some states in the United States.  That falls disproportionately on some sectors of the community, such as the poor, and the United States is also racially unbalanced.  In five US states, including the state of Minnesota, which has been in sharp focus in recent times, black males are incarcerated at a rate of 10:1 in comparison with white males.  A black man has ten times the prospect of being incarcerated as a white man in five US states.  In the state of Oklahoma, one in 15 black adult males is in prison.  In 11 states, one in 20 black adult males is in prison.  In 2010 in the United States, black people made up 13% of the population and 40% of those who were in jail.</p> <p> That brings us to the broader issue of politics and crime.  Fear of crime is much more prevalent than people's experience of crime.  We have, in relative terms, a low rate of crime in this country thank God.  That does not mean many in our communities are not in dreadful fear of their personal safety or the safety of their families or children.  Fear of crime is a hugely debilitating and life-limiting issue that we as politicians need to address.  Politicians rightly respond to the concerns of our electorate and mandatory sentencing is often the solution or remedy that is put forward at public meetings and offered by us in the Oireachtas.</p> <p> I am glad we have a Judiciary that is not elected, whose members are appointed professionally and who cannot be removed except for extraordinary and exceptional matters.  In fact, we have never impeached a judge since the Constitution was enacted in this State.  Judges are not subject to external pressures in the administration of justice.  That is an extraordinarily important bulwark for us and a great safety for our people.  As an adjunct to that statement, it is important that the Judiciary are plugged into the reality of life for many of our citizens and communities, particularly vulnerable communities which some colleagues have described earlier and where there is a lot of criminality.  Even low level criminality is extraordinarily debilitating.  If people cannot walk out their doors, across their streets or across their estates without feeling intimidated, being followed or potentially being stalked, that is a problem.</p> <p> I am in agreement with the suggestion put forward and we have talked about this many times.  The solution is not mandatory sentencing or ever more years in prison being prescribed, which often simply professionalises amateur criminals.  The solution is a reconnection between policing and communities.  I have been talking about these matters since I first put forward legislative proposals the bones of 20 years ago to establish the Policing Authority based on the model of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  I went and spoke to the chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and the deputy chairperson, who I invited to Dublin to speak to us too.  When the Labour Party was in government we eventually got around to enacting the Policing Authority.</p> <p> We need to safeguard the principles that underscored the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the 1920s, that there would be unarmed community policing.  Even the name An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na signifies that its members are the guardians of the peace.  It is not there to enforce but to be the people's guardians.  That means community policing in a real sense.  I welcome the inclusion in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report of community policing as an integral and essential part of policing.  We must have members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in every community who are linked into the community with a knowledge of who is who and what is what.  If there are difficulties, members of the Garda must be able to go and talk to individuals and be visible, and not simply breeze through in a police car.  They must be of the community so that people know that Garda John or Garda M&aacute;ire is the local community garda and that if there is a problem they can talk to him or her about it and a positive response will be made about it.</p> <p> These changes are envisaged and I know that yesterday the Government approved the new transformation envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I do not know if the Minister without portfolio, Deputy McEntee, will wait until she is back in the House to present that legislation because it will take some time to tease out.  I am strongly in favour of the vast bulk of it.  I have met the chair of the review group to discuss it with her and I have also discussed it with dissenting members who had a minority report, as the Minister of State will know, on one aspect of it in particular, which causes me concern.  I was determined in recent years, particularly during our time in government when we were bringing in the Policing Authority, to have the appointment of senior Garda officers removed from the domain of the Garda itself and be done independently.  I confess that I have not read the legislation because it was only published yesterday but I look forward to reading and debating it.  I would be concerned if we reverted to an in-house appointment system.  One of the great changes brought about by the Policing Authority was an independent system of appointing senior garda&iacute;.</p> <p>I am very anxious that the reformed Policing Authority incorporating the inspectorate would have that role and I will debate this with the Minister.</p> <p> A critical part of all of this, and the hallmark of policing, will be an integrated community policing model, which exists in many countries.  I happened to visit policing systems in Japan, where every community has a little hut at the end of the street where there is a local police officer whom people know and consult and speak to about things.  That police officer is able to watch everything from bad traffic management to littering.  It is these small things that debilitate communities.  There could be an issue with the quality of the environment in a community because of people being careless with litter or driving motorbikes or whatever else carelessly.  Anchoring policing in the community can transform this to the good.  Sometimes we clamour about the location of a Garda station but that is no good if we do not have people.  I do not want garda&iacute; in stations, I want them visible in communities, walking around and talking to people knowing the communities they serve.  I want them to be able to receive intelligence and act intelligently on intelligence, not with a heavy hand but with knowledge of their communities and knowing what to do.  I am hopeful that the review of policing being carried out will result in this.</p> <p> The legislation before us is with regard to the decision of the Supreme Court on ensuring each case is taken on its own merits and that the final determination of a sentence is the proper role and function of an appointed judge, hopefully acting in a much more collegiate fashion under the new systems we have put in place for judges to speak about sentencing, and having more consistency and more collegiality on these matters.  In the meanwhile, we certainly need to continue to amend the law and I will wholeheartedly support the Bill.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we might tease out one or two of the points I have touched upon.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to see the Government is making progress on making being in politics more family friendly, from being in the Oireachtas right up to being a member of government.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill, which addresses the constitutional issues that emerged in the Supreme Court judgment in the Wayne Ellis case in 2019.  It will ensure that the checks and balances between the courts and the Parliament are maintained.  A robust criminal justice system is essential for protecting our communities.  We need to examine properly the ability to role out the use of community CCTV surveillance systems that protect communities but do not invade people's privacy.  This has been an enormous issue in many towns and villages throughout the country and legislation such as this needs to be expanded further to try to help communities with regard to local authorities and the data privacy aspects that have caused consternation in many Garda divisions and with local authorities over who has responsibility.  I ask the Minister of State to continue to do the work the Government is doing to solve this particular issue.  It will be a huge improvement for local garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  When discussing this legislation it is important to acknowledge the role that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has played in recent months.  It has been an exceptionally challenging time for policing in Ireland.  Earlier, I spoke about the many new challenges that social media has brought to policing in the country for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Generally the work they have done in recent months has gone unacknowledged in many quarters and as a Deputy I would like to say that it is exceptionally important that they receive the recognition they deserve given the unprecedented level of danger they are in from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  With regard to the drive to reduce the incidence of crime, anti-social behaviour, public disorder, vandalism and the general fear of crime, from my discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is in favour of CCTV systems as an aid to policing in our communities.  This recognises the national demand from community and business groups for CCTV systems in their respective towns and cities.  While the use of CCTV by a police service can have great merit, its use can have a direct impact on the human rights of individuals.  Therefore, we need to think carefully about how we ensure there is transparency in such systems so communities throughout the country are aware of the implications of the implementation of such a system. </p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin spoke about the United Kingdom and the efforts being made there to improve community policing.  The safer streets fund of &pound;45 million includes planned measures for CCTV and is a very interesting initiative.  It is something I would like to see us do here to improve public places, such as our parks, to ensure they are safe and to reduce the levels of crime and antisocial behaviour as a method of improving safety in our communities.</p>  <p>  The move by the UK to appoint a surveillance camera commissioner is also very wise to try to help with similar administrative and legislative issues to those facing our local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a local basis.  It is absolutely crazy when we stop and think about the fact we have installed multi-million euro CCTV systems in Garda barracks throughout the country and they cannot record.  People are getting away with crimes who otherwise would easily be convicted because the garda&iacute; could collect data from the footage.  Even if it were deleted at the end of each day it could be kept on file in the event that it could be of some use in a criminal investigation, whether with regard to small levels of crime or theft or more severe cases.  There is a lot of merit to putting in place these systems.  I have to acknowledge this.</p>  <p>  This was discussed very often when I was a member of Cork County Council and there seem to be very little hope of addressing it.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, before she took leave and she told me the Department is trying its best to address this.  I ask the Minister of State to keep his foot on the pedal in the coming months on this issue.  Local authorities throughout the country have millions of euro invested in these systems for local garda&iacute; but my understanding is that they are not being put to full use.  They could be of enormous benefit to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done in recent months has been exceptional.  It has been very challenging for them and they have dealt with protests and other situations where their health has been put at serious risk.  As a parliamentarian and member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I acknowledge this and thank them for this work.  I say to the Minister of State go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh leat and I wish him well in the coming months.</p></speech>

It is a technical Bill that is absolutely necessary from the point of view of dealing with constitutional issues.  Deputy Howlin spoke earlier about mandatory sentencing, which people sometimes believe is a panacea.</p>  <p>  I will deal with interventions that are necessary in our communities.  This is nothing new as I have raised these issues previously with the Minister.  I welcome what the Government has been saying on certain issues.  I welcome the fact there are projects that attempt to stop young people becoming engaged in crime and involving themselves in gangs and try to remove them from it.  I welcome the idea of community safety forums and I hope they will be given sufficient powers to replace joint policing committees, hopefully with more teeth and involving more agencies.  This is the whole-of-government or multi-agency response we have all called for.  We need to see this.  I also welcome the moves on the youth justice strategy.  These measures will only work if the resources are put in place and we need to audit the pilot projects to see they are working and to learn from them.  We then need to operate them across the board because we are dealing with these issues everywhere.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the Government is looking at the idea of a community safety innovation fund, which is similar to the legislation Deputy Ward and I have tabled on putting back into communities the money taken by CAB and the Garda from criminal organisations.</p> <p>That money needs to go back into those communities, particularly working-class communities, that have been ravaged by the drugs pandemic with we are dealing.  We need that to happen as soon as possible.  It is as simple as that.  It is natural justice.  It is not a panacea for everything.</p> <p> I have stated before and will state again that we need to have a citizens' assembly deal with the wider issue of drugs.  Let us look at best practice.  I accept that policing alone will not deal with this.  I represent Dundalk.  Many across society are impacted by drugs and by drug debt intimidation, but in working-class communities it is particularly acute and we need to deal with criminal gangs.</p> <p> I agree with what has been said about the need for increasing our capacity for community policing.  We all know the worth of a good juvenile liaison officer.  We need to ensure that they are given all the tools and capacity to be able to deal with this.  We know that we need to have interventions at an early stage in order that we can avoid people even getting into this criminal sphere but we need to see it as soon as possible and we need all the necessary resources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800053#BBB00200"><p>I welcome this legislation.  The Social Democrats will be supporting it.</p><p>In 2007, the then Minister, Senator McDowell, introduced the Criminal Justice Bill to the D&aacute;il.  The Bill was explicitly put forward to, in the then Minister's words, &quot;send a clear and unambiguous message&quot; to organised criminal gangs.  How effective these methods would actually be were questioned at the time, as was the Government's decision to impose a guillotine to fast-track the Bill through both Houses over a period of a few weeks before a general election.  There was not adequate time for the Bill to be debated, or for legal and human rights groups to examine the measures.  In particular, the then Irish Human Rights Commission did not have time to look at the Bill, as it was empowered to do by law.  This was yet another example of rushed and reactive legislation.  We need to learn from these mistakes and to properly engage with a process.  Pre-legislative scrutiny has been introduced since 2007 and when it is well done, it really adds to the legislation.  Understandably, the past year has been fairly difficult in that regard.</p><p>The criminal justice system is the cornerstone of our democracy.  Changes to it need to be well drafted and well considered and we need to bring in opposing voices as well.  If there is an area of legislation that should not be subject to guillotine it is criminal justice.  The consequences of inadequate scrutiny of legislation are obvious.  They are certainly obvious with regard to this legislation and what will transpire in respect of reviewing sentences.</p><p>We are here today due to the Supreme Court ruling which concluded that mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences are unconstitutional.  In her judgment, Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan stated that the Oireachtas impermissibly crossed the divide in the constitutional separation of powers and sought to determine the minimum penalty which must be imposed by a court, not on all convicted of an offence but on that limited group of people who had committed an offence for a second or subsequent time.</p><p>When we see policies such as this in relation to sentences imposed on individuals who have committed a previous offence, the obvious example which comes to mind is America's three-strike rule.  There was abundant evidence regarding the disastrous effects of this type of legislation in 2007, when this legislation was enacted.  The negative effects of the three-strike rule was even referenced by the then Minister.  It was not referenced as a negative but it was certainly referenced by the then Minister in bringing the legislation forward.</p><p>The introduction of mandatory minimum sentencing in the US contributed to the most dramatic period of prison expansion ever recorded, where the national prison population grew from approximately 300,000 in the early 1970s to approximately 2.3 million people today, disproportionately impacting in particular the black and Hispanic communities.  America has 5% of the world's population but 25% of the prison population.  One in seven American men will have been in prison.  It may well be for short durations but that is quite an extraordinary statistic.</p><p>The US has begun to turn away from mandatory minimum sentencing and yet we continued to walk down this well-worn track, despite the evidence pointing against it.  There can be a general perception that judges and the justice system go easy on offenders and it is an opinion that is shared by many Members of this House.  However, many trends suggest judges are becoming more punitive, certainly at least in terms of some types of crime.  Figures published in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently show that people found in possession of large quantities of drugs are twice as likely to face jail time as they were ten years ago.  The length of life sentences has been on an upward trend and the proportion of short sentences for minor crimes has increased by a third.</p><p>Our own expert groups have resisted for decades the policy of mandatory sentencing for decades.  The Law Reform Commission, in its 1996 report on sentencing, recommended that minimum and mandatory sentencing be abolished and repeated this call in its report on mandatory sentencing in 2013.  In its report, the commission recognised the emotional appeal of mandatory sentences.  It certainly looks like an easy fix.  It gives the impression that one is being tough on crime but, in fact, the impression is not enough.  We need to look at the evidence of where the solution is.</p><p>Proponents of this policy generally believe that mandatory sentencing will make sentences more consistent and predictable and the arguments often portray a level of distrust in the Judiciary.  It is thought that mandatory sentences might send a message to criminals showing that these acts will not be tolerated and so would deter crime.  There is little evidence to support this view when one looks at the rates of crime.  Mandatory minimums are an incredibly blunt legal instrument, applying the same sentence to all offenders who have committed the same crime.  The potential for injustice is quite considerable.</p><p>Providing trial judges with discretion in sentencing would not necessarily mean that the person in front of the judge serves less prison time but it would mean that the trial judge could make an assessment of the appropriate length of time that the offender should serve based on all of the information available which, of course, would not be available to us when we are framing the legislation.  In relation to the existing provisions in the Misuse of Drugs Act, for example, people who are engaged as drug mules are sometimes more vulnerable or maybe foolish people who face addiction themselves and may be found to be importing large quantities of illegal drugs on the direction of others, who may face a lesser charge or may not be brought to justice at all.  That is not to say that there should not be a punishment for that.</p><p>There is also, frankly, little evidence that mandatory sentencing deters crime.  In the US, where a large proportion of states have mandatory minimum sentencing, the crime rate has been little affected.  It does not appear to translate in that respect.</p><p>It seems whenever any form of crime becomes a public controversy, the debate shifts back to mandatory minimums as a simple way of dealing with crime or presenting a solution.  During the election campaign last year, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne's party, Fianna F&aacute;il, promised mandatory minimum sentencing for knife possession.  It is not uncommon to hear statements that suggest these sentences are the only possible way we can tackle a particular crime.</p> <p>The fact the policy was redundant was simply ignored.  It sounded like it was the business but we all have to be very careful not to reinforce bias, particularly when something cannot be introduced because it is, for example, unconstitutional.  Judges and members of the legal profession often go to great lengths in this country to circumvent mandatory minimum provisions and in some cases, they do so to avoid an injustice.  Ironically, mandatory sentencing does not generally achieve consistency in sentencing but increases its arbitrariness, where judges attempt to avoid imposing an unjust sentence on an individual.  <br/><br/>Section 15(a) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, introduced the offence of possession of drugs for sale or supply with a value of more than &euro;13,000.  The law set a minimum sentence of ten years in jail, although judges could impose lesser sentences in cases involving &quot;exceptional&quot; or &quot;specific circumstances&quot;.  In Ireland, Circuit Court judges generally do not impose the ten year minimum sentence in respect of drug trafficking and, indeed, have faced a lot of public criticism for this.  Judges have interpreted this provision in a broad manner from the beginning.  Co-operation with garda&iacute; or a guilty plea may be deemed &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances and so the majority who are convicted do not receive the minimum sentence, even though it is laid down in law.  Co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can lead to people who are higher up the criminal food chain being identified and brought to justice, which is obviously of value in terms of making communities safer.<br/><br/>In 2013 the Law Reform Commission reported that the directors of the drugs trade had adapted to the new sentencing regime by using couriers they deemed to be expendable.  This results in relatively low-level offenders being subject to harsher laws while the higher ups keep their hands clean.  The law may be deficient in other ways and, in certain circumstances, could be even benefiting the criminals.  We must be careful in what we do in the area of sentencing policy.  <br/><br/>The effective response to crime has been always a matter of debate and this debate has been often cast as one between those who fully believe in punishment and those who want to see prison time completely cut and replaced with rehabilitative programmes.  In actual fact, most people and in many cases, it comes down to discretion.  The debate is more often about the right mix, which is what we should be trying to achieve.  <br/><br/>Proactive policing can happen only where there is an appropriate number of law enforcement personnel and a fair distribution of Garda resources.  Adequate resources are also essential if we are to provide community policing which should be the cornerstone of the Garda response.  I am pleased to see this is referenced in the publication launched yesterday.  I have done an analysis of the statistics on Garda resources and will shortly publish a paper on same.  My analysis shows that areas of growing population are always playing catch up in the context of Garda numbers.  County Meath, for example, which is the Minister for Justice's own constituency, has the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population in the country, followed by Kildare.  The Minister of State's constituency also features prominently, as north Wexford has experienced a rapid rise in population in recent years.  What tends to happen is that Garda resources lag behind population rises and we get policing that is reactive rather than proactive.  Community policing is proactive policing but it cannot be done properly with inadequate resources.  I am not saying that is the only metric that should be used but it is not something that should be dismissed either.  Issues such as rates of crime or specific outbreaks of criminal activity would be also key determinants in the context of allocating resources.  <br/><br/>The Scandinavian model emphasises rehabilitation, with treatment and support aimed at helping the offender to become a law abiding member of society.  Norway moved its focus from punishment to rehabilitation 20 years ago.  This was followed by a large reduction in re-offending rates, which is what we should try to achieve here because such reductions make people feel safer.  Compared to a re-offending rate of around 50% within a year in the UK, Norway&rsquo;s rate is around .  This is clear evidence of the value of this approach.  <br/><br/>Views on crime and punishment differ but we can all agree that we care about criminal acts because they cause harm and have particularly bad effects in some communities.  Very often the perception is different to the reality in terms of the actual crime rate but if people feel afraid, we must take that seriously and address it.  Advocating for an approach to crime which reduces harm should be a united goal across the political spectrum.  There is evidence that rehabilitation reduces crime and is cost effective.  The Law Reform Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust have repeatedly called for an end to mandatory minimum sentencing, yet successive Governments have been slow to act.  Our future approach should not be just based on the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing has been found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which is pretty significant in itself, but based on evidence.  <br/><br/>Very often when one speaks about ending mandatory minimum sentencing, one is perceived to be soft on crime.  We need to make sure we do not reinforce this perception.  At the same time, we have a responsibility to examine the evidence regarding what works rather than just presenting apparently simple solutions.  The rehabilitative approach has been played out in other countries and thankfully we have seen countries like the USA moving slowly in a different direction, which is necessary.  We must look at the evidence here.  We want to do more good than harm and mandatory minimum sentences have not been good policy.  <br/><br/>I completely acknowledge that there is a significant problem with drugs and organised crime in this country and not adequately resourced policing results in a failure to get to grips with such problems.  We saw this in Limerick where a significant problem was allowed to emerge.  That county and city ended up being labelled, with international publications describing that city in disgraceful terms quite recently.  Communities can be blighted in the long term when proactive policing is not practised.  We end up trying to resolve problems rather than trying to prevent them from occurring in the first place.  The latter is what proactive policing and good policy allows us to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800054#CCC00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I accept that the Bill is before the House on constitutional grounds.  Every so often we must review the efficacy of legislation and the need for it.  There was a need for legislation in this area to sharply bring home to those involved in criminality that they could not get away with it indefinitely.  An attempt was being made at the time to shock the criminal world into believing that there would be serious consequences for their actions and that they would pay.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Catherine Murphy outlined, the criminal world seized the opportunity to use mules to do their dirty work, to do the carrying and delivery.  The mules were inevitably caught and given maximum sentences while the real carriers took a different, well charted route and got clean away.</p> <p>That was an instance of a serious problem which had to be dealt with.  One way of dealing with it is to change the law in respect of it.  However, there is also a danger of losing all the ways and means of dealing with crime in its modern shape and form.  We need to recognise that as time goes by, the criminal world is modernising its activities, changing the rules insofar as it is concerned and finding new ways and means of circumnavigating the system with a view to making crime pay.  </p> <p> The question of bail and the number of crimes committed by people while on bail was very much an issue in the past.  It still remains so, albeit not to the same extent.  Not only were people on bail for committing more than one crime, they were subsequently bailed again allowing them to commit more crime.  It was really laughable to see what happened.  The Garda was bringing people in, prosecuting them and bringing them to court, but before sentencing they were let out on bail during which they made good value of that time to reoffend.  As a result, in some cases up to 20 or 30 offences took place while the person accused in the first instance was on bail.  That was unacceptable and could not go on.  The longer that kind of thing went on, the worse the situation got. </p> <p> Some of us carried on a campaign to highlight that particular issue and, thankfully, it was addressed.  It may need to be addressed further and great caution needs to be taken to ensure there is ongoing monitoring of the efficacy of the legislation in dealing with that issue.  There should be no situation whereby somebody can obtain bail in respect of a multiplicity of crimes and at the same time be free.  That cannot add up.  It brings the law into disrepute.  It is certainly no comfort to the forces of law and order if this kind of thing is allowed to happen and people appear to get away with it.  </p> <p> We should also recognise the important role of crime prevention.  We need to look at that to a greater extent.  One or two things come to mind very quickly.  One is bad-quality housing and the concentration of huge numbers of people in what are, effectively, ghettoes.  We do not have many in the country but we have a few and they are bad environments.  We cannot expect people to behave in a normal way if they live in abnormal conditions and are treated accordingly.  We need to look at our social and housing laws to try to ensure that people have a reasonable quality of life in the houses in which they live.  I am conscious of the fact that we have a housing crisis.  I have spoken about it, like everybody else, many times in this House.  We have not resolved it yet; various factors have affected that.  The fact of the matter is that we will need to resolve that particular issue if we are going to give people an even chance.</p> <p> I raised quite a number of D&aacute;il questions on the issue of rehabilitation over the years.  I was not always happy about the degree to which the issues were resolved.  First-time offenders should get the first opportunity at re-education within the prison system with a view to education and training.  Every possible means should be found to enable them to have pride in what they could do in a crime-free environment and to be able to contribute to their well-being, that of their families and, as a result, that of society.  Much more needs to be done.  I have also found out over the years that within the prison system there are some people who are habitual, long-term offenders who avail of all the services available within the Prison Service with no intention of ever changing their habits.  They are doing it to have a better quality of life while they are in prison.  We need to look at those services, see how effective they are and how we proceed.</p> <p> My final point goes back to minimum sentencing and the extent to which the courts have discretion, rightly so, in determining the sentences they hand down.  It should not automatically follow that the easiest possible sentence is administered in certain areas.  For instance, we have seen many situations in the past where somebody who did not pay his or her television licence did prison time, whereas somebody who struck an elderly person over the head with a blunt instrument, leaving him or her in hospital, sometimes got the Probation Act.  These kinds of things should not happen.  In order to ensure that the law is respected, we must have the law in such a way that it protects the vulnerable in society and society as a whole.  At the same time, the law must be constitutionally sound.  Those are just a few of the things I wanted to say.  I could say much more but I would need much more time.</p></speech>

In recent weeks a number of communities in my constituency of Cork North-Central have come under attack.  People, children, families and cars have been violently attacked, resulting in some families walking out, locking the doors of their homes and leaving because they felt so intimidated and fearful.</p>  <p> I am asking the Minister of State what is being done to put garda&iacute; on the ground.  The only way to deter criminals, gangs and anti-social behaviour is for garda&iacute; who know everyone to be seen in place, walking and cycling around communities.  I am looking for more garda&iacute; but also for local authorities and landlords to tackle these criminals by not letting them live in communities, trying to destroy them.  We need CCTV cameras in hotspot areas.  We also need much more to be done in order that people can feel safe when they walk, go for a jog or go to their local shop.  </p>  <p>  Social media needs to be held to account because some attacks are being posted on it.  It helps encourage these gangs to be more brazen.  As youth services are shut, many people, especially young people who have never been in trouble before, are now getting into trouble and engaging in anti-social behaviour because of the lockdown of the past 12 months.  They do not have somewhere to go to make friends.  My fear is that we will lose more and more young people to these gangs and to criminality.  We need more members of the Garda and more help for these young people.  The one thing we know is that every summer there is an increase in attacks and involvement in gangs; it just goes with the time of year.  I am asking the Minister of State what is being done now to put a plan in place to stop this from getting out of hand.  People have contacted me from areas such as The Glen, Farranree, Gurranabraher and other areas in my constituency.  People are desperate and they feel afraid.  These are great communities of hardworking people who go to school and college.  They have built great community and GAA groups and sporting organisations.  We need to support them.  We need to let people know there is support there for them.  </p>  <p>  For years, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael cut services to youth funding resources and the Garda.  I am asking for that funding to be put back.  People should feel safe in their communities.  I am asking the Minister of State what he will do now to put a plan in place for this summer to ensure resources are there. </p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to take part in today's debate on an extremely important Bill.  The Ellis decision raised a number of very important issues over what is an appropriate approach to sentences in certain cases, which in turn has led to significant delays in processing such cases to conclusion.</p> <p>I appreciate that the Bill is intended to remedy the faults in legislation that arose as a result of the Ellis case.  There is no doubt that those on the Government side will highlight the many benefits of the amendments so there is no point in me going over them again.  I would like to put on record my support for the Government in any actions that it may take to make the laws of this country stronger, more resilient and more of a deterrent to those who commit second and subsequent crimes.  At present, there is simply not enough of a deterrent to stop those people who commit a crime regularly.  How many times have you heard it said that it is always the same people's names appearing in the local newspapers in the courts reports?  On some occasions, it is said that one could easily name the people appearing in court before their names appear in the papers.  With this being the case, something is clearly wrong.  We must get to grips with the legal system in this country and have a system in place that will create a situation where people will be afraid to commit an offence a second time.</p> <p> There are always victims when crimes are committed.  These victims are often overlooked.  More must be done to support the victims of crime.  One of the ways that we can support them is by making sure that those who commit the crime pay the price.  Too often, those who commit the crimes get away scot-free.  This is wrong.  I acknowledge that this Bill will address this to a certain degree.</p> <p> We can talk all we want in the House but the bottom line is that we must support the court system with robust and up-to-date legislation.  We must also put in place real measures that support the victims of crime.  These people are, in my opinion, the forgotten people of crime.  They are the innocent victims of crime.  They are left to pick up the pieces on many occasions.</p> <p> In my constituency, Louth, we have been plagued by a drug feud involving two rival factions in Drogheda.  Unfortunately, lives have been lost and destroyed, and families have been torn apart.  Many families in Drogheda now live in fear as a direct result of the feud.  The feud has been played out not only in the local media but also the national media.  The dogs in the street know who is involved yet, at times, it seems that the garda&iacute; are powerless to act.  How was this allowed to continue for so long?  This feud has spilled into neighbouring towns and villages, including my own town, Dundalk.  It has ruined the lives of many and left many more living in fear.  If the dogs in the street know who is involved and the media seem to know every detail, how is it okay that it took so long?  Do the garda&iacute; not have enough power?  If this is the case, then as legislators, we must put in place legislation that ensures the authorities have the power to deal with this.</p> <p> Drugs are destroying many lives and make many of those responsible for dealing rich.  We must make sure that those who profit from the selling of drugs are brought to justice.  Surely at this stage we have the resources to pinpoint exactly if someone is living beyond his or her means and examine why this is the case.  In many instances, this will highlight whether earnings are illegal or not.  In addition, we must make sure that robust legislation is in place that puts in place a real deterrent to those who would consider committing a crime more than once.  In this respect, I feel that the Bill is a good start.  It is not only a start.  We must now work together to ensure that laws are put in place that create a situation where crime does not pay.</p> <p> Unfortunately, in some situations, criminals are treated like celebrities in their local areas.  This is not helped by the reporting of some media outlets, which no doubt contribute to making some of these people celebrities.  I have a problem with some of the terms used to describe gang leaders.  Surely the media have a duty to ensure that it does not make celebrities out of criminals?  The media often glamourise the life of criminals, especially the drug barons.  It would serve the media better if they were to highlight the misery of those victims and innocent families instead of making criminals into media stars.</p> <p> Getting back to the Bill before us, I support it and any amendments which make it stronger and more robust.  We should have an increasing scale of penalties for those who continuously commit crimes.  I have an issue with sentences that run concurrently.  How is that a deterrent to those criminals?  Sentences for different crimes should not run concurrently.  They should be added together to ensure that those convicted pay the proper price for their crimes.  If they commit more crimes, the sentences should reflect this.  Criminals who continue to commit crimes should have their sentences increased each time, not have their sentences run concurrently, and pay a proper price for their crimes.</p> <p> I once more state my support for the Bill.  We must not stop here.  We must continue to examine the legislation in place and ensure that it is fit for purpose.  There are too many occasions where criminals have got off on a technicality.  This should never happen and when it does, we should address the legislation that has failed.  These criminals often have access to vast sums of money and can employ the best legal brains who will try to find a loophole to allow their clients to get off.  We must fight this.  The way to fight it is by ensuring that we have strong, legally sound and robust legislation in place.</p> <p> As I said previously, the trappings of crime are often wealth.  Surely in this day and age, we have the technology, access to information and the resources to identify when people are living way beyond their means.  We have seen many times before, both here and abroad, that the downfall of criminals has been when their financial affairs have been examined.  I want to once more confirm my support for this Bill.  I hope that this is only the start of hopefully further measures that will ensure that crime does not pay.  Those who commit a crime are dissuaded from further criminal activities by more robust sentencing.</p> <p> I want to raise the matter of the Border counties.  In the four Border stations, we only have one sergeant.  That is a disgrace.  I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on numerous occasions about the situation in the Dundalk area.  At present, there are ten vacancies for garda&iacute;.  There are seven for Dundalk, which is a big region where the garda&iacute; are doing a fantastic job.  There is one at Blackrock, one of the biggest rural areas in the region, one in Omeath and one in Hackballscross.  It is important that garda&iacute; are supervised.  The experience of sergeants is needed.  Having ten vacancies in one area makes no sense to me.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to give me a commitment that he will talk to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I believe that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will still be involved with the Cabinet.  Coming from a Border area, with Brexit, smuggling and everything else, they have done a fantastic job.  The least one can do there is ensure that the garda&iacute; are well-resourced.  Will the Minister of State please give me a commitment that he will look at the situation, and not leave it on the long finger?  Many people really get fed up of the situation.  I know one family that has been burgled three times.  Believe it or not, it is the same person who comes back time and time again.  It is important to address if somebody is caught a second time.  Putting all the crimes together cannot work.  If he is in custody and it is discovered that he committed two or three more crimes, they should be put aside separately, and instead of a criminal going to jail for one, two or three years, we have to deter and stop people from breaking into people's houses.</p> <p> I know these people who are victims and their lives have changed.  It is not nice for one's self, wife and children to be in bed and for someone to break into the property.  They threaten the people and destroy the house, and everything that we work for.  There is fear afterwards, especially among the children.  I met a few children in the last months whose houses had been broken into.  They cannot sleep.  Everything comes back on to the victim.  They get no support whatsoever from Government, which says "so what?"  The big fear is that the people who the garda&iacute; catch will go in to jail and, a few weeks later, be walking down the main street or wherever it might be, and who do they walk into?  Consider the looks that they get and everything else.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State help me out with getting ten sergeants and getting more garda&iacute; on the street?  While I was at the Joint Committee on Justice, people were talking about 4,000 civilians coming in and doing clerical work in Garda stations.  What happened there?  How many people are employed as clerical officers?  There is no point to having people train in Templemore for six or 12 months and do all the training, and then be put into an office to do clerical work.  If the Government is going to put civil servants behind the desks, do so.  We need more footfall.  I come from a Border area.  I ask the Minister of State to please give a commitment of giving us the ten sergeants that we deserve.</p></speech>

While the figures were down marginally in 2020 because of Covid-19, between 2016 and 2019 there was a massive increase.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, recorded 2,520 sexual offences in 2016.  That figure increased to 3,340 in 2019.  There was a huge increase in the numbers of cases of rape, abuse of children under the age of 17 and sexual assaults. There must be a serious national conversation regarding the underlying reasons for this increase and how we can best respond.<br/><br/>This week also brought unbelievable information from the CSO in the context of the sexual assault figures it published.  More than one in five, over 20%, of those who committed sexual assaults were boys under the age of 18.  That is a startling and incredible figure.  Even more startling than that is the fact that three in five victims of sexual assault, or 60%, were children.  In this generation, children under the age of 18 are the most vulnerable in this State regarding this type of sexual crime.<br/><br/>It is an incredible situation, and an issue that the country is not dealing with.  On the news, the CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre said that one of the driving forces behind this increase in abuse by youths of youths is the amount of hardcore Internet pornography being consumed by individuals at a very young age.  I have raised this issue several times and when I do the Government frets over it.  Heads are shaken, but at the end of the conversation shoulders are shrugged.  No party in this D&aacute;il has introduced legislation to end the ability of children as young as ten years of age to access hardcore Internet pornography.  That is except for one party, namely, Aont&uacute;.  I have a Bill waiting to move to Second Stage.  If passed, that legislation would make it illegal for international companies to make a profit out of selling hardcore pornography to children as young as ten years of age.  I really encourage the Government to help to get the Bill through the D&aacute;il.  This is far too serious an issue for people to ignore.<br/><br/>I also wish to discuss sentencing, which is important when it comes to sexual violence.  In 2019, a man was sentenced to a mere two and a half years in prison for the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl.  In 2015, another perpetrator was given a suspended sentence of a year for the repeated rape and sexual assault of his girlfriend while she was asleep over the course of 12 months.  When the judge was handing down the sentence, he credited that perpetrator for confessing and allowing the case to be brought forward.  In February, a former drug dealer was given a fully suspended sentence despite sexually assaulting a woman.  In another case, a man was given the opportunity to be spared a criminal conviction for the sexual assault of two women if he gave a donation of &euro;100 to the rape crisis centre.  These sentences are disgracefully weak.  They do not represent justice for the victims and they are definitely not a reason for future perpetrators to be afraid of the law.  We must do much better by victims.<br/><br/>I also want to talk briefly about some of the criminal aspects introduced by the Government in respect of Covid-19.  Covid-19 is obviously a real issue and it is a dangerous illness for certain cohorts, especially the elderly and those who are ill.  The Government has done a poor job of providing protection in the context of the restrictions and laws which it has introduced in the past year.  According to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, since March 2020 the Oireachtas has enacted four statutes and the Minister for Health has made 67 sets of regulations in response to Covid-19.  These include 40 weeks of bans on religious services, 410 days of wet pubs being closed and more than 215 days of workplace closures.  This adds up to the longest and most severe lockdown in Europe and one of the longest and most severe on the planet.  The IHREC report published in February was damning in its assessment of how the Government has responded to Covid-19.  It declared that:</p><blockquote>	... the State has repeatedly blurred the boundary between legal requirements and public health guidance, generating widespread confusion about the extent of people&rsquo;s legal obligations.  This offends the rule of law, disrespects people&rsquo;s [freedoms] and, in several specific respects, breaches standards of national and  international law. </blockquote> <p>That is a shocking indictment of the Government actions over the past while.<br/><br/>One of the worst examples of the suppression of human rights has been that relating to religious services.  Ireland is currently the only state in the European Union in which religious services are banned.  We are one of a few countries on the planet, including Saudi Arabia and Korea, where religious services are banned.  Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this is a human right.  The Government has stated that it intends a return to religious services at some stage, perhaps at the end of May, at the same time as people return to attending museums and galleries.  Attendance at museums and galleries is important, but they are not in the same place as a right specified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  For the Government to value these in the same way shows a massive disrespect for the well over 1 million people in this State for whom religious practice is an essential element of their lives.<br/><br/>Before Christmas, the Minister for Health said that religious services would not be criminalised.  He stood up here in the D&aacute;il and said that.  However, representatives of the State stood up in the High Court last week to confirm that saying mass is now a criminal offence.  A priest in Cavan was fined for saying mass, while a Protestant minister in Dublin was arrested for organising a religious service.  It was unclear exactly what they were being charged with.  Oran Doyle, a law professor in Trinity College Dublin has said that under the Government's new Covid-19 lockdown rules, holding outdoor religious services-----</p></speech>

Therefore, the D&aacute;il has been bypassed as a matter of routine.  That is wrong.  I ask the Government to ensure that in developing restrictions, the law in general and the criminal law in the weeks to come, it desist from criminalising these two aspects of practice within Irish society.  It is really important that we have a very clear system of criminal law.</p>  <p>  It is also important in terms of criminal justice that people understand exactly what is illegal and what is not illegal.  It is important also that there is no confusion regarding criminal law in this State.  The truth of the matter is that there is a significant level of confusion now.  There is confusion regarding the language the Minister is stating and what legal professionals acting for the State are indicating in the High Court.  There is also confusion, according to a law professor in Trinity College Dublin, about what is a criminal act and what is not a criminal act.  If we expect citizens to obey the law, then it must be clear to them exactly what is the law.  Since the case in the High Court, I have asked the Minister serious questions about whether hearing confession outdoors constitutes a criminal act.  Again, the Minister could not give a straight answer.</p>  <p>  The Government is putting together the restrictions for the next month in respect of a country which has had the longest and most severe lockdown in the whole of Europe.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we look at several key criteria in the development of future laws.  These key criteria are the number of admissions to hospital and the number of admissions to ICUs.  Right now, those figures are very low, thankfully.  In some counties now, days go by when there are no Covid-19 cases.  Indeed, the number of people being admitted to hospital in Munster is very low.  This should feed into the Government's design of the criminal law in future.  I am asking the Government to ensure that we accelerate the pace of reopening and address the liberties of the citizens of this country.</p></speech>

In its judgment in May 2019, the Supreme Court found that the Oireachtas could impose mandatory penalties but only if applied to all persons.</p> <p>It is not constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to specify a mandatory penalty which only applies to a limited class of persons, such as a person who had previously committed one or more listed offences.  The Supreme Court held that the application of a penalty in such cases is the administration of justice and, under Article 34 of the Constitution, may only be administered by the courts.  The Bill is intended to remedy this fault.<br/><br/>It is easy to come into this Chamber and appear to be hard on crime and propose mandatory minimum sentences but we must consider the balance of powers and the constitutional requirements.  This Bill is welcome in what it sets out to do, namely, to abolish certain mandatory minimum sentences, some which have been on the statute books for more than a century.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the facts of the Wayne Ellis case were that he had been successfully addressing his drug problems at Coolmine drug treatment centre and had not come to adverse Garda attention in the interim.  The suspension was imposed on the basis of the &quot;last chance&quot; principle.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, successfully appealed the sentence as being unduly lenient to the Court of Appeal, which imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment.  On appeal the relevant legislative provisions were struck down.  The Supreme Court ruled that they were an overreach by the Oireachtas into the powers reserved for the Judiciary, that is, deciding the length of a sentence.<br/><br/>Today, we heard demands for longer sentences to be passed in respect of the events in Killarney over the weekend without any evidence that what happened was actually caused by a criminal act.  People must understand that it is very important to address the underlying issues because while it is easy to be seen to be tough on crime, it is much harder to come up with solutions and investment in education, particularly in inner city communities.  It is harder to find more park rangers and to put in place a proper system and a crisis management plan for Killarney National Park, for example.<br/><br/>Going back to the Ellis case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Oireachtas does have a role but it is worth reflecting on whether we should assume this role with respect to mandatory minimum sentences.  The Law Reform Commission recommended no new mandatory minimum sentences be introduced onto the Statute Book.  Most of the time, when there are calls for mandatory minimum sentences, it is more to do with publicity for the Member in charge, rather than any real understanding of the law.  The position of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is that we should look towards the repeal of others, but we must grasp the hard questions.  In respect of many of the other mandatory sentences on the books, it may not be politically palatable to tackle them, but this should not stop us.<br/><br/>Crime is changing and the pandemic is accelerating this change.  The number of petty offences is down all over the country but more serious offences are increasing and there is a shift towards more serious organised crime.  It reflects the economics of crime for the criminal gangs as in-person opportunities to make money decline.  We should do everything we can to prevent their increased power and sophistication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800058#GGG00200"><p>I am very concerned about the statistics released this week which state that one in five detected sexual crimes reported to the Garda involved minors as both victims and perpetrators.  This is extremely worrying, as it involves those so young, most of whom I am presuming are in their teens.  I do not want to think that they could be younger.  As a former teacher in a secondary school, I am aware that inappropriate comments and touching may happen regularly, to female students in particular, but they seldom report it.  It seems to happen in crowded corridors and certainly when staff are not present.  I wish to stress that I believe that only a small number of students are responsible but it is enough to make female students in particular feel very uncomfortable.</p>  <p>  Rather than letting this continue, measures need to be taken to educate young people on what sexual abuse, sexual assault and rape are and how serious and unacceptable they are.  Education on consent is vital.  Sexual violence is on the increase.  As the Minister knows, many sexual crimes are not reported and of those that are, very few are brought to court.  I believe that sexual and violent crimes against people should attract much higher sentences.  However, I do not feel it is the only measure that should be utilised to deal with this issue, and education and information are absolutely essential.</p>  <p>  On average one in ten women are killed every year in Ireland by a current or previous partner.  Many more are violently assaulted and left for dead.  Sentencing for the non-fatal attacks is far too lenient.  It is disgraceful.  I also want to support the call by Una Ring and Eve McDowell to make stalking a separate offence and with significant penalties attached for those found guilty.</p>  <p>  The other issue about which I am hugely concerned is the use of illegal drugs and drug-related crime.  Many families in my constituency are being threatened on a regular basis because it is maintained that a member of the family owes some drug dealer hundreds or thousands of euro.  I know of young people who have committed suicide as a result of these instances.  Families are afraid to report the intimidation to the Garda.  People are afraid to walk the streets in the evening or at night because of the regular drug dealing that is happening on many dark streets and alleys.  More CCTV is required in order that people feel safe walking the streets.  Areas also need to be well-lit.  That requires more funding for local authorities to put these measures in place.</p>  <p>  Similar to the sexual assault issue, a cross-departmental approach is required to deal adequately with the drugs issue.  It cannot be viewed as a issue for the Department of Justice only.    I wonder where the national drugs strategy is at now.  Longer sentences for those found to be dealing class A drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are urgently needed.</p>  <p>  Finally, there is a frustration in many areas when people hear of instances of a crime being committed by a person who is out on bail.  While I understand the need for every accusation of crime to be treated independently and the presumption of innocence to be maintained, if someone is found to have committed a crime while out on bail they should be treated more stringently by the court and a stiffer sentence given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800058#GGG00300"><p>I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  In a recent case, the Supreme Court found that while the Oireachtas can impose mandatory penalties for offences, it can only do so where those penalties apply to all persons equally.  Specifically, the Oireachtas cannot create a mandatory penalty, which only applies to a particular class of persons, such as a person who has previously committed a particular offence. The Court held that under Article 34 of the Constitution, such a penalty may only be administered by the courts.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the purpose of the Bill is to remove any instances in legislation where such a mandatory penalty occurs.  If this Bill helps to prevent crime and save the public and members of the Garda from criminals, I will fully support it, as it is hard on the honest working people out there watching criminals getting away with crime that at the end of the day, the taxpayer must pay for.  </p>  <p>  We see cases of ordinary people being nabbed by a hidden speed van when they are going to work or taking their children to school in the morning.  Whether this happens in Bandon or Schull, it is the same story and it has to stop.  We should be concentrating our efforts on serious criminals, which is what this Bill stands for.  The money-making racket of giving penalty points and issuing fines to those caught driving at 52 km/h or 53 km/h in a 50 km/h zone has to stop.  It is most unfair on hardworking people.  I also call into question where these hidden speed vans are parked, often on what appears to be private property.  The practice must be investigated.  Like my good colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, who spoke on the issue last week, I ask, what is the benefit of speed vans?  Most of their work is done inside and around towns, where there are rich pickings.</p>  <p>  The Garda is doing a good job in respect of dealing with hardened speeding drivers, whose behaviour be stamped out at all costs.  However, the practice of chasing innocent parents who are bringing their children to and from school, and the hard-working man or woman going to work every morning, is most unfair.  One man told me that his wife was caught twice recently in west Cork in the period of few days, by a speed van that was hidden inside another person's yard.  He said that he will never co-operate with the law again, as he had done before, if he sees some wrongdoing.  These vans are penny-wise and pound-foolish.</p>  <p>  While I have the floor to discuss issues relating to criminal justice, I would like to talk about the garda&iacute;, who, in fairness, do a great job in protecting our communities.  They receive a lot of unfair criticism.  I have been asked to raise the fact that members of the Garda have not been offered the Covid vaccine yet, for those who want it.  It is unfair that they have not been prioritised.  They work on the front line and were forced out there during the pandemic.  It is unfair to think that now, when it is time to reward some of them with a very simple vaccination, they are not considered.</p>  <p>  I also want to talk about local community garda&iacute; and the lack of good community garda&iacute; at present.  There is a concentration of Garda members on the roadside and in the bigger Garda stations throughout the country.  That started a few years ago when Garda stations were closed under a Fine Gael policy that was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I saw it happening in my own community, when the Goleen, Adrigole, Ballinacarriga and Ballinspittle Garda stations were closed.  We fought on this issue and one of the stations was subsequently reopened after a brave struggle by the people of Ballinspittle.</p> <p>Someone was helping them, perhaps the statue of the Blessed Virgin.  Whoever it was, the Garda station was reopened.  It is the smallest privilege that every community should enjoy to have a local garda to nip crime in the bud.  It is unfortunate that we moved away from that.</p> <p> Crime is down at the moment because of the pandemic and the restrictions on movement and travel.  It is great that this has happened and I hope it stays that way.  In general, however, people in local communities that have lost their Garda station and their community garda&iacute; are petrified.  Those community garda&iacute; did important work with young people.  There is no one in here who can wear a halo.  Everybody makes mistakes and people were lucky when the local garda knew them, spoke to them and nipped any criminal behaviour in the bud.  It does not matter whether that happens in Drimoleague, Ballinadee, Drogheda or anywhere else.  If there is a local garda working with the local people, he or she will nip that type of criminal activity in the bud.  Unfortunately, we have lost that and we need to concentrate on getting it back.</p> <p> I have been involved in community work down through the years and have seen what community alert and neighbourhood watch groups have done to help people, even if it is just a simple call to elderly people to prevent a crime in a home or, if they are alone or frightened, to ensure they can press a button and get help.  Being on their own is the most frightening thing for many elderly people.  We have to look at returning local garda&iacute; to the community.  Garda Brigid Hartnett in Bantry has carried out very good work there during the pandemic.  I probably should not refer to individuals but I also must praise Garda Damian White, who was an outstanding community garda in Bantry and probably one of the finest garda&iacute; in the country.  He focused very clearly on working with people, young and old, in the community.  He was miles above others in his team.  Ian O'Callaghan and John McCarthy are other good community garda&iacute; who worked to nip crime in the bud.  I could be standing here forever naming garda&iacute; who have worked very hard in their communities, when they were allowed to be stationed there.  We fought alongside the people of Kilbrittain to keep Garda John McCarthy.  There was some concern a number of years ago that he was going to be taken out of there.  We fought bravely to ensure he remained to keep the people of Kilbrittain, Ballinadee, Ballinspittle, Timoleague and Barryroe safe in their homes.  That is what garda&iacute; should be doing.  I would appreciate a refocusing to ensure that happens.</p> <p> We have spoken in the House about CCTV and the need to make funds available to provide it.  I was involved in a local community alert group in Schull that put together funds to install CCTV in the town.  It provides great security to people there to have it in place.  It is also in place in Mallow, Bantry and other towns, offering great security to the people living there.  We always talk about dealing with criminals after the event.  Perhaps we should concentrate on putting funds and efforts into deterring criminality before it happens.  We can only do that by deploying more garda&iacute; in communities, putting in CCTV, giving the garda&iacute; better resources, including proper Garda vehicles, and reopening stations like the ones in Adrigole, Ballinacarriga and the many others that the Government decided to close a few years ago.  It did so without any consultation with the local community, only dictation from the top.</p> <p> I will be supporting this Bill as it moves forward.  Its provisions will help to prevent crime and give suitable penalties to those who carry out very serious offences.  We need to concentrate on the great work done by garda&iacute; down through the years to help young people and nip crime in the bud.  If there was a small amount of crime, it was dealt with locally and did not go beyond that.  That is the focus we should have for our young people today.  Every human makes a mistake but a good local garda will put a person in the right direction without being heavy-handed and getting others involved.  That type of thing will never be forgotten by a young person.  We need to use a bit of cop on in dealing with such issues.</p></speech>

If he does, I will share time with him.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to speak in the debate on this Bill.  Much of it draws on the cases that have turned up in the Supreme Court.  It is very important that legislation that is made and passed in the Oireachtas applies equally to all citizens and will withstand the test of time.  Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, amend provisions relating to mandatory sentences for second and subsequent firearms and misuse of drugs offences.  Sections 8 and 9 provide for consequential amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 2007 and the Parole Act 2019 arising from the deletion of provisions set out in the Bill.  Some parts of the legislation relate to provisions that go back to the foundation of the State.  This reform is badly needed.</p>  <p>  I want to put on record my support for the ordinary men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up and down the country.  I salute the way they have been out on the front line doing their best.  I spent a very pleasurable morning last Monday with the community garda in Ardfinnan and Cahir, Noel Glavin, who is a proud Cork man but has been based in Cahir for a long number of years.  He visits elderly people in their homes as part of the community effort during the Covid crisis.  It was wonderful to see, on that beautiful morning, a sense of hope in people after 13 long, arduous and frustrating months.  I salute Sergeant Ray Moloney in Cahir and Sergeant Kieran O'Regan in Clonmel and their counterparts in other districts, as well as garda&iacute; Jenny Gough and Claire Murphy.  I thank all the garda&iacute; in Cahir, Clonmel and throughout my county and the whole country who are out helping people in the spirit of the meitheal.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Cahir lost its community Garda car but, fortunately, it has been replaced.  It is a dedicated community vehicle for the garda&iacute; in the town.  Garda&iacute; must stand in the kitchens of the people if they want the support of the people.</p>  <p>  It is very frustrating for garda&iacute; when they go into court and their evidence is pulled asunder and every trick in the book is taken out to undermine them.  It is, of course, the right of the accused person to have a proper defence and to be proven innocent, if he or she is innocent.  The principle of innocent until proven guilty must always be the benchmark and standard to which we aspire.  However, one sees people with 25, 30 or 40 charges against them and there is the whole situation with free legal aid.  I firmly believe that it should be a case of three strikes and you are out.  Some people think it should be two but I would say three.  The situation is very frustrating for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it undermines the community support for garda&iacute;.  I was taken to task by the Taoiseach earlier today in this Chamber for expressing my feelings about certain issues.  The point I was making is that we had a great country and we earned our freedom deeply.  I told a story earlier in the House about the valiant fight for freedom in this country.  Many of our rights have been stripped away from us during the Covid crisis though legislation that has been passed at regular intervals in this House.</p>  <p>  We had a situation where the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, when introducing the main legislation dealing with restrictions, told Deputy McNamara and me that there were no provisions in the Bill to penalise, criminalise, fine or imprison a priest for saying mass or hearing confessions.  He told us that and he has never corrected the record of the House.  It is very easy for the Taoiseach to lecture me today but it is very important that Ministers, especially, would ensure, if they err or mislead the D&aacute;il, knowingly or otherwise, that they correct the record.  In this instance, it has not been corrected.  I have asked the Minister for Health time after time to do so and I have discussed the matter with the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach attended a meeting with church leaders last Thursday week.  While they were meeting in one room, the Minister for Health was signing a statutory instrument which underpinned the provision in the legislation to which I referred, which he denied was in it, to criminalise priests and make them liable for a criminal offence.  We see how priests such as Fr. Hughes, a wonderful man in Cavan, and many others have been brought before the courts.  We saw what happened in Athlone last weekend.</p>  <p>  There must always be a balance in things.  Fair play is fine play with me.  I am involved in the second community alert group that was set up in the country, in Newcastle.  That is Caisl&eacute;an Nua na Siuire, Tiobraid Arann theas.  We were under Dungarvan Garda station but we are now back in the county boundaries in Tipperary.  The Garda needs our support and it always must get it.</p>  <p>  An issue arose today about taxi drivers not being allowed to hold a drive-by protest tomorrow.  I accept that this would constitute a gathering, in the essence of the word, but the proposal was to drive by and not get out of their cars and interact with others.  They were told clearly that if they did so, they would each be fined &euro;100.  People are only trying to protect their living or recover whatever living they had.  These people invested in their vehicles.  All self-employed people invest in their business and their career and many of them go on to give employment and support other families.  All they are trying to do is rescue and regain what they have lost.  Many of them do not have a rateable premises and did not, therefore, get any supports.  While local authorities and departmental officials worked hard to try to help people, there just was not enough money to go around.  That was the number one issue.</p> <p>They were trying to protest.  I might have given the impression that taxi drivers from Tipperary were coming.  No.  They contacted me to ask me to ensure I would support their colleagues in Dublin, who would represent them at Merrion Square in the morning.  That is not happening now because the Garda has told those drivers clearly that if they turn up, they will be fined &euro;100 each and there would be a possibility of a court conviction.  That is a fact, so where could we go?</p> <p> This Bill is vital.  We have a proud record of jury service and I salute the members of the public who carry out the duty when asked.  It is part of their civic duty and they must be looked after.  We must also bring legislation to modernise the process.  There should be an impact assessment of each piece of legislation once it is passed.  We had this same debate as it related to a justice Bill that was debated with the Minister of State in the Chamber.  It could be 20 years before an Act is reviewed so we can deal with glaring anomalies.</p> <p> I support this Bill and I always support good legislation.  No matter how good we make the legislation here, and regardless of the expertise in the Department, there is always room for correction because of unintended consequences.  The Firearms Act 1965 required a mandatory five-year sentence for some convictions and this was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  There was reference in the notes to a gentleman being arrested with a sawn-off shotgun, bottles of petrol, stockings and other items.  Anybody going around with such items, even if under the influence of drugs or alcohol - I pity the people who are - knows a sawn-off shotgun is a lethal weapon.  It would cover the width of this building from ten or 15 feet and do untold damage.  We cannot have people getting suspended sentences in such cases.  People go out with such weapons with intent.</p> <p> A person may have a shotgun in his own house with a licence.  He may be shooting vermin because he is a farmer.  I have heard of cases of such people shouting at intruders into their home that they have a gun and I have heard of cases where the gun was taken from them.  There is a balancing act in defending a home, a family or oneself.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well, as I have done in the past.  The Minister has gone off to greater things and I wish her well in her voyage with her new baby.  I hope all goes well for her and her family.  I know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will take over the brief.  There are many issues to deal with in the Department of Justice and goodness knows there is much work there.</p> <p> We must try to reform free legal aid and change the adversarial system in the courts, with people before the courts sometimes being intimidated in the precinct of the court.  There is no room for that and we must have the rule of law.  The research note indicates sexual offences were being committed on minors and, even worse, sexual and other offences were being committed by minors.  We must ask what is going on in society and in homes and schools.  We must consider why this is happening while examining our education.  It is so important that we have civil society that is proud of democracy.</p> <p> It is why I am concerned with the question I had today about our democratic rights, particularly my democratic right to ask questions of the Minister for Health.  I cannot get answers despite asking questions week in and week out.  After the first week or two, I used my time to ask questions and seek written answers.  The Minister has plenty of officials to take note of my questions but I have never got an answer.  It demonstrates contempt for this House and for me and the people I represent.  I am seeking the basic answers to the basic questions.  We need them.</p> <p> The Minister of State protested when Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n talked about public worship.  That is enshrined in European law and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.  We have the longest lockdown in Europe, if not the world, and we are one of only three countries when we had level 3 restrictions that denied the right to worship.  The others were Saudi Arabia and one of the Koreas and I would not like to be compared with those countries.</p> <p> I spoke today about spiritual nourishment.  I want the priests and clergy of all denominations to have the right to be declared essential workers.  It is about this spiritual nourishment.  There are people who want communion or confession on a daily basis.  Their faith is so important to them, regardless of their religion.  This relates to their mental and physical health.  We will have fitter and healthier people.</p> <p> Priests should be allowed to administer to their flock.  There is a duty under their oaths of ordination but they are prohibited from doing this.  We see what happened in Athlone in Sunday and what is happening with Fr. PJ Hughes.  There is no need for it.  The vast majority of people are obeying the rules and a few are going to pray.  Our Lord spoke about a few gathering in his name being wonderful.  We must look at that.</p> <p> We must be sensitive.  We must not have a repeat of what happened today, when taxi drivers were intimidated into abandoning their protest.  They would not have been on the street or been a danger to anybody.  They were not told that they could not go; they were told that if they went, they would be fined and there would be court proceedings.  That is totalitarianism and the heavy hand of the law.  I always ask people in my community to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Men and women have given their life in this country for the uniform so we can have the freedom to sleep in our beds.  There is a very thin line between that and anarchy.  We need to support our garda&iacute;.  I again salute those who work under Superintendent William Leahy in Clonmel and Superintendent Denis Whelan in Cahir.  They also have community teams in Tipperary town and all around.  Some people are retiring so we need new recruits who can aspire to work in the Garda. </p></speech>

This is necessary legislation that has arisen from the Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences for categories of people, namely, those who are repeat offenders of specific crimes.  Perhaps the most noteworthy of these relate to firearms and misuse of drugs offences.  The Supreme Court held that whereas the Oireachtas can provide for a mandatory penalty for an offence, it can only do so where a penalty applies equally to all offenders.</p>  <p>  Although the power to legislate for mandatory sentences for second offences will be removed from the Oireachtas, I hope the judicial system will ensure appropriate sentences are imposed for those found guilty of supplying large quantities of drugs in the State.  Limerick, like many other locations across the State, has been plagued by the scourge of drug dealing.  It was reported yesterday that drugs valued at &euro;340,000 were seized on Monday evening.  Unfortunately, large quantities of illegal drugs are still finding a way into our communities, causing havoc, and mandatory sentencing has not acted as a major deterrent to this activity.</p>  <p>  I commend the Garda on making such a large seizure of drugs, cocaine in particular.  There has been a step change in the Garda response to drug dealing in the past number of weeks in my city and I urge the Garda to keep up the pressure.  Recently, Operation Cop&oacute;g, involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Limerick and Limerick City Council, was launched to deal with a specific problem in a specific area.  It is having an impact and I hope it is maintained until we sort out the matter in question.  The local efforts of garda&iacute; have had an impact on a gang and diluted its power in an area but we are receiving news of increased activities in others.  It is vital the Garda tackles this upsurge.</p>  <p>  I will also reference community garda&iacute;.  I have mentioned high-profile Garda seizures, which are necessary and very welcome, but it is my firm belief more must be done on a community level.  Such approaches can be effective in turning vulnerable and young people in particular away from crime.  Community policing can play a vital role in efforts and having dedicated garda&iacute; engaging with people in communities demonstrates to the communities that garda&iacute; are there to help them.  Community garda activity can show a human face of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while building trust between the police force and the community.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that community garda numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years.  In 2015, for example, there were 58 community garda&iacute; in Limerick and now there are 31.  I urge the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner to increase these numbers while ensuring community garda&iacute; are visible and approachable in their duties.</p>  <p>  There is a sense that there are not enough garda&iacute; on the streets in Limerick.  When we had the regeneration programme, it was suggested by Mr. John Fitzgerald that we would need an additional 100 garda&iacute; for the regeneration areas alone.  We never got those.  The numbers have increased but retirements have brought that number back to where it was.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Garda Commissioner to increase these numbers and show that policing numbers are adequate, so when people ring a local Garda station, they can get an answer and a service that allows them to feel safe and secure in their homes and communities.</p></speech>

The criminal justice system is something of a mystery to most people.  They are unsure and, in many cases, puzzled about how decisions are made.  This is sometimes not helped by the media who use the courts system to sensationalise their stories and, more recently, use court cases for clickbait online.  Our ultimate goal should be to keep as many people as possible out of the criminal justice system.  We must ensure that the myriad preventative programmes are well resourced.  These include children and family services, youth initiatives, family resource centres, youth diversion programmes, Tusla's meitheal and child and family support networks, gambling, drug and alcohol addiction and rehabilitation services and many other vital community services.</p><p>Mental health and addiction, in particular, cause more people to be involved in the criminal justice system than any other reason.  In my community, the Genesis Psychotherapy and Family Therapy Service has produced a well thought and strategic plan that would double the amount of counselling hours from 3,800 to over 7,500 at a cost of just under &euro;500,000.  To put that in context, the average cost of keeping a person in prison is &euro;78,000 per year.  The cost of keeping a young person in a secure unit is &euro;200,000 per person per year.  Let us do the mathematics and think about how we could reduce the number of victims and survivors of crimes.  Consider how we could prevent so much waste of human life in the criminal justice system.</p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of community policing and community safety.  In 2016, Garda Trevor Laffan, who had over 35 years of experience in community policing publicly stated:</p> <blockquote> 	There were always gardai who became involved in sports clubs, called into primary schools and became part of the social fabric of the community.  During the late eighties there was a feeling that gardai were becoming disconnected from the general public and &lsquo;Community Policing&rsquo; was introduced in an effort to reverse that trend.<br /><br />Over the following twenty years, that&rsquo;s exactly what it did.  Initially, community gardai were tasked with developing Neighbourhood Watch, a crime prevention strategy, and the Garda Schools Programme. ... as time passed, community policing teams pushed the envelope and developed very successful methods of community engagement. </blockquote>  <p>I am a passionate supporter of the community policing model but, unfortunately, it is being starved of resources.  Recently, there was a series of attacks in Dublin 15.  Thankfully, the incidence has calmed down, but there were a number of shootings in the last couple of years.  I spoke to a community garda who said: &quot;It is deeply frustrating.  I cannot do my job because every time an incident happens, every time a checkpoint needs to be put up or a door-to-door knock, it could take four to five to six days.  It could take weeks to get around a particular area if a car has been dumped after a shooting or a robbery&quot;.  That is time which she said is being taken away from her job, the job she loves and always wanted to do, which is to work in the community.</p><p>I strongly appeal to the Government to listen to the Deputies who have spoken in this debate about community policing.  They have talked about the fear in our communities and about drug gangs and criminal gangs that have taken a grip of some areas.  I worked in the Coolock-Darndale area for 20 years.  When I left there last year after being elected to this House, I had never seen as much fear in a community in all the years I have been working on this.  We must take back control.  We need to ensure that the community feels safe.  We must work with the Garda, the councils and in an inter-agency way to ensure we have safe communities as we move forward.  It can be done, but they need support and resources.  The community deserves that.</p></speech>

They were closed down in the middle of an epidemic.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021 is designed to correct potential anomalies resulting from a ruling of the Supreme Court on the sentencing of individuals to mandatory minimum sentences for a second or subsequent offence under the relevant legislation.  Many of the mandatory sentences for violent offences and drugs offences that are being removed from the various Acts under this Bill were introduced as a consequence of the escalating criminal activity in communities, particularly with regard to drug dealing and the use of firearms.  Such criminal activity, especially drug dealing, has become even more pervasive in today's society.  In areas such as Ballymun and Finglas in my constituency of Dublin North-West, it is unfortunate that drugs have become more easily obtainable than ever.  There also appears to be a corresponding decrease in police resources.  A clear example is the significant decrease in the number of community garda&iacute; not only in my area but in other areas across most of the country.  In the Dublin metropolitan area north, which encompasses the greater part of my constituency, the number of community garda&iacute; has gone from 86 in 2012 to 11 in 2020.  It is a disgrace that an area with a population of over 90,000 has such limited Garda resources available.</p>  <p>  Over the years there has been a massive increase in the number of properties in the area.  Areas such as Ballymun, Finglas and Santry have experienced big increases in local populations due to large-scale construction of housing and apartment projects.  Many more are in the pipeline.  There are areas in the constituency where drug dealing and its related activities are commonplace.  To combat this we need intelligence-driven police action, along with dedicated drug squads to target people dealing drugs.  The illegal use of drugs is becoming a chronic problem across my constituency.  The subject is constantly raised at drugs task force meetings, joint policing committees and local area safety forum meetings.</p>  <p>  Figures for the last couple of years show that Ireland has one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in Europe, with 278 garda&iacute; per 100,000 citizens.  That is 40 fewer than the EU average.  The population of Dublin North-West is becoming increasingly diverse and is growing rapidly.  It is a constituency that experiences serious inequalities.  The constituency has areas that are both socially and economically disadvantaged, where many people live with persistent poverty and social exclusion.  Homelessness is a serious issue in the constituency as well.  These factors affect and determine how policing in the community must operate, as well as the context in which policing generally operates.  There is a perception among the public that judges are out of touch with the public.  That is not helped by their refusal to attend safety forum meetings and joint policing committee meetings.  They have refused numerous times to do that.</p>  <p>  Hopefully, this Bill will address some of the anomalies pointed out by the Supreme Court.  I would also like to think that judges would think very strongly about their general sentencing policies, because many people are of the opinion that the sentences in some cases are too lenient and do not fit the bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800062#LLL00100"><p>I thank everyone who made a contribution to the debate on this Bill.  As Deputies will have noted, the Bill is limited in scope and is designed to rectify the constitutional infirmity identified by the Supreme Court with regard to repealing second or subsequent mandatory sentences, mainly in the area of firearms and misuse of drugs.</p><p>As I noted in my introductory remarks, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect provisions in the statute which provide for presumptive minimum sentences where there is judicial discretion and the issue is not addressed by the Bill.</p><p>I have listened closely to the contributions and wish to address some of them.  Before I get into those, as Minister of State with responsibility for justice, I cannot let Deputy Mattie McGrath&rsquo;s remarks earlier go without comment.  The drawing of a moral equivalence between the actions of Nazi Germany and those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is simply outrageous.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an unarmed police force that acts in the spirit of community policing.  The Nazi Germany regime exterminated 6 million Jews.  It exterminated people because they were gay.  It exterminated Jehovah's Witnesses, gypsies and political prisoners because of their political ideas.  It is not just an insult to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Unfortunately, there is a trend across Europe at the moment with certain political people and groups to trivialise genocide and what happened during the Holocaust.  That is also part of the consequences of the Deputy's statement.  I believe Deputy Mattie McGrath is a good person and I do not think that was his intention.  I ask him to reflect on his comments, however.  I ask him again to withdraw them.</p><p>Several themes came out during the debate today, of which community safety, tackling serious crime and resources were probably the key ideas.  I remind Deputies that the mission of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is about keeping people safe.  It is a simple but clear message.  For me, that is about people being and feeling safe in their communities.  To achieve that sense goes much wider than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and requires a joint approach right across our communities.  That was recognised by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It involves preventative and rehabilitation actions, as well as enforcement.  It involves mental health, education, housing, and tackling poverty is a crucial part in this regard, as well as the built environment.  It is reflected in the key principle of the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to build stronger and safer communities.</p><p>The Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, A Policing Service for the Future, is strongly focused on people's need to see an increase of visibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the streets and an increase in local engagement.</p><p>Community engagement is a defining feature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have seen that in action during the period of Covid-19.  I thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all ranks for its efforts above and beyond the call of duty over the last 14 months in dealing with Covid-19 and ensuring the vulnerable people in our communities are protected and looked out for.</p><p>We want structures to ensure the community element is retained and strengthened.  That is why we published the general scheme of the landmark policing, security and community safety Bill, which was developed on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It recognised that community safety requires all of State services to work together with local communities to make our communities safer.  It is a whole-of-government responsibility.</p><p>Key measures include placing statutory obligations on the Department and public service bodies to co-operate with one another to deliver safer communities, establishing national structures to ensure collaboration is working and establishing local community safety partnerships to develop tailored local safety plans.</p><p>Three community safety partnerships are already up and running in north inner city Dublin and counties Longford and Waterford.  These will be rolled out across the country.  Operation Faoiseamh has been in operation during Covid-19, with enhanced and proactive supports to victims of domestic violence.  Unfortunately, during the period of Covid-19, we have seen a significant increase in occurrences of domestic violence.  The Still Here campaign is ongoing and <i>stillhere.ie</i>is an important website for anybody looking for supports.</p><p>My Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027, which was published a couple of weeks ago, has fundamental policies of widening out engagement with young people who come into contact with the justice system and brings in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as well as other Departments.  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for his support.  It is about ensuring that we can engage with young people who are coming in contact with the criminal justice system, and even before they do so.  We have consistently seen through the research that when young people get involved in criminal activity, very often, behind that is personal trauma such as mental illness or drug and alcohol addiction within the family or they come from minority groups or are early school-leavers.  We need to engage on an early basis and divert those young people and children away from a life of crime into a more positive life they themselves will want.</p><p>We also introduced the antisocial behaviour forum, which recently brought out policy on tackling the scourge of scrambler motorbikes.  However, we also engage with those young people who have a genuine interest in motorbikes to then get them into using their activities in a more positive way.  I have also re-instigated the rural safety forum in order that we can come up with policies and ideas on addressing the issues around rural crime.</p><p>All this work is being supported with unprecedented resources, with &euro;1.952 billion being given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in budget 2021.  We now have 14,600 members of the Garda with provision for further recruitment later this year.  It is all about a vision for community safety.  Our vision is ambitious but we are seeing significant steps being taken on that between myself and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, who has done an extremely good job in driving forward the implementations of policies.</p><p>The Bill at hand is very important.  The irony does not escape me that one or two Deputies came in here and did not even mention the Bill in their debates, but instead used it as a soapbox when the Bill itself seeks to change an error in a previous Bill that was found to be unconstitutional.  Perhaps, if those Deputies spent a little bit more time scrutinising Bills instead of using the D&aacute;il purely as a soapbox, we might not end up in these situations to begin with.  It is a sacred duty of any legislator to actually scrutinise legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to continue with my Second Stage speech on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p><p>Last Wednesday, when first speaking on the Bill, I referred to several issues, including how disenfranchised the general public are in these discussions because of the technical nature of these debates.  I also said climate action campaigns have been fairly middle class with many measures targeting the working class and people with less money.  I wonder if those are more or less likely to be contributing to climate change.</p><p>Earlier this month, during the &quot;Today with Claire Byrne&quot; radio programme, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, spoke out against low-cost flights.  The conversation was around meeting climate change targets and the need to change the way we travel.  The Minister suggested that &euro;10 flights will end.  On special low-cost flights he said, &quot;No, they won't be going for &euro;10, I don't expect that, but people will still be flying.&quot;  He was, of course, talking about the need to halve emissions in transport.</p><p>I have been thinking about this.  It is not the person or family who travel for a sun holiday on a special low-cost flight who are causing the most damage to the climate.  Why should they be deprived of an opportunity to travel when businesspeople can travel all over regularly?  Why can flight costs not be linked to a person&rsquo;s air miles?  The more one flies, the more one pays because the more one is contributing to aviation emissions.  The less frequent fliers are those who can least afford to travel.  Why should they be punished?  If someone can afford three holidays per year, he or she should be charged more for that privilege.  Low-cost flights have opened up travel opportunities for people who may not previously have been able to fly abroad.  It is complete snobbery to suggest that it is the low-cost flights which are causing more damage to the environment.</p><p>The cost of flying should be linked to a person's air miles.  If people are travelling for business, it becomes just another expense.  If they are travelling for pleasure, they can afford to pay more.  If someone is privately jetting around the place, he or she should have huge levies and contributions to make.  We must stop blaming the general population for the pollution of the richer and wealthier.  The Bill does not even cover international aviation and shipping.  These areas of transport are not even included in the definitions but the Minister was already on air talking down to those who buy low-cost flights.</p><p>I thank Johnny McElligott from the Safety Before LNG group for getting in touch this morning about the petition for Ireland to propose a global ban on fracking at the UN.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	When deciding at the Cabinet in the coming weeks on a policy against fracked gas imports, as was agreed in the programme for Government, it would be the appropriate time to decide on the ask that was made directly by grassroots activists on Earth Day to the Government which was to take the opportunity to propose the adoption of a strong UN resolution for a global ban on fracking on climate-mitigation, public-health, environmental-protection and human-rights grounds. </blockquote>  <p>This is a measure that the 2020 programme for Government and widespread public opinion support, and that scientific evidence shows increasingly to be necessary.  A call for a global ban on fracking would set Ireland on course to become a global climate leader.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has already explicitly informed the United Nations Security Council that Ireland will take &quot;a practical and action-orientated approach&rdquo; to climate action.  When he addressed the Berlin Climate and Security Conference in June 2020, he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We must remember that those who have contributed least to climate change - people from least-developed countries and small island developing states - are the most exposed to its consequences.  Those most at risk have the least capacity to respond.  Protecting the most vulnerable and safeguarding their human rights must be at the heart of genuinely inclusive global response.  With climate already driving insecurity, we need the United Nations and the Security Council to play their part.  On the Security Council, Germany has shown great leadership on climate and security.  Ireland, as a newly elected member, will work hard on the council to take this agenda forward. &hellip; We are only ten years away from the deadline that we set for ourselves in the 2030 agenda.  The decade of action is upon us.  Now is the time to act. </blockquote>  <p>When we look back on our record, I wonder if we will see that we have acted.  I was on the climate committee when Professor Robert Howarth explained that importing fracked gas would leave a carbon-equivalent footprint at least 44% greater than importing coal over a 20-year period.  True climate action is about looking at the impact of our decisions.  We need victories against the fossil fuel sector to bring the people along in this journey.  We need to think globally and act locally.</p><p>Last week, there were yet another two depressing reports published.  The Global Energy Review by the International Energy Agency, IEA, showed that carbon dioxide emissions are predicted to rise by 1.5 billion tonnes in 2021.  This increase will reverse most of the decline seen in 2020, which we know was due to Covid.  The report of the UN's World Meteorological Organization, Global Climate 2020, was also published.  The Secretary General of the UN, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, said:</p> <blockquote> 	This report shows that we have no time to waste.  The climate is changing, and the impacts are already too costly for people and the planet.  This is the year for action. </blockquote>  <p>That is perhaps the understatement of the century.  Will we look back on this time and see that Ireland acted?  I hope we will.  However, I do not know whether this Bill will provide the impetus to make that happen.  I am concerned the Bill does not refer to justice actions.  It provides the perfect opportunity to have these enshrined as the Government's policy but, instead, they have been left behind.  That is a worrying omen for the future.</p><p>We will be taking actions with this legislation which will make ordinary and poor people responsible for climate action.  They are the people who can bring about these changes if the Government puts in place a system which will make them able to bring about the necessary changes.  That is what we need to do in the time we have left in the next year or two.  I hope we can but I think the jury is still out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800063#MMM00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Government's climate change action Bill.  It is an important element of the programme for Government, as well as having been a crucial element of the Government formation talks.</p>  <p>  The Bill sets out how the whole of government can, must and will confront climate change, reduce emissions, as well as providing and ensuring real actions and commitments to match Ireland's obligations under the Paris accord.  The Bill provides a focused procedure and set of processes which are new to the Government seeking to address climate change.  In recent years and decades, we flittered around it and flattered to deceive.</p>  <p>There has been some progress but not nearly enough to match previous commitments and previous signatures to previous accords.  One thinks of the social change we have witnessed in this country in the last ten years and how it was slow to materialise.  When the various Oireachtas committees, motions and debates were taking place, when there was consideration of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations and when the issue was then put before special Oireachtas hearings and further scrutiny took place, all the while the people of the younger generation were demanding to participate, to force an opportunity for them to dominate that debate.  Ultimately, it was them who convinced many in the rest of the population to pass both referendums.  Many of us, all of us in fact, revelled in their participation.  We welcomed and admired them and thanked them for such participation.  We hoped they would involve themselves in future debates and decisions for the country, be they social or indeed economic.  It is that generation, and indeed the younger one, which dominates this subject matter and demands action.</p> <p> The last election was dominated by a number of issues, predominantly housing, health, balanced regional development and climate change.  The electorate naturally expects the Government subsequently elected by the D&aacute;il to address and place emphasis on these issues.  We provided for the largest ever monetary provision in relation to our efforts to address the social and affordable housing situation.  We also have an opportunity, like never before, to finally invest in the sort of funding that is necessary in both acute and community health services, by building on the goodwill, the endeavour and the lifesaving actions of all those who have worked so diligently and with such effort and commitment in the health services during the course of the pandemic.  We have also heard in recent weeks how the Government will seek to augment and support remote working to provide e-hubs in many towns and villages across the country which otherwise need and deserve such action and for such an opportunity to be presented.  It is obviously one of the good things that has come out of the pandemic.</p> <p> Now, at this stage, we can build and act on the climate change credentials of this Government with this Bill.  It was not just members of the Green Party who spoke of, participated in or commented on their or their party's aspirations on the country's commitments in the Paris Agreement.  Last week I noted even Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said he was not a climate denier.  However, what many of these people have successfully denied to date is their failure to inform the rest of the electorate and the rest of the House, what specific measures they would make, initiate or participate in, in order to meet our commitments.  Would they deny the Paris Agreement?  Would they by association deny this country the type of international investment that is there for the taking in relation to measures, methods and initiatives in the provision of alternative energies, for example?  In the absence of those specifics, many of them shout loudest, shriek loudest, for extra funding for flood relief schemes to deal with the very issues caused by the very issues we seek to address tonight.  They shout and shriek loudest for increased funding towards the rural environmental protections scheme, REPS, in agriculture.  Again, that too has become too much of an income support rather than the initiative it was intended to be in the first instance and we hope the new scheme and the opportunities presented by the CAP will afford this Government an opportunity to make real inroads there and offer real opportunities for increased income for farm families.  We also hear many shriek and shout loudly for exceptional payments over and above what is there presently with house adaptation grants, for example.  Again, this is due to the pressures caused by global warming and climate change.</p> <p> The Bill places obligations and responsibilities and an onus on each Government Department to specifically commit to and account for and contribute to the whole-of-government targets on reducing emissions.  They will be part of carbon budgets with projected actions on a five-year basis and will of course be responsible and accountable to the D&aacute;il.  This too will complement and assure our credibility when we are seeking investment into our economy from international sources.  Such funding, from pension funds and the like, is now exclusively dependent on sustainable practices and government pathways towards necessary emission reductions.  Such ethics are now a reality.  Our economy, let alone our environment, cannot ignore that reality.  However, that is not to say the road ahead is an easy one.  It is not to say change will be seamless.  It not to say the entire population, or sectors within it, get it or are on the same page.  To make this process easier, achievable, workable and to garner the results craved economically and socially, the Government must show leadership, offer hope, bring people together, offer assistance, help, entice, assure and reward the sort of change that is necessary.  We must seek to engender an attitude, a feeling, a belief that we can come out of climate change actions far better off than we went into them.</p> <p> Many have spoken here, and speak regularly, about the challenges faced by farmers and facing agriculture.  However, few acknowledge the advancements, progress and leadership provided to date by that sector.  The agricultural industry, the food and drink industry, remains one of our greatest assets and exports.  It retains its status as a world leader because of its ability to adapt and to change, to embrace diversity, adapt to consumer sentiments, explore new markets and deliver a quality product.  The lazy argument that the industry must simply reduce the national herd to play its role is exactly that: lazy and absurd.  The growing world population and growing world markets mean our produce must keep pace.  It can do so as other industries can, namely, by adapting and aligning production systems to environmental ambition and by recognising, embracing and employing new sciences and innovation to meet that demand.</p> <p> When I talk of the Government offering hope, assistance, help, initiatives, incentives and rewards, I consider or would have considered the example that should have been shown with energy transition in County Offaly and the midlands.  The accelerated decarbonisation process including cessation of peat extraction meant the Government was under severe pressure to provide and cater for a just transition in the past two years.  I envisaged funding addressing the effects of cessation and change with improved educational retraining opportunities and the potential to be derived from alternative energy options, proposals and solutions.  I would have expected us to champion innovation among other projects within the counties impacted on.  Such a positive experience for us in my county and region could and should be an example to other regions and sectors.</p> <p> Unfortunately, I am extremely sorry to say this has not been our experience to date.  It is therefore essential that parallel to this Bill's journey through the Oireachtas, this Government convene or reconvene Department officials who have responsibility in this area and the just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, whose reports issued following extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders.  His reports are representative of the ambition that exists in our country among its communities and among public representatives, such as myself, too.</p> <p> I committed to, and sold, just transition to my electorate.  It is therefore my duty at this stage to call out the lack of progress and to insist on it being rectified as soon as possible.  It was with this mindset that I wrote to the Taoiseach last week on the commencement of this debate.  I take this opportunity to read it into the Official Report.  It is dated, as I said, Wednesday, 21 April.</p> <p>It states:</p><blockquote>	  	Dear Taoiseach,<br /><br />With the Climate Change Bill now published I think it an opportune time to voice my disappointment, frustration and no little anger at the ridiculously slow, poorly administered and apparent inept governance/leadership/delivery of just transition to date.<br /><br />I was at the forefront of our Party's commitment to establish and ensure that revenue raised from carbon taxes would fund just transition in areas/counties/regions most impacted by decarbonisation.  Indeed, I championed the increase [in carbon tax] when a Fianna F&aacute;il negotiator agreeing the budget in October 2018.  We also insisted on fuel poverty provisions being included [in that package to give it the sort of credibility the project deserved].<br /><br />The slow snail's pace &amp;amp; lack of progress to date is a far cry from where I'd expected to be today.  That's further compounded [for me personally] considering Fianna F&aacute;il being the lead party in government since June last year.  It would appear not having a cabinet member for example from Offaly, Longford, Laois, Kildare, Westmeath, Roscommon or [even] East Galway is very evident and telling when it comes to just transition.<br /><br />In recent weeks I posed a series of written PQ's to Minister Ryan on just transition matters.  Unfortunately, the responses (rather than answers) confirmed my fears/concerns [which are included in this letter I refer to].  Those responses included confirmation that:<br /><br />1) not one job [I am afraid] has yet been created by just transition funding.<br /><br />2) only &euro;166,000 has been drawn down to date<br /><br />3) the rules/terms associated with the proposed funding previously announced/lauded [by me too, I might add] do little to ensure such funds will materialise [at all].<br /><br />4) the county most impacted by [Bord na M&oacute;na and] ESB job losses &amp;amp; economic damage (Offaly) is not prioritised or benefitting as proportionately as it should.  There also appears to be a suggestion that the midland region be extended even further for the purpose of the EU [just transition fund], further diluting the impact on communities most affected.<br /><br />5) the midlands regional transition team is merely a sounding board with no real powers (despite recommendations to the contrary by Kieran Mulvey, Just Commissioner and I [and others]).  It would appear too that the Dept is actually depriving BNM / ESB staff of upskilling opportunities that match the jobs the [just transition fund] may create, as they won't share any of the details of these employment opportunities [that they have sought to enter into].<br /><br />6) there's no decision on potential community gain arising from either a) [the Department's] consideration [or] investigation [into the] future use of now [defunct] power plants at Lanesboro &amp;amp; Shannonbridge.  [There has been no response to my recommendation, where I asked that the local authorities would act as administrators in seeking an open tender competition to determine the future use of those plants that might yield a community, social and economic gain.]  Concurrently ESB are seeking a refund from the energy regulator of the &euro;5m it supposedly &quot;gifted&quot; to just transition upon the announcement of the closures.  It is also seeking further millions from the same source to cover costs of its exit!!<br /><br />Of course, notwithstanding the above there's the ongoing failure of still not having put in place a greatly expanded program of home heating retrofit options thus neglecting the very people impacted greatest by the suddenness of decarbonisation.<br /><br />Meanwhile in the midst of this lack of progress we see the ongoing and indeed growing &quot;importation&quot; of peat products for horticulture and home heating fuels.  That indeed is making a laugh and mockery of just transition process altogether!<br /><br />I had sought a meeting to discuss just transition some months ago and still await a date for same.<br /><br />In the meantime, [Taoiseach,] you can see from this short appraisal the obvious social, economic and political ramifications of such poor progress on these matters to date.  </blockquote> <p>That was the end of the letter.<br/><br/>I wish this Bill every success.  I wish the process of its passage success and I expect that the interaction and engagement by Members of both Houses will improve the Bill and give it the type of ownership that is required to ensure its then leadership can deliver on its intent.  I especially hope that Members will recognise that the update I have given the House on just transition reflects the view emanating from the relevant stakeholders, including ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na workers of today and the past; pensioners and their families and communities; the county; and the region.  It is also the view of other representatives, of all parties and none, whether they are councillors in the locality or my colleague, Deputy Nolan.<br/><br/>When we are elected to this D&aacute;il, irrespective of one's background, party or affiliation, one's duty is to those who gave one the privilege to be here.  This was the major issue in our constituency and we will work together, as it is expected of our electorate, to ensure that this Government responds properly and effectively and based on the commitments it made two years ago.  It has an opportunity to recommit to them in the context of this Bill and debate and it has the opportunity to rectify the measures which have not been successful to date and which have been unworkable to date.  That is why I said earlier and why I ask again that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications bring back to the Department the aspiration, wish and demand we are making, namely, for the relevant stakeholders in the Department, the just transition commissioner and the public representatives, who have a duty to respond to the needs and aspirations of those we are given the privilege to represent.  We want to be there to ensure the changes that are necessary are made as quickly as is possible.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, there is every potential for that example to be a great one to others and for us to come out of this process and these necessary actions far better than we went into them.  I also said that the prospect of international investment, financiers and pension funds investing in this country is dependent on our commitment to what is contained within this Bill and on various sectors living up to expectations in a real and meaningful manner.  They should not be browbeaten into it or forced to do this, that or the other.  There should be a commitment on the part of everybody who is here to recognise that and to work together to ensure the Bill is real, meaningful and can deliver to all the sectors that fear the impact they may feel because of it.</p></speech>

While the most pressing and immediate issues facing our society are the Covid-19 crisis and then beyond that the issues of housing, health, childcare and employment, it is fair to say that climate change and tackling the biodiversity crisis are the greatest challenges of our generation.  That is not just in this jurisdiction but right around the globe.</p>  <p>  Before I talk on the Bill, I want to commend all of those environmental activists who, over decades, have kept this issue to the fore of the public and political agenda.  I pay special tribute to the young people who organised, in huge numbers, the Fridays for Future demonstrations last year and previously.  As one of many Deputies who attended those demonstrations, one could not but be struck by the energy, enthusiasm and clear determination of those young people to ensure that those of us entrusted with passing legislation and introducing policy in this House do the right thing, not just for ourselves but for them and their futures, the future of the planet and the future of our environment.</p>  <p>  The legislation before us is important because, while it does not say how our society should move towards carbon neutrality and tackle the biodiversity crisis, it sets clear and legally binding obligations that future Governments must meet.  That is what has been missing from the framework in recent years.  Due to inaction by Governments for decades, we are laggards when it comes to meeting the challenge of climate change and as a result; we have a far larger mountain to climb than we would have otherwise had if previous Governments had acted appropriately.</p>  <p>  I also want to pay tribute to the Committee on Climate Action.</p> <p>When the Minister, Deputy Ryan, first published this Bill, it was incredibly weak.  In fact, at that stage the Minister wanted to fast-track the legislation and have it done and dusted by the end of last year.  Thankfully, because of the environmental movement on the outside and the hard work of many members of the committee, we have much better legislation in front of us.  It is not perfect and it needs change and I hope the Government will continue to listen to people inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that when the Bill is finally passed that it is the best possible legislation to help this and future Governments do the right thing by the people of this jurisdiction as we rise to the challenges ahead.</p> <p> I want to outline a number of key concerns about the legislation and then make a number of more general comments relevant to my portfolio of housing and planning if I have the time.  I thank Deputy Cowen for what was a very honest and thought-provoking comment on an issue I wanted to raise, which is that of just transition.  There are many challenges in moving towards a carbon-neutral economy and it is absolutely central that those who are most responsible for carbon emissions pay that price.  Of course, they are not working people.  They are not people who are struggling to pay bills to keep their children in school and ensure that when somebody is sick or has an emergency there is enough money in the credit union to meet those challenges.  The people who are primarily responsible for carbon emissions are large industries or governments and those who are much more wealthy in our society.  Therefore, if we are to move towards a carbon-neutral economy it has to be done in a way that ensures those most able to pay and those most responsible for those carbon emissions pay their fair share, and that the burden of the transition is not heaped on working people, particularly those working people least able to pay and most negatively affected by some of those challenges.</p> <p> Listening carefully to Deputy Cowen, not only confirms the concerns of many of us in opposition that the previous Government and this Government did not and have not adequately put in place the supports and mechanisms to ensure a just transition but also that the Government is not even engaging with its own backbenchers who are clearly and legitimately raising these issues.  The biggest task for the climate committee and then the Oireachtas is to ensure that a just transition is placed at the very heart of the Bill.  It is important to note that, for example, the legislation in Scotland has a chapter of principles detailing what a just transition looks like.  The legislation before us has weak language and short text that has to be changed.</p> <p> The next issue that has been raised, including by my colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke, our spokesperson on the matter, when he spoke last week, was the issue of interim targets.  There is some confusion about this issue.  The targets set are based on science and the Government has already signed up to them in a number of international and European agreements.  What we need to ensure is that the Government meets the targets it is setting for itself.  It would be completely unacceptable if the Government had weak language on interim targets to get itself off the hook and then on the other side of a general election, which, hopefully, produces a progressive government led by my party, the next government would have to pick up the slack for the failure to act of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  Nobody is proposing to change targets, just to ensure the targets are met appropriately as we move from 2021 to 2030 and then to 2050.</p> <p> The next issue is that of consultation.  This cannot be done unless it is done in partnership with communities.  Today we saw an appalling scene in another related matter central to tackling the biodiversity crisis.  The Government shutdown scrutiny, consultation and debate with key representative organisations, including inshore fishermen and environmental non-governmental organisations, concerned about marine biodiversity.  It would not create a platform for these organisations to raise their concerns regarding the marine planning framework.  The fear, of course, is that the Government will plough ahead with large industrial-scale offshore wind energy while sacrificing marine biodiversity and hard-pressed inshore fishermen and their communities.  This is not the way to advance the cause of climate change or to tackle the biodiversity crisis.</p> <p> Much of the debate we have had in recent days has focused on very important issues, and my colleagues will deal with some of these.  We also have to ensure that all other areas in the debate are adequately addressed.  We need to change our planning code.  We need to ensure that we repopulate our villages, towns and particularly our city centres, and end the bad practice of suburban sprawl and the car dependency that comes with it.</p> <p> We need to make housing affordable.  How can we ensure people are less dependent on cars, particularly in our cities, if they are forced to live far away from where they work, play and send their children to school?  Housing affordability, particularly in our city centres, is vital.  This is something on which the Government continues to fail.  We need to ensure the infrastructure is there, including public transport, schools and  cr&egrave;ches, so that people can genuinely live in the 15 minute city where they can walk from home to work and school and to play within that time.</p> <p> We need to tackle the embedded carbon in our construction and building products.  We need to embrace new technologies and new ways of developing our construction, particularly residential construction, so that we do not just take into account the energy usage of new homes which, of course, should all be A2 rated but also take into account all of the carbon that is involved in the building of these homes so they have the minimum impact on our environment.</p> <p> This is an important Bill but it only sets the targets.  It is up to the Government to determine how we then reach those targets.  I am very concerned that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party will do what they have always done, which is to try to make ordinary working people pay for the mistakes and bad practices of governments and corporations.  Let us have real climate change.  Let us have real action on biodiversity.  Let us do it in a way that is just and fair, with clear consultation and in partnership with communities the length and breadth of the country.  If we do this we will meet these targets in a way that is good for our economy, society and environment, and in a way that is good, in particular, for those least able to pay the costs of the changes that will come down the tracks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800066#PPP00200"><p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which is the principal Act, placed national climate policy on a statutory footing for the first time in Ireland.  This was a significant step.  One of the main criticisms of it was a lack of specific emissions targets.  The draft amendment Bill of 2020 was a step forward in this regard in that it tried to set out a legal framework by which Ireland's 2050 climate emissions targets were to be reached.  However, as my colleague, Senator Boylan, pointed out, it was full of loopholes.  The amendment Bill of 2021 is more ambitious than its draft predecessor and I welcome this.  It provides for many of the recommendations made by the committee, which is also welcome.  It provides for 2030 interim targets with five-year carbon budgets, sectoral emissions ceilings, an annually updated climate action plan and a long-term climate action strategy.</p>  <p>  This places Ireland on a surer footing when it comes to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and will allow us to play our part in this transition.  This will require a fundamental transformation of the Irish and European economies, with sectors such as transport, buildings and energy production all having key roles to play.  We must recognise this as a bold, ambitious and exciting opportunity for us to create new jobs, new industries and new ways of life.</p>  <p>  As the Covid crisis recedes, we should see the tackling of this climate crisis as a route back to a more sustainable planet with an economy based on inclusive growth and shared prosperity.  It was very concerning that a just transition was not mentioned once in the first draft of the Bill.  It was even more disappointing that the inclusion of references to a just transition have been so weak in this redraft.  Phrases such as "best endeavours" and "in so far as is practicable" are not a just transition and will do nothing to bring communities along the road to decarbonisation.  The Bill fails to grasp the opportunity provided to reimagine and recreate the society in which we live.</p>  <p>  As we come out of the pandemic we will face a new challenge of unemployment, specifically long-term unemployment.</p> <p>Many have now been out of work for a year.  That is, of course, considered as long-term unemployment.  We have already heard from the Government that it is considering removing aid to those businesses which it no longer deems to be viable meaning that a cohort of people will not be able to go back to work.  We are told, of course, that new digital jobs will be created but the reality is that this, too, leaves behind a specific age group who do not have those digital skills.  We need to realise not everyone will learn how to code.  We have an opportunity here to tackle this pending unemployment crisis and the climate crisis through the creation of green jobs and we should not let this opportunity slide.<br/><br/>There is also an important omission that had been included in the programme for Government around the 7% per annum reductions.  While I recognise this Bill sets a 51% reduction over the decade in law, it does not provide for the 7% annual reduction figures, which leading climate experts have said is a serious flaw.<br/><br/>Ireland has been a laggard on climate action and has continually kicked the can down the road and missed its targets.  We need to ensure the Government starts immediately to reduce emissions and does not leave the heavy lifting to the next Government, which will bring us up to our 2030 target.<br/><br/>There is also a question raised relating to the accountability of those who fail to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  We saw in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the Bill does not provide for penalties if targets are not met but it is understood that where actions fall short in particular sectors, Ministers with responsibilities in these areas may in future face budget reductions.  A clear line of accountability is lacking here.  Too often in the past, when targets have not been reached, there has been a shrug of the shoulders and an acceptance of fines.<br/><br/>I am also concerned by the recent High Court ruling interpretation of the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act which found that the Government is not a relevant body.  That is ridiculous.  My party has written to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and asked him to amend this before it comes to the D&aacute;il to close this loophole.<br/><br/>The 2015 principal Act first established the bone structure of our national climate Bill by placing it on a statutory footing, and the current amendment Bill acts as a connective tissue which ties our climate policy to specific targets.  However, my lingering concern is we are awaiting the muscle fibres needed to drive performance so as to reach these targets, and it is seems like that job, in addition to others, may fall to a future Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800067#QQQ00200"><p>When I talk to people in rural communities and I ask them what climate change means to them and what climate action has meant to them, they tell me it means higher taxes, higher costs on products for which they have no alternatives, job losses and greater fear for their livelihoods, particularly in farming families.  The climate crisis is real.  The need for a climate action Bill is real but so too is the need for this House and for Government to recognise the real concerns and the realities of ordinary workers, families and rural communities.</p>  <p>  The biggest problem I have is the confidence that any of the parties in government can address those concerns and realise the difficulties of the realities I have outlined.  I heard one Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy assert that perhaps the problem was the lack of a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister from the midlands in Cabinet.  I would have to say the real problem is the lack of any ambition or vision for rural communities within Fianna F&aacute;il or within the Government as a whole.  In fact, none of the parties that make up the Government - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party - can be trusted to deliver for either the environment or for rural communities.  I base that entirely on their track record.  The Green Party, in particular, has adopted a policy of simply exporting whatever it perceives to be problems.</p>  <p>  A good example of that has been the approach to horticultural peat.  The Green Party has driven an agenda, that has been by and large facilitated by its Government partners, of banning the cultivation of horticultural peat - a key component in vital sectors of rural communities such as the mushroom industry.  When asked, they tell us those sectors need to find alternatives, but when you engage with them, as I did with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in this Chamber, and ask what are the alternatives, the alternative is importing peat from outside of the State.  That is not climate action.  That is hypocrisy.  If we take the same approach to beef, for example, as we do to peat, that is hypocrisy that will devastate rural communities for no benefit for the environment whatsoever.  If we were to suggest, as we apparently are, that we reduce the number of suckler farmers and suckler beef cows being produced along the west, the Border region or the midlands, and on the other hand agree, as the Government has done, to a Mercosur trade deal that will see the importation of 100,000 tonnes of additional Brazilian beef to the European market, that is not climate action.  That is hypocrisy.  We need the State bodies and Government agencies to take responsibility.  People want and are asking for fairness.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to many dairy farmers who have expanded in recent years.  Many young farmers were told dairy was the sector for them.  They were told by Ministers, State agencies and financial institutions they needed to go into or expand in dairy, and yet this week there are being told there is a limit to the amount of milk that they will produce.  Nobody is suggesting there will be less milk consumed.  The only question left unanswered is where that milk will be produced.  If our only suggestion is we reduce food production in Ireland and we import from countries of more intensive production such as those in South America, that is not climate action.  That is hypocrisy.</p>  <p>  I have listened to Government representatives all throughout this debate talking about just transition and fairness for rural communities, and none of them has specified what that means in reality.  I will put up to them two challenges.  The first is we rural-proof the policies to ensure the response to climate action we all agree needs to happen does not disproportionately impact those who have suffered as a result of virtually all other Government policies, whether it be regional development or the wider economic policies driven by successive governments.  If we are to be serious about climate action, let us get serious about those who are primarily responsible for the climate crisis, that is, the big corporations - those who will find it easiest to transition to alternatives.  Those who cannot transition to alternatives in the short term without Government support, that is, ordinary workers, ordinary families and the rural communities of the country, need to be facilitated.</p></speech>

We look at people who have been planting trees and minding the fields, hedgerows and communities of our countryside.  As a practising farmer myself, I take great pride in what our farmers have done over the years.</p>  <p>  They are also providing food.  They are providing excellent produce, which is very green and which is seen as being environmentally friendly the world over.  We have to make sure in all the debates that we have at the forefront of our mind that Irish agriculture is probably one of the most green agriculture sectors on the planet.  It is being produced with a great deal of regulation that has been put in over the years.  We have to ensure that food security.  Many decades ago, the European Union was set up in relation to food security.  We want to make sure our food is produced to the highest standard, that the people who work every day to produce it are supported and that our industry is supported.  That has to be at the very front of it.</p> <p>One could be forgiven for thinking that agriculture is the sole reason for the challenges we face in terms of climate change and the green agenda but that is not so.  As I look around at my own community, I am reminded of the poem by M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Dire&aacute;in and the lines: </p><blockquote>	Th&oacute;g an fear seo teach<br /><br />Is an fear &uacute;d<br /><br />Cla&iacute; n&oacute; f&aacute;l<br /><br />A mhair ina dhiaidh<br /><br />Is a choinnigh a chuimhne buan. </blockquote> <p>When one looks around, one sees the fantastic work that has been done by generations of farmers, by people who planted hedgerows, worked in their communities and enhanced our environment.  We should take our hats off to those people and should protect agriculture going forward.  <br/><br/>I wish to raise the issues of energy efficiency, the retrofitting of homes and the cost of the energy required to heat homes.  The green agenda is a national agenda and it is a challenge for our own Government and for governments the world over.  The green agenda will yield long-term benefits for our climate and our planet and, in that context, we must ensure that the retrofitting of homes is a priority for the Government.  We must address the long wait for approval under the warmer homes retrofitting scheme and improve the incentives.  Many houses built between 40 and 60 years ago need to be retrofitted but the grants that are available do not match the costs involved in retrofitting them to the standard required today.  The grants that are available are minuscule.  They simply are not sufficient to incentivise people to retrofit their homes.  Such retrofitting will benefit the State and will progress the green agenda.  If we are serious about this, we must provide proper incentives for people to retrofit their homes.<br/><br/>I welcome the progress made in recent months on the generation of offshore wind energy.  This is something that was talked about six or seven years ago but the technology exists today to allow us to generate electricity offshore and bring it on to our island.  This is hugely important and will form an important part of the debate in various communities on the sustainability of wind energy.  <br/><br/>In recent decades we have pursued a planning policy based on the urbanisation of our society.  The policy has been to push economic activity into large urban centres.  I have been saying since the day I was elected to the D&aacute;il that this policy is wrong.  It was wrong then and it is wrong now.  That policy has fundamentally failed, especially in the context of the green agenda being debated here today.  On transport, let us consider the number of cars on the road and the fact that many people have to commute long distances for work.  That goes against the green agenda.  It also goes against the idea of a balanced society and proper regional development.  The policy was wrong from the start and some of the people who were driving it were toffee-nosed people who looked down their noses at rural communities.  They were not prepared to listen to the debate we were having and to the arguments in favour of balanced regional development.  In the past 12 months more has been done for regional development than ever before.  Unfortunate as the global Covid-19 pandemic has been, it has forced many people to examine their lifestyles and to reassess the benefits of rural communities.  There has been much negative commentary about rural communities in various media but we now have a chance to do the right thing, not just in terms of rebalancing society and advancing the green agenda, but also for the sake of human beings.  We have a chance to do something for the person who has spent two or three hours every day commuting to work rather than being able to work in his or her local rural community.  <br/><br/>Our rural communities are ready to embrace change.  In the context of the green agenda, the climate change agenda and the challenges we face, we must make sure that we are starting from the correct base.  We cannot start from the planning policy base of recent decades that holds we must urbanise everything.  I fundamentally believe that we have to ruralise everything.  We must turn the policy on its head completely.  We must ruralise everything on the basis of the benefits that will bring in the context of the green agenda.  There has been much talk of digital hubs, rural hubs and people working from home.  The great enabler of all of this, of course, is broadband.  If we are to properly embrace the agenda we are debating, we must be very serious about rural Ireland and what it can contribute to improving our climate, our planet and the lifestyle of our people.<br/><br/>These are fundamental issues.  The contributors to this debate have been very serious and have put a great deal of thought into their contributions.  Serious commentators the world over have said that climate change is the biggest issue facing mankind.  We have a duty in this country to make sure that we are fully informed as we make decisions on the future.  We cannot just look at this issue through the prism of urban centres or the way we have approached planning heretofore.  We have to turn it on its head.  We have to recognise the good that is in our countryside and we have to protect it.  We must recognise the enormous contribution of agriculture the world over.  We must protect that and not threaten it further.  We must engage on agriculture and make sure that the family farm remains viable.  We must make sure there is proper planning and that rural regeneration is our focus.  The change of emphasis towards rural Ireland must be maintained.  If we are serious about energy, we must put a proper system in place to retrofit homes.  This will ensure that people who are less well off will be able to reduce their energy bills and their reliance on fossil fuels.  <br/><br/>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  I will contribute again on later stages as the Bill makes its way through the House.</p></speech>

We will support it but will table amendments to it to make it more robust.  I will start by acknowledging the countless emails I have received from my constituents in Cork East in respect of the Bill.  There are one or two points that I would like to see addressed in it, as reflected in the emails from my constituents.  The first relates to the Climate Change Advisory Council and the adequacy of the 2050 net zero target.  It is vitally important to reflect the fact that climate change does not affect everyone or every county equally but impacts first, and most profoundly, on poorer countries, counties and communities, on those that have done the least to cause the problem and who have the least resources to cope.  A target of net zero emissions by 2050, which is the climate neutrality objective as defined in the Bill, is simply too little, too late, is out of step with the scientific advice presented to the Oireachtas and does not amount to our fair share of the global effort needed to deliver on the Paris Agreement.</p>  <p>  The second point relates to the just transition, a phrase that is used quite often in this debate.  It is important to acknowledge that in the sphere of agriculture-----</p></speech>

Circuses have been unfairly treated by the Department and the Arts Council.  In practical terms, circuses have been singled out with regard to the lack of funding being given to them over the last year.  As a result, many of them are in serious danger, will not get through this crisis and will have to fold up their tents.  I ask the Minister why circuses have been singled out and treated differently by so many performance arts organisations.</p></reply>

Both strands are valued artistically, with classical circus having a long working history in Ireland, while contemporary circus practice is relatively new.  The Arts Act 2003 cites circus as one of nine art forms.  As an art form, circus attracts high audience numbers each year including many rural audiences and members of new communities.</p>  <p>  The live events sector has been impacted by Covid-19.  I know there were some drive-in circuses last year, which shows once again the innovation of the arts sector.  Government support for circus as an art form is channelled through the Arts Council.  While there are enterprise supports available for businesses and individuals impacted by Covid-19, these are matters for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, in his role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the criteria for their eligibility.  </p>  <p>  Primary support for the arts, including circus, is delivered through the Arts Council which is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record level of &euro;130 million this year.  It is important for me to point out that under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.</p> <p>The strategic context for the council's support of circus and all other art forms is set out in Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy 2016-2025.  The Arts Council supports both strands of circus and, through direct support and strategic intervention, engages with the sector to assist individuals and organisations to develop high-quality performance and participatory work.</p> <p> Circus is supported by the Arts Council by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  There were very significant increases in supports provided for the circus in 2020 and 2021, with over &euro;2.2 million allocated to circus, street arts and spectacle in 2021.  The council makes awards to circus organisations and to individual circus artists.</p> <p> In 2020, many circus artists also qualified for the council&rsquo;s Covid-19 crisis response award.  Details of all grants are available on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website.</p></speech>

Traditional circuses are not being funded.  They are not getting any money from the Arts Council.  I have put a dozen questions in to the Department.  The Department has told me to go to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I have put questions in to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it told me to go to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council said it has no money for the likes of Duffy's Circus.  It is an incredible situation that circuses are some of the most successful cultural and performance arts groups in this country.  Their reach is incredible.  Practically everybody in the country has a chance to access a circus.  They wash their own faces financially, typically.  They are even recognised by UNESCO for their heritage value.  I think there is snobbery at the heart of this with regard to the fact that the Department and the Arts Council have refused point-blank to provide traditional circuses in this country with the funds to get through the pandemic.  The Government has prevented them from functioning, taken their income away from them, and not supplied any supports.</p></speech>

That information may have been gleaned through the Department or the Arts Council but the circuses are not getting the money.  The Arts Council confirmed this week that it is not providing traditional circuses here with meaningful funding to counteract the devastation caused by Covid.  Whatever the Minister is being told in her Department or the Arts Council, these circuses are not getting it.  I ask the Minister to please meet with Duffy's Circus and the people involved in traditional circuses.  There is a chasm between what the Minister just said and the experience on the ground.  I have gone around in circles.  We have spent at least four or five months putting questions to the Department, ringing up secretaries general, and having conversations with the Arts Council.  The Arts Council said there is no money for traditional circuses.</p></speech>

While I will not pre-empt the Government's decision in this regard, I have been working closely with the sector, including meetings today, to ensure its voice is heard and perspectives understood.</p>  <p>  The tourism recovery plan was taken into consideration for budget 2021, where substantial measures were put in place to support and strengthen the tourism sector.  There was a record level of funding for tourism overall, of just under &euro;221 million and there have been additional measures to support tourism, such as the VAT rate reduction to 9%, as well as the &euro;55 million tourism business continuity scheme, the Covid-19 adaptation fund and other tourism sector-specific schemes.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery.  I am working on a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme for the sector.  As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will outline how it will help people to return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland, at the appropriate time, will be launching its "Keep Discovering" campaign to inspire more people to take a break in Ireland this summer and in the shoulder season.  The initial campaign will include promotions for each of the regional brand areas, including Dublin, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, and will be supported by substantial marketing campaigns.</p></speech>

I hope that is not on the cards for this season again.  Last year, it was a complete flop.  I think the Minister will acknowledge that herself.  Just 10,000 people benefited from it.  There were thousands of low earners who were excluded from benefiting from it, which was a shame.  The total amount that was claimed was under &euro;2 million and the tax expenditure recorded on the receipts was under &euro;9.7 million.  The fact that it was brought in off-season excluded families totally.  What use is having an incentive for tourism if it excludes the entire school holiday period?  I hope that the Minister will consider something that would benefit people more significantly than the flop that that was.  Will the Minister consider the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal of the staycation voucher which would benefit every man, woman and child in the State and local economies?</p></speech>

It was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It was quite an innovative approach to incentivise spending.  However, the public health conditions beyond our control have clearly prevented that incentivisation of spending because of the stop and start nature of the pandemic.  The unpredictability and consequences of the pandemic have resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised.  A review of the stay and spend scheme was one of the recent recommendations of the tourism recovery oversight group.  I have urged Cabinet colleagues to give this and other recommendations of the report serious consideration to facilitate the reopening of the sector.  It is anticipated that the Minister for Finance will then take stock and look at what additional measures might be appropriate.  I am cognisant of the seasonal nature of the industry, financial challenges and the leaner shoulder and off-season months.  I believe that supports will need to consider that impact on the off-season.  I am open to all supports that can help the tourism sector.</p></speech>

As she said, it was a positive move with &euro;12 million for local authorities to use in respect of adaptations for outdoor dining.  The concern, however, is the &euro;5 million allocated for individual businesses.  She does not need me to tell her that the sector is on its knees.  For the most part, and especially for June and July, it seems certain that it will be a case of outdoor dining.  The sector will need every assistance to prepare for that, whether that involves weatherproofing, seaters and-or heaters.  The sum of &euro;5 million is insufficient in that regard.  The sector is looking for the Minister to fight its corner.  Will she insist that this allocation is increased?  There are more than 10,000 premises affected between restaurants, pubs and hotels in the State.  Not all of them will be able to adapt or claim the support, but-----</p></speech>

I reiterate that I am open to considering everything and anything that will help the tourism sector to reboot.</p>  <p>  On the outdoor dining grant, we had this conversation last week.  It has been very well-received by the sector.  I am not hearing this cry for help from the sector that the Deputy mentioned.  The grant has been well received.  The applications are open.  Of course, if it all dried up then we would look at it again.  However, I have not received any communication from anyone in this sector who feels there is not enough money.

Hotels are under massive pressure such as the Celtic Ross Hotel in Rosscarbery, West Lodge Hotel in Bantry, West Cork Hotel in Skibbereen, Eldon Hotel in Skibbereen, the Blue Haven Hotel and Actons Hotel in Kinsale, Fernhill House Hotel in Clonakilty and Schull Harbour Hotel.

It is a beautiful part of the world.  The tourism sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it.  Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector&rsquo;s survival and recovery.  I appreciate fully the impact in an area as dependent on tourism as beautiful west Cork.</p>  <p>  A tourism recovery task force was appointed last year to prepare a tourism recovery plan, which includes a set of recommendations on how best the domestic tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  That task force presented its plan for 2020 to 2023 to me in September last year and it has been an important input for myself and my colleagues in government in considering the measures to assist the tourism sector.  Together with horizontal measures implemented to support businesses across the economy, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the sector-specific supports I have introduced have been key in helping tourism businesses to survive and employees to remain engaged in the sector. </p>  <p>  The recovery oversight group I appointed last December is keeping me informed of progress on the implementation of the recovery plan and developments in the tourism sector more generally.  As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will also outline how it will help people return to work and further support sectors such as tourism.  We will consider more targeted measures to help with the reboot in that sector.  In line with our programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the Covid-19 crisis. </p>  <p>  The advent of the Covid-19 crisis meant that the work of the sustainable tourism working group was temporarily suspended but it was re-established early this year to complete its work in identifying the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented from 2021 to 2023.  Tourism has proven itself resilient before, and I am confident that with the key support of the Government it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.</p></speech>

It has been one of the sectors hardest hit during the pandemic.  Many businesses are making decisions about whether they can survive, and if they can, they are cutting back on services and operating hours.  We need a commitment for a minimum of five years to make these SMEs, restaurants, tourism attractions, pubs and shops feel that it is worth trading for the hours that will ensure visitors have things to see and do when the recovery happens.  A VAT rate of 9%, insurance reform, grants and more such measures are needed to stem the rising costs of doing business.  Otherwise, these SMEs will not be able to realise a living from what they do.</p>  <p>  We need a plan regarding when music venues, arenas, etc., will be allowed to open so we will have an offering that will continue to attract people and support jobs and spending in our local economies.  Many of these music venues, pubs and GAA, soccer and rugby matches are attractions in their own right and part of the fabric of Irish life.  Cork Airport is estimating that it will take four to five years for passenger numbers to recover.  Therefore, that length of time needs to be mirrored in targeted supports.  Hotels are negotiating rates with tour operators and businesses for 2023.  Can the Minister give us up-to-date information regarding what the Government has planned for the hospitality and tourism sector for the coming four to five years?</p></speech>

There is a &euro;55 million tourism business continuity scheme and phase 1 was announced on 1 February.  In Cork, we can look at some of the benefits in respect of the supports being put in place.  A wide variety of businesses in west Cork will be eligible to apply for assistance from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme.</p>  <p>  In response to Covid-19 as well, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in collaboration with local authorities, established a destination recovery task force.  In respect of strategic tourism locations across the country, it will bring together stakeholders to form a co-ordinated and sustained collective response.  Among those responses, I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the West Cork Calling tourism network, which oversees the implementation of two destination experience development plans that are being developed for west Cork for the long term.  Those visitor experience plans are the west Cork coast, including Kinsale and Ballydehob, and The Three Peninsulas - West Cork and Kerry, and it will be ensured that the plans are aligned and that tourism and hospitality providers across both geographies work together.</p></speech>

Hospitality will have nothing to entertain and attract guests off-season and people will be out of work again for the four to five autumn and winter months.  Employees in the sector must also be supported and incentivised to stay in this wonderful business.</p>  <p>  Currently, many of these employees are laid off and-or are on reduced hours.  They face prejudice when seeking loans or mortgages, even when in full employment.  They have had a tough time.  They are representing Ireland and supporting the economy in this important industry.  Yet, they are out of pocket and at a disadvantage.  Their skills are being lost to the industry, and when we are recovering we may not have the resources to deliver.  What plans are being put in place to protect the employees of the hospitality sector? </p>  <p>  I have only seven seconds left, but the Minister is most welcome to west Cork again this year.  Please God, she will again come down to see the beauty of the region.  Regarding the tourism task force, I am just disappointed that no one from west Cork was on it.  I am talking about one of the biggest and strongest tourism areas in Ireland, and perhaps in the world.  It was a major disappointment to us that did not happen.  </p></speech>

That is why we have invested money from the budget in this endeavour and that is why Government work is going on in this area.  The work being done in apprenticeships by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is evident.  Two such programmes launched recently in collaboration with the Irish Hotels Federation.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's concerns about approaching the winter season, that is why I am looking at more targeted approaches to support the industry during that off-peak season.  We are entering the peak season for the domestic industry now, but I am concerned about that shoulder season.  We should invite people to go to west Cork, like I did, in that shoulder season as well.  Therefore, we are continuing the supports and we are very aware of the retention of skills issue and that is why we are investing in upskilling, training and the digitalisation of the industry.</p></speech>

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.</p>  <p>  In terms of specific supports for the local print sector, it is of particular importance regarding media organisations to avoid any perception of undue Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue.  I am, however, cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.</p>  <p>  This is a sector which has been in decline over the last number of years and is undergoing fundamental changes due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising.  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion.  While the commission is not a representative body, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to be in a position to appoint a member of the commission who has a strong background in local print and radio.  In addition, at the commission&rsquo;s invitation, the representative group, Local Ireland, has participated in two panel discussions with commission members and the public as part of the commission&rsquo;s series of thematic dialogues.  The commission has therefore been extensively briefed on issues facing the local print sector.  I look forward to receiving the commission's report in the summer.  The print sector has participated in the commission&rsquo;s consultations and will be part of the recommendations.</p>  <p>  The sector has suffered losses from Covid-19 and is receiving Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  In the shorter term, the loss of advertising the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has been helped by the public health advertising placed by the Government.  I understand that in the region of &euro;4.4 million has been expended on regional print advertising form March 2020 to date.</p></speech>

It provides independent and quality journalism, but we are in danger of losing it.  The Minister spoke of the need to avoid the perception of interference by Government that would result if it were to fund the local print media.  That is an excuse; it is not a reason.  The Government helped to fund local radio, and rightly so.  Nobody is accusing the Government of trying to interfere, editorially or otherwise, as far as local radio is concerned.  The explanation given by the Minister is an excuse, not a reason.</p>  <p>  I am sure that it is not beyond the bounds of the Minister's Department to find an arms-length scheme or way of helping local newspapers to provide a sustainable future.</p></speech>

The current scheme in place to support radio is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence.  It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.</p>  <p>  There is no equivalent statutory framework for the print sector.  The BAI has no function in funding the print sector.  Given that the Future of Media Commission is due to report in the next few months, it is best to wait for its recommendations.</p>  <p>  My officials and I have had engagement with the sector and continue to do so.  From the examinations undertaken by my officials, the sector is availing of horizontal supports to business put in place by the Government.  As I have said, it has benefitted from public health advertising.  I am aware that there will be more campaigns that will help the print sector.  However, I want to look at what is appropriate for the long-term survival and development of the sector.  I will give serious consideration to the recommendations from the future of media commission.</p></speech>

I love cycling myself.</p>  <p>  For the last seven years, the Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success.  It has been a magnet in bringing tourists to our country - pre-Covid, of course.  Recently, we have seen beautiful signs being erected in County Clare and the west of Ireland, which read: "EuroVelo 1".  It is an 11,000 km long cycleway that goes all the way from Norway to Sagres in Portugal, taking in huge skelps of the west of Ireland, including County Clare.  I would love to know how the Minister and her Department propose to promote that beyond the signage to use as a tool to attract tourists into Ireland.</p></reply>

Fair play to him.  It is the future of sustainable travel.</p>  <p>  The Government travel advisory currently in operation against all non-essential international travel, in addition to other public health restrictions, means that unfortunately there is virtually no inbound tourism at present.  As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns.  Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by Government on international travel. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is, however, undertaking an extensive, largely virtual, programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right.  While we continue to face quite a bit of uncertainty, Tourism Ireland is actively planning for the restart of inbound tourism and in that regard, is developing a new business plan incorporating a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand.</p>  <p>  The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to do so.  The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return and will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value.  Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase, to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country.</p>  <p>  Over the next number of years, it is likely that we will see an increase in demand for outdoor leisure experiences based on nature, such as walking, cycling and mountaineering.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success to date and it will continue to be extensively promoted in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s future marketing campaigns. The EuroVelo 1 route overlaps with much of the Wild Atlantic Way and incorporates many of our most popular greenways.  It is therefore very much aligned with some our key tourism policy objectives, such as the promotion of more outdoor leisure experiences and increasing tourism to the regions.</p>  <p>  Both Tourism Ireland and I are very much open to leveraging the EuroVelo 1 route to promote cycling tourism in Ireland, should a suitable opportunity arise. </p></speech>

Speaking of music, the Minister will certainly have heard the song "It's a Long Way from Clare to Here".  It is fabulous for one to step up on the pedals of a bike in my home village of Meelick, knowing that going north, one will pass through Galway and Mayo and ultimately get to Norway if one keeps following the route, and travelling in a southerly direction, ultimately get to Sagres in Portugal.</p>  <p>  There are huge opportunities here.  I know that the Minister's Department recently invested &euro;70 million in a whole masterplan for developing Lough Derg and the whole mid-west tourism product, but there is so much tourism potential here.  As we look to recover tourism beyond Covid, including our hotels, guesthouses and outdoor attractions like the Cliffs of Moher, Bunratty Folk Park and Moher Hill Open Farm, we should really focus on these signs that say that we are part of an 11,000 km European cycleway.  There is colossal potential.  Not every tourist wants to get on a tour bus, fly in on a jet or travel on a train.  As we have seen in recent years, many of them get their saddlebags, go on a bike and tour the west of Ireland.  Therefore, a promotional package around this initiative could reap massive rewards not just for County Clare, but all of Ireland.</p></speech>

This work is nearing completion, with just one county left to finalise its route and erect relevant signs.  </p>  <p>  The EuroVelo 1 cycling route is part of a much wider linear route which, as the Deputy stated, starts in Norway and finishes in Donegal.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to work with Sport Ireland to ensure that the route is fully signposted and will promote it on the Discover Ireland website.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's programme teams will flag it as an element of the outdoor offering in the destination experience development plan areas and towns and villages through which it passes.</p></speech>

It passed through Dublin and into counties Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford and Cork.  It was a huge success.  The tour has a global audience each year of 1 billion people.  It would be an obvious extension of the EuroVelo 1 initiative.</p>  <p>  When I was Mayor of Clare, 18 months ago, I proposed the idea at a council meeting.  Like many council motions, we believed that it had been buried in the annals of the council, never to be seen again.</p> <p>We subsequently discovered it had gone to the Minister's Department and was being investigated as a viable headline tourism option for the coming years.</p> <p> I ask that the Minister take up the cudgels on this matter.  It is a fabulous opportunity.  We have lost out on European Championship football games in Dublin this year.  Some of these issues are beyond our control but we need to strategise beyond the Covid crisis.  We need to look at our natural assets in the west, build on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way and exploit all the wonderful possibilities of EuroVelo 1.  I urge the Minister to try to bring the Tour de France to this country in the coming years.  The natural route for it would be to follow the Wild Atlantic Way and incorporate EuroVelo 1.  As a Clare citizen, I look forward to welcoming the competitors along the beautiful roads of east and west Clare.</p></speech>

The proposed project consists of the development of a Shannon Pot discovery centre at the source of the River Shannon at Derrylahan, near Glangevlin.  This is right in the heart of the UNESCO-recognised Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark and in the Cavan Burren area.  This project, when delivered, would be a key tourism attraction for the upper Shannon region.

In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, it should be noted that F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences across Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments.  Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also ran an adaptation fund grants scheme aimed at assisting tourism businesses make physical adaptations to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.</p> <p> All capital investment in tourism is further supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland's current investment in complementary programme supports, including festivals and events, business supports and training, aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the regional tourism experience brands.  The overall objective is to support sustainable growth in the Irish tourism sector and drive higher revenue and job creation around Ireland.</p></speech>

Cavan County Council did excellent work in preparing this application.  Councillor John Paul Feeley has strongly advocated for the development of such facilities and I am glad to have supported his work on this project.  The overall cost of the project is &euro;6.6 million, with the council providing &euro;1.7 million of that cost.  This discovery interpretative centre will promote history and culture and, notably, the importance of the River Shannon, the country's longest river at 360 km.  Visitor displays, walking trails through the forest and a major viewing point will all dovetail very well with the amenities developed already as part of Cavan Burren Park.  The tourism master plan for the Shannon from 2020 to 2030 identifies this particular region as needing tourism infrastructure investment.  The source of the River Shannon, a river that is central to so much of our national tourism industry, needs this amenity.  I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to speak to the officials in F&aacute;ilte Ireland who are assessing the application about its merits and the need for such investment in this part of the hidden heartlands of Ireland.</p></speech>

To receive the funding, the successful applicant must pass all five stages of the overall assessment process, three steps in the application phase and two steps in the delivery and development phase.  Stages 1 and 2 have been completed and F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently evaluating the business case submitted under stage 3 of the five-stage process.  I expect the decision to be notified before the end of June.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided a wide range of supports to County Cavan.  The county is served by two regional brands, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands in the west of the county, where the Shannon rises and through which the Shannon river and the Shannon-Erne waterway flow, and Ireland's Ancient East in Cavan's historical east.  Tourism has always played a significant part in Cavan's economy.  It has a great selection of tourism assets, which I am familiar with having grown up in the nearby county of Monaghan, ranging from natural assets, including lakes, rivers, mountains and woodlands, to built heritage.  Tourism development in Cavan is critical for regional development, which, in turn, has a positive effect on employment, quality of life and the attractiveness of the area for inward investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800075#YYY00400"><p>I welcome the Minister's comments.  I fully agree with her in regard to the potential in both Cavan and Monaghan for further tourism development, increased economic activity and the creation of much-needed employment.  The Shannon master plan is very welcome.  Key to the successful implementation of this strategy is the development of new amenities and attractions.  The boardwalk trail on the Fermanagh side of the Cuilcagh mountain is a fabulous attraction.  To further realise the potential of the Cavan Burren Park area and the upper Shannon region, the discovery centre at the Shannon Pot is essential, both for domestic and international tourism.  The Shannon Pot is unique.  There is no other such location, so we must market and sell it in a very positive manner.</p>  <p>  Today, the Minister and I welcomed the announcement of further funding for the restoration of the Ulster Canal, a welcome, all-Ireland, cross-Border project.  Harkening back to the early 1990s, Fianna F&aacute;il was in government at the time and developed the Shannon-Erne waterway through the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  When we were initiating those projects we were told that it would not be possible to achieve them, but it was.  They now play a critical part in the tourism product, not just locally but also nationally.  I hope that during the Minister's term of office she will ensure that some of the areas that did not realise their potential in the past will have the opportunity to grow their tourism product and attract more visitors.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides a range of supports to ensure Cavan benefits as much as possible from tourism across the county.  It has identified the natural assets and distinctive experiences that Cavan could leverage.  The eastern side of Cavan is particularly rich in heritage and cultural experience, including Castle Saunderson and the Cavan County Museum.  The western part, due to its proximity to the Shannon, fits into the hidden heartlands.  The destination and experience development plans and the destination resilient plans are three- to five-year local tourism development plans which identify priorities for sustainable tourism destinations.  Of relevance to County Cavan, several such plans have been identified or are under way in the region.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800075#YYY00900"><p>The impact of  public health measures, both domestic and international, on live performance opportunities is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.  Due to its proximity and facilitated by the common travel area, the UK has always provided opportunities for Irish artists to expand their horizons and gain experience.  If the UK's planned reopening of the music and entertainment sector proceeds as intended at present, Culture Ireland hopes to resume its support to artists to travel abroad to present their work in other countries, subject to public health considerations in Ireland.  It is expected that this activity may commence later in 2021, subject to the Covid-19 emerging position and in adherence to quarantine and all other safety protocols.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Culture Ireland programming had a special focus on the UK in its GB18 initiative.  A key aim of the Culture Ireland GB18 year-long programme was to renew the unique cultural relationship which exists between Ireland and Great Britain.  Culture Ireland is keen to support the presentation of Irish arts in British institutions, venues and festivals and to expand the reach of Irish culture as soon as Covid-related restrictions allow.  We all aspire to a safe resumption of live performance, which is so fundamental to the arts, culture and entertainment sectors, when public health considerations permit it.  In the interim, my Department operates a range of sector-specific supports.  These include the &euro;25 million live performance support scheme.  Applications made under this scheme are currently being assessed.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the importance of the UK market to Irish artists and look forward to them being in a position to avail of opportunities in the UK when it is safe to do so.  The Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead plan committed to the development of sectoral guidance for very large purpose-built event facilities, for example, stadia, auditoria, conference or event centres.  I established the live entertainment working group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and to develop Covid-19 guidelines for the live entertainment sector.  These guidelines will be critical in preparing for the ultimate reopening of the sector.</p></speech>

This is a serious threat to the industry here.  It is not just an opportunity for artists to play in Britain, which is welcome, but there are many in the industry who may leave Irish shores to work abroad.  We will lose the income to the venues here when they reopen if the money is directed towards Britain.</p> <p>The commercial arts workers and businesses in England, and Britain in general, will have a significant advantage on us.  We have no roadmap or indication of when the music, entertainment and events industry will be allowed to return.  Part of this is due to the slow vaccine roll-out but also because of what appears to be a lack of serious planning.</p> <p> Has any work been done, in particular looking at events in Barcelona at the end of March where a concert was held for those who could prove they had a negative Covid-19 test?  Are we looking at that?  Are there plans afoot?  Can the Minister let us know, or at least, let the music industry know?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800076#ZZZ00200"><p>I understand there is actually much uncertainty about activity in the live entertainment sector in the UK.  The organisers of Glastonbury cancelled the 2020 event and have now cancelled for a second year.  Other festivals have also been cancelled, for instance, the Boomtown Fair music festival.  One of the key arts and culture summer events in the UK is the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  I understand that while it will proceed in August and will use bespoke temporary outdoor pavilions in easily accessibly places throughout the city, much of the festival will actually take place online.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's other query about skills, I understand it is an absolute fear that highly-skilled individuals will leave Ireland and relocate to the UK if the opportunities there are seen to be more attractive.  Recommendation No. 7 of Life Worth Living: The Report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce proposed the establishment of a capacity-building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers, aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003 and is the primary support for the arts in Ireland.  The Arts Council has experience and expertise in training in the sector.  Screen Skills Ireland is the training division of Screen Ireland and has significant experience and expertise in the provision of training.  The Arts Council and Screen Ireland collaboration will, therefore, take responsibility for the implementation of this recommendation, with the Arts Council taking the lead.  I have also established that live entertainment working group with the stakeholders.  Using their expertise, the guidelines available will be critical in preparing for that ultimate reopening of the sector.</p></speech>

Hopefully, it will be able to expedite some of the decisions that needed to be taken.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned some of the large concerts that have been cancelled and will not go ahead this year.  Obviously, they will not go ahead for a whole variety reasons because the lead-in time was not there.  However, in Liverpool, for instance, a crowd of 5,000 will attend a near-normal concert on 2 May.  The Minister will, therefore, see much more of that rolling out over the summer months whereas we have no indication at this stage when such concerts will happen or open here.</p>  <p>  I will talk to the Minister again about the opportunity we have to ensure the entertainment industry in Ireland benefits from the fact that due to Brexit, Britain will be at a loss because of the different tax regimes that will now be forced on it.  We have an opportunity to become the English language-speaking entertainment industry.  We can send people to Europe during the summer months to deliver this.</p>  <p>  Finally, as Britain will open earlier than us and there is an incentive for some workers to leave our shores, what additional supports will the Minister give to the arts and entertainment workers given that her proposed basic income is a long way off, despite being flagged last year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-04-28a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800076#ZZZ00400"><p>Although the UK may be ahead of us in vaccinations, we have responded with many supports.  Hopefully, it is not too long before we catch up with it in terms of reopening.  Rest assured, my officials and I are in engagement with the sector.  That is how I started as a Minister and it is how I will continue.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that the sector needs time to plan, rehearse and engage audiences in advance of reopening, the lead-in time about which the Deputy spoke.  I will continue to advocate for the sector to ensure it has the supports and pathways needed as we emerge from the crisis.</p>  <p>  The &euro;25 million live performance support scheme has built on the successful pilot of that scheme in 2020.  Much work also went into the allocation of &euro;14 million to be made available in the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to help those who had not received support up until now.  That is &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000, and &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.  I am also liaising with the T&aacute;naiste to look at anyone else in the events sector who needs support and who has not been reached to date.</p></speech>

It is very welcome.  I sincerely hope that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is assessing the application.  It can give particular consideration to places where there had been underinvestment in the past due to no fault of those areas.</p>  <p>  Where the Minister and I come from, however, we suffered because of the Troubles.  We suffer for historic reasons and we were slower getting development and tourism amenities put in place than other parts of the country.  Thankfully, we are catching up but we need additional investment to drive and create more tourist attractions and further develop our tourism product to create additional employment.</p></reply>

Under this overall programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland aims to invest up to &euro;150 million between 2019 and 2022 in developing major new visitor attractions of scale and greatly enhancing existing attractions.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s first call for applications under this programme in 2019 focused on heritage and cultural attractions, and invited proposals for large-scale projects of &euro;2.5 million upwards.  As I said earlier, I am informed that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently evaluating applications that made it through to stage 3 of the five-stage overall assessment process and that decisions are due by the end of May.  As we discussed earlier, the projects that have successfully passed stage 3 will then move into the development phase.   F&aacute;ilte Ireland cannot provide any indicative funding figures for Platforms for Growth 1 allocations until the evaluation process has been completed.</p>  <p>  The results of a second targeted call for local authorities to develop activity facility centres at waterside locations across Ireland were announced on 15 April 2021.  The &euro;19 million investment announced for this platform will be used to develop world-class facility centres at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction.  Each centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to Exchequer funding allocations, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's overall Exchequer capital allocation this year for tourism product development is &euro;32.8 million.  Allocations for subsequent years will be the subject of the annual Estimates discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the fact that we will have &euro;150 million in that particular programme over the next few short years.  Our tourism product is quite rightly sold on an all-Ireland basis.  We want to develop the tourism product on an all-Ireland basis with more cross-Border tourism products.</p>  <p>  As a member of Government in January 2009, I had the privilege to launch with Ms Arlene Foster, the then enterprise Minister for Northern Ireland, the first transnational geopark in the world, namely, the Marble Arch Caves geopark in Cavan-Fermanagh.  We need more projects that have international and national renown that can attract visitors from many countries overseas.  As a public representative in a neighbouring constituency, I wish Ms Foster well for the future.  We had the opportunity to work together on different projects over the years.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister again, when formulating policy, to ensure that the all-Ireland, cross-Border dimension is factored into all investment considerations and investment programmes.</p></speech>

Of course, Tourism Ireland helps with that too.</p>  <p>  With regard to other capital investment priorities and capital funding schemes that are under way, funding provided under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 is targeted at helping support and grow tourism in rural communities, in line with the further redevelopment and promotion of regional tourism experience brands thereby developing the regions and rural Ireland.  It is our natural asset as a tourist destination.</p> <p>Priority areas for tourism capital investment identified under the national development plan include the development and enhancement of tourism attractions, as well as of activity-based tourism, to provide the type and quality of experience visitors seek.  There is that pent-up demand.  When it is safe to do so, we will be ready to welcome visitors to our shores again.</p></speech>

The whole river master plan for the Shannon region clearly demonstrates the opportunities and potential to grow tourism in many counties.  I compliment Waterways Ireland, along with all the local authorities through which the River Shannon flows, for their co-operative nature in developing this strategy.</p>  <p>  We want to see it implemented now so we need investment.  The plan gives a strategic direction and identifies necessary tourism investment.  A central part of the strategy is the need to protect and enhance the environment.  One can protect and enhance the environment while having a positive impact on the economy and providing employment opportunities to many rural areas.</p></speech>

As we emerge from Covid, there is a huge opportunity to tap into that natural beauty we have, while protecting our environment and promoting joined-up thinking when it comes to tourism.  We must tap into local attractions, cycling and walking routes, as well as local food products.  That will be good for our regions and for having thriving rural communities with good employment.  It makes sense to have joined-up thinking.  Sustainability in tourism, as the Deputy said, is an example of that and is in that strategy.  That is what we are aiming for.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give us an update on this?  Has any progress actually been made in implementing these recommendations, particularly that of a universal basic income pilot?  As we heard today from other Deputies, the arts sector is really struggling and this would be an essential way of supporting it.</p></reply>

Meanwhile significant work is ongoing with recommendation No. 3, ensuring fair play for the makers of creative content; recommendation No. 7, building sectorial capacity through upskilling and professional development; recommendation No. 8, making space for arts and live entertainment to contribute to national recovery; and recommendation No. 10, addressing the environmental impact of arts, cultural and event activities.</p>  <p>  The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors.  The task force was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social and economic, local and national.  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons.  It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society.</p>  <p>  I have established an oversight group with the remit of addressing the recommendations of the Life Worth Living report, particularly those which are outstanding.  The group's membership is drawn from Departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations.  The oversight group is being chaired by my Department and includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members.  They will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association.</p>  <p>  I have asked the oversight group to prioritise the examination of recommendation No. 1, a basic income for artists.  This is pushing an open door with me.  I have engaged with relevant Ministers and colleagues on this matter who have indicated their support for developing this proposal.</p></reply>

Many areas have suffered in the wake of Covid-19 but, in recent weeks, most of the discussion has focused on restaurants and pubs.  The live music venue and the general arts sector which is struggling.  This proposed universal basic income is the best way to address the precarious nature of this sector.  While I welcome the development from the oversight group and the work done to date, a clear timeline or date for when this trial will begin would ease the uncertainty and insecurity that many in the arts industry are feeling.  Will the Minister provide us with that information?</p></speech>

Universal basic income is also core to Green Party policy.</p>  <p>  Work is being done on this matter.  It has gained the support of my colleagues in the Cabinet and the relevant Departments in the oversight group.  This work on a basic income for artists is independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the programme for Government commitment to pilot a universal basic income within the Government's lifetime.  I intend, therefore, to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority.  The sector is on its knees.  People in it have heard too much talk about valuing our arts and culture and they need to see that we do.  Our actions will show it.</p></speech>

As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns.  Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by the Government on international travel.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland, however, is actively working behind the scenes to keep Ireland front and centre in the minds of potential travellers.  At the appropriate time, it will launch an extensive global recovery kick-start programme.  In 2021, I have sustained the tourism marketing fund at previous levels to ensure Tourism Ireland has the resources to do all it can to protect our hard won market share.  It is undertaking an extensive, largely virtual programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right.  For example, the agency has just recently completed a successful virtual St. Patrick's Day programme which reached out to potential visitors right across the world.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is currently developing a new business plan to reflect the global economic changes brought about by Covid-19.  This plan will draw from the work of the tourism recovery task force which Deputy Griffin helped to establish.  This new business plan will incorporate a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand.</p>  <p>  The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to welcome tourists to our shores again.  The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return.  It will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value.  Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country.</p> <p>When the time is right to actively promote Ireland abroad as a travel destination, Tourism Ireland will then enter a market that will be extremely competitive but I am confident the agency is well-positioned to meet that challenge.</p></reply>

We must respond quickly to ensure employment return to pre-Covid levels.  We were supporting more than 260,000 people within the sector prior to the pandemic and generating revenue of in excess of &euro;9 billion to the Exchequer, with export revenue accounting for &euro;6.9 billion.</p>  <p>  I read earlier that Mediterranean countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal are marketing intensively to welcome UK citizens from June.  We need to be in a position to press the green button and ensure Tourism Ireland has adequate funding and a budget.  Can the Minister identify what target markets and campaigns Tourism Ireland is planning to ensure we return to pre-Covid levels of tourism?  I come from a constituency that has Knock Airport on its doorstep, which is vital for inward tourism from the UK and European market.</p></speech>
