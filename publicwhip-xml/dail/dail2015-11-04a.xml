I also briefed my Government colleagues on the report, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  It sets out the sequence of events leading up to the closure on 12 June based on the information then available.  It also sets out the relevant employment law and company law framework.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the liquidation of Clerys is in the hands of liquidators under the supervision of the High Court.  The High Court was informed at the hearing on 6 July that the liquidators had identified a number of matters which they intended to investigate as part of the liquidation process.  I understand the liquidators will report back to the High Court in due course.  The liquidators have important duties under company law, including an obligation to provide, within six months of their appointment, a report on the conduct of directors for the Director of Corporate Enforcement and a requirement to make an application to the High Court for the restriction of directors, unless the Director of Corporate Enforcement has relieved them of this requirement.  </p>  <p>  On the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in 2001, the existing functions of the Minister relating to the enforcement of the Companies Acts transferred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  These functions included the investigation of suspected offences under the Companies Acts and prosecuting detected breaches of the Acts.  Neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has any investigative function under the Acts.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Department of Social Protection that, with the exception of three pending payments, all former Clerys employees have received their full statutory pay-related entitlements.</p></speech>

Thankfully, the employers who have taken over Arnotts are committed to growing the business and employment in it, but five months on the same situation could have been unveiled at the weekend.  On ICTU's proposals regarding facilitating a consultation period before redundancies, for instance, there are issues such as this could be done to try to delay proceedings.</p><p>I understand the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, is separate, but does the Minister of State have a timeline for when its investigations will be completed?  Is the ODCE aware of the significance of this case in terms of the message it sends because it is not being dealt with while the office is looking into it?  The message it sends is that it is okay to treat workers like something on a peg in a shop that can be just thrown away overnight and that unscrupulous business people can get away with that behaviour, which is unfair to workers.  We know that the reality is different, but while Natrium has got away with it - five months on it looks as if it has - all of the agencies involved in investigating the matter should be aware of its urgency and the necessity of preventing it from recurring.  As regards the Minister of State's responsibilities, with legislation being brought forward, how does he respond to the various ICTU proposals revolving around a consultation period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400004#B00200"><p>The various proposals made by ICTU generally relate to company law and the conduct of directors.  I know that ICTU representatives have met my ministerial colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, in that regard.  It is worth making the point, however, that the report I published in a timely fashion after the closure of Clerys and the related events takes that issue very seriously.  It suggested, as I recommended, that the Department of Social Protection become a member of the committee of investigation, which essentially is a committee of the court and an important part of the liquidation process which is ongoing.  It is only when all of the facts and events leading up to the winding up of Clerys are fully known, with any legal challenge that could potentially be initiated in that respect, that an informed decision can be made on whether any amendment to company law is required.  As the Deputy knows, company law is continuously kept under review domestically and in the European context, as well as through the work of the company law review group.  The group's current work programme includes items on winding up, receivership and examination.</p>  <p>  We are all troubled by and distressed at the way in which the Clerys workers were treated.  There is an ongoing liquidation process, at the conclusion of which the Government and I hope any subsequent Government will not be found wanting in providing important protections for workers given what happened at Clerys and in the context of the lessons learned from it.  We are all very concerned about the situation at Clerys.</p></speech>

Section 224 of the Companies Act states directors must have regard to the interests of employees and that this is among the fiduciary duties of company directors.  Surely there is scope within that section to ensure what happened will not recur.  I am conscious that there is an investigation taking place, but the liquidator has one month left in which to provide a report for the ODCE.  Has the Minister of State asked the ODCE to put him on notice when the report is received?  If so, as soon as it is received from the liquidator, his departmental officials will have sight of it to take action, if necessary.</p></speech>

I expect that, given my interest in the issue and that of the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, the ODCE will keep us informed.  There is a huge amount of public interest in this issue.  Decisions will have to be taken by the Government and Departments on the next steps to be taken.  It would be remiss of me, however, to make any statement on the matter before the process has been concluded.  The Clerys liquidation process is in the hands of the liquidators under the supervision of the High Court.  We will assess the position when that process has been concluded.</p></speech>

Not only does it bring about 40,000 people to Dublin city, but it also offers start-ups an opportunity to network with tech leaders and venture capitalists who are looking to invest money.  The Taoiseach has said the 2014 Web Summit was worth &euro;104 million to Dublin city.  It is, therefore, a flagship event.  Its loss not only represents a loss of revenue to the capital but is also a huge blow to Irish start-ups and the country's reputation.  Why did the Minister drop the ball and ignore this opportunity?</p></reply>

Last week we welcomed over 800 attendees from 43 countries to the Med in Ireland event and the Innovation Showcase 2015 will be taking place on 8 December following a successful launch last year.  In January a major conference on financial services will be hosted in Dublin, organised by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris.</p>  <p>  My ministerial colleagues and I, with the agencies of my Department, also participate in many third party events that take place in Ireland, similar to the Web Summit, and we will continue to provide assistance and for attendance, where appropriate.  Between 2011 and 2014 my Department's agencies provided &euro;880,000 in support for the Web Summit.</p>  <p>  The Start-up Gathering is a recent example of the potential to host and grow events in Ireland, with close to 400 gatherings in 22 counties.  This week also sees the first ever National Digital Week taking place in Skibbereen, with over 3,000 attendees and 60 speakers from both the private and public sector.</p>  <p>  Annually, Ireland is the location of choice for many international conferences and events in a wide range of sectors.  Our offering as a location is marketed through the brand &ldquo;Meet in Ireland&rdquo; which is supported by a dedicated team in F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, disappointing that the organisers of the Web Summit have decided to move the event, but it is a commercial decision.  The Government has been supportive throughout as the company, an Irish start-up, grew from an event that initially only welcomed 400 people to the success it is today.  A commercial decision has been taken to move it to another location.  Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have had remarkable success in developing start-ups and emerging companies and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

He mentioned it in three sentences in a very generalised fashion.  The release of emails between the Government and Mr. Paddy Cosgrave gives a rare insight into how the Government operates.  Mr. Cosgrave has repeatedly said all he wants to do is keep the Web Summit in Ireland.  That was his objective.  All that it was necessary to do was to ensure proper traffic management and public transport plans were in place.  People who had spent money to get to Dublin could not even get to the conference centre owing to the fact that there was total gridlock.  Mr. Cosgrave also wanted to make sure the hotel industry was not gouging, at a rate of 600%, in order that people could afford to come.  These were simple issues with which to deal, but none of them seems to have been addressed by the Government.</p><p>As regards the process in which Mr. Cosgrave was involved with the Government, the emails show a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude, a lack of engagement and dysfunction at the heart of government in dealing with this issue.  I simply ask the Minister to answer these questions.  Was he aware of the breakdown in communications?  Was he aware of the role of the enterprise agencies involved?  If so, what steps did he take to fix it?</p></speech>

Dublin is now recognised as an excellent start-up environment, which has been part of the reason for the successful attraction of the Web Summit.  There is such a vibrant environment here for start-ups which has been created by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Both agencies have used the Web Summit to identify leads and organise itineraries.  This happens all the time.  However, when a decision is made to take such a conference to another location, it does not in any way, as the start-up commissioner for Dublin has indicated, diminish the capacity of the city to support strong start-ups.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will continue their record levels of performance in the past couple of years.  Both bodies have dealt adequately and perfectly with this matter.</p></speech>

I asked him if he was aware of the breakdown in communications and the problems arising.</p><p>The Minister has not even attempted to say he is aware of it.  If we cannot understand and critique the problems, how are we supposed to fix them?</p> <p> On "Morning Ireland" yesterday, Paddy Cosgrave went even further.  He mentioned the &euro;800,000 received in terms of hush money.  Essentially, he said the Web Summit was supposed to lavish praise on the Government for what it did but for four years behind the scenes, he went back and forth to try to push the Government time and again to realise the opportunity and make sure things were fixed.  Shockingly, he said Ministers were only interested in attending on an invite basis and only to have photographs taken.  He also said that Enterprise Ireland had not engaged properly in the process.  He said it invested money, created logos and created spin but had not used the event properly.  What physical steps will the Minister take to reach out and fix this problem?  We may have lost the 2016 Web Summit but what steps will he take to ensure the 2017 Web Summit is in Dublin?  I ask him to answer the question directly.</p></speech>

I am sure there will be successors to the Web Summit in Dublin because Dublin has such a vibrant environment.  Just as we supported it in the past, we will support such an initiative again.</p>  <p>  I completely reject the suggestion that Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have not used the Web Summit effectively.  Only last week I was in the USA on a trade mission and the IDA took the opportunity to organise itineraries around a number of people who planned to visit the Web Summit.  We do not work in a blaze of publicity; rather, we work confidentially with companies to develop programmes.  The Deputy should look at the figures.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have used their resources to achieve record job creation in Ireland over the past four years.  They have never been performing at a higher level than they are now.</p></speech>

The mandate given to the EU Commission, which is the negotiator for the EU side, is a broad-ranging one, covering virtually all sectors of economic interest, not just tariffs but also non-tariff barriers, as well as opportunities for global standards setting.</p>  <p>  One of the objectives in the EU&ndash;US trade agreement is greater regulatory coherence to ease red tape for firms.  This will not be at the expense of consumers or standards.  There will be no dilution of labour or of environmental standards, no change in governing access of GM products to Ireland, no dilution of the right to regulate and no interference in public service provision.  The mandate recognises that each side can continue to organise public services and regulate in the public interest in sensitive areas such as hormone treated meat and genetically modified organisms.  This has been reinforced by a joint declaration from EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m and the US Trade Representative Mike Froman. </p>  <p>  There have been 11 rounds of negotiations to date, the 11th round taking place in Miami from 19 to 23 October 2015.  In concrete terms, the EU and the US have made substantial progress on all three pillars of the proposed agreement, namely, market access for EU and US companies, regulatory co-operation and trade rules.  Both sides remain positive and expect further substantial progress by early next year.  On 8 July, the European Parliament voted for a resolution supporting the EU-US trade agreement, including such a reformed investment protection mechanism.  </p>  <p>  At the Council of Trade Ministers scheduled for 27 November in Brussels, I will have the opportunity to discuss the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a new investment court system.  I will also discuss progress on these negotiations with Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m and with EU Council colleagues.</p></speech>

Let us consider the question of the environment.  In January, we had a concrete promise from the EU to safeguard green laws, defend international standards and protect the EU's right to set high levels of environmental protection.</p>  <p>  However, we have the millennium negotiations, a leaked text that has not been released because the negotiations are not taking place in the open.  The leaked text from the EU shows the commitment is purely rhetorical.  It contains vaguely phrased, non-binding commitments to environmental safeguards.  It is clear that in reality, the right of corporations to profit will take precedence over the right of Ireland, European states or America to regulate in terms of environmental interest.  That is reflected in the kind of cases we have seen under NAFTA in the ISDS agreement, where, for example, Lone Pine Resources sued Canada for $250 million due to a moratorium on fracking introduced in Qu&eacute;bec.  The same could happen here if TTIP is signed off on.</p></speech>

The right to profit will not take precedence over the right to regulate, something both negotiators have recognised plainly.  They have set that out not only in a joint statement, but in the mandate under which the EU is negotiating.  It has been stitched into many of the documents to ensure it is respected through the procedure.</p>  <p>  Government retains the right to regulate.  There are great opportunities for trade.  Ireland is three times more involved in trade with the USA than any other member state.  The potential gain for Ireland is very significant.  There could be a potential boost of &euro;2 billion to GDP if there is a successful reduction in trade barriers.  It will be particularly beneficial for small companies as it has been shown that trade barriers are the greatest obstacle for small companies which wish to trade in US.</p>  <p>  There are also opportunities for very innovative Irish companies to bring technologies into the US public procurement area.  There are significant opportunities for Ireland.  Of course, any deal would have to be voted on at the end but this is a balanced negotiation, which is going well.</p></speech>

The big winners will be large corporations and the losers will be small businesses, consumers, working people and the environment.  </p>  <p>  In the draft text the definition of "expropriation" is being expanded dramatically.  We know have terms like "measures tantamount to expropriation", "indirect expropriation" and "regulatory expropriation".  That means that any interference with the right of corporations profit is seen as expropriation.  </p>  <p>  Under ISDA, of which the Irish Government is one of the biggest champions in the whole of the European Union - the Minister signed a letter to that effect to the Trade Commissioner - corporations can sue in private arbitration tribunals.  They choose the arbitrators and are able to win large amounts of money in compensation or, more likely in reality, freeze the ability of countries to regulate in the interests of their people or the environment.  The examples go on and on in terms of ISDS.  They already exist under NAFTA and will exist under CETA and TTIP.</p></speech>

The truth is that these negotiations and this arbitration will not be in private with arbitrators chosen by companies.  The Commission has developed an approach to dispute settlement whereby it can only be invoked where there is targeted discrimination on manifestly unfair grounds.  Adjudicators must be approved by Governments from among persons qualified to be judges.  The procedures must be transparent.  There must be an independent appeal process and it must respect and protect the right of governments to regulate.  Deputy Murphy is simply inaccurate and, I suspect, is not reading the documents because they might interfere with the conclusions he reached years ago on any trade negotiations.</p></speech>

By the time the previous Government left office after the economic crash hit, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness had been seriously damaged, more than 300,000 jobs had been lost in the private sector and unemployment had reached a high of 15.1%.</p>  <p>  Since entering office, the Government has helped our rankings improve and 126,000 people are back at work.  While competitiveness is improving, there is no room for complacency.  The Government continues to undertake a range of significant structural reforms to restore and improve national competitiveness.  We have made work pay better, improved access to finance for business, streamlined regulatory processes and reduced the administrative burdens on business.  We have also implemented changes to make the tax system more competitive in supporting entrepreneurship and innovation, improved skill availability in key areas and vigorously opened up new export markets. </p>  <p>  Our domestic cost base has improved, making Irish firms more competitive internationally.  The exporting sectors of the economy, particularly companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, are winning new markets and creating jobs at record levels. </p>  <p>  Since its introduction, the Action Plan for Jobs has recognised the fundamental link between competitiveness and job creation and has been the key mechanism for driving competitiveness in all areas of economic activity.  All of the action plans to date have provided a sharp focus on specific aspects of the competitiveness agenda, particularly in the areas of costs, improving Ireland's global competitiveness ranking and making it easier to start, run and scale a business.</p>  <p>  Our improving competitiveness performance is manifest in increased employment, with the latest figures showing another decrease in unemployment to 9.3% from a crisis peak of more than 15%.  These show the progress being made.  I have strengthened the National Competitiveness Council which reports regularly to the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs.  This facilitates timely attention to areas of opportunity for improvement.</p>  <p>  The immediate challenge is to sustain the recovery under way by remaining competitive.  There is a continuing and urgent necessity to enhance the regulatory environment for start-ups and small and medium enterprises to enable them to trade successfully in increasingly competitive global markets.  Further actions and reforms driven by the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 which is being prepared will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world's most competitive countries and achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.</p></speech>

During the Minister's period in office we have fallen behind Estonia and Macedonia in the global rankings.  The Minister referred to Ireland's competitiveness strength.  I will cite some facts as opposed to offering fictional spin.  New business interest rates for non-financial corporations are up to 81% higher in Ireland than in the rest of the euro area and our electricity and energy costs are significantly higher than the average in the euro area.  Any improvement in Ireland's competitiveness is the result of reductions in labour costs which have nothing to do with Government policies because they are being shouldered by workers.  </p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about strengthening the National Competitiveness Council, yet the Government ignored the council's recommendations as well as its statement that Ireland's environment for entrepreneurship was poor in international terms.  The Minister constantly refers to the necessity to support start-up businesses, yet Ireland has fallen six places in the rankings for ease of starting a business.  If Ireland is to be the best country in the world in which to do business in 2016, as the Taoiseach declared in one of his rambling statements, we are a long way from achieving that objective and without specific responses, we will not move closer to achieving it.</p></speech>

It has been an annual process whereby changes have been developed across government and subsequently implemented with a strict timetable overseen from the Office of the Taoiseach.  The focus of the actions is to achieve key targets, principally getting 100,000 people back at work and improving the business environment for growing strong enterprises.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has focused on three main areas, namely, programmes that have made it easier for enterprises to establish and grow jobs, sectors that can be successfully developed and measures that allow Irish business to compete more successfully.  This has been a successful policy approach.  The jobs target has been exceeded, with 126,000 additional people at work.  These jobs are in sectors which have solid and sustainable foundations with good prospects and working conditions.  Competitiveness has also improved significantly.</p>  <p>  In terms of implementation, there has been a quarterly monitoring and reporting system and publication of quarterly progress reports.  Since the action plan was first launched, the average quarterly completion rate has been more than 90%.  </p>  <p>  One of the strengths of the process has been the open consultation on policy areas where improvements can be made and the involvement of industry partners in the implementation of some of the initiatives.  This has allowed continuous learning and development. </p>  <p>  The OECD has commended the policy approach and made useful suggestions which have been incorporated.  In 2015 we have deepened the process by developing regional action plans which can drive the same collaboration at regional level.</p>  <p>  My intention is to publish the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 in mid-January next.  My Department is developing the 2016 action plan and engaging bilaterally with enterprises and Departments to identify actions to ensure the plan is as ambitious and impactful as possible and will keep us on track to achieve our goal of having 2.1 million people in employment by 2018.</p></speech>

The approach of the Fine Gael Party, to which the Labour Party has unfortunately acquiesced, is based on the idea that the State cannot create jobs but can only create the environment in which big business can create them.  To achieve this end, businesses must be incentivised.  This approach lies at the heart of the Action Plan for Jobs and its extent is demonstrated in the case study on page 72 of the 2015 action plan.  It refers to a company which receives free labour through JobBridge for nine months and subsequently hires the same intern through JobsPlus, for which it receives an additional &euro;10,000 from the State.  From the employer's point of view, the pretence of training usually associated with the schemes is dropped and she freely admits that JobBridge and JobsPlus are now the "backbone" of her "growing business".  At the heart of the action plan is a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to employers.  More than 80,000 people are on activation schemes, many of whom are being grossly exploited.  A review of JobBridge has been alluded to.  What is the status of this review?  Is the Government open to abolishing the scheme?</p></speech>

The truth is the jobs being created are quality jobs.  In the past two years all of the jobs have been full time.  There has been a reduction in part-time work, in particular involuntary part-time work has dropped by 23%.  Unemployed people have been major beneficiaries of this progress and the number of people on the live register has decreased by 111,000 over the past three years.  The number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 60%.  With regard to the prevalence of schemes, 9,500 extra people are on schemes overall, but 92% of all employment growth has nothing whatever to do with schemes.  These jobs are in quality sectors such as manufacturing, ICT, financial services, business services and engineering, and they are all supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  They are in good sectors with a sustainable future.  We also see a recovery in employment in construction, another sector with good pay rates and good conditions.  The Deputy seeks to distort reality just to fit his own view of the world.</p></speech>

In my constituency a number of places in a vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, which is a further education scheme, were cut and instead we have extensive use of the Gateway scheme whereby hundreds of peoples have been working for &euro;1 for 20 hours a week for almost two years.  They are involved in protests against the scheme, which they describe as soul destroying.  The morale of the group is very down.  People treat it like a prison sentence at this stage because they simply do work which is meaningless and they do not feel valued for it.  This is what faces ordinary people, but for corporations, between Starbucks, Apple, Google and the other, the Action Plan for Jobs and the general approach of the Government means not paying any tax.  The Government was forced to drop the double Irish a year ago, but one year later we have the knowledge development box, which is another tax loophole aimed at corporations.  The Government's job creation agenda is to give the corporations all of these incentives and free money and then ensure they do not pay any tax.</p></speech>

The good news, which the Deputy refuses to acknowledge, is that of the 126,000 extra people at work 92% of them are in initiatives not supported by the State in any way.  They are in strong sustainable sectors.  They provide good conditions and they are growing strongly.  They are in sectors we have targeted, such as manufacturing, engineering, ICT and financial services.  These are all sectors with long-term prospects.  They are also in very important traditional sectors such as food and tourism.  We are getting a broad-based recovery; the Deputy does not want to recognise this, but it is the reality.  We see our streets are busy with traffic and restaurants and bars are fuller.  There is a recovery and we need to build on it.  This is what we are intent on doing.</p></speech>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that yesterday afternoon, following a decision by Government yesterday morning, I published the study by the University of Limerick, UL, on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts in the Irish economy.  This week, I will launch a public consultation process to give all interested parties an opportunity to consider and respond to the conclusions drawn in the report and the recommendations made by the UL.  I understand that the UL conducted stakeholder interviews with 30 bodies as part of the study, including 13 employer and business organisations, eight trade unions, four NGOs and five Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out this is an independent study, and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made are those of the UL.  Therefore, it is essential that the various stakeholders who contributed to the study and, indeed, other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to engage with the UL, are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the findings and recommendations in the report.  This will allow me and the Government colleagues to be more fully informed before formulating our own views on the policy recommendations that I should bring to the Government arising from the study.</p>  <p>  I urge all parties with an interest in the area to consider carefully the findings and recommendations published yesterday, and I would welcome submissions in response to the study, including submissions from seasonal workers and their representatives, to whom the Deputy referred in his question.</p></reply>

I am glad to hear the report has been published and consultation is commencing.  I raised the issue of seasonal workers in particular because they are largely unrepresented by any of the trade unions or NGOs and it will be difficult to get their views because of this.  Most of the sectors in which they are involved are not organised through trade unions.  Is there a way these workers can be targeted to get their views on this, perhaps through an outreach meeting in an area where seasonal work is predominant or the only work available?  Will the Minister of State and the Department consider this as part of the consultation process?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy has had an opportunity to look at the report at some level over the past 24 hours.  It is balanced and the UL's recommendations are independently provided and will be considered by the Government.  The UL was conscious of taking a balanced approach to its findings and recommendations, to ensure those working non-guaranteed hours and those doing seasonal work are protected and receive the full panoply of employment protections and also ensure a degree of flexibility in the labour market so enterprises can be run efficiently and effectively.  The study is also conscious of the very clear view that no interventions should be made in a legislative or regulatory fashion which would very rigidly prevent people from taking up seasonal work.</p></speech>

One of the traits of seasonal work in Donegal, particularly in the fishing industry, is that although workers do not have zero-hour contracts they could be called into work at 9 o'clock in the morning and be sent home again at 10 o'clock and that is it for the day.  This means they cannot avail of social welfare protection.  This needs to be addressed.  If seasonal workers are taken on they should be guaranteed a certain minimum number of hours that day to allow them to be able to sustain themselves in employment.  I hope this will be taken on board in the consultation process.</p></speech>

The report states there is not extensive use of zero-hour contracts in Ireland.  It is prevented by the provisions of the Working Time Act 1997, but it is important that our labour market policies, employment protection legislation and the regulatory environment keep up with evolving practices in industry.  The UL identified the prevalence of what might be termed "if and when" contracts, where there is potentially no mutuality of obligation between an employer and an employee.  This may very well be the case in the instance provided by Deputy Pringle.  We need to be conscious of this in the proposals we make.  We also need to be conscious of the role played by the Department of Social Protection through family income supplement and access to jobseeker's payments for people working in an atypical fashion with non-guaranteed hours.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland has also been in contact with the company on a continuous basis regarding the assistance it could provide for restructuring to minimise job losses.  The workplace relations services of my Department have also been actively engaged in this process.</p>  <p>  Labour Court hearings between the company and the unions concerned took place on 9 October 2015.  The Labour Court recommendation for the production personnel represented by Unite and SIPTU is to continue the negotiation process with management on headcount reduction, shift pattern changes, outsourcing and a two year pay deal over a four week period beginning on 29 October 2015.  The management expect the unions will ballot their members in the coming weeks to determine support for the proposed changes.</p>  <p>  The Labour Court recommendation for the electricians represented by TEEU and the fitters represented by the TEEU and Unite is for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to mediate between management and unions for a four week period beginning on 28 October 2015.  Both parties have engaged with the mediation process in the WRC.</p>  <p>  Immediately after the announcement by Mondelez, I established, as the Deputy has acknowledged, an inter-agency group to co-ordinate the response to the proposed job losses.  The group, chaired by Enterprise Ireland, is seeking to secure alternative employment for Coolock, Tallaght and Rathmore and to ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for retraining, access to social welfare supports, access to advice on employment rights and access to advice and support for those workers who intend to start their own businesses.</p>  <p>  I understand that the site in Tallaght will cease production in April 2016 with the severance and exit packages agreed.  The company has engaged Penna O'Shea, the career transition provider, to assist the workforce in planning their future.  Enterprise Ireland has visited the Tallaght site and will share the plant specification and worker profile with its clients.  The plant specification and worker profile has also been shared with IDA Ireland.  The inter-agency group has obtained agreement from SOLAS eCollege to offer any existing courses free of charge to all learners in Mondelez, Tallaght.</p>  <p>  I have already directed Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to step up their efforts to find alternative projects for the areas affected.  I continue to monitor the situation very closely and I have arranged to meet the company representatives shortly.</p></speech>

I note detailed counterproposals were put forward six or seven months ago by the SIPTU, Unite and TEEU trade unions and by members of the workforce themselves who are obviously expert in this element of food production and it was feared some of the key brands, for example, the Twirl and the Snack, would be outsourced to Poland.  The Minister stated we are in a critical period in these negotiations and referred to the role of the commission, etc.  Is the position that the Minister will be able to save those jobs?</p>  <p>  What response has he received?  The ultimate mother group of this company, 3G Capital, which has a Brazilian principal in Rio de Janeiro and which has assembled this considerable food combine and has a bad track record in taking over companies, devastating their workforces, taking out value and leaving them.  Has the Minister made contact with 3G Capital?  There was word of a &euro;11.7 million investment programme for Coolock and Rathmore.  Has any of that been seen?</p>  <p>  As the Minister will be aware, this is against a background where there are still more than 8,000 unemployed attending the two employment offices in Kilbarrack and Coolock in the constituency the Minister and I represent.  As the Minister will be aware, there is still considerable anxiety and worry in the broader Coolock area that we could have further job losses here.</p></speech>

Its intention is to achieve state-of-the-art production lines in Coolock.  There were counterproposals and Enterprise Ireland supported the workers in furnishing those counterproposals.  The position is they have entered into the detailed negotiations that I outlined in terms of the restructuring proposals the company is seeking and those are ongoing with both the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission playing a role to seek to find solutions.  As I indicated, Enterprise Ireland will also support the company.  It has programmes, such as lean manufacturing programmes, which can allow a company successfully achieve the competitiveness it needs.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this is a situation where the company has indicated that restructuring is needed to be competitive in its markets and we are seeking to work with that and minimise the job losses.  I share the Deputy's concern that we need to minimise the job losses but I would point out that Dublin has been enjoying a recovery.  While there are some companies experiencing difficulties with which we deal, and it is a fight every day, there are also companies which are growing strongly.  We work to achieve such growth as well.</p></speech>

On overall job figures, the Government mentions 126,000 jobs created, which is way below the total level of employment in late 2007 or early 2008.  The Government is still a long way off that mark.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister hopeful, from the initiatives taken by the inter-agency group, that these jobs can be protected, which is the key desire of our constituents and their families?  What other assistance can the Minister give to ensure that the promised investment in the plants will happen as soon as possible and that we could look forward to a positive future?</p>  <p>  Has the Department done anything in relation to the protection of iconic Irish brands, given the kind of attack on branded products in recent times and the difficulty of maintaining clear brands in the food area?  All Irish food products are under this kind of threat from the German multiples and other companies.</p></speech>

Job losses in the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies are at the lowest level in a decade and we are succeeding in managing companies.  </p>  <p>  In this case, as the Deputy will be aware, the company has indicated that there will be job losses but we are working to ensure there will be as few as possible and that the remaining jobs will be placed on a secure footing with the necessary investment and the efficiencies of modern production lines that can give them a secure future.  That is what we are working to achieve.  As I indicated, there are continuing negotiations with that aim in mind.</p></speech>

The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprise that have taken place in recent years.  The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2016 last month have further strengthened the attractiveness of Ireland as a place for innovation, entrepreneurship and investment, delivering sustainable job creation and growth.  A competitive and innovative enterprise base is at the core of Ireland's future economic development and Government policies for enterprise and innovation set the framework for continued investment and growth.</p>  <p>  Ireland is the first country in the world to introduce an OECD-compliant knowledge development box, KDB, offering certainty to global and Irish-owned enterprises.  The OECD approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from intellectual property assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a knowledge development box initiative.  Ireland's KDB rate is 6.25% - half of the corporation tax rate - and is internationally competitive.  It is important to note that there have been no changes to the headline corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</p>  <p>  The knowledge box, as outlined by the Minister for Finance, will support and encourage both foreign and Irish-owned enterprise to undertake research and development here, to protect the intellectual property that arises and to benefit from the measure.</p><p>The Finance Bill also allows for the introduction of a provision pertaining to companies with income arising from intellectual property of less than &euro;7,500,000, which will be introduced during 2016, when the necessary legislation to give it effect is enacted, and will be of direct benefit to companies of a relatively lower scale, with global income of less than &euro;50 million.</p></speech>

There is no doubt we are seeing the emergence of what Germany would call Mittelstand companies - strong, globally competitive companies, many of them in engineering, food or agri-tech.  These companies are showing great resilience and capacity to grow.  We have a balanced growth among the Irish companies, which are very strong in software and technology, but also strong in traditional sectors like food, agri-tech and engineering.  I believe we have good prospects and we have a strong flow of entrepreneurship from Irish companies, which is encouraging for the future.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that as digitisation, or whatever we want to call it, transforms virtually every sector, there is an increasing focus on a narrow range of skills.  We need to up our capability across a whole range of skills.  I am very encouraged by the new apprenticeship programme, where 86 employer partnerships applied to create new apprenticeships in areas where we have never had them before.  That is an encouraging sign that business is willing to invest, in partnership with the State, to grow the skills base in new areas.  That is the biggest issue.  As they describe it, the war for talent is very strong among companies.</p></speech>

The execution is reported to be imminent and all appeals to the King have been ignored.  It is reported by the family that the boy is being tortured while he awaits his death.  His execution, if it is carried out in the next few days, will be the 136th since January.  I wonder if the Minister is still of the opinion that trade missions are not the place to raise human rights issues effectively, no matter what horrors are taking place in the country we are doing business with.</p></reply>

Trade missions are to deal with trade but there are many avenues where the Irish Government takes a very strong line in regard to human rights issues.  The situation is that we bring companies with us on trade missions which then seek to open up opportunities to trade.  In the past four years, such measures and missions have opened up a net 40,000 extra people at work in exporting companies.  A key focus is to grow in markets which offer opportunities, and these include areas like the Gulf region.  It is clear we have to work on that and get companies to establish business-to-business links, encourage investment and encourage companies to form a base and grow in these markets that have growth prospects.  Some 90% of the growth in trade is going to be outside of the European Union, so we are going to have to trade in Asia, the Gulf and in many countries, and Ireland has an interest in growing that.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts, especially through the European Union and the United Nations.  We have never shied away from addressing these issues.  We will continue to be a strong advocate for higher global standards that improve human rights and encourage the highest standards of business conduct and corporate social responsibility.</p>  <p>  During the last trade mission I led to the Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia, in April of this year, Irish companies from a wide range of sectors concluded deals and created jobs in Ireland.  They prospected with potential buyers and developed relationships with key sectors, including aviation, water technologies, financial technologies, support to various programmes and so on.  These are important opportunities we need to develop.</p>  <p>  Ireland is an active member of the EU human rights group in Riyadh which co-ordinates EU policy on human rights issues and progresses implementation of the EU&rsquo;s human rights country strategy for Saudi Arabia.</p></reply>

Each year, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation grants billions of euros worth of export licences for dual use goods that are sent by Irish-based firms to some of the most destabilised and war-torn regions on earth.  Does the Minister know what role Irish firms may have played in the wide-scale massacre of Yemeni citizens by Saudi Arabia in the last number of months, backed by the US?  It beggars belief that we can just totally ignore what is going on in Saudi Arabia.  Has the Irish Government objected to the massacre of civilians in Yemen?  Does it have any impact whatever on our trade dealing?  It does not look like it.</p>  <p>  The Minister said he cares.  We were able to back the EU on its trade sanctions with Russia but, here, we cannot do enough business with the Saudi Arabians.  According to international sources, they are actually beheading more people than ISIS.  Would the Minister sell stuff to ISIS if it wanted to buy something off him?  I am sure he would not, but he is prepared to sell stuff to Saudi Arabia and do business with it.  I do not understand that.  There is no consistency.</p></speech>

Overall, the trade is about &euro;1.5 billion into Saudi Arabia from Ireland, which is probably supporting 1,000 jobs in Ireland.  It is a significant market for many of the companies we were just talking about, which are growing in, for example, the agri-engineering sector, and have technologies that are relevant.</p>  <p>  In terms of dual use goods, the licensing in my Department is very carefully monitored and involves discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in areas where there might be particular issues of concern.  If the Deputy has concerns about individual licensing arrangements, he should certainly bring them to the attention of the Department.  That is very closely monitored and we are very careful to ensure there is no abuse of the obligations in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to be responsible for losing jobs in Ireland.  However, the Swedes were selling Saudi Arabia &euro;1 billion worth of armoury per year.  When the Saudis started bombing Yemen, they cancelled that and they are no longer selling to them out of respect for what is happening to Yemeni citizens.  We are not taking a position.  Aside from that, if the Saudis find that countries like Ireland will trade away with them, whether in food, milk or dual parts, it means they have a licence to do as they please.  Nobody is giving them as much as a smack on the back of the hand.</p><p> In November last year we gave permission for two overflights for planes travelling from Dover, Delaware to Saudi Arabia.  We found out under a freedom of information request that those planes were carrying class 1 explosives, rockets, liquid fuel and rockets with bursting charges, possibly for the making of cluster bombs which are regarded as illegal.  For all we know, because we do not search the planes, there are cluster bombs coming through Shannon.  We do not know what is on the military planes coming through Shannon, because we are not allowed ask what is on them because there is supposed to be nothing on them.</p> <p> How can Ireland continue with this position?  How can we say we have a human rights position when we will not even search planes passing through Shannon to check whether they are taking cluster bombs to places like Saudi Arabia?</p></speech>

The products Ireland sells are products such as soft drink concentrates, medical and pharmaceutical products, infant foods, general industrial machinery and equipment, dairy products, medical devices, stents, pacemakers, digital media and so on.  Those are the markets Irish business is selling into in Saudi Arabia and they are important markets for these companies.</p>  <p>  Clearly, there are problems in many of the countries we deal with and the regimes can be criticised.  However, we must do that through channels that can influence the human rights performance of those countries, and that is what we do.  The EU human rights group in Riyadh co-ordinates the European Union's approach and Ireland is actively involved in that.  We have significant trade to Saudi Arabia and those companies have valuable markets.  My job is to support companies in their export diversification and these are all products that are perfectly acceptable and tradeable.</p></speech>

The goal of the Government has been to replace all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis and deliver sustainable full employment by the end of 2018.  This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness and support job creation in Dublin and in every region.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in Dublin.  Since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched, some  50,000 additional people are back at work in Dublin.  This compares with job losses of 90,000 in the period 2008&ndash;11.  The trend in employment in enterprises supported by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland has been similar.  Such enterprises created a net 20,000 jobs in the period 2011&ndash;14 compared to 10,000 job losses in the earlier period.  In the past year, net employment growth in Dublin was 15,400.  There was expansion in all categories of enterprise supported by my Department.  This included 3,700 in IDA supported enterprises, 2,350 in EI supported enterprises and 793 in local enterprise office, LEO, supported enterprises.</p>  <p>  While good progress is being made, the Government is not complacent about the challenge of achieving sustainable full employment over the medium term in all regions, including Dublin.  As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, we launched the process for developing action plans for every region.  The work on the preparation of the Dublin action plan for jobs is currently under way and will set ambitious targets for the region over the coming years to realise the potential of sustainable full employment and improved standards of living for the people of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Deputy Flanagan also raised the issue of the employment experience of graduates, but I do not think the CSO gathers data on the net change.  However, in terms of the areas in which we have visibility, such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, a significant share of graduates are obtaining opportunities in those companies.  There is a high skill content to most of the growth in those sectors, so there are good opportunities for graduates, particularly those in the technology, engineering, mathematics field.  There is strong performance in both pharma and ICT sectors.</p></speech>

We have lost many of them to the United Kingdom and other countries.  What emphasis is being placed on ensuring that people who have spent so many years studying here get opportunities?  We hear from many graduates that they have no option but to emigrate because of the lack of opportunity.  I understand that as the economy picks up, more opportunities will arise, particularly for graduates.  Emigration figures show that one out of every six people born in Ireland lives abroad.  Many of these are abroad by choice, but there are some people who want to return, but they do not see the opportunities to do so.  The Minister's narrative is that he is trying to create opportunities in order to get emigrants, particularly some of those who have emigrated in recent years, to return to Ireland to contribute here.  Is he doing anything specific in that regard?</p></speech>

There is strong growth in ICT, financial services, bio-pharma and other sectors.  The food sector is doing extraordinarily well and the Kerry Group recently filled 900 posts in its research centre.  There are thriving and strong areas and opportunities and there are signs there is the beginning of a return flow of emigrants to Ireland.  Net emigration is down to one third of what it was at its peak, so we are making headway.</p>  <p>  In respect of nurses and doctors, these positions are not in my direct area.  However, the Minister for Health has stated there are 3,000 additional people at work in our hospitals compared to a year ago.  Therefore, there are opportunities opening for doctors and nurses in the health system.  As we continue to see jobs recovery in the wider economy, this will allow us fund improved services in health areas that offer opportunities in those fields.</p></speech>

In regard to doctors and nurses, they do not get the opportunities here to become specialists in different areas and not enough sweeteners are provided to persuade nurses who have emigrated to return.  Many well trained people have emigrated over the past years.  The message I want from the Minister today is one that will give hope to graduates that opportunities will improve.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Durkan, the issue in some areas is a skill shortage, particularly in the technology area.  There is a need and desire to see people with qualifications return.  In regard to conditions in the health area, that is a matter the Deputy will have to take up with other Ministers.  It is heartening to see growth in the numbers employed in the health system and this opens opportunities for people in the sector.</p></speech>

Budget 2016 is a carefully designed, responsible, interlocking budget where different pieces come together to form an overall picture, a picture of a country moving in the right direction, with living standards being gradually raised in every home.</p><p>The social welfare package included in the budget has similarly been carefully designed to ensure a number of core groups will benefit and, as I said, to provide for a decent society and improvements in the social welfare structure.  It has been designed to include pensioners, families with children, including lone parents, carers and people with disabilities.  It has also been designed to get people back to work because, although we now have a 9.3% unemployment rate and the rate has fallen again this month, there are still more people out of work than we would like.  The Labour Party and I, as T&aacute;naiste, want to move to a full employment society, with work for everyone who needs and wants a job.  </p> <p> I know that some of the Deputies on the Opposition benches will, for opposition's sake, vote against the Bill.  Let me tell them why, on the basis of the clearest evidence, they should support it instead if they truly want to see the development of a strong economy and a decent society and if they want to assist the most vulnerable in society.</p> <p> My Department has carried out a social impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures in budget 2016.  This assessment is based on the tax-welfare micro-simulation model, SWITCH, developed by the ESRI.  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely effects of key policies on household incomes, families, poverty and incentives to take up employment.  The assessment has found that average household incomes will increase by 1.6% or &euro;14.30 per week as a result of budget 2016.  Importantly, there are higher than average gains for the bottom two quintiles, that is, the lowest income households in society, while the smallest gain is in the top quintile.  The biggest beneficiaries are lone parents and dual and non-earning couples with children, with an average gain of 2%.  As I said, the budget is focused particularly on families with children, whether parenting with mum and dad or the mother is parenting on her own.  Non-earning lone parents and couples with children with a single earner fare above average, gaining around 1.8%.</p> <p> I should emphasise that child benefit expenditure, although universal, favours lower income households.  Therefore, budget 2016 will deliver considerably bigger gains for the poorest households.  If any Member of the House votes against the Bill, it will be because he or she is placing politics before poorer households.</p> <p> Coming to specific measures, throughout the worst of the crisis we protected the State pension.  I am particularly pleased to provide for an above inflation increase of &euro;3 a week for pensioners and carers aged 66 years and over.  There is also an increase of &euro;2 a week for adult dependants aged under 66 years and an increase of &euro;2.70 for adult dependants aged 66 years or over.  These will benefit 583,000 pensioners and over 93,000 qualified adults who live with pensioners.  It is the first weekly rate increase for pensioners since 2009.  From talking to pensioners I know that there is a very significant welcome for the fact that, for the first time since 2009, we are able to increase rates.  While I would love it if I had &euro;5 or &euro;10 a week to distribute to every pensioner, the budget has been crafted in order that, from an economic point of view and in terms of getting people in businesses back to work, we have a balance which will assist the different groups in society, particularly those who are less well off and vulnerable.</p> <p> I will also be making regulations in the coming weeks for the payment of a 75% Christmas bonus which will benefit older people, carers, people with disabilities, long-term jobseekers and lone parents at what is often a financially stressful time of year.  For a single person on disability allowance, this will mean a bonus payment of &euro;141.  For a pensioner couple, both of whom are in receipt of the non-contributory State pension, it will mean a bonus payment of &euro;327.50 or over &euro;6 a week to the household.  That same household will receive an extra &euro;3 on 1 January for anybody in receipt of a contributory pension or &euro;2.70 for other adults who do not have a pension in their own right.  This is a considerable boost to the household income of pensioners.</p> <p> Some 1.23 million people will receive the Christmas bonus in the first week of December and I make absolutely no apologies for paying it.  As T&aacute;naiste and Labour Party leader, my focus is on trying to ensure we can improve things for every person, not just a few.  Pensioners asked me on numerous occasions to maintain the core pension rate and we did.  They asked us to maintain the free travel scheme and we did.  They asked us particularly, as circumstances improved, to restore the Christmas bonus.  We have been able to do this, restoring 25% of the payment last year and 75% this year.  Pensioners built up the country and supported their children and grandchildren when things were very difficult.  The Christmas bonus is also paid to anyone with a disability, on long-term social welfare payments, the long-term unemployed and anybody parenting on his or her own.</p> <p> When the Government entered office, there were grave fears that the numbers unemployed would exceed 500,000 and the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund was heading towards &euro;2 billion.  The rate of unemployment would eventually peak at 15.1%.  As of this week, it stands at 9.3% and is continuing to fall rapidly, thanks to the sustained focus of the Government on returning the economy to growth and helping people to get back to work.  As a result of returning to work in high volumes and more employers being able to reward employees with pay increases, the Social Insurance Fund has been transformed.  The 2016 budget provides for an increase in Social Insurance Fund income to almost &euro;8.9 billion in 2016, with expenditure estimated at &euro;8.67 billion.  This means that there will be a projected surplus of &euro;216 million in the fund, the first such surplus since 2007.  This means that if we can continue to increase the surplus, those who have contributed to their pensions can be confident that they will receive their pensions and that we will be able to improve them as we go along.</p> <p> The increase in the national minimum wage to &euro;9.15 an hour from 1 January is hugely important for low-paid workers.  I pledged earlier this year that if we increased the minimum wage, we would address any PRSI step effect arising from such an increase.  We are doing so in this Bill.  Put simply, the measures will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees and ensure the benefits of an increase in the minimum wage will be felt by all those in receipt of it.</p><p>This is, of course, in addition to the gains from the USC changes announced on budget day.</p> <p> This Bill provides for a &euro;5 increase in the rate of child benefit - the second budget in a row in which child benefit has been increased.  This will bring the monthly rate of child benefit from &euro;135 to &euro;140 per child with effect from 1 January 2016.  Child benefit is a crucial support to families through difficult times, in particular to low and middle-income families.  The increase will benefit 623,000 families and almost 1.2 million children.  The introduction of a paternity benefit scheme will take effect next September, as was announced in the budget.  The family income supplement income threshold is also being increased by &euro;5 for each of the first two children per week from next January.  This will mean an additional &euro;3 or &euro;6 per week for over 59,000 low-income working families - benefiting over 131,000 children.  I will shortly make regulations to provide for an increase in the earnings disregard for the jobseeker's transition payment from &euro;60 to &euro;90 per week.  This improved disregard will apply to existing and new recipients from next January.  All earnings above &euro;90 will be assessed at 50% from January.  They are currently assessed at 60%.  Funding for the school meals programme will increase by &euro;3 million next year to &euro;42 million.  The school meals programme currently benefits 217,000 children in over 1,700 schools and other organisations.  The allocation of an additional &euro;3 million in 2016 will provide for breakfasts for an additional 27,800 pupils or a lunch or light meal for almost 12,000 additional pupils.</p> <p> The strong economic recovery that we can see around us is, above all, a jobs-led recovery and this is crucial because secure and fairly paid work remains the best protection against poverty.  The budget is, therefore, a pro-work budget.  The budget announced increases of &euro;2.50 per week in the top-up payments for jobseekers availing of community employment, the rural social scheme, Gateway, Job Initiative and other such schemes.  Earlier this year, I introduced a new incentive called the back to work family dividend which helps jobseekers with families to return to work.  This dividend provides an incentive of &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount in the second year.  Over 9,500 families and 15,000 children benefit from the dividend.  These are families with children going back to work.  This measure, when taken together with the employer incentives such as JobsPlus, will ensure that long-term jobseekers also benefit from the strong recovery in the labour market.</p> <p> Apart from the rate increases I have already mentioned, the fuel allowance is being increased by &euro;2.50 per week to &euro;22.50 for the duration of the fuel season.  This is another targeted measure and will benefit almost 381,000 households.  The name of the respite care grant scheme is being changed to the carer's support grant.  In light of the hugely important role carers play in our society, I am particularly pleased to announce that the rate of the grant is to be increased by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700 from 1 June 2016.  It will be payable to around 86,000 carers next year.  In another improvement, carer's allowance will now be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for instead of the current duration of six weeks.  I thank the carers' organisations which made that proposal to me in the course of our pre-budget discussions.  </p> <p> I want to use this opportunity to refer to the rent supplement scheme.  My Department is currently providing support to approximately 63,800 people living in private rented accommodation.  The cost of the scheme in 2015 will be over &euro;298 million.  Between rent supplement, the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme, the State is currently accommodating almost 100,000 households via the private rented market.  Given the size of the State's involvement in the private rented sector, any general increase to rent supplement would serve only to increase rents overall.  That would particularly affect low-income households which are renting, including students and low-paid workers.  Instead, my Department is operating a framework which ensures that families or individuals at risk of losing their rented accommodation can get urgent assistance from the community welfare service.  Department officials will on a case-by-case basis increase the rent supplement limits to ensure people stay in their homes.  To date, more than 4,400 households have had their rent supplement increased.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance will in the coming days finalise a housing package which will address both the crucial issues of supply and providing greater certainty for tenants.</p> <p> I am very concerned about reports in recent days of mistreatment of workers on some, and hopefully few, Irish fishing trawlers.  Following a decision at Cabinet yesterday, the Government is immediately setting up an inter-departmental task force to examine the complex issues arising.  The aim is to formulate a co-ordinated and effective cross-Government approach.  My Department's special investigation unit, which in particular tackles fraud, will actively participate and assist in any multi-agency approach that emerges or is required in the context of Government-interdepartmental decisions or proposed joint initiatives in this sector.  We do not want to see any workers taken from tens of thousands of miles away, put on board small fishing vessels and, if one is to judge by the story, having their passports taken and their ability to go on land restricted in some cases.  This is an absolute disgrace in light of the traditions and history of this country.  The Government and I are determined to see an end to this.  </p> <p> I will now turn to the specific measures in the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title of the Bill, its construction and collective citation with the Social Welfare Acts.  Section 2 provides for the definition of certain common terms used in Part 2.  Section 3 provides for an increase in the rate of contributory State pension.  It also provides in respect of persons who are 66 years or older for increases in the rates of the following schemes: widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension; death benefit; and disablement pension.  It also provides for increases in rates for qualified adults.  Section 4 and Schedule 1 provide for an increase in the personal and qualified adult rates of the non-contributory State pension.  It also provides for an increase in the rate of carer's allowance for recipients who are 66 years or older.  This will be particularly important for people on a half-rate carer's allowance who are looking after their spouse or partner in addition to whatever State pensions they may be entitled to.  Section 5 and Schedule 2 provide for the renaming of the respite care grant, which will now be the carer's support grant.  Section 6 provides for an increase of &euro;325 to the carer's support grant from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700.  Section 7 provides for an increase in the monthly rate of child benefit from &euro;135 to &euro;140.</p><p> Section 8 provides for an increase of &euro;5 per week in the family income supplement, FIS, earnings threshold for families with one child and &euro;10 per week in the thresholds for families with two or more children.  This measure comes into operation on 7 January 2016.  Section 9 provides for the period in which carer's allowance is payable following the death of the person being cared for, to be extended to a period of 12 weeks.</p> <p> Section 10 provides for two changes in pay-related social insurance, PRSI: a new tapered PRSI credit is being introduced for employees insured at class A whose earnings are between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 per week.  The upper threshold at which the lower 7.8% class A rate of employer PRSI applies is being increased from &euro;356 to &euro;376 per week.  These measures take effect from 1 January 2016.</p> <p> I wish to advise the House that I also intend to introduce amendments on Committee Stage on a number of matters.  Earlier this year we saw the historic result of the marriage equality referendum.  The subsequent legislation, the Marriage Act 2015, was enacted on 29 October.  On Committee Stage I will be bringing forward amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 in light of the enactment of that Act.</p> <p> I will also be bringing forward amendments to provide for the inclusion of registered nurses within the definition of medical assessor in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  These nurses will be employees of the Department.  Other amendments will cover the inclusion of credit unions providing personal micro-credit loans among the specified bodies for the purposes of the household budgeting scheme, and the correction in the Bill, as published, of the figure for the FIS earnings threshold for a family of seven children.  I also intend to bring forward an amendment of the Pensions Act 1990 to enable the Financial Services Ombudsman to carry out the role, duties and functions of the Pensions Ombudsman in light of the intended merging of those two offices.</p> <p> Over the recent very difficult and challenging years, our social welfare system has continued to play an essential role safeguarding the most vulnerable people in our society.  Having protected that very strong system through the worst of times, we are now strengthening it further in better times.  The social protection measures contained in this Bill and in budget 2016 are built on the foundations of the recovery.  The clear objectives of these measures are to secure improvements in living standards and to create greater opportunities for every person, every family and every community. </p> <p> We have a significant social welfare package this year, including the measure concerning the Christmas bonus, improvements in a range of payments, benefitting in particular pensioners and retired people, people on disability allowance, carers, families with children and families at work, who have children and are on low incomes.  That is made possible by all the taxpayers, workers and employers in the country who pay PRSI.  The fact that so many more businesses and individual workers are getting back to work has been the mechanism that has enabled us to provide for the improvements and changes we have made in the Bill.  I have a duty to those people to ensure that every cent of their PRSI contributions is used to improve the status of the Social Insurance Fund, which was almost wrecked when I came into office and heading for a deficit of &euro;2 billion.  This will for the first time be back in surplus next year so that pensioners and contributors can have confidence in the availability of the retirement pension in this country.  I must also make sure that all social protection and welfare money goes to those for whom it is intended, that they get the payments they are entitled to and that the special investigations unit, inspectors and departmental staff will do their best to ensure that nobody can defraud the social welfare system or take money that rightly should go to people such as pensioners. </p> <p> I thank all the staff in the Department who faced very difficult times during the crisis but have transformed the Department from the payments Department of old to one that provides a good quality public employment service, working with employers to get people back to work.  It is important people recognise that the public servants in this country, working in the Department of Social Protection have made a very special contribution to individual lives and to the recovery of the country in general. </p></speech>

She is challenging us, saying how dare we vote against this Social Welfare Bill 2015 and how dare we oppose the huge largesse she is distributing to the poorest and neediest in society.  The Minister&rsquo;s approach seems to be the one adopted by the famous playwright, No&euml;l Coward, who once said, &ldquo;I can take any amount of criticism so long as it is unqualified praise&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The more I listen to the Minister the more I am driven to conclude that she has very little empathy with, and less understanding of, the poorest and neediest people in this country.  After all, we know from advance excerpts from a book about to be published that she objected strenuously to taking on the responsibilities of the Department of Social Protection.  She was, we are told, consumed with anger when she was offered this lowly post.  She wanted to be strutting her stuff on the world stage.  According to the book, she promised Deputy Gilmore that he would regret the day he put her into the Department of Social Protection.  That is one promise she kept.</p></speech>

The Minister&rsquo;s speech seems to consist largely of praising herself for giving back a part of what she has already taken from those people.  I do oppose this Bill but I support the improvements, the &euro;3 per week, the increase in the fuel allowance, the restoration of the respite care grant, the increase in child benefit, etc.  I oppose it because it is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s fifth regressive budget in a row.</p>  <p>  If anybody doubts that I take myself as an example.  I am here, courtesy of the people of Limerick city, in a very well-paid job, earning &euro;87,500 a year, &euro;1,700 per week gross.  I did a small calculation and the budget benefits me to the tune of over &euro;900 per annum.  I have a very good friend who is in receipt of social protection payments.  He lost his job when a business closed down in Limerick about two and a half years ago.  He has had some part-time employment since.  He has had various periods of unemployment and is now unemployed.  He is a single man in receipt of &euro;188 per week, paying rent to Limerick City and County Council.  He gains, according to my calculations, &euro;95 per annum, approximately a tenth of what I gain as a highly paid Deputy.  The only word I can conjure to describe that is "regressive".</p><p>Prior to the budget, there was a huge income differential between that gentleman and me.  Now it has increased to the tune of approximately &euro;800 per annum and I understand that, as a result of the Lansdowne Road agreement which will kick in from 1 January, I will gain another &euro;1,000 with the result that the differential between that gentleman and me will be &euro;1,800.  An unemployed couple will gain &euro;157 per year, whereas a couple with two incomes, with a gross income of &euro;125,000, will gain over nine times as much, or exactly &euro;1,408 per annum.<br/><br/>The Minister referred to the benefits for the lower quintiles of the population.  Last year, the last period for which official figures are available, the top 10% of households were in receipt of 24% of all disposable income, whereas the bottom quintile, the bottom 10%, received 3% of all disposable income, exactly one eighth of that of the top 10%.  The gap has widened as a result of the budget and this Social Welfare Bill and I am only talking about income.  If one takes into account the fact that access to, and control of, capital is exclusively within the preserve of the upper echelons of society, the gap between rich and poor has become dangerously wide.<br/><br/>When he refers to the social welfare provisions included in the budget, the Minister for Finance usually treats us to some poetry, but he did not quote any this year, no doubt worried that we would be reminded of what he said last year when, inspired by Robert Frost, he promised to travel the road less travelled.  There has obviously been a change in attitude and now he is travelling the road marked, &quot;How to win a general election&quot;.  I will fill the deficit by quoting a famous Irish poet, Oliver Goldsmith:</p><blockquote>Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,<br /><br />Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</blockquote><p>The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, referred extensively to what she gave in the budget.  Yes, there was an increase of &euro;2.50 per week in the fuel allowance, but the allowance is now paid for only 26 weeks.  According to what I learned in arithmetic class, &euro;2.50 multiplied by 26 comes to &euro;65.  The Minister has reduced the period for which the fuel allowance is paid from 32 weeks to 26 and &euro;6 multiplied by 20 is &euro;120.  Having taken away &euro;120, she has given back &euro;65 and praises herself for it.  <br/><br/>I support the increase in child benefit, but I also recall the election posters during the last general election promising faithfully that the Labour Party would not reduce child benefit.  In fact, it did reduce it, the reductions causing a great deal of misery and hardship, made directly contrary to promises it had made and which it had advertised from one end of the country to the other.  The increase in child benefit, allied to that granted last year, will bring us almost but not quite back to where we were when the Government took office.<br/><br/>Several years ago, when the respite care grant was reduced, we warned the Minister of the consequences, of the hardship and misery it would cause, but she proceeded anyway.  Now, in the shadow of a general election, she has decided to restore it.  I would like her to clarify one point.  The name has been changed to the carer's support grant.  As I understand it, people who are not in receipt of carer's allowance can still qualify for the respite care grant if they do not, for some reason, qualify for carer's allowance.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400014#M00300"><p>I support an increase in the Christmas bonus, but a huge section of the population is shackled to poverty which is all year round, not just at Christmas.  </p>  <p>  The Minister devoted a good part of her contribution to the elderly.  This is the first pension increase since 2009-10, but the rate of inflation since the last increase has been running at 4.5%.  In normal circumstances that would represent an erosion of 4.5% in the purchasing power of what the people concerned are getting, but the position is somewhat worse than this.  The inflation basket includes a range of items which the elderly would not purchase and the inflation figure for the primary purchases made by the elderly, of whom 70% rely exclusively on the old age pension, would be closer to 6% or 7%.  The pension rate in 2010 would be worth some &euro;10 or &euro;11 less in purchasing power in 2015 and 2016.  That would be bad enough in itself, but we must add to it the fact that the telephone rental allowance has been taken from the elderly, the household benefits package which was enjoyed almost exclusively by the elderly has been slashed, the method of calculation for contributory old age pension has been dramatically changed to the detriment of pensioners, there have been cuts to rent supplement and reductions in the higher rates of disability allowance and invalidity pension for the over-65s.  There has been a severe restriction of tax relief on medical insurance contributions, which disproportionately affects the elderly, while the threshold for the drugs payment scheme has been increased from &euro;120 to &euro;144 per month or by approximately &euro;5.50 per week, almost double the increase in pensions for the over-65s.  Housing adaptation and mobility grant aid for the elderly and the disabled has been reduced quite considerably.  There have also been changes in eligibility for medical cards for the over-70s and the loss of the bereavement grant, as well as many more cuts.</p>  <p>  On top of all this must be added a raft of new taxes, charges and impositions.  For example, the elderly are now subject to water tax, with no account being taken of an inability to pay water charges, and they are also subject to property tax, again with no account being taken of ability to pay.  Those who try to provide for themselves are subject to a pension levy which has taken &euro;2.5 billion out of their savings, while hundreds of thousands of home help hours have been slashed.  Contributions to the fair deal scheme have been increased by 50%; carbon tax has been increased, while the waiver for refuse collections has been abolished.  The VAT rate applicable to most of the elderly and pensioners which was 21% has been increased to 23%.  An increase of &euro;3 per week is supposed to compensate the elderly for these three things.  The Minister said she had been talking to a number of pensioners who had been showering her with praise for her performance, but I have been talking to a different group who have something very different to say.</p>  <p>  I agree with the beginning of a process to bring about tax equalisation between the self-employed and PAYE workers, but I deplore the fact that the Minister has steadfastly refused for the past five years to provide a safety net for those who set up on their own.  We are told it is impossible to introduce a system of social insurance under which the self-employed can apply for jobseeker's benefit if they lose their job.  We are told it is impossible to provide social insurance if they get sick and lose their livelihood due to illness, despite the fact that we are almost unique in not having such a system.  Other countries have such a system, including Germany, Sweden, Austria, France and even smaller ones such as Lithuania and Romania, but we cannot and this is supposed to be a country which encourages entrepreneurship.</p><p>I have no problem with the &euro;550 tax credit that is being given to the self-employed.  However, is it not somewhat perverse that &euro;550 could be given to be somebody who might be running a very successful business and earning millions in profits and yet we cannot devise a system to allow people, if they wish, to contribute to a social insurance system which gives them a safety net if they lose their business for one reason or another particularly due to illness?</p> <p> The Social Welfare Bill is significant not for what is in it, but for what is not in it.  We calculate that there have been 40 social welfare cuts during the regime of this Government.  Two of them have been fully restored and another has been half restored - so two and a half down, 37 and a half to go.  For example, there has been no reversal of the cut to the school clothing and footwear allowance, which represents an imposition on the most vulnerable because one almost has to pass a starvation test to qualify for that allowance.  It has been slashed to the tune of approximately &euro;40 million and yet there has been no reversal of that.</p> <p> There has been no reversal of the increase in disallowance of illness benefit from the first three days to the first six days of illness.  I have come across many cases where employers do not pay this which effectively means that somebody who cannot work due to illness must now fend for themselves for six days instead of three.  There has been no reversal of the cut in invalidity pensions for the over-65s or the cut in disability allowance for the over-65s.  There has been no reversal of the cut in maternity benefit, which is costing expectant mothers on average &euro;3,500 a year.  There has been no change to the adverse changes in the farm assist scheme.  There has been no reversal of the increases in minimum rent contributions for rent allowance purposes.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the discretion that welfare officers have.  According to figures recently released to me, there have been in excess of 600 applications for that discretion in Limerick city alone and only two have been successful.</p> <p> There has been no reversal of the increase in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme.  There has been no reversal of the restrictions in eligibility for the State pension scheme.  Jobseeker's benefit for part-time workers was changed to the disadvantage of those workers and there has been no reversal of that.  There has been no reversal of the reduction in the employer redundancy rebate.  There has been no reversal of the household benefits package changes.  There has been no reversal of the changes from nine months to six months for jobseeker's benefit.  There has been no change in the reduction of the provision for exceptional needs payments.  There has been no change in the abolition of the &euro;300 cost of education allowance.  There have been 40 cuts and two and a half reversals.</p> <p> The net result of these five regressive budgets is something very interesting to behold.  According to the Department of Finance, we are likely to enjoy growth of approximately 4.5% to 5% this year with a projected growth next year of 5% - although Professor Honohan might disagree.  Nevertheless and despite the burgeoning corporation tax receipts we heard about only today, over 390,000 people are living in consistent poverty, which is double the 2008 figure.</p> <p> Some 1.4 million, or nearly one in three of the population, are experiencing some form of deprivation.  Some 700,000 people are at risk of poverty, of whom 211,000 are children.  More than one in every six children and one in every ten people over the age of 65 are at risk of poverty.  We still have social welfare rates that are about &euro;20 per week below the poverty line.  Food poverty is rampant and the Government has totally reneged on its solemn commitment deliberately given to measure the impact of each budget in advance to ensure it is poverty proofed - and no wonder.</p> <p> Not today but on other occasions, the T&aacute;naiste has often adverted to the importance of social transfers in combatting poverty and taking people out of poverty.  The Government has taken in excess of &euro;1.8 billion out of the social welfare budget and given back about &euro;500 million.  That is a net reduction of about &euro;1.4 billion.  If she says that social transfers help to combat poverty, is the corollary not true that a reduction in social transfers tends to increase poverty?</p> <p> On several occasions the T&aacute;naiste has claimed to have made a difference in moving the entire social welfare system from what she likes to call a passive system to an active system.  I wonder.  Society is changing.  We all agree that people's skills can become obsolete and they need to be retrained for new opportunities that present themselves.  There was an activation scheme that predated the T&aacute;naiste's arrival at the Department of Social Protection.  I am not saying it was perfect; in fact, it was imperfect in many ways.  However, the main focus should have been on improving that activation system.  The money the Government is now spending on so-called activation would be better spent on improving and making that scheme more appropriate.</p> <p> As I understand it, the T&aacute;naiste has moved the system from one of activation to one of compulsion such that if somebody is offered a training or education course, regardless of how inappropriate to their circumstances or how useless it might prove to them in the future, they have to take it or suffer the consequences in terms of loss of social protection.  The same applies if somebody is offered a job, regardless of how insecure or how low-paying and regardless of the conditions.  I have come across people who were on social welfare and were offered jobs 50 km or 60 km away from their homes.  Taking into account the expense of travelling to and from work, they would finish up worse off.  Nevertheless they are compelled to take it up.  That is the system now.</p> <p> Of course, it is all based on a false assumption that the unemployed are lazy idle scroungers who must be forced to take up work.  Of course, for the Irish people nothing could be further from the truth.  All the evidence has shown that the overwhelming majority of Irish people would prefer a job to being unemployed.  The net result of the changes introduced by the Government has been to develop a harsh, unsympathetic and authoritarian social welfare system that forces people to take training courses or accept work on lower wages or with worse conditions.  The only people benefiting from that are employers.</p> <p> Now an array of supervision, assessment and intervention faces anyone who is unfortunate enough to become unemployed.  Only 100 people faced sanctions in 2011, rising to 5,300 in 2014 and the upward trend continues even though the numbers of unemployed are falling.  This is only a small percentage of claimants and yet the threat is continually experienced by thousands of individuals with a gradual heightening intensity.</p> <p> Beyond those directly affected by the sanctions, everybody is subject to a social welfare system that is now infinitely more precarious.  The safety net we can expect if we lose our jobs has been transformed for the worse.  The tragic irony is that there is no evidence that those types of sanctions, including cutting welfare as a means to change behaviour, actually work and numerous studies dispel the notion.  A harsh social welfare system does not create jobs apart from those of the officers employed to investigate people.  The vast amount of money spent on this would be better spent on matching people to suitable vacancies or suitable training.</p> <p> The current system is almost a throwback to the English Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which required people to take whatever was offered, regardless of how low-paying, demeaning or degrading, or else face the indignity of the workhouse.</p><p>That system was based on the contemporary economic theory that there is no such thing as unemployment and that if one leaves people with no alternative they will take any job regardless of how insecure, lowly paid or how much it disadvantages them even monetarily.

We are almost back to the era of the workhouse, given that one must either take what is offered even if it means one is disadvantaged by it or else face sanctions.  It is a throwback to the 1834 Poor Law (Amendment) Act.  The last people I would expect to introduce a reverse into such a system is the Labour Party in government.</p><p>Any government in a democracy, regardless of its ideology, should be concerned about a widening of inequality.  As I demonstrated, poverty is widely spread and very deep in this country, in particular among certain sections of the population.  The English politician Joseph Chamberlain, who was a radical in his time but was far from being a Marxist, said on taking office, &quot;My aim in life is to make life pleasanter for this great majority; I do not care if it becomes in the process less pleasant for the well-to-do minority&quot;.  If that had been the policy of the Government, in particular the Labour section of the Government, for the past five years, this would be a fairer, better and more just society.</p><p>The Minister for Social Protection has consistently claimed that during her tenure, in her term of office of almost five years, she has made a difference.  I agree with that.  She certainly has made a difference.  She has insulted the young, in particular young jobseekers, she has penurised the elderly, ignored the claims of carers , widows and the disabled, for whom nothing was done in the budget.  She has introduced a social welfare system which would be the envy of the old Russian KGB.  She has contrived to totally ignore the looming pension crisis for which she has departmental responsibility.  She has contributed significantly to a system where the gap between rich and poor has widened inexorably in the past five years.</p><p>When I spoke on the equivalent Bill last year I left the last word to Social Justice Ireland.  I am tired of quoting Social Justice Ireland; it has been so critical of the Minister, and I feel that I am echoing myself, so on this occasion I will leave the last word to the sagacious Marge Simpson who said, &ldquo;I guess one person can make a difference.  But most of the time, they probably shouldn't&quot;.</p></speech>

In this Bill the Minister seeks to give legislative effect to the meagre range of measures she announced in the budget.</p><p>The measures introduced in the budget are too little, too late and far too cynical.  While I welcome the row-back due to pressure from myself and others, especially those who suffered the consequences of the cuts in social welfare rates, I would be happier if the Government had seen fit to take on board more of the proposals made by me and others on this side of the House and outside it.  If those proposals were all taken on board we might have a progressive Social Welfare Bill that would be worth the ink in which it is written.</p><p>The restoration of the Christmas bonus is the measure that has been most lauded by those on the Government benches.  However, Christmas comes but once a year and there are another 51 weeks.  Those weeks have not been made any easier by the small change promised by the &euro;3 to &euro;6 increase in the family income supplement, FIS, the &euro;3 increase in pensions, and the &euro;2 here, &euro;2.70 there for qualified dependants, or even by the restoration of the &euro;5 she pillaged from children in cuts to child benefit over the years of the Government&rsquo;s reign.</p><p>The restoration of the respite care grant is welcome, as is the increase in the period for which carer&rsquo;s allowance is payable from six to 12 weeks.  The Minister challenged us as to whether we would oppose the Bill for the sake of opposition.  My record on social welfare Bills shows I have not taken such an approach.  I have opposed the use of the guillotine on Bills which ensure all measures have not been adequately discussed but I have continuously welcomed small positive changes and I will do likewise today.</p><p>I welcome the tapered PRSI credit proposal, in line with the increased minimum wage.  That is something Sinn F&eacute;in has sought.  Whenever a positive change is introduced we have advocated that it would not be squirrelled away by the Government through tax increases or that it would result in people ending up in a different tax bracket, which ekes away every last cent.</p><p>The Government has prioritised tax cuts which favour the most well-off in society over public spending which would favour everyone else.  The Minister should have listened to the people.  Two thirds of those who were recently polled in what I think was an opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>said they overwhelmingly wanted the Government to increase expenditure on public services, housing, homelessness, health, education and child care over tax cuts.  That is what the public had to say.</p><p>More spending would have redistributed income and reduced inequality but the Government cynically decided to play election politics by throwing crumbs to the masses and favouring their friends with tax cuts.  Could the Minister tell me where is the fairness in that?  Over the course of the Government&rsquo;s term in office it did not share the burden of austerity equally or fairly.  A total of &euro;30 billion was taken out of the economy in taxes and cuts during the recession.  Some suffered greatly and others were protected.  The Department of Social Protection cut nearly &euro;3 billion in social welfare spending at a time of increased dependency on social welfare.  Those figures alone speak volumes.</p><p>One of the central roles of a government is to protect its vulnerable citizens.  In fact, the Government did the opposite and made the most vulnerable, the poorest, members of society shoulder the heaviest load even though the parties promised in the programme for Government that it sought to protect the young, the sick and the vulnerable.  The Government picked the pockets of those people - from the cradle to the grave.  The Government targeted the elderly, the disabled, lone parents, struggling low-income families with children, mothers and young children, jobseekers and the long-term unemployed with the most savage cuts over the course of the four consecutive budgets overseen by it in its term of office.</p><p>The Government cut core social welfare rates time and again, despite its denials.  It relentlessly cut, cut, cut during periods of severe hardship when the less well-off in society should have had the benefit of the safety net of social transfers.  The Government denies that inequality has risen during its term in office, yet in budget 2016 the gap between rich and poor has widened by &euro;506 a year.  In two years the gap between the rich and the poor has widened by &euro;1,003 as a result of the Government&rsquo;s budget decisions.</p><p>More than 376, 000 people are living in consistent poverty.  That is, almost one third of the population, 30.5%, experience two or more enforced types of deprivation.  Households where the head of the household is parenting alone have the highest deprivation rates at 63% and the figure for households with people with a disability is 50%.  Approximately one in six children and one in ten people aged over 65 are at risk of poverty.</p><p> These figures have firmly put paid to the lie that the recovery the Government has so often trumpeted is fair.  Its budget decided to prioritise the better-off and give them the majority of available resources to the detriment of people in poverty.  Its income tax changes disproportionately favour those on higher incomes and are of no benefit to the most vulnerable members of society.  It even went as far as to create a new tax relief this year for rich aeroplane owners who wish to build themselves a hangar for their aeroplanes.  In budget 2016, the Government allocated half of all available resource to tax cuts, thereby eroding the revenue base needed to deliver quality public services to tackle the crises in the health service and in respect of homelessness, housing, education and child care.  Services that help the low-paid and most vulnerable, hold their lives together and close the gap between rich and poor have been decimated.  Social Justice Ireland, which was not quoted earlier by the previous speaker, has stated, "The poorest 10% in Ireland lost most since the onset of the crisis", yet the Government has cut taxes in this budget that benefit the top 20% of society who also hold 39.7% of the wealth.  Where is the fairness in that?</p> <p> The Government's measly, miserly cuts were implemented year in and year out and the T&aacute;naiste's reign in office has been characterised by punishing the elderly for being old, people with disabilities for being disabled, the young jobseekers who could not find a job because none existed, lone parents for raising their children alone, carers for caring, mothers for having babies and children for being children.  I remember when the Government came into office in 2011.  It promised to mend the broken economy, protect the vulnerable and build a society based on fairness and equal citizenship.  Nearly five years later, it has not delivered on any of these promises but along the way, it has lost its sense of social justice.  All Members have seen is the Labour Party doing what the Labour Party does, namely, making promises it does not keep.  As the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Rabbitte has stated, is that not what everyone does during election time?</p></speech>

Budget 2016, of which this Bill forms part, is another cynical attempt at election game-playing.  Can the Minister of State seriously believe the Labour Party can buy off the people it has most savagely cut and consistently targeted over its entire term in office with a few measly crumbs, a carrot, and some shiny baubles?  Does the Labour Party really believe the people are willing to be bought off with a fiver here or a few row-backs there?  I do not believe that will happen, as Labour Party Members will find soon enough.  I have stood before the T&aacute;naiste many times over the last four and a half years and in the Minister of State's case, over the past couple of years since he took office in the Department.  I have begged, implored and appealed to their sense of compassion and social justice to reverse almost all the cuts the Government has brought in.  It is only now, four and a half years later, that the Government has started a measly row-back and that it is doing so at all is a belated acceptance I was right and the Government was wrong to cut in the first place because in their speeches, members of the Government have admitted these people are the most vulnerable and that this money is spent in the local economy, which it would protect.  If this is the case, why did the Government introduce these cuts?  It is too late for many local businesses.  They are closed because the very money on which they depended and which their customers received in social welfare payments was cut relentlessly by both the present Administration and the previous Government.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the reversal of some of these cuts, I and others have seen the devastating impact they had on the ground on the real flesh-and-blood people, who are not figures or statistics, over the course of the last four and a half years.  I have met people on a continuous basis, who have visited my office or who I have met on the street, who were in absolute distress.  They were in distress because each time they sought hope, they have been hit by further cuts.  The figures and statistics also bear out the despondency and need I witness on a daily basis.  I have seen many constituents in tears because of despondency and a lack of hope because the present Government, in which they had some faith regarding living up to its promises when casting their votes four and a half years ago, did not do so.</p>  <p>  The budget has failed to deliver an increase in the minimum social welfare payment, which has remained at &euro;188 since 2011.  Since then, the cost of living has risen and has eroded its value and the value of all social transfers, in effect leaving those dependent on social welfare to fall further behind even as far as the small, if any, recovery is concerned.  The Government should at least have restored the buying power of those who depend on the minimum social welfare payments to pre-2011 levels to alleviate some of the hardship caused by the cumulative impact of five regressive budgets and the cuts to services on which they also are dependent.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste has left the Chamber, I remind the Minister of State of some of the harshest cuts inflicted on the most vulnerable while he and the T&aacute;naiste were at the helm.  While the Government had the opportunity to take a different approach, instead of targeting the wealthy over the aforementioned four and a half years, it chose to cut illness benefit, maternity benefit, children&rsquo;s allowance, the diet supplement scheme, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, the telephone allowance, State pension, respite care grant, bereavement grant, jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance, to name some benefits and allowances, each of which was cut to some degree.  Sinn F&eacute;in has shown continuously in its fully-costed alternative budgets that there were alternatives to those cuts.  Its priority was to see a reversal in the hardship and deprivation the Government has wrought upon working class communities in particular.  Almost five years ago the Labour Party lambasted its current bedfellows with its &ldquo;every little hurts&rdquo; campaign.  I tell Fine Gael and the Labour Party today that every little cut hurts those who are dependent on social welfare and they are correct in this regard; the problem is that the present Government compounded the cuts made by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government with its own cuts and went much further in many ways.  I believe the people will understand that when the vote comes around again this year or early next year.</p>  <p>  As for some previously mentioned cuts that have been implemented by the Government, I note that workers have already paid for illness benefit through their PRSI contributions but even that did not stop the Government from cutting three days' payment or &euro;113 from it.  In addition, the Government closed the diet supplement scheme, which had offered social welfare recipients suffering from conditions such as coeliac disease, stroke, throat cancer or motor neuron disease a small contribution towards the additional costs, which were recognised by everyone, associated with their medically necessary diets.  As for the fuel allowance and household benefits package mentioned earlier, the Government cut these schemes, on which some of the poorest households including the elderly and people with disabilities depend to heat their homes, by six weeks or &euro;120 in the case of fuel allowance.  While the Government has gone a little way towards restoring these benefits, it has not extended the number of weeks back to the previous timeframe and therefore has not restored the benefit to its previous full value.  Even with the increase announced, pensioners and those in receipt of social welfare still are down by &euro;54.50.  Let Members not forget the Government also imposed a water tax on top of that and for many people, and also imposed a property tax on in case they were getting rich on social welfare.</p></speech>

All of us in this House will have been shocked at the contents of a letter written by an emergency department consultant at Tallaght hospital to his chief executive officer, which was copied to the Minister for Health and referenced by me to the Taoiseach yesterday.  It outlines how a couple in their 90s, married for 59 years, found themselves waiting for long periods in an emergency department.  The man, who has advanced Parkinson's disease, was left a on trolley in a conduit between the psychiatric rooms and some cubicles for over 29 hours.</p>  <p>  The consultant refers in his letter to there being 79 patients in the emergency department at 10.40 p.m., 19 of whom were waiting for beds and two of whom had been waiting in the emergency department for longer than two days.  In regard to the man with Parkinson's disease, the consultant stated, "This man, like the others in non-designated patient conduits, had no privacy, no dignity, was subject to constant noise torture, constant light torture, resulting in major sleep deprivation and pressure effects causing pain as a result of lying for an advanced period on a trolley not designated for same, as well as boarding conditions that constitute an infection control hazard."  He further stated, "Nobody of any age should be subjected to this inhumanity."  He then spoke about gross governance failure evidenced by two patients who were boarded and deemed to be requiring isolation, a patient festering two days and 11 hours and a dedicated pressure control isolation room that currently lies idle in the expanded new emergency department, along with eight cubicles lying idle since June of this year.  Chillingly, the letter concludes, "It's only a matter of time before we disclose our next crowding related death at Tallaght hospital while crowding is tolerated."</p>  <p>  The INMO has now balloted for industrial action, citing record numbers on trolleys in our hospital emergency departments, the total figure for which amounted to 80,000 over the past ten months, which is an all-time high since the introduction of trolley watch.  There were 8,000 people on hospital trolleys in the month of October alone.  Two years ago, the Taoiseach announced to this House that he was taking personal charge of health services.  This letter speaks to an absence of decency and dignity.  The situation has worsened over the past two years.  Can the Taoiseach explain the reason for this to the House?</p></speech>

We were told earlier on this year that the provision of additional funding for the fair deal scheme would help to bring down waiting times under that scheme from 15 weeks to a more normal level and that this would end this particular problem.  That funding was provided.  It is now four weeks on and it did not deal with the problem as envisaged.</p>  <p>  An extra &euro;117 million has been allocated this year to free up hospital beds, to create additional beds and to hire more staff.  I did not hear the hospital manager, or the bed manager, from Tallaght hospital speak on this particular incident.  I do not have all of the details, other than the letter Deputy Martin has referred to from the consultant, with whose view I agree.</p></speech>

There are more beds.  Delayed discharges have been reducing steadily since the start of the year.  Beds in the community - for instance, in Mount Carmel - have been opened and 300 additional hospital beds are to open shortly, as already announced and in respect of which money is in place.  A series of campaigns are going on to attract front-line staff.  Since January of this year, there are 500 more nurses in the health service.  Since September 2011, almost 300 additional consultants have been appointed, including 57 more this year.  The number of NCHDs employed has increased by over 250 since last year.</p>  <p>  I do not understand how what happened to this 91 year old man was allowed to happen.  It is up to everybody in the health service to play their part, accept their responsibilities and to work to ensure that the plan works.  All Members will be aware, in terms of hospitals they may have had to visit, that somebody has to make a decision about the extent of medical priority such that no 91 year old is left on a trolley for 29 hours.  The facilities are being provided.  The extra staff are also being provided, as is the money, but it is still not making the impact that it should.  I am sure that over the next number of weeks other shocking cases will be brought to light.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has come in here today and said that he would love to know why this is happening, after he said two years ago that he would take personal charge and after the Minister establishing a task force, the co-chairman of which has said it has not made a dent on the problem.  Then the Taoiseach says people are resisting change.  That is an appalling assertion against the staff in our emergency departments.</p></speech>

Since the Labour Party conference in February, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has been promising the introduction of rent certainty.  He said then what we are looking at is a process whereby people have some certainty as regards rent into the future while housing supply is being dealt with.  The Minister said this was his number one priority and he said "I'm committing here, that I am intent on entering the market to change this; it has to be done."  Now the Taoiseach disagrees.  He has said: "It is clear that interference in the market, to its detriment, is not something we should do.  While people are calling for what they call clarity on rent certainty, if we interfere in the wrong way, we will make matters worse".  It is little wonder that there is chaos in the Taoiseach's Cabinet.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has referred to his Fine Gael colleagues as anonymous cowards because they briefed against the rent certainty proposal, but the chaos in the Cabinet is at nothing compared to the instability and the chaos inflicted by the Taoiseach on families who cannot afford to pay rents.  Yesterday when I raised this issue the Taoiseach said the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would this week conclude discussions on proposals to deal with the housing crisis.  Could the Taoiseach confirm for the D&aacute;il today, and for those citizens who are suffering directly as a result of his Government's policies, that the Government will introduce rent certainty?  Will he tell us that today and, if not, will he tell us why not?</p></speech>

I listened to a very effective and very efficient official this morning speaking about what is happening in this city and the efforts that have been made, which are proving to be very successful, to deal with that particular problem even though the population of those who are rough sleepers has changed over the past period.  There is the progress has been made clearly with more than 700 families now being put into what were voided units, or units that had to be reconstructed, renovated and made habitable.  We have had the changes in the housing assistance programme, which provides a degree of certainty and a further option for those tenants who are under pressure from landlords.  We have the figure of &euro;4 billion on the table for the period between now and 2020, objectives and targets have been set for every local authority, and chief executives have been called together by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and told to get on with their jobs, which is to provide these houses for which the taxpayer is providing money.  There are the other issues in respect of the private housing sector.  Clearly, with every new facility that comes into the country with direct investment or expansion of employment, there is a need for further accommodation, and this is stalled effectively because of the situation that applied either because of a shortage of access to equity, the planning situation or the building regulations.  These are all matters that are the source of discussion between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his officials have done an extraordinary amount of work in the areas that I have mentioned.  I hope the discussions taking place between the two Ministers can conclude this week with an agreement on effective responses for the short term, as well as for the medium to long term, which will ensure the viability of housing supply.  This is the critical fault in all of this.  If one does not have the supply of houses, one has extra pressure on existing accommodation units.</p> <p> I referred yesterday to the decision to provide modular housing units.  The first tenders for those are now being put in place.  A small number, over 20, will be provided by Christmas.  It is a challenging situation.  I hope the discussions taking place will conclude this week, so we can move on and deal with the issues that will allow for accommodation to be provided for individuals and families with children and give them an opportunity to have proper comfortable accommodation with a longer term view for the future.</p></speech>

Contrary to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s protestations, his policies are making the lives of citizens worse.  He is allowing the market to decide on this issue.  Since he took office, rents have increased by 35%.  Up to 90% of these cases are above rent supplement limits, meaning families cannot afford to live in homes.  They are being evicted, being forced from their homes into emergency accommodation.  There are now 1,500 children living in homeless accommodation in Dublin city as a result of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s policies.  There is no other reason for it.  The Government&rsquo;s response has been incoherent, incohesive and chaotic with Ministers briefing against each other instead of dealing with the housing crisis.</p></speech>

I would argue that not addressing the underlying problems in the housing crisis is making it worse.  It beggars belief how poorly the Government has dealt with the housing crisis.  This week, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance pointed out that in January 2015, 400 families with children had to go into emergency accommodation.  How could that figure have reached 700 by August 2015?  How has the Government failed so miserably to deal with the problem?  The Government is now talking about getting the homeless off the streets for Christmas.  It talked about same thing last year.</p></speech>

In fact, the housing crisis has got worse.</p>  <p>  It is not all on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s plate.  The housing crisis is a result of decades of housing policy that followed the private, free-market version.  There is nothing wrong with the private sector making money out of building houses.  That is what it does.  It is not a crime to make money or lose it.  The private sector looks to make a profit on whatever it does.  That is accepted.</p>  <p>  I see the role of the State as being different, however.  Its role is to provide an actual service.  The State is not looking to make a profit but to provide homes to people who cannot afford to buy them.  For several different reasons, from land-banking to the whole thrust of housing construction, there are significant problems with affordability and homelessness.  The Taoiseach can throw all he likes at the housing crisis but he will not solve it until he accepts the fact that we need to build social housing through the local authorities again.</p>  <p>  The Government is not actually doing that.  Most of the social housing it is planning to provide over the next five years will be through the private sector, not through the State.  Why are the local authorities not allowed to borrow money from the European Central Bank at the cheap rates to build social housing like the approved housing bodies?  I do not understand the logic of this.  Will the Taoiseach explain it to me?</p>  <p>  NAMA building 20,000 houses was much trumpeted.  Only 10% of this will be social.  Why will the Taoiseach not make 50% of this social housing?  It should be a mix of social and private, 50% of each, in the same buildings.  We have a massive housing problem and the lack of social housing is at the root of the problem.  Until the Government addresses that, it will not solve the problem.</p></speech>

The Minister has called in all the local authority chief executives on two occasions.  He has stated that they have their targets and they must get on with providing these houses.  I expect 200 sites will be opened next year for building social housing all over the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, NAMA expects, on the basis of the authorisation given to it by the Minister for Finance, to open 100 sites, most of which will be in Dublin.  They will deliver about 80 units once they get started.  This should be an addition to the system.  As a builder himself, Deputy Wallace knows these cannot be provided overnight.  We have to provide for the immediate term, as well as for the longer term.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace recognises the supply element in dealing with the number of houses is absolutely critical.  The fewer housing units, the greater the pressure on existing stock.  That is what is causing the pressure in terms of rents.  When higher rents are seen on the horizon by landlords, some go after them with a vengeance.  We have to deal with this.  That is why, unfortunately, there are people staying in hotel rooms and other unsuitable accommodation, as well as people on the street.  This is a challenge with which we have to deal. </p><p>With all the measures being put in place, I hope we are making progress.  We would like to think it could be done much faster, but that is not going to be the way it is.  Some &euro;4 billion will be spent on social housing between now and 2020.  Instructions and authorisation have been given to get on with the task.  Some 200 sites are to be opened.  NAMA will provide 100 sites which once work starts will equate to 80 homes a week.</p></speech>

The Government's five-year plan provides for the provision of 760 units, less than 100 of which - 20 a year - will be built by the local authorities in the next five years.  That will not address the problem.  Unless the Government changes its policy, we will see further boom and bust cycles and continue to have an affordability problem, homelessness and social exclusion.  We sold the best sites through NAMA to investment trusts from abroad.  Kennedy Wilson has just received planning permission to build 160 apartments at Clancy Barracks.  It asked that no provision be made for social housing and no social housing is included.  What will it do with the apartments?  It will rent them out.  What will that do?  It will drive rents up further.  There is a cartel of investors, most of them foreign, who control the rental market.  Rents have increased from &euro;1,000 a month for a two bedroom apartment in the city centre to &euro;1,500 a month because the Government has sold half the country.</p></speech>

The Government regards the work of credit unions and the services they offer as a fundamental issue for our country and society in general.  The credit unions are well respected by ordinary people.  Obviously, some changes have been made due to certain instances that arose.  The Central Bank will make its recommendations and the Minister will oblige.  He will deal with that in the next couple of weeks.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned two national cultural institutions Bills.  I do not have a date for them but I expect they are due to be dealt with in the first half of next year.  Regarding the current issue, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, was able to stabilise and increase funding in both 2015 and 2016 for the national cultural institutions.  They have had some difficult years.  She provided &euro;2 million in once-off funding in the 2015 Estimates for the cultural institutions and &euro;600,000 of that was allocated to the National Library.  Additional money has been secured for 2016.  I expect the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to deal with that matter and the Deputy's question about the quality of the accommodation, the storage and so forth for the historical documents in the short period ahead.</p></speech>

There would be general political consensus across the House in support of legislation to deal with minimum pricing, regulating advertising and marketing and sports sponsorship.  I pose my question against the background of growing consumption of alcohol in this country and in circumstances where public health is constantly challenged.  The costs to the health service are enormous.  However, at the same time, throughout the country hundreds of traditional family pubs have closed and many of them are only open on a part-time basis.</p></speech>

I have asked about the first of these on many occasions.  It relates to the release of the 1926 census.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, has promised this and it was promised in the programme for Government.  Indeed, on 9 March 2012 it was said that the legislation had been approved by Cabinet.  The legislation has not come before this House to allow for the records to be released before the 100 year rule.  Will the census be released?  Is the legislation forthcoming and will any of the 1926 census data be released for the centenary of the Easter Rising, as was the original plan, or is it off the table?  It is likely it is far too late now to release it and that the Government has missed the boat on this issue, but in regard to the promised legislation can the Taoiseach tell us whether it will come before the House before the Government's term in office is up?</p>  <p>  My second question relates to the promised legislation on bankruptcy.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this was kicked to touch to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It reported to the Minister in the first week of July, four months ago, but the report remains on the Minister's desk.  Will legislation come before the House this or next term to reduce the bankruptcy term from three years to one year, as has been unanimously agreed by the joint committee?</p></speech>

I will have to come back to the Deputy in regard to when the legislation is likely to be published.</p><p>The question on the 1926 census is twofold, concerning the 100 year rule and the cost.  I am not sure what state of preparation that is at, but I will advise the Deputy shortly.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it was selected a number of weeks ago but neither the Minister nor the Minister of State was available.  I appreciate that the Minster of State, Deputy Humphreys, has come in today despite the pressing demands on him.</p>  <p>  With the Acting Chairman's indulgence, I intend to speak just once on this occasion.  I have some visitors to the audiovisual room today, members of the Irish Cancer Society and the Movember movement, whom I do not want to detain.  I am quite sure I am going to be satisfied with the Minister of State's reply and acknowledge his willingness to engage with me on this issue outside the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to talk about the public services card without referring to social welfare fraud.  I acknowledge the role played by the T&aacute;naiste and Minster for Social Protection, her Department, and the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, since coming into government in 2011 in dealing with this in a most serious way.  Many people, including many in my constituency, had been calling for such action for long years.  However, I would contend that there are certain areas that may need to be tweaked or where a little bit of flexibility needs to be displayed.  I have received numerous correspondences from people who are caught in situations and, although they are very willing to engage with the Department of Social Protection at every opportunity, sometimes things do not work out.  In my view they have been unfairly penalised.</p>  <p>  To give one example, I recently heard from a non-consultant hospital doctor who is obliged to spend 12 months in training in HSE hospitals at various locations around the country.  In the circumstances this person has had to move house on a number of occasions.  Oftentimes junior doctors work long hours and this doctor was not able to meet the appointments that were set up, but has made very serious attempts to contact the officials.  I have evidence to show that these attempts include registration of letters and numerous telephone calls.  There was great difficulty even in having telephone calls answered.  This is a person who, because of their profession, has never availed of social protection payments other than child benefit.  I only have time to cite one example today but have numerous others on hand.  Without notice, this doctor's child benefit was stopped.  The wheels have been turning again to try to get it reinstated.</p>  <p>  I raise this example while appreciating all the good that has come out of the public services card and the efforts that have been made by the T&aacute;naiste, her Minister of State and the Department in dealing with social welfare fraud.  In certain cases, flexibility needs to be shown to give people assurance that they will not be unfairly penalised in the way this doctor was.</p></speech>

He is right that the public services card has been a fantastic success in many ways, including in simplifying use of free travel etc. and not just in terms of fraud.  It has been very good and is best practice.  It was initiated by our predecessors in 2005 and I acknowledge the interdepartmental work done in the very early stages.</p>  <p>  The Deputy talks about tweaking it for the exceptions.  As he will understand, there are about 1.6 million public services cards in operation.  I will confirm that figure with him at another time.  In many ways, we have tweaked the system.  When a person who receives an invitation to attend a public services card registration meeting is unable to do so due to illness or disability, we settle that and leave it for 12 months for people to recover and their benefits continue.  We are looking at other areas such as people with intellectual disabilities and how we can deal with them in a caring manner.  We are reviewing how we will deal with our clients in that manner and considering the best practice and process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred in particular to child benefit.  It is a social welfare payment the same as all the others and there is a necessity to ensure that the people claiming it are who they say they are.  There needs to be a robust system to ensure we are paying child benefit to those who are eligible for it.  I take on board the Deputy's point about tweaking it.  If he would like to bring the individual case to my attention I would be happy to deal with it personally.</p>  <p>  We have tweaked the system and are continuously doing so.  For certain people with illnesses or disabilities who want the public services card, if requested we can now go out and do the meeting in their own homes.  The flexibility is being built into the system.  We are improving it all the time and I certainly take on board the case the Deputy has pointed out today.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this matter and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for being here in person.  I know he has a busy schedule today as always.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned with figures I obtained recently in respect of the number of people working in IDA-supported companies in the Cork and Kerry region.  I am concerned about the breakdown of those figures and the number of such companies in the two counties.  It is the largest regional division of the IDA, as I understand, with a population of 666,000, of whom 519,000 are in County Cork and 145,000 in County Kerry.  While the population of County Cork is roughly 3.5 times that of County Kerry, the figures for employment in IDA-supported companies are unfortunately very different.</p><p>There are over 15 times the number of people employed in IDA companies in Cork than there are in Kerry even though the population in Cork is only three and a half times that of Kerry.  There are 12 times more IDA companies in Cork than there are in Kerry.  There are 146 IDA-supported companies in Cork employing 28,545 people while there are 23 IDA-supported companies employing 1,874 people in Kerry.  Kerry could be doing much better than this.  I do not mean to in any way overstate the importance of FDI in our economy but it certainly plays an important role and we cannot ignore it.  </p> <p> To date, the Cork-Kerry collective arrangement has not been working for Kerry.  It is not delivering to the level it should be.  We need to bring more IDA-supported companies to Kerry.  I acknowledge that there has been great progress in the past number of years in terms of the expansion of IDA-supported companies in Kerry.  There are over 300 net new jobs in those companies.  That compares to major losses in 2008 to 2010 so we are going in the right direction but we could be doing more.  I see that Waterford has its own regional office and I think something like that would be very suitable for Kerry.  </p> <p> We have a different arrangement when it comes to investment aid, which is something I have worked on since I entered this House.  I thank the Minister for his efforts in putting Kerry on the investment aid map since 1 July 2014.  We have different strengths and opportunities to push in the Kerry region that a Kerry office could bring to the fore to bring more industry to the country.  </p> <p> Hopefully, we have put in place measures to improve the fundamentals for Kerry, for example, the N22 Cork-Kerry road.  Getting that on the capital plan has been a major step forward and has been one of the greatest socioeconomic developments for the county in many years.  We need an office to push Kerry individually.  If we had a stand-alone office in Kerry, would we have seen greater progress on the Shannon LNG project in recent years?  Would companies like Amann Industries in Kerry, which left in 2010, have stayed a bit longer?  Could we have done something differently?  The feeling on the ground in Kerry is that we are the poor relation of Cork.  When we look at those figures - 12 times the number of IDA-supported companies and 15 times the number of people employed - it certainly gives that notion credence.</p> <p> I would be interested in hearing the Minister's views.  I acknowledge the great progress that has been made in the past number of years in reducing the live register figures in Kerry.  When I was first elected, we were heading for 18,000.  We are now just over 11,000.  At 34.94%, Kerry has seen the highest reduction in live register figures in the country since the launch of the action plan for jobs in February 2012.  This is a major achievement but we need to keep it going and increased FDI would help us do that and build for the future.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, under my direction, the enterprise agencies have adopted a very strong regional focus, particularly in the past 12 months.  I have worked with local stakeholders in the south west to develop a regional action plan for jobs for the region.  This includes very strong ambitions for both Irish-owned and foreign-owned businesses in the region.  The plan has set ambitious targets for FDI.  They are a 30% to 40% increase in new investments, building an advance technology building in Tralee, building upon Kerry brand development initiatives as a marketing tool overseas, developing a regional Connect Ireland plan that is integrated with the local authorities' plans and activities and establishing a south west skills forum to ensure that the future skill needs of targeted sectors and enterprises are developed by the local institutes of education.</p>  <p>  As part of its approach to implementing the regional strategy, the IDA has established a stand-alone regional office for the south west.  Previously, the Cork office covered both the south east and the south west.  The office in Waterford is an office for the south east.  It is not an office specifically for one county.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that Kerry has a smaller foreign-owned enterprise base than in Cork.  However, it has exhibited strong growth in the past four years increasing jobs by 24%.  This is in contrast to a 25% decline in the previous three years.  I am confident that this strong progress can be maintained.  On a proportional basis, this is faster growth than that experienced by most counties.  Site visits to Kerry have increased significantly in the past 18 months, which is also a healthy sign.  We are in the process of building an advance facility in Kerry.  </p>  <p>  The marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for FDI is done through IDA Ireland's network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland, although the ultimate locations selected are always decided by the companies themselves.  As the Deputy has recognised, one of the boosts that will help us market Kerry more effectively is the reinstatement of regional aid from 1 July 2014.  This allows the State to grant aid at enhanced rates to businesses to support new investment and employment in Ireland's more disadvantaged regions.  This is a new element in the armoury of IDA Ireland in promoting the Kerry region.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland promotes Kerry as part of an integrated south west region, along with Cork, with access to the county population base of 145,048.  The reality is that we must market ourselves in the context of pretty deep labour market pools across a region.  We build a base of regional strengths as a magnet but we have also used the advance facility in Kerry as a way of making sure it does not just focus on the core but that we have other parts of the region providing alternatives.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA Ireland is particularly targeting emerging companies in the ICT, international financial services and global business services sectors.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the county.  As the Deputy has recognised, this has been very strong.  </p>  <p>  The IDA is satisfied that it is delivering a strong service to Kerry as an integral part of the south-west region.  IDA Ireland is structured on a NUTS III regional basis - this is the south west as a single region - and there are no plans to change this.  I would point out as an aside that, as the Deputy probably knows, the CEO is a Kerry man.  In some ways, Kerry has occupied Wilton House as a way of ensuring it gets attention.</p></speech>

I am sure it is helpful having a Kerry man in there.  Hopefully, there will be benefits in the future.  I welcome the growth in recent years.  Turning around the trend that was present between 2008 and 2010 so significantly was a great achievement.  It could be argued that we are starting from a lower base but what really stands out is the huge difference between Cork and Kerry.  Yes, it is the second largest urban centre in the Republic of Ireland and we must give a weighting to that.  However, to have 15 times the number of people working in those companies is too skewed and we need to address that imbalance.</p>  <p>  If we cannot establish a dedicated Kerry office, there should be greater emphasis on the county and a renewed effort to bring more to it and to highlight some of the positives that are in it.  The Minister rightly referred to the institute of technology which will hopefully soon become a technological university, the technology park and the new advance facility, which is very welcome.  However, we can also look at examples at around the county such as the town of Killorglin.  I have raised this issue with the Minister previously.  Killorglin is a shining example of a rural town that has really shown itself to be a success story.  It contains indigenous companies like FEXCO,  companies like Temmler and Astellas and smaller companies like Promed and Aqua Design.  Liebherr is only a few miles down the road in Fossa.  All these companies are operating and providing employment in a rural town that would be seen as peripheral by many but that is showing that one can do business and be very successful.  It should be held up as the example to any prospective investor.  They should be told to look at what has been done in Killorglin and told that they could go there, be among many other high-achieving companies and do very well.  This is an area we need to look at.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has listened and I thank him for that.  I was looking through the archives recently and saw a Topical Issue I raised in 2011 about the need for a regional approach to jobs planning and individual job plans for the regions.  The Minister has done this and followed it through, which is a major step forward.</p><p>That is highly progressive.  It has not been done before.  I mentioned the strengths and opportunities in Kerry recently.  They are at the heart of what the Minister is doing with the regional jobs plan, which will boost every region.</p> <p> Shamelessly wearing my constituency hat, I have to say we have not punched high enough in Kerry to bring in foreign direct investment.  We need more site visits to try to sell the county more.  I hope the regional office for the south west will place a greater emphasis on redressing that imbalance. </p></speech>

Kerry is in a very strong position because it has core strength in a range of sectors, as the Deputy has pointed out.  It has strength in food, tourism, financial services, engineering, agri-technology, multi-media technology, energy and marine.  The key to the regional action plan is developing strategies for each of those sectors to be credibly leveraged and for the institute of technology, IT and other resources, stakeholders and local authorities to come in behind that programme of actions.  That is the approach we are taking.  Examples such as Killorglin are integrated into a bigger unit which is a magnet for the IDA.</p>  <p>  The IDA, however, has to decide how best to market the south west and Kerry in particular.  It has made a choice, having the advance facility, of integrating the IT into its effort rather than having stand-alone offices that give the impression of activity but do not deliver the goods on the ground.  That is the strategic approach it has adopted.  It creates the larger region because that big magnet is necessary to compete for projects.  That can be used for spin-offs.  For example, Dundalk has leveraged off the success of Dublin to build a strong centre.  That model of hubs and spokes is the way to do this successfully.</p></speech>

The national cultural institutions are back in the headlines.  Professor Diarmaid Ferriter resigned from the board of the National Library in 2012 as a result of his concerns at the pretty swingeing cuts made there.  We have reason to be grateful to RT&Eacute; today for exposing the letter which the outgoing board wrote to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht last July, expressing its deep concern at the library&rsquo;s inability to fulfil its statutory function of protecting and preserving the nation&rsquo;s documentary heritage.  It made the alarming statement that all of its important collections are deteriorating because they are housed in unsuitable conditions.  It needs an additional &euro;500,000 to operate effectively.  Not only does it have serious concerns about the unsuitability of the storage spaces in which 75% of the collection is maintained but it is concerned about the lack of fire safety, staffing and its inability to acquire vitally important new documents which should be retained in public ownership.  There is a serious problem which Professor Ferriter and the board have signalled to the Minister.  Additional investment is needed.  I salute the Minister for securing some additional funding for the national cultural institutions last year.</p>  <p>  Over the past few years of recession, agencies, individuals and families throughout the country suffered because there was not enough money to go around and there was real suffering and hardship.  The cuts imposed on the national cultural institutions, such as the National Library, were disproportionate and indicate a lack of understanding on the part of Government of the vital importance of these institutions to national well-being and their role in our society.  For example, the National Library has a collection of something in excess of 5.2 million photographs.  Particular care needs to be taken in preserving photographs.</p>  <p>  This is the decade of centenaries when we are talking about celebration.  It is vitally important that in this period of celebration and commemoration, we ensure these valuable pieces of our heritage are protected and that the other pieces that need to be acquired can be acquired and added to the collection.</p></speech>

The National Library is one of our foremost national cultural institutions.  It not only enhances our understanding and appreciation of our nation's history, it helps us tell our story to an international audience.  The National Library, which is housed beside us here on Kildare Street, is an increasingly popular attraction for Irish visitors and overseas tourists.  I believe this will increase next year, during the centenary of the Easter Rising, as the library holds a collection of fascinating historical material relating to that period.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the National Library and, indeed, other cultural institutions, following the significant reduction in resources available to the Exchequer as a result of the economic crisis.  These challenges are a legacy of the economic crisis.  The catastrophic collapse in the public finances resulted in severe, multi-annual reductions in funding across all of our cultural institutions and across the public sector.</p>  <p>  There has been a &euro;30 billion adjustment in Government spending in recent years.  There are huge challenges and they are not going to be fixed overnight and will most likely take several years to address.  Since my appointment as Minister, less than a year and a half ago, I have managed to stabilise and increase support to our cultural institutions.  Thanks to the fact the economy has improved because of the sacrifices of the Irish people, I was in a position to secure an additional &euro;2 million in once-off funding for our national cultural institutions in late 2014, as part of the 2015 Revised Estimates.  The funding was aimed at addressing specific issues in several key institutions, including the National Library.  This included an increased allocation of &euro;600,000 for the National Library.</p>  <p>  While this funding was originally secured on a once-off basis, I was pleased to retain it for 2016.  The library will also benefit from additional funding under the Ireland 2016 centenary programme next year when it will play a very important role in our commemorations.  The library gives the security of the collection the highest priority and, where incidents have arisen, has brought in appropriate expert advice to assist it.</p>  <p>  With regard to staffing and the security of collections, I was also pleased to approve recently a new post in the National Library for a security and facilities manager, which will be key to managing and planning the storage and security of the library's collection.</p><p>The overall funding secured in the past two years gives more certainty to the library and will allow it to continue to deliver on its core objectives, including the protection and conservation of its collections.  However, it is generally acknowledged that the library holds a significant amount of its collection in a Victorian era building which would not meet modern standards in terms of environmental and other controls.  I might add there was no significant capital investment in the building when the country was awash with money.  At a time when resources are still scarce, the Government is investing in our cultural institutions.  I refute the Deputy's comment that there is a lack of understanding on our part.  A &euro;30 million upgrade is under way at the National Gallery of Ireland to restore the Victorian Dargan and Milltown wings.</p> <p> I know that the library needs further capital investment.  These issues have been discussed in the House on numerous occasions in recent years.  My Department has been liaising closely with the library on these challenges and I intend to make a positive announcement on its capital needs in the coming week.</p></speech>

It is in this House that such an announcement should be made.  I appreciate most of the points she has made and cannot disagree with any of them.  However, the outgoing board is stating all of the important collections are deteriorating.  If that is happening, it is something that requires immediate action.  If the collections are not fire-safe, they require immediate attention.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that there will be the required level of attention?</p>  <p>  The Minister has rightly said the building on Kildare Street is old, as is this building, and such buildings require ongoing maintenance and capital investment.  What is the level of capital investment required to upgrade the building?  If the Minister is to make an announcement in the near future, will she refer in it to the total refurbishment of the building?</p>  <p>  Reference has been made to an exhibition in 2017 of the work of the Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, of whom and of whose work we are enormously proud.  We want the exhibition to go ahead and are aware that it is going ahead, the Minister having secured commitments from Bank of Ireland in this respect.  As media reports state the National Library of Ireland will not be in a position to invest in the exhibition, can the Minister of State put our minds at ease by confirming that extra funding will be forthcoming from the Government?</p></speech>

There were, however, also some good things in the letter in which they expressed their appreciation of the interest I had shown in the library since I had taken up office.  In turn, I appreciate their efforts in serving on the board for the past five very difficult years.  They said it was remarkable, against a backdrop of cuts since 2008 and the public service embargo, that the library had delivered significant initiatives, including the digitisation of the 1916 collection and parish records and increased visitor and public engagement levels, both directly and online.  I look forward to working with the new board and its chairman, Mr. Paul Shovlin.  I intend to call the first meeting of the new board in the coming weeks.  Much of the advice provided for me by the outgoing board was related to the need to put in place a board with a range of suitable skills and backgrounds to oversee the operations and strategic focus of the library.  I believe the incoming board will meet that test.</p></speech>

My Department has also been working closely with the newly appointed director of the library, Dr. Sandra Collins, to address its needs in terms of resources and investment.  By working together we intend to begin to address the most pressing needs of the library in the coming years.  The outgoing board stated the building on Kildare Street needed substantial investment and that the Victorian construction gave rise to particular safety concerns as it would not meet modern construction environmental and fire safety standards.  I am very aware of these issues which are a priority.  The final details of the plan will be announced in due course, but I do not have the figure the Deputy sought.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Seamus Heaney exhibition, the Bank of Ireland is making space available to the State for a ten-year period and this will cover the cost of refurbishment.  My Department is working with the library on the final cost of the exhibition.  It is good that this exhibition of Heaney's work will be made available in a particularly good location in the centre of the city.</p></speech>

The matter I raise is the need for supportive care homes to be held by HIQA to separate standards from those for a nursing home.  Those working in supportive care homes welcome the intervention of HIQA and the opportunity to work alongside that organisation.  However, it must be recognised that the model of care is different from that available to people in nursing homes.  I have been working on this matter with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, particularly with reference to the HoIy Ghost supportive care home in Waterford city.  It seems there are more of this type of care facility in the south east than elsewhere in the country.  The Holy Ghost supportive care home is an interesting facility.  It was established under a royal charter granted by King Henry VIII in 1545 to care for the elderly of Waterford.  The buildings are a little younger, but the proud tradition of looking after our older people dates back to those days.</p>  <p>  The Holy Ghost supportive care home depends on the HSE for a small amount of section 39 funding and is also supported through fundraising by the people of Waterford city.  Any increase in funding would be very welcome, but the main issue is the model of supportive care homes which is very different from that for a nursing home.  The aim of the care provided is to reflect a philosophy which encourages independence in a home-like setting.  The staff work to meet the individual needs and preferences of the residents and the facility provides the residents with care assistants, as opposed to nurses, and a range of recreational care services in a homely, yet professional manner, with a plethora of activities, from art to bingo to knitting and crafts, yoga, singalongs, music and supervised trips.  The level of independence of a resident in a supportive care home is very different from that of someone in a continuum of care who may need to progress to a nursing home.</p>  <p>  These facilities are being held up by HIQA to the same, otherwise very welcome and necessary, standards as in a nursing home, but the group is keen to stress that the services it provides are very different.  The supportive care home facility encourages independence in persons who are not ready to move into a nursing home.  These great facilities have the capacity to decrease costs to the health sector owing to the fact that there is no need for nursing staff to be available, relying as they do on care assistants and a skills mix to look after the people who reside in them.</p><p>As I know the Minister of State is acutely aware, many people enter a nursing home too early, at a stage when they could be at home or in a facility such as the Holy Ghost residential home.  The supportive care home model is considerably less expensive and more suited to those who need some help but do not need the intensive care provided in a nursing home.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to look at the supportive care homes and address the issues raised, if she can.  Let us have them assessed using the correct criteria, standardising the model of care.  While this issue may be specific to the south east, the rest of the country may be able to benefit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400029#BB00200"><p>At the Deputy's request, I visited the facility she mentioned.  It is probably a model we should consider for use in the rest of the country as it provides an intermediate piece.  We will need to see how these homes fit into the standards we have set for HIQA.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  All long-term residential services for older people must meet the national quality standards for residential care for older people in Ireland.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continual improvement and monitor safety and quality in Ireland's health and personal social care services.</p>  <p>  In the context of supportive homes, HIQA recognises the necessity for proportionality in how it applies regulatory provisions.  The authority has emphasised that all decisions on compliance in the areas of clinical governance, policy development and skill mix are considered with regard to reasonableness, proportionality, fairness and in the context of the service provided.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy is referring specifically to supportive homes, I am aware that at a wider level there are concerns about the implications of national standards for residential facilities generally.  The Government is committed to ensuring long-term residential services for older people meet the 2009 national quality standards for residential care for older people in Ireland.  The standards and the associated national regulations that underpin them encompass issues relevant to the privacy, dignity and respect of residents and seek to support the provision of a physical environment that meets modern day standards and the needs of vulnerable people living in designated services.</p>  <p>  The Government's recently published capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, commits to a major multiannual programme of capital investment in public and voluntary provided social care facilities.  A total of &euro;300 million in Exchequer funding has been made available, together with further potential to develop projects through public private partnerships.  The shortage of public capital funds in recent years due to the economic crisis has meant a number of publicly provided or voluntary services have not met standard 25 of the national quality standards for residential care for older people in Ireland within the previously stated timeframe of 1 July 2015.  As a result of the capital plan, it is now possible to set a revised policy and outline a revised timeframe for ensuring all public and voluntary services which are currently non-compliant with standard 25 demonstrate compliance to HIQA.</p>  <p>  The revised policy will ensure all services will fully achieve the national standard by the end of the capital plan period in 2021.  In the coming weeks the HSE will submit to HIQA its plans, focused at individual service level, to meet the requirements of standard 25.  The individual plans will be in line with the revised policy timeframe.  They will also detail proposed capital expenditure at each individual centre level.  The HSE will also support relevant voluntary providers with which it has service level agreements in submitting individual plans.  In addressing this issue of non-compliance by some public services, the Minister and I acknowledge the investment and achievements of the independent sectors in recent years in meeting environmental and other standards.  I hope any similar plan for services in the independent sectors will be given consideration by HIQA.</p></speech>

In speaking about supportive care homes the Minister of State used the word "proportionality".  That is exactly what they are looking for.  They want to work in partnership with HIQA and the HSE to ensure this.  It is really significant and will be of huge comfort to many older people in public nursing homes and their families.  There was a cloud hanging over them in not being compliant with HIQA requirements.  It is welcome that the Minister of State has stated &euro;300 million will be made available to ensure all public nursing homes will be compliant.  There has been an ongoing campaign by many people in Waterford to ensure St. Patrick's Hospital will continue to look after older people who need that level of care.  It will be quality compliant, which is what older citizens deserve.  To hear that money is being made available lifts a huge burden from the residents in these public nursing homes and their families.  I eagerly await publication of the HSE's plans as to how it will use the &euro;300 million that has been made available.</p></speech>

It is Government policy and HIQA does it very well.  It is usually the last line of defence in looking after very vulnerable people.  We need to look at the different types of care available.  The care homes in the Deputy's area are delivering a different type of care that is not overly medicated and does not have a medical model attached to it; it is more of a social model.  We are going to have to look at how we tweak these things.  We have to ensure people are safe and that the service they receive is of a particular standard.  Nevertheless, they are different from long-stay nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The reason the &euro;300 million for public nursing homes has been mentioned today is that we are close to concluding our talks.  There is more to be done in terms of how we are going to manage it in the timeframe of the capital programme.  The Deputy has mentioned public nursing homes that are very worried that they are not going to meet registration qualification requirements and, therefore, could be put on notice that they would have to close beds or would not be able to admit more residents.  It is very good news for them that we will now have a plan to ensure they will all meet the criteria in order to be registered by HIQA in the timeframe up to 2021.  That is genuinely very good news for them.  It has taken a lot of work, in which many people have been involved.  I am glad that it is bearing fruit and that the plan will be published very shortly.</p></speech>

They include cuts to illness benefit, the diet supplement scheme and the fuel allowance scheme.  I was dealing with the fuel allowance and the household benefits package when the debate was adjourned.  The Government cut these schemes, affecting some of the poorest households, including the elderly and people with a disability who depend on the fuel allowance to heat their homes.  The payment period was cut by six weeks, amounting to a reduction of &euro;120.</p><p>Even with the increase that was announced, because the weeks have not been reinstated, it still leaves those who depend on the fuel allowance at a loss of &euro;54.50 on the payment made prior to the Government coming into office.  Let us not forget that in addition, a water charge and property tax were heaped on many of the same people, pensioners who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and who should be able to have some comfort in their twilight years instead of having to choose between heating their homes or feeding themselves.  Many of those who pay the property tax have already paid several times over, in particular those who paid significant amounts in stamp duty.  In addition, there are water charges.  As if that was not enough, the Minister also cut the electricity and gas components of the household benefits package for pensioners by 25% and 20%, respectively, at a time when fuel prices were rising.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not only abolish the water charge and the property tax but we would also increase the fuel allowance by the full six weeks over a period of two years.</p> <p> The telephone allowance was abolished when the Government took &euro;271 from the annual budgets of people over 70 years of age and ensured that vulnerable older people, especially in rural areas, had to beg, borrow and scrimp to keep up the payments on the panic alarms they had got.  However, that is not just a rural phenomenon as panic alarms do not just relate to anti-social behaviour or criminals trying to break in, they also give people peace of mind that if they fall they will have a connection to an open phone line.  That was a poor show by the Government.</p> <p> The State old age pension was, in effect, cut by 16% when one takes into account the increase in age from 65 to 68 years.  In addition, by introducing new pension rate bands, thousands of people, especially women, will find they are entitled to a smaller pension than they had anticipated when they come to retire because they had based their calculations on a previous system.  For the Minister to give them a miserly &euro;3 extra a week after years of ignoring them adds insult to injury.  This is an attempt by the Government to buy the grey vote coming up to the election.  That group, perhaps more than most, very clearly understands how their vote works and they will not be bought by less than the cost of a cup of coffee in Starbucks.  They are not stupid and they will not be fooled by empty promises.</p> <p> The respite care grant was also cut.  At the time I condemned and opposed the cut.  While I welcome that the full rate is now being reintroduced, for many it was a cut too far and the change is a little too late.  The initial cut of &euro;350 to respite care undermined the contribution of carers to society.  I accept that in most cases the grant was not spent on respite care and that it acted as a support payment to allow people to pay for expenses such as car insurance or to buy extra fuel as the fuel allowance only covers a certain number of weeks in a year but in many cases where a person is bedridden or stationary one must heat the home continuously at a high temperature.  The extra money was less for the benefit of the carer than the caree.</p> <p> I welcome the extension of the payment from six to 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for as it recognises the fact that the carer is in many ways out of touch with the jobs market.  I have asked for other considerations to be taken into account in the future in terms of the job activation scheme or other training schemes to allow carers to keep up their skills at least for a few hours each week.  If one has been caring for a parent for ten or 15 years one will be out of touch with the workplace and in many cases it would be very difficult to re-engage at the same level at which one operated when one gave up work.  The cut to the bereavement grant was one of the meanest cuts of all.  I still do not understand the logic behind it.</p> <p> The rent and mortgage interest supplement schemes were also cut by the Government.  The contribution of tenants was hiked.  Maximum thresholds for rent supplement in most parts of Dublin are too low to secure accommodation.  In some ways there is a recognition by the Department that the figure is not realistic given the somewhat under-the-counter manoeuvres it makes to pay a higher rent and keep people in rented accommodation.  The problem we now face is that people cannot get the accommodation in the first place.  People are under threat as landlords who increase the rent are being protected to some degree.  Very few so far have managed to benefit from it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, appears to be saying it is 4,600 to date, whereas there are 100,000 in the scheme.  I would welcome if the number of those who have been helped is higher but it does not address the fact that the problem we face in Dublin city in particular is that people find it impossible to even find somewhere to rent in the first place let alone the difficulty of paying the rent on an ongoing basis.  People cannot even come up with a deposit anymore. </p> <p> The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was cut in three budgets in a row, reducing it by a total of &euro;100 and, in addition, restrictions were introduced in terms of the number of eligible children.  Despite the pre-election promises made by the Labour Party, child benefit was cut severely, not just in terms of the &euro;10 cut but beyond it.  In the past two budgets the payment was restored to many beneficiaries but those with more than four children were cut by more than &euro;10 and their payments have not been reinstated.  I do not know whether that is the Government&rsquo;s intention but it has still cut the payment by too much.</p> <p> Instead of tackling excessive pay and pensions at the top, the Government chose to break its oft repeated promise to protect core social welfare rates.  It did cut jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, maternity benefit and the invalidity pension because all of those payments were subject to reductions in the eligibility criteria.  The Government shortened the payment period for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit by three months which amounts to a cut of 25% and in some cases up to 33% in the core weekly payment.  The number of months in which a person is entitled to gain jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit has been reduced and a person will not necessarily go onto jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at the top rate if his or her partner is working.</p> <p> There were also cuts to maternity benefit.  First, it was taxed and then it was cut.  The majority of maternity benefit recipients now see their weekly payment cut by &euro;32.  Over the full six-month leave period, that is a cut of &euro;832, which is a substantial one for mothers with young babies.</p><p>For many new mothers, the maternity benefit was and is the only income during that time and for those mothers who are fortunate enough to have their maternity benefits supplemented by their employers, the cumulative impact of the Government's benefit cut and the tax measure has seen their payments shrink by up to &euro;128.  There is a potential loss of up to &euro;3,276 to new mothers.  I have welcomed the new proposal on paternity benefit which is something for which Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for years and which was included in its pre-budget submission.</p> <p> In addition, I welcome the proposed amendment that will address the exclusion of credit unions from the household budgeting scheme.  Members have discussed this issue previously and I hope this will address the so-called Lough payment and so on.  This is where credit unions in the past gave payments for mobile homes which could then be deducted from social welfare payments.  It was an inadvertent result of excluding credit unions in the past and, hopefully, this issue will be addressed.  It is something for which the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the credit union movement had argued and I presume the new amendment will allow credit unions to be part of the household budgeting scheme.  Consequently, it will allow them to-----</p></speech>

Given recent events, it is important that this message is sent out.</p>  <p>  There is a lot more to discuss but I will deal with some of the Bill's particular elements in committee.  One restriction I always find to be highly frustrating at this time of year when dealing with a social welfare Bill is that neither I nor any other Opposition Member can table amendments that constitute a charge on the Exchequer or on the public.  This greatly limits what Opposition Members can do, whether it is negative from the Government's perspective or positive, it makes it difficult for them.  I will try my best to frame the amendments in such a way that they will bypass the restrictions in order that Members can have a proper debate on many of the other issues that should have been in the Bill.</p></speech>

There has been much spin about what has not been done in social welfare in that one has been told that core rates of social welfare were not cut in the context of some things that happened, particularly at the early stages of this Government.  This, of course, is not true and the previous speaker has made this point.  There was a cut in respect of those under the age of 25 and similarly, the duration of jobseeker's benefit has been cut to nine months.  Moreover, child benefit, which is a pretty basic social welfare payment, has been cut despite the Tesco advertisement and the assurances that it would not be.  While there has been a modest restoration of that benefit, which is welcome, it does not restore it to its previous levels.  One should call this out for what it is in respect of the spin that was presented.</p>  <p>  Some of the other items are not so easy to describe, such as the ongoing reviews, which I understand the Department is obliged to carry out.  However, I refer to the number of reviews of people in receipt of invalidity pensions who had thought there was a degree of certainty about their payments.  I cannot count the number of such reviews I have encountered in which people were told they were fit for work as they could answer a telephone.  Some people could barely walk and one man I met could barely talk due to respiratory failure but he was told he could answer a telephone.  These were the kind of cases that were represented as people claiming benefits for which they may not have been entitled.</p>  <p>  However, when one examines matters structurally, lone parents have been singularly selected.  While it is welcome that people return to work, the nonsense that was spun about the Scandinavian model of child care prior to the insistence on that scheme being introduced really caused a great deal of understandable upset.  Similarly, in respect of pensions, people now are beginning to receive reduced pensions where there was no expectation that this would be the case.  It is because of the manner in which pensions are calculated on the basis of the very first time somebody worked, perhaps as a teenager with a part-time job, and this is calculated over a person's lifetime.  I have seen these cases so the Minister of State should not tell me this is not happening because I know it is.</p></speech>

In some cases, this involves people who had been working for decades.  If the Minister of State wishes to see some of those cases, I will send him the details.</p>  <p>  However, the area of greatest difficulty has been the head-in-the-sand approach to rent assistance levels.  I remember being beside Deputy Joan Collins when raising the issue about how out of kilter they were with market rents, as well as being beside her when she raised the same issue.  This was not last month or last year; it was two and three years ago when people were coming through the system and were struggling to find accommodation because the rent assistance levels were far below market rent.  The response of the Minister for Social Protection was almost exclusively to state it was a supply-side issue while at the same time, the Government did nothing about the supply of housing.  Consequently, that supply-side issue and the resistance to changing those rent caps in any meaningful way has meant this situation has worsened substantially.  We now face a crisis that is of a scale that will be incredibly difficult to deal with in the short term.  I am quite certain the Minister of State is meeting people in his clinic who are presenting with precisely the same set of problems they are raising with me.  Essentially, this was a matter that was foreseeable, predictable and about which something could have been done.  If one considers the package of social welfare measures over the past five years, this has been the single greatest failure.</p></speech>

I intend to vote against this Bill, not because of opposition for the sake of opposition - I disagree absolutely with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, in this regard - but because the Government has just produced its fifth regressive budget in a row.  By regressive, I mean yet another budget that favours the well-off, as opposed to those on the lowest incomes.  In her contribution, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, stated this budget was carefully designed and it certainly was.  It was carefully designed to try to win votes but it will not work and certainly will not save the Labour Party's bacon.  The people the Labour Party claims to have protected while in government cannot wait for Labour Party Members to come knocking on their doors next spring or whenever the election is called.  Those people are not waiting to thank them for all they have done for them but are waiting to give them the electoral kicking of all kickings and they could not deserve it more.</p>  <p>  I wish to concentrate on the issue of core welfare payments, such as jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, the one-parent-family parent payment and disability benefit.  These are the key welfare payments provided by the State.  They were reduced drastically between 2009 and 2011-12 and have been frozen since then.  To restore these core welfare payments to their 2009 level, taking account of inflation, would require an increase of at least &euro;27 per week for a single adult and &euro;40 per week for a couple.  This makes a joke of the Government's repeated claim to have protected core welfare payments, quite apart from the range of cuts it has made in non-core payments.</p><p>The reality of budget 2016 is that a single unemployed adult will gain &euro;95 per annum, while a single person earning &euro;75,000 per annum will gain &euro;902.  An unemployed couple will gain &euro;157 per annum, while a couple jointly earning &euro;125,000 per annum will gain &euro;1,400 per annum.  </p> <p> The number of people living in consistent poverty which currently stands at 376,000 has doubled since 2008, while 1.4 million people are experiencing deprivation, an increase of 128% since 2008.  There are 700,000 people at risk of poverty, including 211,000 children, which equates to one in six children.  In other words, there is widespread endurance of poverty.  For the Government to have done nothing in the Bill in terms of increases in core welfare payments is an utter disgrace.  For example, repayment of half of what was lost owing to inflation would have meant an increase of &euro;6.50 per week.  This could have been done as part of a commitment to restore rates to 2011 levels, consistent with inflation, with a further commitment to restore rates to their 2009 levels over a number of years.  However, the Government chose not do this.</p> <p> Other factors in the high poverty rates are low pay and insufficient working hours.  Taking into account those who are out of work and those who want and need additional hours, the unemployment rate is 20%.  Approximately 80,000 people living in or at risk of poverty are in employment.  The 50 cent increase in the minimum wage is extremely limited.  A minimum wage of &euro;9.15 per hour is 25% below the proposed living wage of &euro;11.50.  Again, the Government should have committed to increasing the minimum wage to the level of the living wage over a number of years.  This would have meant an increase of at least &euro;1 per hour this year, followed by a similar increase next year and the year after.</p> <p> Overall, in terms of the provision of good public services, a health service that works and a strong social security safety net, the Government has continued the failed approach of the past.  In 2016 Ireland will spend one of the smallest shares of national income of any developed country, with only the United States spending less.  However, this is nothing new.  Between 1995 and 2000 the percentage of GNP spent on public services fell dramatically to 36%.  This model of low pay, low income taxes, low corporation taxes and resulting poor social services, including a crisis-riven health service, has been imposed by successive Governments.  Nobody voted for it.  Out of this will come a new political movement that will offer a real alternative.  </p> <p> Child care payments have also been drastically reduced in the past few years, despite a commitment from the Labour Party that such payments would not be touched.  I recently tabled a question to the Minister on the reintroduction of child benefit for children who continued in education up to 19 years of age.  This measure would have cost &euro;58 million.  However, the Government chose not to address the issue.</p></speech>

Rather than being titled the Social Welfare Bill it should be titled the corporate welfare Bill because that is what social protection has become in this country.  Rather than it being a necessary safety valve for citizens when they fall on hard times or find themselves out of work, it is a vehicle to transfer wealth and line the pockets of big business, in part, through the facilitation of labour activation schemes which have given rise to an almighty race to the bottom.</p><p>I want to read an email I received from a constituent which really struck a chord with me.  The catalyst for it was the protestations of the Taoiseach and his Government that a recovery was under way; that we had all taken great strides forward; that the number of people unemployed had fallen and that we should all be proud of what we had achieved.  The man is sickened by the impact of what the Government has done on his health and it led him to compose the following email.  It reads:</p><blockquote>I've done what these people and their kind have told me to do for the last 15 years, I'm no better off now than I was then: in fact, in terms of my mental health and general demeanour, I'm decidedly worse off.<br /><br />The Establishment told me to get an education.  I asked what I should do.  They advised me to do what I was good at.  I am good at philosophy ... I got a first class degree and Masters in philosophy.  The goal posts then changed.  I was told that employers didn't want philosophers and that I needed to add more strings to my bow.  I told them I had no money.  They said I should take the dole for a few weeks and then do a Jobbridge Internship.  And that's what I did, winding up in a policy section of a Government Department where I produced tightly argued papers that recommended scheme changes that I knew to be wrong - all for the princely sum of &euro;200 per week and no PRSI contributions.  The Establishment seemed happy, but not happy enough to give me a job.  Well, it couldn't given the recruitment embargo.</blockquote><p>The email continues:</p><blockquote>I was told to hold tight for some temporary clerical work ... In the meantime, they tricked up another internship that saw me at the front-line.  I was told I couldn't be soft and would have to treat the customers hard.  Of course, they did not put it that frankly but still the message was clear: the customers, all of the customers are chancers and must be treated accordingly.  <br /><br />I then got moved to a section in a different Department, the job in question being slightly more humane.  I was then told I could maybe hang on for another temporary job.  At that stage, I'd had enough.  I walked out of the Department and the Jobbridge scheme and into a zero-hour contract with an English language school.</blockquote><p>This is the Ireland the Government has created.  That is the process it has facilitated with its misnamed social welfare system which has resulted in millions being taken out of a budget that should be in place to support people rather than facilitate employers to not offer decent jobs.  Advertisements have been placed for qualified veterinarians, teachers in private schools, qualified chemists, medical scientists in the HSE, shelf stackers in Tesco, administrators in the Department of Health, social media administrators in RTE and kit assistants in the FAI.  That is what we are talking about in the context of labour and job creation.  Hundreds of under-employed and short-term working teachers have to rely on the social protection budget to obtain a decent working week's wages.  Casual and part-time work is utter lunacy.  It is facilitating a transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to those at the top.  </p><p>The Minister's reference to the maintenance of core social welfare rates is an insult against the backdrop of rising inflation and the appalling inaction of the Government in its failure to deal with the glaring disconnect between rent supplement payments and the actual cost of renting.  The current rent supplement for a single person is &euro;520 per month and for a couple, &euro;750 per month, despite the fact that the cost of renting a two bedroom property in the city is &euro;1,700 per month.  How are people supposed to make up the deficit?  They cannot do it.  In 2010 alone, the Department of Health transferred, by way of rent supplement, &euro;2.5 billion of taxpayers' money into the pockets of private landlords.  That is what the Government has stood over.  The Social Welfare Bill does not tackle any of these structural injustices that are now built into the system.</p><p>The Government has given pensioners a pittance of an increase and at the same time robbed those in private pension schemes.  The Bill is a joke and the people will see through it.  It is scandalous that it is being put forward under the stewardship of the Labour Party in government.</p></speech>

The small give-backs, including the &euro;3 increase in pensions and the &euro;5 per month increase in child benefit, are pathetic, given that rates have been frozen for the past four years and that the groups hit most have been the victims of other cuts in so-called non-core social welfare protections and payments.</p>  <p>  There are many people who, against a background of spiralling levels of poverty and deprivation, received nothing in the so-called "give-back" budget, including widowers, those in receipt of invalidity pension, carers, people with disabilities, jobseekers and carers under 66 years of age.</p><p>There is nothing in it for people with a disability, for the one-parent family payment, for the deserted wives' allowance or for the supplementary welfare allowance.  There is no increase in the living alone allowance.  All the people in those groups who have had their incomes slashed and battered with cuts and austerity and who have had their core payments frozen or cut over the past four or five years get absolutely nothing back.  It is that which puts us in a situation where we have doubled the number of people living in consistent poverty to 376,000, where 1.4 million of our population, which is an increase of 128%, are suffering deprivation and where 211,000 children are living at risk of poverty or in poverty.</p> <p> All those situations have deteriorated or, in many cases, are still deteriorating because of the biggest failure of all of this Government, which is its failure to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis.  That crisis has resulted from the Government parties' decision to reduce social housing provision from the trickle that it was under Fianna F&aacute;il, which had already generated a crisis, to stop it all together in the first year they were in government.  They ceased the building of social housing and compounded that by slashing rent allowance in 2012 and that has led directly to the homelessness and housing catastrophe we have now, which is getting worse on a daily basis.</p> <p> Let us consider the rates of rent allowance, on which the Minister, Deputy Burton, refuses to budge.  The rent allowance for a single person, under the rent allowance scheme, is &euro;520 per month, for a couple, it is &euro;750 per month, for a couple with one child, it is &euro;950 per month, for a couple with two children, it is &euro;975 per month and for a couple with three children, it is &euro;1,000 per month.  Where on this planet, not to mind in Dublin where rents have gone up by about 16% in the past two years, would one find accommodation for those amounts?  It simply does not exist.  We begged the Minister to increase those rent allowance thresholds or even to give real flexibility, but it is not happening.  </p> <p> The Minister may have heard on the news about a man, with whom I was dealing, who was living in a tent on the beach.  He has now moved out of the tent but he may be back living in it after only moving out of it two weeks ago because the Department is still refusing to sanction rent allowance for him.  The Minister will be getting an e-mail from me begging for this money to be sanctioned, otherwise that man will end up back living in a tent along with seven other people who are living in tents on Killiney beach, and that is only the tip of the iceberg.  When is the Minister going to stop giving tax breaks to the multinationals in this country and start giving some real protection to the people who are homeless, who are without houses and who are suffering poverty and deprivation?</p></speech>

Some 160,000 people have turned 65 since the recessionary 2009 budget and yet since then the telephone allowance has been abolished, the fuel allowance season has been cut by six weeks and the household benefits package has been reduced to a single rate.</p>  <p>  The cutting off of the telephone allowance in recent years has been a very serious development, particularly for people in rural Ireland.  It has forced thousands of pensioners to remove their vital landline service.  The community alarm mechanism is connected to the landline phone.  With the ongoing continuing wave of rural crime, the alarm system is of the utmost importance for the safety, well-being and security of our senior citizens.  In many cases, those people are worried, live in fear and have sleepless nights and that is having an affect on their health and well-being.  That is not satisfactory, given that they have contributed to the State and have been very good citizens.  They should not be forced to live under these conditions without proper security alarm systems.  They are in danger of assault, not to mind in danger of criminals breaking into their homes and taking their valuables.  This is a particular concern as we face into the winter, with the long winter nights providing cover for those marauders who prowl round the country.  I urge the Minister to amend this Bill to reinstate the telephone allowance.  Some increase could also be made to the fuel allowance.  Statistics show that Irish telephone costs are the sixth highest in Europe.  The alternative to the landline is the mobile phone, which is not the answer, having regard to the intermittent coverage in my county of Kerry.  Half of the county is a blackspot for mobile phone coverage.  Therefore, people cannot rely on such coverage to contact the outside world.</p>  <p>  Another issue is the prescription charges.  Many older people are crippled by the imposition of prescription charges.  They are a direct tax on our sick and the Government has done nothing to rectify that.  A person living on the State pension is down &euro;700 since 2008 in allowances and benefits and that is without taking account of the rising cost of living increases, charges and general taxes.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the number of people living in consistent poverty, according to the most recent Central Statistics Office figures, the number has doubled since 2008.  It is estimated that the number is now a staggering 376,000 people with an estimated 1.4 million people suffering deprivation since 2008.  Overall, 700,000 people are at risk of poverty and of that number, unfortunately, 210,000 are children.  </p>  <p>  There has been a comprehensive analysis of this budget across the political spectrum but one consistent point has been made, namely, that this is the fifth regressive budget in a row.  In saying it is regressive, I refer to the fact that there was more for the better off in our society than those at the bottom.  A simple example that highlights that is the fact that a single person earning &euro;75,000 a year is more than &euro;900 better off while a single unemployed person is better off by &euro;95.  Unfortunately, this is widening the gap and it is very wrong.</p></speech>

It takes some doing by the Labour Party to stand over five budgets throughout the course of a crisis that managed to increase the gap between rich and poor and, in reality, increase the gap between the rich and the rest and transfer wealth to those at the top of our society.  The Government is obviously very keen to sell this Social Welfare Bill and sell this budget as a recovery budget, one that is sensible and one that will deliver stability.  The truth of the matter is that it delivers stability and recovery for those for whom there already was recovery, those at the very top of our society, the bondholders, the big corporations and the wealthiest who have managed to increase their wealth by more than 60%, the richest 300 people in our society between 2010 and 2014.  For the rest, the majority, all those who have struggled throughout the course of the crisis with job losses, precarity, low pay, poverty and homelessness, this budget offers almost nothing and will not deliver a real recovery for the majority.  This budget increases the rich-poor gap in Ireland by an incredible &euro;506 a year.  According to Social Justice Ireland, over the past two budgets, the gap has been increased by over &euro;1,000.  It comes at a time when the Government is crowing about a full-blown recovery but the figures illustrate who the recovery is currently benefiting and why a majority in opinion polls consistently say they do not feel it.</p><p>What people have got at most is crumbs off the table, delivered by a petrified Labour Party looking at the prospect of a coming election.  The reality is that people are sitting under the burden of cumulative austerity of over &euro;100 billion in cuts.  In this budget, however, &euro;1.5 billion is presented as some sort of giveaway.  Unfortunately, it is treated by elements of the Opposition as a giveaway too, when in reality it is nothing of the sort.  No real giveaway has been given to those who carried the heaviest burden of austerity and continue to carry it.</p> <p> Instead, what we have is an insult to most people.  There is a &euro;3 increase for pensioners.  While any increase is better than nothing, it is measly and is rightly perceived by pensioners as such.  The increase of child benefit of &euro;5 is, again, better than nothing, but it will not bring the payment back to pre-crisis levels or even to the same level when this Government came to power.  It shows how out of touch with the majority the Government has become, in particular the Labour Party, if it thinks it can sell this as a real recovery for ordinary people.  Those who get these extra &euro;3 and &euro;5 increases know it will be wiped out if they choose to pay their water charges.  Thankfully, the majority continue not to pay their water charges.  These increases will also be wiped out by rent hikes and property tax.</p> <p> The aim of these increases is obvious, of course.  It is to save the skin of the Labour Party as it faces electoral oblivion.  However, it will not work because it cannot wipe out the devastation of austerity measures over which the Labour Party has stood.  It has created a nightmare situation where 376,000 people live in consistent poverty, twice what it was in 2008.  Up to 1.4 million people experience deprivation, an incredible increase of 108% since 2008.  Up to 211,000 children, one in six, live at risk of poverty, along with one in ten pensioners.  Those people are in poverty because this Government, as well as the previous Government, chose to inflict cuts on working people and on the poorest in society rather than tax the rich or wealthy.  That was all the time while saying it was making the hard choices.  In reality, the Government made the easy choices which was to protect the Apples, Starbucks and Googles, while going after the most vulnerable.</p> <p> Unfortunately for the Labour Party, this Social Welfare Bill will not save it.  Above all, there is what is not contained in the Bill.  There has been a refusal to reverse the cuts in rent allowance.  The leading housing agencies have said the number one cause in the rise of homelessness is the cut in rent allowance.  That is empirically felt by anybody who has been contacted by those who are homeless.  For weeks, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has spoken about bringing in rent certainty.  Once again, however, Fine Gael has beaten the Labour Party into submission rather than take on the vested interests of landlords or of the market.  That is no real surprise, however, when 41 Deputies are landlords.</p> <p> The Labour Party has stood over and implemented policies in social welfare that saw payment upon payment slashed.  It stood over the introduction of forced free labour through JobBridge and Gateway.  It stood over using emigration as a policy to deal with the unemployment crisis.  This budget and the Social Welfare Bill do nothing to change any of that.  Rather, they copper-fasten the recovery for the rich and big business.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400034#GG00300"><p>I welcome this debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2015.  This is our fifth social welfare Bill in government.  The first three of these were particularly difficult, with hard decisions that had to be made and, unfortunately, cuts that had to be implemented.  This is the first opportunity we have to reverse those cuts and give back to people.  It is not by accident that we are now in a position to do so.  It is not an accident that the economy is growing and creating jobs with people leaving jobseeker payments which allows us invest that money in other social welfare benefits.  This is due to the work and decisions of the Government and the sacrifices made by the people.  There are still sacrifices, however, as long as we are still correcting the books.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a welcome improvement.  Budget 2016 contains &euro;770 million of new spending measures, of which the Government has allocated &euro;251 million to social protection, almost &euro;1 out of every extra &euro;3 the Government will spend in 2016.  The total budget allocation to the Department of Social Protection for 2016 is &euro;19.6 billion, over 38% of all government spending.  In effect, &euro;2 out of every &euro;5 that the Government will spend in 2016 will be on social protection schemes and programmes.  This figure is in keeping with the budgets of the past several years.  It is a colossal sum of money, representing a substantial investment in society.</p>  <p>  It is important to keep in mind the purpose of social welfare is to act as a safety net for all.  Most of us will, at some stage in our lives, benefit from the social welfare system.  It is important that it is in place and is properly funded.  The social welfare system supports the most vulnerable in society and enables people to participate in it.  The social welfare system does not operate in a vacuum.  The system depends on the overall management of the economy to provide the funding necessary for the support schemes and programmes.  The country cannot spend indefinitely what it does not have.  Borrowing will only last as long it is sustainable.  The aim over the past number of budgets, framed in an extraordinarily challenging and difficult time for our country, has been to protect core rates of payments, while ensuring the continuation of supports for the million and more citizens who depend on the Department.</p>  <p>  It is a clich&eacute; but it costs money just to stand still.  Demographic pressures will drive up the allocation needed just to continue with existing supports and schemes.  This can be seen from the State pension schemes.  In a decade, the number of recipients of the contributory pension has effectively trebled.  In 2005, there were 156,000 recipients, while in 2014, there were 417,000 recipients.</p>  <p>  These democratic pressures add extra costs not just to the Department of Social Protection but other services such as education.  Increases in the population with high birth rates equate to a much increased budget necessary for child benefit payments.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients have almost doubled in the past ten years from 48,000 in 2005 to almost 95,000 in 2014.  Carers perform essential work and should be supported by the State.  The restoration of the carer&rsquo;s support grant is one of the most welcome measures in budget 2016.</p>  <p>  These figures exemplify the growing demands on the social protection budget.  The system, however, cannot stand still.  Society changes as do the needs of the people.  The best time to reform the social welfare system is when fewer people depend on it.  There was an opportunity for reform in the late 1990s and early 2000s when our country had a budget surplus.  That opportunity was missed and it has fallen to this Government and the current Minister to focus on reform in the context of fewer resources.  Specific issues include the focus on identifying and eliminating welfare traps.</p>  <p>  For example, the introduction of the housing assistance payment, unlike the rent supplement scheme, allows recipients to maintain portions of the payment for that crucial time after starting a new job.  However, following a meeting with the management of Galway City Council last Friday, I learned delivering the scheme there will cost an additional &euro;300,000.  This is a concern for this local authority as it is dealing with budget cutbacks and 83% of the cost of running the council is borne locally rather than by central government.</p>  <p>  Providing greater support for the transition to the workplace is another welfare reform.  The back to work family dividend, an excellent budget provision from several years ago, enables a person to manage better with the continued payment of the child portions of the social welfare payment.  Properly prepared and thought through measures are necessary.  Previous Governments introduced increases in existing payments and entirely new payments without putting in place a sustainable funding basis.  When the crash came and their economic mismanagement caught up with them, major cuts were put in place.  Some schemes were cut not once but twice, while others were scrapped altogether.  The measures in this Social Welfare Bill and the absence of round numbers, namely, the &euro;3 increase in the pension and the &euro;2.50 increase in fuel allowance, demonstrate the responsible, prudent and sensible approach being taken by the Minister and the Government.  The restoration of 75% of the Christmas bonus is a measure which will not only benefit the recipients but also local businesses and local economies in every community across the country.</p><p>We have the continuation of innovative schemes such as JobsPlus, which is directly helping people get back to work, and the maintenance of and increase in the payment for participants in community employment schemes.  The rural social scheme, Gateway, T&uacute;s and other schemes are all important and help people to participate in, and contribute to, communities across the country.</p> <p> There is a need, however, to examine flexibility in these schemes.  A graduate might be underemployed and working in the local corner shop and awaiting a job commensurate with his or her qualifications.  As this person is not signing on, he or she is not able to join certain training schemes.  Those individuals do not want to sign on and want to work and contribute.  They do not want to draw from the State but, at the same time, they are being penalised.  We need to examine the possibility of introducing greater flexibility to such schemes.  I hope the next Government will be able to examine this possibility more closely as the country's finances improve.</p> <p> Financial independence through work is the best support that can be given.  With an election on the horizon, a raft of promises will be made.  We must ask how these promises will be paid for and managed.  When we hear people say this is a derisory amount of money, as has been said by others in this House, we have to ask where do these people think the money is going to come from.  It is important that all parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, highlight exactly how they intend to fund the extra promises made. </p> <p> The emphasis of the Government on job creation and support for people in work enables us to invest further in welfare reform and provide targeted, sensible and responsible spending increases for pensioners, working families and vulnerable groups.  </p> <p> I welcome the basis of this budget and that we are in this position.  When we debated the Social Welfare Bill at the end of 2011, we were dealing with cuts and the scrapping of schemes.  We are in a very different era now to where we were then, and that is not by accident.  I commend the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and the Government for their work in this regard.  This situation has not arisen by accident.  I acknowledge the sacrifices made by the Irish people.  There is no shortage of things on which we can spend money.  Within social welfare, there is no shortage of worthy recipients.  As the economy continues to grow and improve, we will continue to invest in those who are most vulnerable in our society and need the support.</p> <p> We will also continue to ensure that we do not have situations whereby people are better off on the dole.  A start has been made in the preschool allowance from next September.  Many individuals must decide if it is worth going back to work given the cost of child care and costs associated with travelling to work.  We need to ensure we incentivise work in as many ways as possible.  I welcome the back to work divided introduced last year by the Minister and will welcome any other initiatives that will make work pay more than being on the dole.  At the same time, social protection is a much needed safety for people.  Therefore, the Bill is hugely important.  A huge amount of money is being spent.  We welcome the increases for this year's budget and hope that as the economy improves, we will not need to spend as much on social protection for job seekers and will be able to spend the money on other worthy initiatives. </p></speech>

I join with him and others in welcoming the measures contained in the Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy Kyne has outlined a few of those measures and I wish to refer to a couple of them in particular.  One of the most difficult cuts and, if I am to be perfectly honest, probably one of the biggest errors the Government made was the decision approximately three budgets ago to reduce the respite care grant.  It was a decision made in difficult times to try to make the figures balance.  I welcome the fact the grant is being restored to its previous level.  I thank the Minister of State and his senior colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, for that restoration.  Carers make an extraordinary contribution to society.  As well as saving the State billions of euro annually, they are looking after their loved ones, which in most cases is what people want to do if they are in a position to do it.  The restoration of the respite grant to its previous level is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The initiative in the legislation to extend the period for which carer's allowance is paid after, for instance, the person who was being cared for has passed away from six weeks to 12 weeks, is to be welcomed.  Ongoing expenses after someone has passed away are a fact of life and this is, therefore, a welcome initiative.  I also agree with Deputy Kyne on the Christmas bonus.  There has been a 75% restoration of the Christmas bonus and that is also welcome. </p>  <p>  Members of the Opposition said the announcement in the budget of a &euro;3 increase in the State pension rate was not enough.  In an ideal world, we would like to increase it by more but it is a step in the right direction and an acknowledgement from the Government that pensioners living on fixed incomes and who have had to endure hardships over the past seven or eight years since the downturn in the economy should see some return.  I, therefore, welcome that increase too.  </p>  <p>  I agree with the point Deputy Kyne made on the back to education scheme and certain difficulties, although that might be the wrong word, concerning the way it operates in practice.  Now that we are moving into a time when the Exchequer will have a little more in terms of resources, the adjustment that he referred to in that regard could be made. </p>  <p>  It was interesting to listen to some of the previous speakers from the Opposition who have decried the Bill but none of them, from what I have heard, has offered any indication as to where the money for the increased expenditure they wish for in the social welfare budget would come from.  Usually those on the left, the hard left or the far left in Irish politics would say we should tax the wealthy.  Our taxation system has been judged independently by the OECD to be the most progressive in the OECD.  I am referring to income tax and the universal social charge.  The top 17% of earners pay more than 80% of the total universal social charge and income tax collected annually.  This country has a significantly progressive personal income taxation system.  If members of the Opposition want to give wish lists in this House on where spending should be increased, it behoves them to give some indication of where the money for those increases might come from.  I would welcome such an approach as being a more realistic contribution to the debate. </p>  <p>  The reason the budget, as presented, and the Social Welfare Bill are positive for the first time in many years is the economic situation has improved.  People have made many sacrifices and it is only right that some of those who have made sacrifices and are in receipt of social protection payments should see a marginal improvement in many of those social protection schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/988" speakername="&Aacute;ine Collins" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400035#HH00300"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  In coming into power nearly five years ago, this Government promised it would maintain basic rates in social welfare.  This promise has been largely fulfilled despite the fact that we entered government during the most difficult economic times since the foundation of the State.  It is worthwhile to remind ourselves that at that time the State finances were badly broken.  As we all know, the troika were in town and exploring the possibility of our having to exit the euro.</p><p>Portugal and Greece were in a similar situation and many of their social welfare payments have been cut by up to 50%, particularly in Greece which continues to be in crisis five years on.  That is very unfortunate for the Greek people and it is compounded by poor political decisions in Greece.  In comparison, the Government here maintained basic social welfare rates during that period and continues to do so.  Both it and the people faced up to the their problems and pursued an economic policy that concentrated on job creation as the best way of reducing poverty.  The Minister, in the most recent budget, is now in a position to begin the process of increasing social welfare payments.</p> <p> Job creation remains a priority for the Government, as it wants every family to feel the recovery.  Thankfully, it maintained a massively strong social welfare safety net throughout the financial crisis.  Our welfare safety net is among the best in Europe, as the evidence proves.  Now that the recovery is under way, the safety net can be strengthened for the most vulnerable in society, while at the same time expanding measures to help jobseekers to get back to work.  From a social and economic perspective, having a job is the most important way to increase a family's values and outlook.</p> <p> The Bill will give effect to statutory schemes that can only be implemented by way of primary legislation.  It provides for an increase in the monthly rate of child benefit to &euro;140 from January 2016, an increase of &euro;3 in the weekly pension for pensioners and carers aged 66 years and over and an increase of &euro;2 for an adult dependant aged under 66 years and &euro;2.70 for an adult dependant aged 66 years and over.  We are all delighted to see the new carer's support grant being increased.  It replaces the respite care grant.  We are all aware of the great work carers do in minding their families and allowing people to remain in their homes.  There will be an increase of &euro;5 per week in the family income supplement thresholds for families with one child and &euro;10 for those with two or more children.  There are also changes in PRSI rates to benefit lower income families.  Separately, the T&aacute;naiste will move a regulation in the coming weeks to provide for a Christmas bonus of 75%, which will be paid in the first week of December.</p> <p> While these increases are modest and prudent, they give confidence to the more dependent section of society that the worst of the financial crisis is over and that the fear of future economic hardship has eased.  These measures, combined with the increase in employment figures, the equalisation of taxation between the self-employed and PAYE workers to encourage entrepreneurship, increased investment in health and education and much needed investment in child care, should be of most benefit to lower and middle income families.</p> <p> I take the opportunity to compliment the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and the Minister of State at her Department on their work in the Department in the past five years, particularly in sustaining basic payments and reforming the role of the social welfare office through the introduction of the Intreo offices to help people to get</p> <p> The introduction of the JobBridge scheme, despite the criticism of it, has been hugely beneficial to the long-term unemployed and small businesses in creating employment.  Over 61% of all those who have participated in the JobBridge programme have gained full-time employment as a result, which proves the success of the scheme.  This is particularly the case when one compares it with other European schemes where the success rate is 34%.  Another figure relevant to activation schemes is that when we had full employment there were 76,000 people participating in activation schemes.  The current number is 83,000.  This dismisses the myth that the activation schemes are decreasing the unemployment numbers.  It proves that that is not the case.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1188" speakername="Colm Keaveney" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400036#JJ00200"><p>During the general election campaign of 2011 there was much debate about where cuts would have to be made and which sections of society would have to take the greater burden of the adjustments.  One of the key questions asked in several debates and interviews with party leaders was: "What group will you prioritise for protection from cuts?"  The Taoiseach and the former T&aacute;naiste, now an author in the fiction bestseller list, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, both promised to prioritise disability services as an issue and said that not only would they defend the disabled, but when things improved they would also prioritise disability services for improvement.  How hollow that promise sounds today.  Far from defending the disabled, the Government elected in 2011 attacked them.  Far from prioritising them, it placed the interests of those on incomes in excess of the average industrial wage ahead of them.  Far from understanding it as a fundamental issue of human rights and citizenship, it continued to attack the disabled with the old attitude of taking a charitable approach to the issue, not one of rights.  If there was a little extra after looking after other interest groups, the disabled could have the crumbs that fell from the table.</p>  <p>  Despite the restoration of the respite care grant, which Fianna Fail welcomes, there is little in the Bill, or in the broader measures announced in the budget, for people with disabilities.  They have seen their incomes and services eroded under the Government and the Bill offers very little to a group that is already vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.  The &euro;3 increase in pensions does not apply to invalidity pension.  The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, appears to believe those already struggling with the higher costs associated with their disability are immune from an increase in the cost of living.  Based on figures provided for me yesterday by the Minister, the annual cost of increasing their payments in line with other pension payments would have been just &euro;9.8 million.  An increase of &euro;5 per week, an increase that would have come closer to matching the cost of living, would have cost &euro;16.4 million per year.  This is evidently the value the Minister and the Government place on those living with a disability.  This was the price they were willing to make such people pay to ensure the Government could cut taxes for those on almost twice the average industrial wage.</p>  <p>  In her written response the Minister boasts that while she did not increase these payments, she increased the Christmas bonus, which I welcome.  However, does understand people must live for 12 months of the year?  The bonus will not spread over 52 weeks.  That this should be offered in place of a general increase is an insult to the intelligence of the people working and surviving in the disability sector.  It is shameful how little regard the Government has for people with disabilities.  From my engagement with the sector, I can tell the Minister that the anger is growing and that those involved are now starting to realise their electoral strength.  They are not victims but citizens who are demanding their rights and they will make their voices heard.</p>  <p>  The Government has failed to restore the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability, for which Fianna F&aacute;il called in its pre-budget submission.  This failure has consequences.  Some people with disabilities are now trapped not only within their homes but within parts of them.  Does the Minister have any comprehension of the difficulties some people face in performing simple tasks such as cooking and maintaining their personal hygiene?  Does she appreciate how her failure to restore the grant for the most vulnerable in order that it could be sacrificed for tax cuts is a blatant abdication of recognition for those who have been excluded from society?</p>  <p>  The budget offered no alternative to the mobility allowance and the motorised transport scheme which were closed in 2013.  People with disabilities have been overlooked in recent budgets and will not see their living standards improve in 2016.  Once the cost of living is taken into account, including all of the extra charges and taxes payable, people with a disability will continue to see their standard of living fall.</p><p>The Minister's own failings have been compounded by the failings of her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who has obstinately refused to support an increase in personal assistant hours for people in wheelchairs.<br/><br/>Much of the infrastructure required for people with disabilities to lead full and independent lives has been dismantled by the current Government.  Budget 2016 and this Bill are missed opportunities and constitute a failure to enhance the lives of people with a disability.  Over and over again, the Government has attacked the capacity of people with disabilities to participate fully in society.  It has failed to advance the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it has failed to advance by one whit the cause of human rights and equality for people with disability.<br/><br/>The motto of this Government has been &quot;yes to equality&quot;, but only for some.  Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>comes to mind: all are equal but some more equal than others.  Economic equality, if it costs the Exchequer 1 cent, will be resisted and, ultimately, refused.  The Government pays lip-service to equality but, ultimately, has no real commitment to it, as we saw with the failure of commitment in response to the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion on the Travelling community.  The commitment to equality is very much that of the Sandymount liberal sect; if it does not cost money then yes, we can have the equality but if it disrupts the economic power relations within our society, if it affects the upper and middle classes, we cannot have that equality, because it is a cost to the Exchequer.  In the same week Ministers were busy having themselves photographed in PantiBar and tweeting of their joy at the victory for equality, we had the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, acting as apologists for pubs that shut their doors to the grieving Travellers in Wexford.<br/><br/>Those with disabilities have been told their place is to wait at the back of the queue, and the Bill reinforces that.  Even at this late hour, as the Government stumbles forward, could the Minister not reconsider the shameful abandonment and disregard for those with disabilities by her and her Cabinet colleagues and make some gesture that indicates people with disabilities are valued as citizens of this republic?  If she were to do so, she would find no shortage of support in the House.  I invite her now to face down the Tory element of this Government and insist that this group be enabled to participate as full citizens within our society.<br/><br/>Our past in this country with regard to people with disability has been shameful.  We have an opportunity in this Bill to address that.  I believe it is past time we began to address it and to ensure that all of the children of the nation are cherished equally.</p></speech>

What the Government presented in the budget, and which will now be brought about in this Social Welfare Bill, is certainly tokenistic.  The Bill underscores the Government's lack of commitment to the less well-off in society and its pursuit of an agenda that punishes the less well-off and the vulnerable while it looks after the wealthy.</p>  <p>  Very little thought or vision has gone into the Bill.  During my time in the House, we have had many new ideas from different governments.  We had the introduction of free fuel, the respite care grant, the carer's allowance and other initiatives that were brought forward by different Ministers through the years.  However, nothing new has come from this Minister during her time in the Department of Social Protection other than reductions and cuts for people who cannot afford to carry them.</p>  <p>  I would like to suggest to the Minister a few ideas and thoughts that she might consider before the Bill is passed.  One of these areas, following on from Deputy Keaveney's point on disability, is that there would be a special rent allowance for people with disabilities to enable them to live independently.  I find that people with disabilities who want to acquire a rented property find it very difficult to do so under the present rental regime.  This is because most landlords who have to make a property wheelchair-friendly or suitable for people with disabilities would have to spend a lot of money and, as a result, they look for increased rent.  I would ask the Minister to include some measure in the Bill that would allow an increase in rent subsidy.  The current operation of rent allowance throughout the country means people with disabilities must remain in institutions whereas if they received a substantial rent subsidy they would be able to leave the institution and have a certain amount of independent living.</p>  <p>  I recently visited the community workshops in Enniscorthy with the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  One of the strong points that was made to us on that occasion, which was attended by some 300 people with various disabilities, was that they would like to leave the institutions and live a normal life in an independent manner.  However, because of the exorbitant rents they are not able to do so.</p>  <p>  The &euro;3 increase for old age pensioners is certainly a start, although it is not a huge amount.  From meeting people throughout my county, I find they are disillusioned with the &euro;3 increase because there has been a reduction in the fuel allowance and the telephone allowance, as well as the abolition of the bereavement grant.  When the property tax and the water charges are added to that, it certainly takes away from the weekly pension people receive.  The Government makes great play of the fact it did not touch the amount of money old age pensioners have received weekly over the past four years but if we take all the other reductions into account, the overall reduction is substantial and the &euro;3 will go nowhere near meeting that.  I believe the Minister should seriously consider increasing the old age pension by more than &euro;3.</p>  <p>  In particular, the increase should have been extended for those on invalidity pension or disability allowance.  These people have a very small weekly income and could do with an increase.  It is mean-spirited of the Minister not to increase those two payments along with the old age pension.  However, as I said, the &euro;3 increase is a start, if a paltry one, and I hope it will be substantially increased in the future.</p>  <p>  To return to the issue of rent subsidy, there seems to be logjam within the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in regard to how they deal with the rental issue.  As we know, there have been huge rent increases in the past year to 18 months for one simple reason - the scarcity of property.  Not only in Dublin but in my own constituency of Wexford, rents have shot up by 25% and 30% in some cases, particularly in the north Wexford area around Gorey, which is adjacent to Dublin.  We now have a situation where people who had houses rented to councils under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are taking them back because they can get &euro;200 or &euro;250 a month more by renting them in the private sector.</p>  <p>  There is a need to re-examine the amount of money allocated for the rent subsidy scheme.  As I said, there is a huge scarcity of property and I do not know how this is going to be dealt with because no matter what building programme the Government introduces in the next few months, the houses will not come on stream for the next 12 to 18 months.</p><p>We need a mix of private, social and local authority housing to deal with the problem.  In the meantime, it is urgent that the rental subsidy is increased so as to enable people meet the demands of property prices.</p> <p> In regard to the living alone allowance, single people living alone are finding it very difficult to survive.  This is an area the Minister must revisit.  There is an issue in regard to lone parents and these people come in droves to my constituency office and clinics to complain about the changes the Minister introduced in last year's budget.  These changes are causing increasing poverty for lone parents.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to revisit the issue and make changes, but she still has an opportunity to do that through the Social Welfare Bill.  It is not just my view but that of all of the agencies that deal with the issue of poverty that lone parents are being driven below the poverty line by the changes made by the Minister in last year's budget.  This year's budget does not promise much change, but the Minister has an opportunity to revisit this issue in the Social Welfare Bill.  She should take another look at the issue and increase the threshold from seven years of age.  We suggested a cut-off at 14 years, but the Minister does not have to go along with that.  The seven years of age cut-off is far too low and causes hardship and poverty.</p> <p> The FIS scheme was an enlightened initiative by a previous Minister and it works reasonably well.  However, some increase or change in regard to the first and second child should be considered.  The payment is beneficial to families on a low income.  I have always and will continue to support the FIS scheme, but perhaps some changes could be made to provide an increase in the amounts allowed per child.  The scheme should continue.</p> <p> We all make our views known in this House on the direction that should be taken in regard to social welfare overall.  However, the main purpose of social welfare is to support less well off people.  These people and families are surviving on the minimum income and cannot afford reductions in their social welfare payments.  While the Minister allocated an increase of &euro;3 for old age pensioners, she should take into account the gain of from &euro;20 to &euro;25 per week if we add up the reductions in the water charges and property tax.</p> <p> I know the property tax is a contentious issue, but there is something seriously wrong with how it operates.  An old age pensioner lives next door to me and she pays the same property tax and water charges as I do, although she is on a pension of &euro;230 per week while I am a well paid Deputy.  Whatever Government we have after the next general election, the water charge should be given serious consideration.  We should not have a one size fits all water charge or property tax.  If these taxes are to be kept in the future, income thresholds and social welfare payments should be taken into account.  It is unfair that millionaires and people on high incomes only pay the same charges as people on disability, invalidity or old age pensions.  The Minister of State here, Deputy Ring, is a compassionate man and I am sure that if he sits at Cabinet in the future he will look seriously at changes that need to be made in this area to see an element of fairness is introduced.</p></speech>

This Bill gives effect to some of the changes to social welfare which were announced in the budget last month.  It is only right that we acknowledge that budget 2016 was a fair budget which saw many positive measures introduced.  It was the first opportunity the Government has had to give back to the Irish people after many difficult years following our economic crisis.  The Irish people have endured some difficult budgets, but we have now exited the bailout programme and reduced our debts and are seeing a real improvement in public finances.</p>  <p>  In the context of this Bill, it is important to note that our social welfare budget is huge - &euro;19.6 billion in 2016.  In order to be able to spend this money on important services and supports, we must first take it in through taxation.  We are a very small country, although as some would say ours is probably the best country in the world to live in.  We have a small population and only a small but growing workforce.  Fortunately, as the economy has begun to recover, we see more people return to work and this in turn has contributed to a great financial reserve which can be reinvested into necessary vital services.</p>  <p>  I was particularly pleased to see a focus on supporting the elderly in budget 2016.  I want to pay tribute to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Age Action.  They have said they welcome the thrust of the budget in general, but know we are only returning a small element of what the people have lost.  I appreciate the welcome they have given.  Age Action also welcomed the first increase in the State pension in seven years, although it had reduced by &euro;13 since 2009.  We are all aware that has been the case and are aware times have been difficult across the board.  However, things are improving and now the budget can give back to people some of the moneys taken from them.</p>  <p>  For a number of years now, there have been calls for an increase in the State pension, as it has not increased since 2009.  Budget 2016 has increased the weekly pension for pensioners and carers aged 66 years and over by &euro;3.  An increase will also be paid for adult dependents.  This shows our commitment to our senior citizens and is a recognition of their contribution to society.  A 75% Christmas bonus will also be paid during the first week of December, which I know will be of huge benefit for many senior citizens and all welfare recipients.  Approximately 1.2 million people will receive the Christmas bonus this year, at a cost of &euro;197 million.</p>  <p>  Senior citizens will also benefit from an increase in fuel allowance of &euro;2.50, to &euro;22.50 per week.  This payment is a lifeline for many older people and I am glad to see this has been acknowledged in the budget.  We are all aware that without the free travel, the TV licence and medical benefits such as medical or GP cards, life would be difficult for many older people.  I also welcome the increase in the rate of the respite care grant, now known as the carer's support grant, to &euro;1,700.  This will be paid to 86,000 carers at a cost of &euro;30 million in 2016.  This payment is very important in supporting our carers, who provide invaluable care and support to family and friends on a daily basis.</p><p>Those in receipt of carer's allowance currently continue to receive payments for up to six weeks following the death of their loved one.  The Bill proposes to increase this period to 12 weeks, which will again acknowledge the role that many people play on a daily basis as carers.</p> <p> Budget 2016 is family centred and I know this approach can be built upon in further budgets.  The Minister has increased child benefit by &euro;5 to &euro;140 per month.  We are the fifth highest out of 17 EU countries in a social payment for children's allowance and I would add that our neighbours are the fifth lowest.  The introduction of two weeks of paid parental leave for new fathers, which takes effect from September 2016, has also broadly been welcomed.</p> <p> While it does not apply to this Bill, I acknowledge the extension of the ECCE scheme, or free preschool year, to children from age three to five and a half, or until they begin primary school.  Together with an additional 8,000 community child care places, these measures will support young families, many of whom struggle with child care costs.</p> <p> The Bill also sees a positive change to the family income supplement, FIS.  This payment was introduced in the 1980s as a targeted support for families with children on a low income.  It is currently paid to approximately 50,000 families.  Budget 2016 provides for an increase of &euro;5 in the earnings threshold for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children.  This measure is aimed at making work pay and ensuring that people can take up offers of employment without being worse off than if they were relying solely on social welfare supports.</p> <p> The increase in the minimum wage in January 2016 from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour will be an important boost to those on low incomes.  The reduction in the universal social charge and exemption of over 700,000 low income workers from it are further steps towards making work pay.  Figures this week show unemployment is down to 9.3%, which is good news and shows our strategy and our key policy, the Action Plan for Jobs, of creating 125,000 jobs created since 2012, is working. </p> <p> On the new Opposition speakers in the D&aacute;il - I mean those who did not make the hard decisions as members of Government and crossed the floor to save their own necks - they are the people who want to lead in the next general election but they cannot even choose a leader among themselves, so God help us all if they are in that position.  Regarding Sinn F&eacute;in, whose members would class themselves as the people's party and want to be in government after the next election, on a daily basis they say that everything should be free and everything free should be given to the less well off.  I want to ask them who the less well off are.  They then talk about taxing the rich.  Who are the rich they want to tax?  Our sons and daughters, who have gone on to third level education and paid dearly for it through saving and through families and who want to become doctors or nurses or just graduate in some other skills, will be the people who will be taking the flights out of this country if Sinn F&eacute;in and others are in government the next time around.  They will not want to stay because after going to college, the years that they have put will not be recognised and will only be taxed.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for Social Protection for her dedication to reforming the welfare system and ensuring that those who most need support are helped in every way possible, as shown in the measures included in this Bill.  I respect the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, hugely.  She has made huge inroads into changing the social welfare system and will continue to do so when she is re-elected and in the next Government.  I thank her and her staff in the Department of Social Protection for putting this Bill together.  Above all, I pay tribute to the Irish people, many of whom are my friends, families, neighbours and constituents, who have had cuts to their family incomes but have survived.  At long last we in government are now able to give them some benefits back.</p></speech>

It is important to reflect on where we were four or five years ago when we assumed office.  The country was, in effect, in receivership and every Member of this House knows that a company or a business in receivership has no easy way out.  Difficult decisions have to be taken and people, unfortunately, get hurt.  The reality is that we live in a very equal and fair society.</p></speech>

One is that we have the fairest and most progressive tax system in the OECD, which is recognised independently by the OECD, and the second, and the reason we are here today, is that we have this social protection regime.  In particular, I welcome the increases in the State pension for those over 66, including qualified adults.</p><p>It is not all great news as it was not the giveaway budget that most would have predicted.  It was modest in terms of what we could do and that was appropriate.  However, there is one cohort of people I would have liked to have seen being looked at more favourably.  This cohort is suffering, as I have mentioned several times to the Minister and will continue to do so.  I refer to those who are living alone and who are entirely dependent on social protection.  It would cost &euro;8 million for every &euro;1 increase in the living alone allowance and as we move forward into a more secure and stable economic environment, we should recognise that there are standard basic household costs, irrespective of the number of people living in a household.  The living alone allowance could be an area in which we could achieve a greater balance in the years to come.  I ask the Minister and officials to reflect on this in terms of policy in the coming year.</p><p>We have increased the rate of child benefit.  It is back to &euro;135 per month.  That is a message that confirms the universality of child benefit payments here, and it sends a message that we do the best we can to look after families with young children, particularly when there are expenses relative to going to school.  It is worth reflecting that in the UK and the North of Ireland, the child benefit rate is &euro;29 per month.  It is a different message entirely - and that is also <i>pro rata </i>on State pensions, disability pensions and most other allowances that are paid in that jurisdiction.  We do not hear much about it and we do not get much trumpeting from the benches opposite about how brilliant the social protection system is in the North.  That is perhaps a reason the institutions of the North are in such a precarious position.  When we talk about equality in this State, we hear snide remarks from those who do not look behind and see what they are presiding over in the North.</p></speech>

I welcome the ongoing increase in the number of families which have claimed the family income supplement over the years.  Up to 50,000 families now claim it.  That is a positive policy in terms of social protection in that we are supporting parents who wish to work and who have two, three or four children but find that those associated expenses can be difficult.</p><p>I firmly believe that not enough families claim family income supplement.  An information campaign by the Department would be very appropriate in this regard.  </p> <p> I wish to talk about features of the budget which do not appear in the Bill but which merit welcoming.  The almost complete restoration of the Christmas bonus to what it was before the crash is most welcome at a difficult and expensive time.  The extra &euro;2.50 for the 26 weeks for which the fuel allowance is payable is a modest increase but, again, sends a message to recipients of social protection that fuel costs and fuel poverty are issues that need to be dealt with.  </p> <p> I will use my contribution to make some suggestions and pose some other questions to which the Department might respond - perhaps in the Minister's closing address or subsequently.  I have some concerns about means testing for allowance payments.  I want to give two specific examples.  One concerns a building worker who has intermittent spells of unemployment, who lives with his aging mother and who started building his own home before the collapse.  This house is substantially constructed but will not be habitable for years.  It is essentially valueless because under the terms of his planning approval, the individual cannot sell it but must reside in it for seven years after its completion.  However, it is valued in terms of his social protection payments and the net result is that he receives the princely sum of &euro;38 per annum despite the fact that he has an asset he cannot deal with and is effectively in limbo.  We need to deal with that issue.  </p> <p> The second case is of a man left severely disabled after an industrial accident who has been refused any payment because he has been left a one third share in a house in Germany that his two siblings are not willing to sell.  He has no income from the property and is denied any access to social protection.  I am highlighting these two examples because the Department needs to demonstrate more flexibility and understanding in how it deals with our citizens.</p> <p> Before the telephone allowance was abolished, the Department would have sought preferential rates from the operators for senior citizens.  The Department has the clout to again fight on behalf of social protection recipients and negotiate fairer terms with all utility providers.  Could the Department be proactive in looking at this issue?  </p> <p> The tracking of applications, appeals and target dates to be processed is a minor issue but one that causes Members of this House great difficulty.  Officials in the Department are very helpful and I have never come across any official who did not want to be helpful but constantly telephoning Department offices looking for the status of an application is a huge strain on our and their resources.  With the IT systems that are available now, we should be able to log on in a similar fashion to Passport Express and have a look at the status of an application.  It would save a lot of time and resources over time.  The Department should look at this issue in the near future.</p> <p> I have come across a number of issues regarding the administration of the carer's allowance.  The concept of only being allowed to work for 15 hours per week only allows someone to work for a day and a half.  The individual is obviously allowed to work for a day but they cannot work for two days or do two shifts.  It is a shift and a half.  I ask the Department to have a look at this and to bring it up a couple of hours to allow possibly two eight-hour shifts or two full days for those on carer's allowance and carer's benefit to allow them to work a couple of extra hours in the week.  A shift and a half is halfway across the river and is on neither bank.  Those on carer's benefit are on it for a limited period of time and people receiving it may suddenly lose it before they are put on to carer's allowance.  Clients on carer's benefit should receive notification at least two to three months in advance of the cessation of their carer's benefit so they are given enough time to apply for carer's allowance.  </p> <p> I wish to refer to an issue that is topical at the moment, namely, media reports on the fishing industry.  One of the great difficulties people in the fishing industry face is that despite the fact that they work all the time, they do not always get a wage.  It depends on their catches.  Whatever they do or do not get, I can tell the House what they do not get.  They do not get social protection.  They have no safety net whatsoever and I ask the Department to engage with the industry once again to see if a proper and workable scheme could be introduced to help those who work in difficult circumstances in the fishing industry.  </p> <p> I will be a bit parochial.  I am a postmaster.  Decisions taken by the Department of Social Protection about the way it administers payments always have a severe effect on the post office network.  I ask the Department officials to reflect on the schemes they administer and to reflect on the net effect on the post office network throughout the country if they decide to move to cashless payments or to incentivise payments through other sources.  </p> <p> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak.  I commend the Minister and Minister of State on their work to date.</p></speech>

When Fine Gael and Labour entered government, they promised a democratic revolution - an opportunity to change the way that business was done in Ireland and to improve the lives of all citizens.  Instead, what was delivered was a Government that hammered the poor and attacked the weakest in society instead of protecting them.  Its record in government shows this.  Labour and Fine Gael abolished the &euro;300 cost of education allowance that had been payable to back to education allowance recipients.  They introduced legislation in 2011 raising the pension ages in stages to 68, which is effectively a cut of 16% to pension entitlements.  These were coupled with many other austerity measures which have caused untold suffering to families throughout the country.  This does not seem like much of a democratic revolution but rather reflects a Government that is determined to follow its own path of ideological austerity.  We are then told about what is happening in Northern Ireland.  If the Irish Government wants to join with us in trying to persuade the British Government to give fiscal powers to Irish people living in Ireland, we would welcome that support but until then, it should criticise the British Government and not Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  There was a clear alternative to the measures imposed that was highlighted not just by Sinn F&eacute;in but by many economists, trade unions, charities and voluntary organisations.  They highlighted the impacts that cuts were having on different sections of the community but they were ignored by this Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in produced a costed alternative budget that offered an alternative to the austerity policies of the Government.  When Sinn F&eacute;in proposed them, the Government benches laughed them off as "voodoo economics".  Yet in the this year's budget when the Government offered some relief from austerity, the Government benches paraded around as if they had just discovered penicillin.  Where was their caring for the poor and the weak in society over the past number of years?</p>  <p>  While it is welcome to see a small rise in the fuel allowance, there has to be more action on helping those who are fuel poor.  Fuel allowance has been increased by &euro;2.50 per week for the applicable weeks, which is welcome.  However, energy prices for domestic customers have risen by approximately 25% since 2009, so the real value of fuel supports has fallen.  </p><p>This level of payment was maintained until 2012, when the number of weeks for which the allowance was paid was reduced from 32 to 26, reducing its annual value by &euro;120.  Energy efficiency programmes which can be used effectively to aid the fuel poor must also receive priority.  The figure for sustainable energy programmes has increased from &euro;43 million to &euro;58 million for 2016.  However, this is still well below the &euro;79 million allocated in 2011 but is roughly around the &euro;55 million allocated in 2012.  The Government has promised a new scheme to help those suffering fuel poverty, but it must deliver on this promise, especially as the winter approaches.<br/><br/>The Government frequently complains that Sinn F&eacute;in opposes everything but does not propose solutions.  Let me run this by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring: the social protection system seems to be badly designed.  It seems to be too labour intensive and expensive to process and administer payments.  It lacks cohesion and seems to consist of a series of add-ons rather than being a cohesive whole.  I understand following a quick search on <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>that there are at least 58 schemes listed.  There are probably more, but why?  The system seems to have been designed to be user unfriendly rather than as a clear, simple set of supports people can easily understand.  Surely people are more interested in what is shown in the bottom right-hand corner, the amount payable, rather than the description on the left-hand side of the cheque.  Perhaps if the whole system was rationalised, although that is a bad word to suggest to any Government because I know what it would do, and streamlined, there might be faster decisions, fewer and faster appeals and we could give a lot more financial support to those who really need it.</p></speech>

There have been cuts affecting the old, the young and the people who care for them.  No one in the State who has to eke out a living and struggle to make ends meet was spared the chop by the Government in its so-called hard decisions.  Now it wants us to believe a few crumbs from the table amount to a giveaway.  It is not giving away anything, as this is the people's money.  It was not made by any Government but by the labour and hard work of the people and they deserve more than crumbs.  Those who shouldered the cuts the Government implemented are the ones who are now expected to take the crumbs and be quiet.</p>  <p>  Apart from the cuts they have suffered in social welfare spending, working class people have been hurt again and again by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  Those who own a home have been forced to pay a tax on it.  Everyone is now expected to pay for the right to access clean water, despite already paying taxes.  The Government has increased prescription charges, imposed massive increases in the cost of public transport and considerably increased the cost of running a car through motor tax.  Ordinary families have been hit the hardest through cuts to social welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  The Government repeatedly claims that it has not cut core social welfare payments.  That has been a successful mantra that the media has taken up, but for hard-pressed families struggling to keep their heads above water, any entitlement they have is core to their survival.  That the Government does not consider rent supplement to be a core social welfare payment means nothing to the families who could not make up the rent and are now homeless, living in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.  That the Government does not consider child benefit to be a core payment means nothing to the child who had to go without.  That it does not consider the respite care grant to be a core payment means little to the carer who has been burnt out and the person receiving care who has seen his or her loved one lose hope.  </p>  <p>  The cut in young person's dole to &euro;100 that has left many a person in early adulthood homeless was particularly low and inequitable.  It was another low blow to young people, often in leaving care, especially considering the Government's failure to provide a right to aftercare.  The Government's spin means nothing to the real lives that it has hurt by choosing to take from the poorest to protect the richest through tax cuts which disproportionately affected them.</p>  <p>  The Government has continued to foster the hateful narrative about working class people started by Fianna F&aacute;il and abetted by the media.  It has painted them as spongers, lazy and idle, people who sit in front of their flat screen TVs, having the time of their lives, who stock up on booze and cigarettes, as Deputy Catherine Byrne claimed, and who can be motivated to do a day's work only with a firm sharp shock.  They get the stick, while the wealthy and privileged are treated to the carrot.</p>  <p>  The issue of housing is a source of shame for the Government, but it does not seem to have the capacity for shame.  To save a few million euro on rent supplement payments, it cut the rates twice and refused to consider a cap completely at odds with the market.  This massively increased the budget for emergency accommodation.  This year alone homeless services will need &euro;73.4 million more than has been provided in the budget for next year, although more people are becoming homeless every day.  We have replaced paying for people to stay in private homes with paying many more times to place them in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  The concept of social housing has been obliterated under this and the previous Government, with plans to provide just 1,750 social housing units between now and 2018, while 1,500 children sleep in emergency accommodation every night and at least 130 human beings make a bed on the streets of Dublin nightly.  The Minister for Social Protection has presided over a carnival of inequality, the consequences of which we will only really understand in the years to come as communities rebuild after the onslaught of Labour Party-Fine Gael austerity.</p></speech>

The social welfare cuts the Government has imposed have had a devastating impact on citizens and families across the State.  We welcome the small increases in social welfare payments in the budget, with a general election looming, but such tiny money transfers will not tackle the root problem of inequality and disadvantage in our society.</p>  <p>  A recent economic survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, has shown that Ireland has the highest level of income inequality among OECD members.  Every budget the Government has brought forward has been regressive and disproportionately impacted on the poorest in society.  Until we have affordable, high quality and easy access to fundamental public services, the country will continue to be blighted by inequality and disadvantage.  One of the cruellest cuts was the cut to the respite care grant.  I still cannot understand how any Government, Government member or Deputy could justify or have the heart to implement this inhumane cut, but hurray, there is a general election looming and I welcome its reinstatement.  The grant has been described as the difference between sanity and insanity for carers, between carrying on and being burnt out.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in the budget for young jobseekers.  In our alternative budget we called on the Government to invest &euro;72 million to commence the restoration of equality for young jobseekeers and to reverse cuts for those under 26 years of age, which would entail a weekly increase of &euro;40.  The Government decided to do nothing.  Young people need careers, not unpaid internships disguised as job activation schemes.  I have met many young people participating in the JobBridge and Gateway schemes in my constituency who have been exploited.  They have received no training and there is no progression, no chance of securing a real job.  Several of the workers on the Gateway scheme who were talking about going on strike said there had not even been a medical check before they commenced training.  </p>  <p>  That one in six Irish-born people now live abroad should not come as any surprise.  If the recovery of which the Government speaks is to be meaningful, it needs to address the issues of inequality and the prevalence of in-work poverty which is the result of low-paid employment.</p><p>Family income supplement should not be a prop with which employers exploit workers.  </p> <p> We are coming into what is likely to be a very cold winter and the amount of people now living in fuel poverty in Ireland is unacceptable.  People are going to be faced with choosing between putting food on the table and heating their homes.  I am sure the Minister has heard that in her own clinics.  There is the real possibility that our elderly citizens living on State pensions will be unable to heat their homes and could die of the cold.  The meagre couple of euro with which the Government is trying to buy them off in this Bill will not make much of a difference.  I spoke to a number of pensioners who asked that the money be transferred instead to fix our hospitals.  Many to whom I spoke said they were afraid of entering a hospital.  A 91 year old Parkinson's disease sufferer was left on a trolley for 29 hours in Tallaght Hospital.  It is a disgrace.  This morning, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, tried to blame the staff for not giving the patient a bed.  Does he think the staff are hiding beds?  The CEO of Tallaght Hospital warned the Government in 2013 that if the Government continued with its cuts there would be a catastrophe within the hospital.  In one week this summer, a 101 year old was on a trolley for 29 hours in Limerick Hospital and a 102 year old woman was on a trolley for 26 hours in Tallaght Hospital.  The call from the CEO of Tallaght Hospital does not suit the Government's narrative.  We are in supposedly in the middle of a recovery, a recovery that the Government says means more money in people&rsquo;s pockets.  In reality, it means more people on trolleys.  More people than ever are homeless and more people than ever are in debt.  Budget 2016 is yet another missed opportunity.</p></speech>

The Labour Party and Fine Gael cut the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance for three budgets in a row.  They cut it by &euro;50 for two years and then eliminated it for 18 to 22 year olds attending college full-time.  Perhaps they will come next for the jar beside the bed where people throw their small pennies at night to save for Christmas, but maybe they have not thought of that yet.</p>  <p>  This Government has cut everything to the bone over the past few budgets and then calls it "generosity" and uses terms like "sharing the fruits of our recovery" to label giving back paltry percentages of the cuts already made to people who see no sign of any recovery.  I travel in rural Ireland on a weekly basis, all over this country, and there is no recovery for those who have to live outside the capital.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party took away the Christmas bonus and now call themselves generous for giving back a quarter of it.</p></speech>

Do they really think that people are that stupid that they do not know that they are electioneering?  Their miserly measures do not hide the cruelty of this Government, which chose to cut illness benefit and the treatment benefit scheme.  It took measures like cutting the grants for hearing aids, mainly for elderly people.  It took away the fuel allowance and household benefits packages.  In the case of Labour the list of broken promises is long and painful.  It has moved a long way from its Tesco promises and has betrayed the people most in need over the past four years.</p>  <p>  Every cut means that something extra has to be paid for out of either low wages, pensions or social welfare payments.  If one takes away, for example, the telephone allowance it amounts to a cut of &euro;271 from the annual budget of people over 70.  They can decide not to have a telephone or they can pay for it out of their pension.  The Government gave them back &euro;3 - so generous after cutting everything around them for the past number of years.  The sham increase of &euro;3 in the old age pension is so small and insignificant that it makes me wonder what was the thinking of the people who sat around the Cabinet table and came up with it, and of those who put the spin on it that it meant they were being generous to our older citizens.  The sum &euro;3 is shameful.  It is disgraceful and an insult to our elderly who built this country.</p>  <p>  The Government has cut basic social welfare payments again and again.  Its press office keeps telling it to deny this, but it is true.  During the worst of times of severe hardship when poor people needed help more than ever and felt the need of a safety net, the Government denied them that.  It acts like there is no society, only the economy.  That is what it has practised but what is the point of balancing the books when inequality has grown so much under this Government?  The rich are getting richer and for the rich there is a recovery, but the gap is widening with the measures introduced by this Government.  </p>  <p>  There are nearly 400,000 people living in consistent poverty.  There are some people who were working poor or just managing not to be poor but who have been thrown into destitution by this Government, some of them homeless now.  Deputy Noel Harrington said we were one of the fairest and most equitable societies in Europe but he is clearly in a bubble, like the other Deputies present.  They do not know what it is like in the real world.  They do not know what it is like to go into a house and see poor people and children going hungry as a result of the Government's policies.  It has betrayed the people who voted for it and its members will get their answer when they go back to their doors some time next year.  They are hoping for a recovery but there is no recovery for people who betray the people they are supposed to represent.</p></speech>

It must be the most miserable, horrible job because they are sitting there watching the economy going better, more jobs being created and people starting to get a bit of hope but they are miserable because they cannot exploit people's fears as they could in the past.  Their strategy for five years was transparent, namely, to exploit people's misery and fears and say how awful everything was and what a shower we were on the Government benches for not giving a damn about anybody.  It was a great little strategy but it is unravelling now and people are seeing through it.  We have the Sinn F&eacute;in mother of all sorrows in this House but up in the North they are austerity junkies, laying off 20,000 public sector workers, cutting back services and agreeing to budget reductions all over the place.  They are chancers.  To give them any more credit than call them a pack of chancers would be to overstate things.  If they want to continue to engage in misery that is fine but it is not worth any more of my time.</p>  <p>  Those of us who actually have to make decisions, to have an input and to bear the responsibility of achieving something, do not look back on the past five years and gleefully say that it was a difficult time for people but it was great to do it and we got a great laugh out of it.  We inherited an awful mess but we took difficult decisions and did our best to bring it back to where we started to put people back to work.  Then people start to pay taxes and then we can reduce the enormous burden of taxation on other people and put money back into social services and public spending.</p>  <p>  What did the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto say at the last election?  It said they would reverse every single cut and would tell the troika to go home.</p><p>It promised to reverse every cut without any money to do it.  What is particularly interesting is that not once did Sinn F&eacute;in ever produce a plan or even a vague outline as to how it would fulfil that manifesto.  It never proposed in an alternative budget in the first year of this D&aacute;il outlining how it would reverse all the cuts because it was making it up as it went along.  It does not want to be in government and does not want to make decisions.  Its plan for the next five or ten years is to keep growing and then eventually it might enter government without being responsible, constructive or having some kind of national interest.  It does not make sense.  It is only self-interest that motivates it - self-interest to grow the party, grow the mission, report back to the IRA and let it know how it is getting along with its little strategy.  That is what it is about.</p></speech>

I was not reading a script.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members came to the House with their press office scripts.  I am not reading a script; I am giving it as I know it.</p>  <p>  This is a good budget.  It is not a great budget, it is not the be-all and end-all.  It will not create some kind of nirvana society.  However, it will finally give a signal of hope to people that the bad times are over.  We can finally start to view the economy as something that is not to be feared, but rather something we can harness and use to create the wealth we need for public services and to give people a break in their take-home pay.  It is signalling to many people that austerity is finally over and there is a clearer way forward and a brighter future.  Those may seem like lofty goals when we are still struggling as many people are.  However, it is a clear intent.  For a long time the country had a complete lack of hope and optimism, which was hard to grapple with.  There was no plan for the how to get there in the future.  Could we get there?  Was there any way to get around it?  Now, finally, we have a pathway forward.  The bad times are over and we are getting people back to work.  There are a few extra bob that we can put back in people's pockets to make their lives that bit better.</p>  <p>  We need to compare where we are with where we were when we first came to the Government benches.  I will never forget canvassing in Renmore in Galway and coming across women and men twice my age crying at the doors.  They were in bits because they had lost their jobs and because they were in their late 50s or early 60s, they knew they would not get another job.  In some cases savings that they had made and scrimped and put together over the previous 30 years had been wiped out, or their child who used to live at home and used to be an integral part of the family had been forced to emigrate.  Those were the situations we inherited.  We have now reached a point where we can say, "You know what?  We're going to give you &euro;3 on the pension.  It's not huge but it's &euro;150 a year.  We're going to give you back three quarters of the Christmas bonus.  It's not huge, but it's 170 quid on your pension.  We're going to increase the fuel allowance by &euro;2.50.  We're going to put the child benefit back up by a fiver and the respite care grant back up to where it was because we can now afford to do it".  Those things matter to people on the ground.</p>  <p>  I am not running away from any doors, rather I am out knocking on doors two or three times a week and I get a very good reaction.  People are reasonable, they are not stupid and they can no longer be fooled.  They know that things are going to be slow and that we have to be careful because what we have is fragile.  The last thing they want is to go back to the bad old days where we just splash out on everything, it all collapses like a house of cards around us and we find ourselves in a terrible position.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill.  It is nice to be able to speak on such positive legislation even if it is a bit late in this D&aacute;il to do it.  However, it is good that we are able to do something of this nature and to give a little back to people.  In future we need to flesh out where we want the social protection system to be.  There is still a bit to go in terms of turning into that fully responsive people-centred individual-focused service that gives people the ability not just to draw payments and eke out a living, but to move to an Intreo option and turn it into an enabler, a place people say go to their Intreo office to get training or information on how to upskill in order to get back into the workforce."</p>  <p>  When it comes to people with disabilities, our social protection system defines a very broad category of people too widely.  It treats with one brush people who have severe to profound disabilities, who will never be able to work, who will constantly be cared for and loved by their families and the State, as well as people who are capable of working and participating.  Simply having one payment called disability benefit and not breaking it down into different categories of people and recognising the individuals within it is something we could work on.</p>  <p>  When I knock on the doors in Galway and talk to people about this I present it is as good news and the people are receptive to it.  It is great to be able to say that the past four and a half or five years have been worth it, that we have got out of the rut, that we are able to start the process of rebuilding, renewing, giving people something back, improving living standards and continuing to reduce inequality.  It is an externally assessed fact that inequality has reduced under this Government because we have a very good redistributive system that transfers money from those who can afford it to help those who are least well off, as it should.</p>  <p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection for introducing the Bill.  I thank the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for their work on the budget.  It is a very good sign and a very good start.  Let this be the first of many budgets that continues this trajectory of providing resources for those who need them and giving breaks to those who get up every morning, bring the children to school and go to work.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in Members think they have the monopoly on caring.  If they really cared about the families they talk about, they need to face up to the people and decide to go into government to make life better for the people they feel they have a monopoly interest in.  Who does Deputy Ferris think he is?  I live in a family in a community in a village in a county where unemployment was at the highest rate of any region in the country when we came into government in 2011.  I am very proud that from May of last year to May this year, the number of people on the live register dropped by 10%.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members need not start to shout at me about JobBridge, which accounts for about 170 people, most of whom are not exploited.  There are difficulties with the scheme but I have met many young people who have gone on to full-time employment because of those job-activation measures.</p>  <p>  As a Government Member I am interested in ensuring that people get access to good quality employment.  For the first time in a long time this budget rewards working families, which is very important.  It also looks after people who have difficulties through no fault of their own because of illness or disability or because of life circumstances.  We have been able to increase child benefit, which is a universal payment that looks after our children and our families.  We have also been able to take away some of the barriers preventing people from working., including the difficulty that PRSI kicked in very quickly as soon as they took on more hours.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party is the party of work and I am very proud of that.  This budget rewards working families, which is what the recovery has to be about.  Deputy Martin Ferris suggested that the recovery is not taking hold outside of Dublin, which is not true.  It is not happening in the same accelerated way as it is happening in the capital, but it is starting to take hold.</p>  <p>  The meanest cut of all those imposed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was to take &euro;1 off the minimum wage.  This affected the people who were getting up in the morning and going out to do work that is often not held in high regard - perhaps in the catering industry or in retail - and that Government wanted to take &euro;1 an hour off them.  It claimed it was of national importance and was imperative that it happen.  However, as bad as the economic situation was, this Government in our first budget restored that minimum wage cut.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, on increasing the national minimum wage because I have first-hand experience of working as well as having family members working in a sector of the economy that is badly paid.</p><p>That will bring about an improvement in people's lives.  Family income supplement is another social transfer that helps and supports people who want to get out and work.  It is hugely significant that in the budget family income supplement has been increased to support families in that regard.</p> <p> The social impact assessment carried out by the Department very clearly indicates that the average household will be better off by in or around &euro;14 a week.  However, the cumulative effect over a year is that there will be an extra week&rsquo;s wages.  That is very significant for families who are trying to meet mortgage repayments and get their children back to school or perhaps it will mean that children will be able to engage in additional activities that might have been beyond their reach in recent years.</p> <p> Nobody in this House is more acutely aware of the situation than I am.  I will not take any lecture from Deputy Martin Ferris or any member of Sinn F&eacute;in about how difficult recent years have been.  No Deputy on the Government side came into the House in recent years and voted with glee for what had been introduced in the budget.  We are acutely aware of what happened, not in terms of votes in the House but the impact measures had on people&rsquo;s lives.  Now that the recovery is starting to take hold, it is the focus of the Labour Party &ndash; the party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has spoken about it on a number of occasions &ndash; to ensure that as the economy grows, we will have a social recovery because that is what we believe in.  We believe in the redistribution of social transfers generated by economic activity to invest in public services and social payments and to make work pay.  It is imperative that we do this for families, in particular where there are small children.</p> <p> A landmark feature of the budget is that for the first time on a statutory basis there will be two weeks paid paternity leave.  That is a significant step forward not only for husbands, partners and wives but also for children.  The overall policy direction of the Government is to try to ensure that when young children are born into a new family, whatever its make-up, they will be able to stay at home with the main carer for the first year of life.  We have a bit to travel on that road, but it is a significant and very welcome measure.  It is something on which the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys; the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, worked and campaigned for.  That is the difference between sitting on the Government side of the House as opposed to the Opposition side.  That is the reason I will not take any lecture from Deputy Martin Ferris or Sinn F&eacute;in, as they do not have the courage of their convictions to sit on this side of the House and improve the lot of those who want to get up every morning to go to work, make sure their children go to a school that will now enjoy a reduced pupil-teacher ratio and access to a second free preschool year and, if they are in a low-paid job or only work part time, family income supplement will give them a leg up to ensure they can move on to better things.  What any family want is to ensure their children get every opportunity.  The other changes introduced in budget 2016, in addition to the Social Welfare Bill, will ensure that will happen.  I accept it is not happening at the accelerated rate we would like to see, but that is the reality of being in government.  It is easy to sit on the sidelines and be against everything, stand for nothing and not take one&rsquo;s seat on this side of the House.</p></speech>

I was trying to find any philosophy behind the Government's distribution of money in social welfare payments, but it did not take me very long to work it out.  It was, quite simply, that the Government had decided it had a certain amount of money to distribute - it found an awful lot of money in a hurry recently - and it decided it would distribute it very thinly among a large number of the electorate in order to buy as many votes as possible.  That is, unfortunately, what Governments have always done and it is what the Government is doing also.  I do not think it is necessarily going to work because in my experience those who are the beneficiaries of social welfare expenditure are saying in every case that what they are getting is a pittance.  Some of them find the increases insulting; others find that they are too little, while a lot of them feel the money was taken away from them in the first place for reasons beyond their control and that they are now getting back only a small portion of what they consider is due to them.  That is the reality.  There has not been the surge in the polls to the Labour Party that it might have expected, given that the Government had some largesse to distribute.  That is because people believe they have suffered enough and that they should get back what they had in the first place and perhaps a little more besides.</p><p>By my calculations, the increase in the old age pension of &euro;3 per week will buy people an extra six cigarettes.  It will not even buy them an extra cigarette a day.  That is the kind of money they have been given back.  Those in receipt of child benefit will receive an extra &euro;5 per child per month.  The amounts involved are, therefore, very small.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is based on the philosophy that if it spreads the benefits very thinly, it will buy each vote one by one and that it will win the election.  I do not think people are deceived by this or will buy it.  I do not think the Labour Party has benefited, although it is claiming the credit for it.  A different approach should have been taken.</p><p>I do not understand why when the Government makes so much fuss about its ability to broaden the tax base and its philosophy in that regard, it has narrowed the tax base in the budget.  That is what it has done by excluding people from USC, quite rightly.  The Government stated it had broadened the tax base by imposing a property tax and water rates, but it did not really; it has actually hit the same people with slightly different tax rates.  The Government is playing with words.  If it really wanted to broaden the tax base, it would have read <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning and asked what was really happening in taxation.  Suddenly, in the past few days it has discovered &euro;800 million.  It keeps discovering money.  A sum of &euro;800 million will come in in corporation tax from multinationals totally and utterly unexpectedly and the Government maintains that it is not a once-off.  It seems that it might be.  I refer the Minister of State to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  It states there is speculation in financial circles in Dublin that the increase in corporation tax payments - a windfall that has just arrived which could be spent on social welfare payments certainly - follows moves by a large US multinational to book certain profits in its Irish division that had previously been booked offshore.  The multinationals simply pick their profit figures nowadays.  They decide what their profits will be.  The Minister will know this, as will others on the Government side of the House.  For some reason, the Government refuses to acknowledge the fact that multinationals which we welcome, cherish and nurture are playing ducks and drakes with the economy and the budget.  If it wants to broaden the tax base, the thing it ought to do is have a reasonable relationship and come to a reasonable arrangement with multinationals.</p></speech>

Much has been said about the cuts to child benefit, grants for school clothing and rent payments and taxing maternity benefit.  It is accepted across the world, even by the World Health Organization, that the issues of social welfare and poverty are interlinked.  The vast majority of those who are impoverished are on very low pay or in receipt of social welfare payments.  I accept that there are people in receipt of minimum payments and even moderate payments who suffer poverty.</p><p>The fact remains that in Ireland, statistics show that without a social welfare payment, 50% of the population would be in some form of poverty, which is an incredible figure.  In 2013, 698,000 people were living below the poverty line, of whom 218,000 were children.  As all Members are aware, the health effects for people in receipt of social welfare benefits can be catastrophic because they do not have private health insurance.  Housing can be catastrophic because they cannot afford to buy their own house, are in local authority housing and can be in arrears with rent.  Education can be catastrophic for such people and so on.  Last Christmas, when dealing with people in receipt of social welfare, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul used the term &quot;catastrophic&quot; to describe the situation in Dublin.  Studies show that social welfare rates are not adequate to provide a standard of living that is perceived to be acceptable to all those who do not wish to see people living with a poor quality of life.  Interestingly, while one can balance that up between a minimum wage, an adequate wage, a livable wage and so on, the United Nations has stated the minimum standard of living is one which meets a person's physical, psychological and social needs.  This applies to everybody who lives in a country and consequently, each Member must ask himself or herself whether he or she is comfortable and confident that people who are in receipt of social welfare payments, many of them through no fault of their own because of recession after recession and the downturn in the economy find themselves with poor qualities of life.<br/><br/>While in my office, I listened to the debate and was taken aback by some speakers on the Government benches.  One speaker suggested everything was going well, people now are being looked after well and it is better than it was because there is a fair tax system and so on.  It also was suggested that were it possible to get in more tax, one could pay out more in social welfare and so on.  At present, statistics show that Ireland is home to more than 3,000 people who are recognised as non-domiciliary for the purposes of avoiding tax worldwide in respect of the capital gains tax regime.  Moreover, all Members are aware, as was stated in an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i>a few weeks ago, that companies are legally avoiding paying billions in corporate tax.  Apple has been called the Holy Grail of tax avoidance.  A question was put to the Minister for Finance approximately 18 months ago regarding the top 5%, 10% and 20% of earners.  Incidentally, I am not against anyone earning big money; many of my friends earn more money than do I and that is fine.  Astonishingly, however, the aforementioned 5%, 10% and 20% were paying less tax than the average PAYE earner in Ireland.  As these are the Minister's own statistics, the money is there to avoid having this number of people living below an adequate income, as referred to by the United Nations, Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<br/><br/>The Minister of State and I both are aware one cannot live on &euro;188 or &euro;220 per week or &euro;350 per week if one has a family or whatever.  It simply is not possible.  Should one not have a television?  The consequence of having a television is one must pay for it and for a provider.  Should one not have a car?  Should one not be able to buy a computer?  Any reasonably-minded person will know many people in receipt of social welfare do not have that comfort in life and do not have the quality of life they deserve.  I wish I had more time but unfortunately I do not.  It comes back to the balance of poverty and social welfare, which are inextricably linked.  It is unfortunate the State has not dealt with this in a substantial way.  A few bob may be given here or there, this or that rate will be increased but at the end of the day, one finds statistics still show the poverty levels may have dropped or increased by 2% but the same substantive number of people are affected by poverty.  To conclude, all the statistics show the vast majority of them are in receipt of social welfare payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400045#SS00200"><p>I wish to take this opportunity to dismantle some of the myths presented within this Bill as endorsed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Key aims were presented by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, on budget day, which included the strengthening of supports for families with children, increasing the momentum to date in helping jobseekers back to work and providing targeted assistance for vulnerable groups.  While the Government hailed these aims as being progressive and inclusive, it is clear they are myths that must be dispelled and the truth revealed that these aims are in fact backward and cynical.</p>  <p>  I will begin with the first myth as advocated in this Bill, which is it will increase the momentum to date in helping jobseekers back to work.  The Bill outlines slight increases in supports for family income supplement, jobseeker's transitional payment, a new tapered PRSI credit for class A employees, as well as top-up payments of &euro;2.50 per week for community employment, the rural social scheme, T&uacute;s, Gateway and similar schemes.  This top-up is to be contributed towards costs, namely, a meal and travel costs.  On paper and in elaborate budget speeches, these additions may sound nice.  However, on closer observation they in fact are surface-level, shallow and random.  Two issues stand out for me.  First, in trying to get people into work, people are faced with low quality insecure jobs.  Second, a characteristic of 21st century capitalism is flexible, periodic and insecure employment, as well as transiency, lack of control over time, over qualification and uncertainty.  To reiterate this point, there are 272,000 fewer full-time jobs in Ireland at present compared with the position in 2007 and this constitutes a fall of 15%.  The number of people in part-time jobs is more than 55,000 higher than was the case in 2007, which is an increase of 14% and more than one quarter of part-time workers are underemployed.  In addition, between 2010 and 2014 the number of people who were long-term unemployed fell by 48,700 but during the same period, the net loss of Irish people to emigration was more than 123,000.  A worrying statistic published by the Central Statistics Office shows that just over 73,000 workers were being paid the national minimum wage rate for an experienced adult of &euro;8.65 per hour, or less, in the second quarter of 2014.  Contrary to the Government's job push proposals, over time, people will be obliged to depend increasingly on social welfare as job security decreases across society.  Social welfare traps will re-emerge because the Government's jobs and social welfare policies lack a coherent targeted approach for jobseekers or those on low incomes.  Instead, it has covered its tracks with a shallow layer of small top-ups and token initiatives.  The increase in the income disregard for those in receipt of the jobseeker's transitional allowance is a modest approach to increasing a parent's ability to stay in low-paid employment.  Keeping families on the margins of work through low pay will mean welfare traps will become an increasing reality.  Currently, 59,000 families are in receipt of the family income supplement and combined with the changes in the universal social charge, this means the State is creating a low-paid economy and actually is subsidising low pay within the economy through Government transfers.</p>  <p>  I will move on to the second myth, which is that this Bill will strengthen support for families with children.  It does not do so at all; it only just about sustains them.  One would expect a Government that has witnessed a doubling in child poverty rates since taking office to have drafted a policy to reflect this urgent issue.  Many of the supports, such as child benefit, are blanket increases to all recipients and are not targeted to anyone on the basis of the level of need.  Barnardos has stated that although the child benefit increase might appear to be a step in the right direction, without meaningful investment in public services, the Government target of lifting 70,000 children out of poverty will never be achieved.  Barnardos stated further that while some measures in budget 2016 were encouraging, for example, the introduction of paternity benefit, there is little to suggest it will be followed up with investment measures that in turn will have a lasting impact on families who have spent years struggling against poverty and inequality.  One Family, which deals with lone parents and their families, has explicitly expressed its disappointment in the budget's approach to lone parents, whose poverty rates are far higher than in the rest of society.  That organisation has stated that low-income families need the family income supplement to be adjusted in order that it makes work pay by reducing the qualifying hours to 15 hours per week and tapering the payment.</p>  <p>  The final myth is that this Bill provides targeted assistance for vulnerable groups in society.  The Bill does not do so and in fact, Social Justice Ireland has declared this budget to be the fifth regressive budget, as it favours the better off in society and there is no denying this point.  Vulnerable groups were sidelined in this Bill and all Members know why.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400045#SS00300"><p>I was horrified to hear a Minister deny in a budget speech that inequality had risen and equally, to hear Government speeches stating it had protected young people, old people and the vulnerable because the statistics from the Central Statistics Office tell a different story.  Moreover, all the non-governmental organisations working with those in vulnerable situations have acknowledged that inequality is rising and is doing so because of decisions in recent budgets.</p><p>The European Anti-Poverty Network put it succinctly when it said that the resource measures are welcome but not nearly enough to undo the damage of eight years of policies.  The ESRI has shown that the poorest 10% have paid more than any group.  In its post-budget analysis, Social Justice Ireland indicated that a &euro;6.50 increase across all social welfare payments was needed to combat inflation and that the value of the minimum payment of &euro;188 per week, which has been at that level since January 2011, has been eroded because of a 4.5% increase in inflation.  This is simply taking into account the cost of living as the economy recovers but only for some.  According to one family, the budget did not respond to the lived realities of one-parent families and resources are not targeted at the poorest of children.  </p> <p> I acknowledge that social welfare payments have increased and are going in the right direction but there is an element of giving with one hand while taking back with the other, including the increase of &euro;3 in pensions while the cost of fuel, coal and briquettes continues to rise and the &euro;5 increase in child benefit, which is paid to parents of children in emergency accommodation and to parents on six figure salaries.  The statistic in relation to the number of children living in consistent poverty, which is one in eight, is alarming.  We know that single unemployed people will gain approximately &euro;95 per annum while single employed people will gain in the region of &euro;900 and that an unemployed couple will gain &euro;157 per annum while an employed couple will gain &euro;1,500 per annum.  While all gains are welcome, it is important they are proportionate to need.</p> <p> The increase in the minimum wage is also welcome.  This means a full-time worker on the minimum wage will get a gross increase of &euro;1,000.  However, we know that low pay affects many workers.  Currently, there are 80,000 people in employment who are living in poverty.  The new minimum rate remains more than 25% below the proposed living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour.  </p> <p> I always look to see how disability groups react to the budget.  Unfortunately, that group has not welcomed this budget.  The people concerned are bitterly disappointed and deeply concerned.  While acknowledging that there was some long-awaited relief, they believe the budget is not likely to lead to employment for anyone with a disability over the coming years, resulting in an increase in inequality for them.  </p> <p> The community platform issued a statement containing four tests for budget 2016, which are interesting.  Will it redistribute income towards the poorest 20% of the population and compensate those who have lost most over the last seven years?  Will it strengthen access to quality employment?  Will it provide the funding needed to restore and strengthen services of vital importance to people on low income?  Will it put in place mechanisms to ensure that all areas of policy addressed in the budget will reduce poverty and inequality?  Sadly, there is no positive answer to those four questions from this budget.</p> <p> There is need for a return to full financial transparency from multinational companies.  We have made a step in this direction through the agreement on country to country annual reporting but not in the public domain.  We need a stronger commitment to closing the tax loopholes in this area and to addressing tax avoidance and tax evasion.  We saw the increase recently from the multinationals.  While in theory 12.5% is the tax rate, in practice, it is much less than that.  It is reckoned that a minimum effective tax rate of 6% for corporations would bring in an additional &euro;1 billion in tax revenue.  We need that revenue.  If we had it, the answer to those tests by the community platform would be different.  One can only imagine what the Minister could do if she had that &euro;1 billion at her disposal for social welfare.  We know that some of the multinationals take the perks and the breaks and then move on.  I referred previously to the situation at Medtronic and the 150 to 200 employees who will lose their jobs this week.  During Private Members' time some months, I put forward proposals around new ways to draw up budgets, including human rights analysis and equality proofing of budgets prior to their introduction.  In that way, the four tests from the community platform could be answered.</p></speech>

The word "poverty" is often trotted out and used as a clich&eacute; to describe all sorts of situations.  Poverty is a serious issue.  When talking about what is poverty and what is not poverty, we must be sober-minded and straight and ensure we address it in a fair manner, so as not to depress people.</p>  <p>  Reference has been made many times to poverty, money, budgets, social welfare payments and so on.  Poverty will not be eradicated through the provision of additional money alone.  That is for sure.  We all know that taking two families in similar circumstances in receipt of the same social welfare income, one family will manage and the other will not.  How to take people out of poverty is a complex issue.  As I said, money is not the only answer in this regard.  There are many people coping, although that is not to suggest that is an attractive life.  If we are to tackle poverty in a meaningful way, we need to look not only at social welfare payments but at services, supports and so on.  </p>  <p>  We all know - I am sure this has been alluded to here previously on many occasions - that for many low income households taking up employment is a deterrent because if they do so, they will lose incidental benefits such as a medical card and so on.  I am sure everybody welcomes all of the inroads that have been made in terms of the reduction in the rate at which people pay the universal social charge, USC, and a reduction in the rate at which people start to pay tax.  I particularly welcome the new emphasis on child care and the reality in this regard for young couples in terms of fees while at the same time repaying large mortgages.  Many of these couples are financially strapped despite the fact they are working.  As a modern society, in which there is no nuclear family to rely on, we need to develop our child care system more.  I do not think anybody disagrees with that.  I welcome the interdepartmental report that issued in this regard and would like to see it implemented.  I also welcome the child care provisions announced in the budget.</p>  <p>  Many people have sneezed at the increase in the pension and the fuel allowance and at the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus.  I do not think those people realise what an increase in payment as opposed to a decrease in payment means to people.  It means a lot.  It behoves us to do the best we can for older people.  I hope that at some stage we will be able to assist them further by way of reintroduction of the telephone allowance, which meant a lot to many people.  Things are moving in the right direction.  There are many people who want to talk others into depression, from which they appear to get some political gain.  The increases provided for in the budget mean real money that will benefit people and it is very welcome.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the increase in the national minimum wage, the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs employment has also increased.  Some 126,000 new jobs have been created.  That is positive news for people and there is more of that to come.  If we stick to the steady path we are on, employment will continue to increase.  Everybody knows there is no magic wand that will fix our problems.  We have endured a lot.  Being a member of the Opposition has been the easiest job in the world during the past few years, although I am not sure it did a great job of it.  Much of what the Opposition had to say during that time was pure populism.  However, that is perhaps the nature of politics.</p>  <p>  I welcome this legislation and compliment the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, on their achievements in what is a tough portfolio.  It has also not been an easy time for the people working in the area of social welfare.  I welcome the emphasis on trying to support people into employment.  As more jobs are created, I would like to see people with disabilities being supported more in getting back into employment.  We are increasingly becoming a more inclusive society.</p>  <p>  There are two particular issues in the area of social welfare that I believe need to be addressed, including the discontinuation of child benefit in respect of children who reach the age of 18 years while still attending secondary school.</p><p>Cuts have been made throughout the system in recent years and we all know the reason for that.  Let us consider the rationale for this cut.  If one has a child in secondary school, that child still needs to be supported and maintained, particularly if the family is on social welfare and suddenly finds it has to cope with this significant cut in its income.  If the child is not in school, he or she would be entitled to jobseeker's allowance of &euro;100 per week, or he or she could be going to college.  Quite a number of people are affected by this cut.  In the interests of fairness, if a child continues in secondary education, the parents should be entitled to some form of child benefit until the child reaches the age 19 or 20, in recognition of the need to support the child and having regard to the additional funds that are provided through child benefit, which support families.  I would like the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, to examine this measure.  There is no logic to this cut given that if the child left school and could not get work, he or she would get jobseekers's allowance or if he or she was to go to college, he or she could get a higher education grant.  If children stay in secondary school, they still have to be maintained and looked after by their families.</p> <p> The second issue I wish to raise relates to JobBridge.  A woman raised this issue with me in my constituency clinic this week.  Aside from participants in the scheme gaining meaningful experience, a traineeship and progressing towards work - I am aware that much has been done to tackle any abuses in the system - there has been progression from the scheme, which I welcome.  Some people clearly have benefited from participating in JobBridge; they got a break and the crucial experience they needed.  My concern is that the approach to the way JobBridge is being rolled out is that one size fits all.  The woman who called to my clinic is a lone parent with two children.  She has a degree and is anxious to get experience in a certain type of work.  She has been offered an internship but if she takes it up, she will not get the back to work family dividend nor will she get any family income supplement or a stamp.  She is trying to improve her circumstances even though she could have decided to rely entirely on the State.  There is no public transport in my constituency and this woman will have to travel to get work experience and will have to put &euro;50 worth of diesel in her car every week.  That is a cost of &euro;50 a week on top of everything.  She will have to find a childminder.  She an awful lot on her plate as a single parent.  I could not tell her I thought this was a fair situation, that is, that she is not being supported in her efforts.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, in particular, has been vocal on the issue of supporting women - who, in the main, tend to be lone parents - back into the workplace but taking up an internship could put them into poverty.  They are not in the same position as a young person who is living at home and may still have the support of his or her parents and be gaining that benefit.  There must be a reality check about lone parents, particularly lone mothers in that type of situation where they are trying to improving their circumstances.</p> <p> I have no doubt the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Burton, will seriously examine these issues which are impacting on people's lives in a real way.  These people are trying to improve themselves and the circumstances of their families and to create a better future for their children.  I would like to think we are always moving towards a point where we are trying to address shortcomings in the system, although I know there always will be shortcomings and more will be revealed.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the last few budgets have been very difficult for everyone.  As a result of the disastrous policies of Fianna F&aacute;il, this country was left bankrupt and unable to fund its day to day requirements, which resulted in the introduction of the dreaded troika programme.  However, those difficult budgets paved the way for our exit form the bailout programme, reduced our public debts and paved the way for real economic recovery, which can be seen by the fact that we are the fastest growing economy in Europe.  It is vital that we keep this recovery on track and, in doing so,  provide much deserved relief to Irish taxpayers, who have sacrificed so much in recent years to get this country back to financial independence.</p>  <p>  We must not only provide tax cuts but we must also improve our public services, including providing more nurses and doctors in the health service, more affordable child care, reducing classroom sizes and have a more efficient public service.  We must never go back to the Fianna F&aacute;il boom and bust policies or move to the high tax and high spend policies of Sinn F&eacute;in.  We must be sensible and take only affordable steps that will keep our recovery going and bring even more benefits to Irish households.  We must protect the recovery that is taking place.  Even though we are the fastest growing economy in Europe, unemployment is still too high at 9.4%.  We need to get more people back to work in jobs that are sustainable.  </p>  <p>  I am delighted that my own county of Louth is performing very well in terms of job creation and the fact that it gets one in ten of all new jobs as a result of foreign direct investment proves this.  In my hometown of Dundalk, we are fortunate to have many high calibre employers, including eBay, PayPal, Sales Sense and National Pen, which this week announced the creation of more than 80 new permanent positions in its Dundalk call centre.  I know from my dealings with constituents the effect getting meaningful employment can have on the individual concerned and also on his or her family.  There is no doubt that employment is the most effective way of improving the quality of life for those involved.</p>  <p>  A sensible approach has been taken to this budget.  The measures outlined are affordable and will not overheat the economy.  Unlike our colleagues on the opposite side of the House, Fine Gael has a proven track record in managing the economy.  This budget will secure our recovery and create even more jobs.  We have already exceeded our forecasts on job creation.  The tax cuts announced will no doubt encourage emigrants to return home and this, in turn, will attract even more foreign direct investment which, as we all know, will attract even more jobs to this country.  It should be noted that over five budgets, this Government has restored our public finances without taxing jobs, a key election promise, and created more than 125,000 jobs since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs in February 2012.</p>  <p>  The income tax cuts announced in the budget are fair and spread the benefits of recovery.  For a working family of two middle income earners, on around &euro;50,000 each, these changes mean an extra &euro;2,300 in their pockets each year.  Other measures announced in the budget include the following measures.  The capital gains tax entrepreneur relief will mean a decrease in capital gains tax for entrepreneurs from 33% to 20%.  In terms of the knowledge development box, there is a lower 6.2% rate of corporation tax on profits from patents and copyrighted software, which will encourage research and development to take place in Ireland.  We are making work pay to increase jobs through cuts in the lower universal social charge rates and bands and a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage.  We are making child care more affordable and removing barriers to work, including free preschool for children from the age of three until primary school, the provision of 8,000 extra community child care scheme places, the introduction of two weeks' paid paternity leave and a &euro;5 increase in child benefit.  We have a new &euro;27 billion multi-year capital plan to address emerging infrastructural bottlenecks in the economy which will create an additional 45,000 jobs in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  This is a fair budget with everyone benefiting from tax cuts.  Extra funding is being provided for key services.  Extra funding is being provided for housing, with an extra &euro;69 million for social housing and an extra &euro;17 million to tackle homelessness.  NAMA will build 20,000 houses over the next five years.  Extra funding is being provided for health, with free general practitioner care for the under 12s and a &euro;900 million increase in health funding.  There will be 2,260 extra teachers and a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio from 28:1 to 27:1.  There will also be 600 extra Garda recruits.  There is fairness for low earners in that they gain the most through the universal social charge cut and the 50 cent minimum wage increase.  Lower earners will gain more under the Government's tax cuts than under the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  A &euro;20,000 earner only gained &euro;255 under Fianna F&aacute;il but that earner will gain &euro;493 under this Government through the universal social charge and pay related social insurance cuts.  Fine Gael's universal social charge cuts are worth more to an ordinary family - for example, &euro;717 for a family on &euro;45,000 - than Sinn F&eacute;in's populist property tax of &euro;405 for houses valued under &euro;250,000 and water charges cuts of &euro;160.  There is fairness for the self-employed in terms of a new tax credit worth &euro;550, which moves them towards equal tax treatment with PAYE workers.  The budget provides fairness for families with the decrease in inheritance tax by increasing the threshold and freezing the local property tax until 2019.</p>  <p>  I would like to put on the record that this Fine Gael-led Government has been responsible for turning the fortunes of this country from the brink of bankruptcy to where we are today, with the fastest growing economy in Europe.</p></speech>

It is also welcome to speak on a Social Welfare Bill which does not contain any cuts but, instead, welcome restorations or partial restorations of important and vital payments.  This Bill is a sign of our improving economy and recovery.  It does not solve every problem in social protection nor does it contain every restoration or reform.  However, it is the first real step back in the right direction.  It is prudent and responsible, keeping with the overall budget presented to us several weeks ago.  The fact the Opposition does not know whether to criticise it as a giveaway budget, or as a budget which does not do enough, demonstrates in itself the responsible and even approach the Government is taking with our recovery.  This is evident in this Social Welfare Bill which provides for the restoration of important payments, such as child benefit and the respite care grant.</p>  <p>  During the troika&rsquo;s time in this country, the Government had to make difficult decisions and tough choices which directly affected ordinary citizens.  I remember vividly the budget in which child benefit was reduced.  It was a difficult time.  Commentators and many Opposition politicians felt the country was moving towards a second bailout with no end in sight.  When we, in the Labour Party parliamentary party, made our feelings clear about these reductions at the time, we were told that when the economy improved, we would be able to restore payments.  With income and tax receipts ahead of expectation, this budget was the first opportunity to begin to restore payments.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection for being true to her word and beginning the restoration needed for payments in social protection.</p>  <p>  The Christmas bonus being restored to 75% is a real boost to social welfare recipients, as well as to local economies.  Many studies have shown over the years that this money is, by and large, reinvested in local towns and villages.  When I welcomed the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection to Swords last week, we visited the Swords senior citizen centre where there was welcome for the increase in the State pension, the fuel allowance and, in particular, the Christmas bonus.  These restorations and increases will make a real difference to pensioners.</p>  <p>  In its pre-budget submissions, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed nothing in respect of the Christmas bonus.  It also proposed nothing in respect of the fuel allowance but the Labour Party has secured a &euro;2.50 increase per week to this payment, in addition to the living alone increase announced last year.  We have not only protected the bus pass, we have increased its funding by &euro;3 million to meet increased demand with no eligibility change to the scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il offered nothing in this area except stoking fears among older people that the bus pass could be cut or revoked.  This bitter tactic over the years has done nothing but heap needless extra worry on older people.  It certainly was not the action of a responsible Opposition as promised by Fianna F&aacute;il and quickly forgotten as it reverted to pure populism.  We are making responsible progress with this recovery.  We are seeing a continued decrease in the unemployment rate, now down to 9.3%, or, in real terms, 203,000 people.</p>  <p>  This is still not good enough but the trend is clear and confidence is returning.  The evidence is there and the recovery is happening.  That is beyond argument.  We are delivering in government.  There is a recognition that this Government has done a good job.  The Labour Party continues to play an important role in this Government, fighting and delivering for ordinary people.  When things were at their toughest and tough budgets had to be delivered, we kept in.  We kept fighting on the promise that once the economy turned and we could afford to do so, payments would be restored.  Some did not believe this would happen.  Some criticised us for being a party that held a secret desire to implement cuts, that there was some magical alternative to expenditure cuts that we were deciding not to choose.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p>  <p>  The Opposition has demonstrated continued lack of direction and competence on budgetary matters.  It doubted a recovery was possible and now denies it exists.  Our fragile and still delicate recovery cannot be entrusted to the populist charms of Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in.  If we are to fully realise a recovery and to ensure further restorations for those most vulnerable, including older people, young families and young workers, and if we are to continue to strengthen workers&rsquo; rights, tackle low pay, make key social reforms, broaden free primary care and invest in key transport projects such as metro north, then it is vital that a sensible and progressive left party such as the Labour Party is there to deliver it.</p>  <p>  We are restoring this country back to where its people deserve to be.  I am proud of the Labour Party&rsquo;s role in doing so.  Listening to Opposition speakers today, and in previous budget contributions, I am both amazed and amused at their capacity to magnify and exaggerate the impact of any cut of any size on those affected but dismiss it as being minuscule and totally insignificant when it is restored.</p></speech>

Any debate on social welfare must take place in that context and we need to focus on that.  In fairness, I acknowledge the Government has provided some supports, particularly for the self-employed, in this budget.  The self-employed are the risk-takers, the ones who set up a business, try to make a living and then employ someone else.  The majority of employed people are employed by those individual risk-takers.  They are the ones who have, at the end of the week, to come up with an additional wage packages, whether it is two, three, five, ten, 15 or 20 wage packets.  They then have to pay the State the money it is due before they can put anything on their own table.  If we are going to get back to full employment, they are the people we need to support and to encourage.</p>  <p>  In fairness the Government has restructured supports for businesses.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has a one-stop shop which is very effective in indicating the supports available to small businesses.  What we need in this country is an ethos of supporting risk, of encouraging people to gamble and set up a new business.  It is disappointing to see that many start-ups are now relocating to the United Kingdom because of the tax structure here but also because the safety net is not in place to support those who take the risk.</p>  <p>  For every business that is set up, nine of them will fall flat on their faces.  We need to ensure we can pick up those pieces, support those individuals, dust them off and get them back up again.  That is why I have consistently raised the issue of allowing the self-employed to make additional voluntary contributions, so they can access supports when they fall down through illness or injury.  I know the Government has talked about it but we yet have to see movement on this.  This should also be extended to self-employed people if their business goes to the wall and they become unemployed themselves.  I am disappointed the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has dismissed that.  Her defence was that nine out of ten self-employed people who applied for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance between 2009 and 2011 received the payment.  However, it was drummed into the self-employed that there were no supports available to them and there was no point in them applying for social welfare.  It was only those who were really on their uppers who applied for social welfare.  I have come across numerous families where there was genuine poverty and where they believed they were not entitled to a social welfare payment.  However, they were fully entitled to it and got it eventually.  Many more suffered through that and did not apply because of that misconception.  It is important that proper supports are put in place for the self-employed.  These are the people who will create the jobs and sustain our economy in the long term.  We need to support them when they fall on hard times.  It is disappointing there is no provision for this in the legislation.</p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise concerns the lack of pension entitlements for F&Aacute;S supervisors.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, has responsibility for small businesses and collective bargaining.  During the passage of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill in the House, he stated the Labour Court will be able to initiate a review of pay and pension conditions and make recommendations to the Minister.  Accordingly, if the Minister is happy with the process that has been employed, he can sign an order bringing them into force.  In 2008, the Labour Court made a determination, recommending that a scheme be put in place for the provision of pensions for supervisors and assistant supervisors in F&Aacute;S community employment schemes.</p><p>Both the State's side and the employees' side of that case were heard fully and the court made that recommendation.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, has said in this House that Dunnes Stores should go before the Labour Court to deal with its industrial relations issues and use the industrial relations mechanisms available.  The State's industrial relations mechanisms have made a recommendation that the State provide pension entitlements for community employment scheme supervisors, yet the Government ignores it saying it will create a precedent for other private organisations in receipt of State funding.  I would like to see the evidence behind that assertion because I have not seen it to date.  </p> <p> In 2007 the benchmarking implementation group did not give public servants any additional payment on the basis that they had access to pension entitlements.  The community employment scheme supervisors did not get an increase at that stage on that basis.  They did not, at that time, have an entitlement to a pension.  They feel there was a legitimate expectation at the time that they would be given access to pension entitlements.  Will the Minister of State examine this issue?  The community employment schemes were established by Government in the 1990s.  It was subsequently forced into establishing private companies and the Government is using that fact as a mechanism by which to turn its back on the supervisors. </p> <p> Today Bank of Ireland announced that it no longer wants customers.  It stated that unless people are withdrawing &euro;700 in cash from a bank branch they are not to come near it.  We have addressed this matter previously but the Minister of State's officials in his Department wrote to pensioners advising them that the most efficient way for them to access their money and for the Department to send the money to them is if they open a bank account into which the money could be paid.  Not only does the Bank of Ireland no longer wish to deal with cash customers in its branches, in my part of the country, County Roscommon, and many other rural counties, Bank of Ireland does not want customers on certain days of the week either.  Given his Department officials were so anxious to write to pensioners asking them to provide their bank account details and encouraging them to use the banks instead of their local post offices, will the Minister of State now write to those customers to whom the Department is electronically transferring money pointing out to them the huge risk associated with continuing to use their Bank of Ireland accounts and encouraging them to go to their local post office?</p> <p> I have seen it before but what is going to happen is that older people will take out their cash and keep it in their homes.  We have enough gurriers going around the country raping and plundering rural Ireland and pillaging communities at the moment without adding an extra incentive.  We should not be encouraging older people to take out cash and allowing those individuals that are coming from urban centres, mainly in Dublin, to rob older, vulnerable people in their homes.  I urge the Minister of State to issue that directive to his officials.  He should encourage them to tell their customers - the people in receipt of welfare payments - not to do business with Bank of Ireland and to return to their local post offices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1190" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400049#WW00200"><p>I welcome the partial restorations of pension payments under sections 3 and 4 and Schedule 1, the partial restoration of child benefit payments under section 7, the restoration of the respite care grant under section 6, the partial back-tracking of the family income supplement earnings threshold under section 8, the changes to the carer's allowance under section 9 and the amendments to certain PRSI credits and earning thresholds under section 10 of the Bill.</p>  <p>  It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge these partial restorations, yet it is also disrespectful of the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste to refer to them as increases.  The social impact assessment, based on ESRI's SWITCH model analysis, about which the T&aacute;naiste told us this morning, may show tiny gains under budget 2016, but these partial restorations of levels of benefit and income for some of the most vulnerable citizens come after seven years of brutal austerity and horrendous cuts.  They cannot undo the damage already done to households and individuals.  The basic minimum rate of social welfare has stayed exactly the same throughout this Government's term despite the T&aacute;naiste's input.  </p>  <p>  Sections 3 and 4 and Schedule 1 provide for the partial restoration of a number of payments, including the State pension.  In many interactions with my constituents in Dublin Bay North, I found great disappointment at the &euro;3 a week change to State pensions.  Many told me they were hoping for a &euro;10 a week increase, or at least a &euro;5 increase.  As one senior citizen said to me a few days ago, the increase would barely cover the cost of a daily newspaper.  </p>  <p>  Once again, in the 2015 Social Welfare Bill, the T&aacute;naiste refuses to address the serious cuts to pensions of deferred members of the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, the IASS.  She also has not addressed the serious complaints of the ESB retired staff association and countless other public service pensioners who were left with drastically reduced payments due to austerity levies and other cuts introduced by this outgoing Government. </p>  <p>  What of women workers who spent many years working in the home and rearing families?  For nearly five years, the T&aacute;naiste has singly failed to remedy the unfair predicament of women workers who had perhaps made 15 to 25 years of social insurance contributions.  These women are now being disadvantaged as pensioners at 66 years of age, particularly following the T&aacute;naiste's changes to contributory pension qualification bands.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, has come across that experience as well.  One hard working constituent who has just turned 66 years of age and spent a lot of time rearing a great family is bitterly disappointed that she will receive just &euro;196 per week instead of the higher amount of &euro;233 because the T&aacute;naiste has failed to address this serious issue of gender inequality.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the provision in section 6, amending section 225 of the principal Act, restoring fully the respite care grant from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700.  However, the provision in section 5, renaming the grant as the carer's support grant, is disingenuous.  The Minister of State knows that I was a social welfare spokesperson in this House for a good number of years and we always intended to have a carer's support grant in addition to the respite care grant. </p>  <p>  The Social Insurance Fund is set to increase to almost &euro;8.9 billion next year, recovering from the devastating deficit of almost &euro;2 billion at the worst time of the crash.  The projected surplus of &euro;216 million is welcome but it also reminds us that a huge percentage of the social protection budget comes from workers' weekly contributions.  Neo-liberal journalists and economists like to talk about a &euro;20 billion social protection budget while ignoring the role of the Social Insurance Fund.  In reality, the T&aacute;naiste and her Government have followed the prescription of those reactionary and well-heeled ideologues and relentlessly kept the social assistance budget under &euro;12 billion during the 31st D&aacute;il, with terrible consequences for the most vulnerable sections of our society. </p>  <p>  In her speech this morning, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the cost of administering the rent supplement scheme for approximately 63,800 people and noted that it will be more than &euro;298 million this year.  The Minister of State, in particular, knows that this represents a savage cut in rent supports over the lifetime of this Government.  In 2010, the cost of the scheme, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember, was approximately &euro;520 million to house 96,500 people and families.  The T&aacute;naiste's mantra since 2011 has been that raising rent supplement levels would push up rent levels nationally, yet she has known all that time that the Government could legally introduce rent certainty and regulation.  We know this from the work of Senator Aideen Hayden and various barristers who briefed us and helped push towards the uplifts in rent thresholds.  </p>  <p>  When I called for rent regulation in this House four years ago, we immediately saw bitter hostility to the proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which are the political parties of landlords.  The T&aacute;naiste and her party knew throughout the lifetime of this D&aacute;il that Fine Gael would never agree to rent regulation or certainty.  They also knew Ireland was facing the worst housing crisis since the 1920s, yet the Minister of State and his party persisted in joining and staying in a Fine Gael-dominated Government which has given us five years of paralysis and terrible suffering for homeless families.  I was the only Deputy to stand up in UCD and say not to enter government, that we could be the leader of the Opposition, oppose a Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government, run them out of office and have a government of the left that would look after people and not yield to crazy austerity economics.</p><p>The Minister said this morning that people who vote against this budget will be putting politics before people but it is the Government that has put politics before people.  I apologise to Deputy Creighton for going over time.</p></speech>

While Deputy Broughan and I may not agree on many things, I absolutely admire and respect his integrity and passion.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government made a clear commitment to open up the budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny in a way that would restore confidence and stability by exposing and cutting failing programmes and pork barrel politics.  That was the clear commitment of both Government parties and it is one I believed and thought would be pursued.  Sadly, however, as we saw in the recent budget, and this Bill gives effect to part of it, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a return to both populism and pork barrel politics and, indeed, to the type of Bertie-nomics that brought this country to its knees.  It must be resisted without hesitation on this occasion.</p>  <p>  The budget is hugely disappointing and unambitious.  We have seen nothing new from the Government in terms of a new economic vision or agenda for Ireland, a vision that will lead us to secure and stable economic and social conditions long into the future.  Much of what Deputy Broughan alluded to is absolutely correct with regard to the housing crisis, which both parties in the Government have abjectly failed to address.  I might not agree with the proposal on rent controls or rent caps but there is a clear solution to the problem which, unfortunately, the Government does not have the imagination to implement.  It is very simple - build more houses.  The capital allocations for housing in the budget were paltry.  There is no new thinking in terms of new streams of funding to build housing.  There still appears to be a huge reluctance to deliver community and social housing through local authorities, which is extraordinary.</p>  <p>  My party, RENUA Ireland, was established because we wish to create a clear, stable, secure future in this State for the 425,000 people, or 19% of the labour force, who, as recently as last August, were either in receipt of jobseekers allowance, social welfare support through back to work schemes, in receipt of back to college grants or were participating in a three day working week.  We do not have anything close to full employment in the State and we will not have it for a long time if we do not strive to do better, to be more ambitious and to deliver better and more sustainable outcomes for our citizens.</p>  <p>  We have proposed a new tax environment, an entirely new way to stimulate growth and investment in the economy.  We have proposed a 23% flat tax rate.  It is interesting that the Government's commission on enterprise in 2013 recommended a flat tax rate, which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, dismissed as too radical.  Clearly, for a Government that has no economic vision anything so radical will be rejected without any scrutiny or consideration.</p>  <p>  We believe a number of measures ought to have been introduced in this Bill and in the budget generally.  We favour the reinvigoration, expansion and extension of community employment schemes.  They really work.  They are hugely successful in communities throughout the country, both in urban and rural areas, but they are under-utilised.  They are too restrictive.  The bureaucracy is excessive and means many people who were in community employment schemes have been forced out of them.  That is unfortunate.</p>  <p>  There should be increased access to JobBridge.  In our pre-budget submission, we proposed to develop greater access to JobBridge and to ensure that certain types of companies can offer better training and development opportunities for people through that scheme.  Again, there is no ambition.  There is nothing new or visionary in this Bill to achieve that.</p>  <p>  Everybody will welcome a &euro;5 increase in child benefit.  However, it really sums up the Bertie-nomics approach of this Government, giving a little bit here and a little bit there.  It is not a solution to the huge trauma being experienced by families throughout the country, especially in urban areas but also in rural areas, with regard to child care.  The average cost of child care in Dublin is &euro;1,000 per month.  It is a second mortgage and a huge noose around the necks of families.  It discourages people from having larger families and more children.  That is morally wrong.  It is wrong that people are being punished for trying to balance work with the provision of child care.  A &euro;5 increase in child benefit will do nothing for the families that are struggling to maintain a balance between family life and working.</p>  <p>  There is a great deal more to be said but, unfortunately, I have been limited to five minutes.</p></speech>

This Government inherited a collapsed banking system and a collapsed construction industry.  The Labour Party was the only party that voted against the blanket guarantee.  It is hard to think now that back in 2008, it was possible to vote for a zombie bank such as Anglo Irish Bank which put us in debt to the tune of &euro;32 billion, money that will never be recovered.  That is part of what we inherited in 2011.  We also inherited savage taxes that had been introduced at that time, levies, welfare cuts and the most unkind cut of all, a reduction of &euro;1 in the minimum wage.  In addition, as one can read in the book written recently by Deputy Gilmore, there was only money for five months in the Exchequer.  That was to last for the rest of the year after the Government was elected in 2011.  It was as chaotic and desperate a situation as one could imagine.</p>  <p>  We sought to carefully manage the economy and to protect all the core social welfare benefits that existed at the time.  We built on the strengths that we had.  The result of all of that is we now have the fastest growing economy in the European Union.  We are creating 1,100 jobs weekly, with 130,000 jobs having been created in the past three years.  Unemployment is now at its lowest ebb.</p>  <p>  That was only possible because the people came with us.  It was the sacrifices of the people of this country that made it possible.  It is only right and fitting, therefore, that the people who made those sacrifices benefit now from the recovery that is taking place.  That is the reason this budget has focused in particular on social welfare.  This Bill focuses on social welfare benefits such as pensions paid to older people, increases in the rate of child benefit, the respite care grant, the family income supplement, the fuel allowance, the jobseekers transition payment, the community employment top-ups and the 75% restoration of the Christmas bonus, which is very welcome after a 25% increase last year.  All of that is being done along with a reduction in taxation.  The worst rates of the universal social charge have been reduced and the income at which a person pays universal social charge has been increased again.</p>  <p>  The intention and focus of all of this is to ensure there will be a fair recovery.  That is the thrust of our policy.  That has been shown by the social impact assessment of the welfare and income measures in the budget which was published today.  It shows that there are higher than average gains for the bottom two quintiles, while the smallest percentage gain is in the top quintile.  The social impact assessment shows that households with children will benefit the most from the budget, particularly working lone parents.  Indeed, the ESRI has shown that in contrast with most other crisis countries, inequality has been reduced in Ireland over this period of time.  This was achieved due to the policy choices of this Government.  The OECD figures also show that this country has a progressive taxation system.</p>  <p>  That did not happen by chance.  There were enormous challenges that other countries have been unable to meet.  We have been able to meet and overcome them.</p><p>We have done that in consultation with the people.  It is important we ensure the recovery is fair.</p> <p> I am delighted to welcome the measures in the Bill.  There is a lot more work to be done to ensure inequality and poverty are reduced and we will continue to take further steps to ensure that.  The minimum wage has been increased for the second time and will come into effect in January.  The Low Pay Commission has been looking at these issues and there is now a big push for a living wage on a voluntary basis.  I believe this is an exciting opportunity which we will be able to push ahead very rapidly in the future.</p> <p> I very much welcome the introduction of two weeks' paid paternity leave for the first time in the history of the country.  This is something I would foresee developing into the future.  We will have an equal balance of child care between men and women and the State will have to recognise the importance of the family in this respect, so men can participate fully in the rearing of their children.  This is the beginning of that development.</p> <p> This is a decent Social Welfare Bill which is moving very strongly in the right direction.  I welcome the steps it contains and look forward to further improvements in the years to come.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

It is the hard decisions we took to rescue this country that have resulted, almost miraculously, in the fact that in last year's budget, we were able to at least return 25% of the Christmas bonus.</p>  <p>  The social welfare budget is incredibly interesting given the conditions in which the country found itself.  The Opposition spokespersons who deride the &euro;3 increase say they would have made it a &euro;10 increase or instead of a &euro;5 increase, they would have made it &euro;15.  All of this balderdash comes from people who voted consistently against the measures we were taking in order to rescue this country.  Now, they want us to spend the benefits we have achieved according to their formula of Opposition politics.</p>  <p>  I am very proud that almost five years after the horrors of the circumstances we inherited in 2011, we are now giving something back, and rightly so.  This is happening notwithstanding the fact some economists say we should not be doing it, that this is an expansionary budget and that we should put all of our additional accumulated wealth into paying off debts that were accumulated by previous Governments.  The people who made the sacrifices in this country deserve every penny and more, if we have it, to improve their lot, particularly around Christmas time and the winter period, when people get sick and need additional resources to heat their homes.  That old age pensioners are getting an increase of &euro;3 might not sound a lot but it goes to show we have reversed the trend that was evident when we inherited a bankrupt country.</p>  <p>  I want to applaud Aldi, which has clearly listened to the political debate that has been initiated in this Parliament by the Labour Party, when it raised the issue of a living wage.  Not only did Aldi guarantee its workers a living wage but, hopefully, this will act as an incentive to other employers to recognise the Labour Party policy of looking after workers in low income streams fairly.  It is also important to record that the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, having had to confront the unconstitutionality of the JLCs in the past, by the stroke of a pen, was able to give stability to 55,000 additional low paid workers, such as cleaners and security guards.</p>  <p>  The return of 75% of the Christmas bonus is a remarkable step in the right direction.  There are also other net beneficiaries, which I will not outline because they have already been stated.  However, I would like to highlight the fact that, for example, widows on a contributory pension aged 66 and over will see their rate of payment increase from &euro;230.30 to &euro;233.30 per week.  It is a good increase, and it might be better next time.  I would suggest that what we need is more stability in this country to allow the Government to implement the plans it has set in motion on behalf of the working class and welfare recipients.</p>  <p>  Given we have found an extra &euro;2 billion in additional resources, we might look again at an area of concern, which is that we did nothing to reverse the rates for jobseekers aged up to 26 years.  In addition, we should try to reverse the penalties that have been applied to people who are very sick, in particular the prescription charges for elderly people and sick people using a multiple of drugs, who find it very difficult to survive.  If not in this budget, we should start looking to reverse those charges in the next budget.</p></speech>

After the years of austerity, budget 2015 saw funding for social protection measures begin to increase in order to again start increasing living standards and investments in communities.  Budget 2016 brings further increases for these social protection measures and brings increases through other measures after the austerity of previous years.  With the welcome departure of the troika and the improving global economic situation, the recovery this Government has been driving is beginning to show results, although the amount of money available to spend is still limited.  Within that context, the priority of the Government is to make sure that every household benefits.</p>  <p>  As I said, this process started with the 2015 budget.  The 2016 budget, of which this legislation is a key part, is designed to particularly help low and middle income families, retired people and vulnerable groups.  The social welfare package in the budget has four main aims: first, to deliver welfare improvements for pensioners aged 66 years and over; second, to strengthen supports for all families with children; third, to enhance incentives for employment and to make work pay; and, fourth, to provide targeted assistance for vulnerable groups, such as carers and people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  There will be a &euro;3 weekly increase for pensioners and carers aged 66 years and over.  This is the first weekly rise for pensioners since 2009, almost seven years ago.  In recent years, many pensioners have supported their adult children and families through very difficult times.  They deserve to see their income in retirement increase, now that we can do so.  Just over 1.2 million people will receive the Christmas bonus this year, at a cost of &euro;197 million, which I warmly welcome.  The Christmas bonus will be spent within the local economy.  It will provide a boost not only to the individuals and families who receive it but also to local businesses and the community and it will help the recovery.</p>  <p>  Given it was cut during a previous budget, I am very pleased the respite care grant is to be increased by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700.  The title of the respite care grant scheme is to be changed to the carer's support grant.  From January 2016, the carer's allowance will be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for.  I welcome this measure.</p>  <p>  A new analysis of the budget changes shows that households with children are the biggest beneficiaries from budget 2016, in particular working lone parents.  There will be an increase in the monthly rate of child benefit to &euro;140 from January 2016, which sees further increases on top of the increases already awarded last year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.630" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400052#ZZ00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  When I made my 2016 Budget Statement in the D&aacute;il three weeks ago, I stated the top priority was to keep the recovery going, while providing relief and better services for the people.  The Finance Bill 2015 provides the legislative basis for the taxation measures.  As I outlined on budget day, the taxation measures are just one element of the overall budget package designed to support families.  The Social Welfare Bill the T&aacute;naiste introduced to the House today includes key provisions that will support working families, including increases in family income supplement and child benefit.  The increase in the minimum wage will be introduced on 1 January 2016 and the legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement will be dealt with by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on Committee Stage next week.  The Revised Estimates Volume for 2016, due to be published in December, will outline in greater detail the expenditure allocations and programmes announced by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in the budget.</p>  <p>  Taken together, all of the budget measures are sensible, affordable steps that will keep the recovery going, increase the progressivity of the income tax system and bring benefits to every family.  They have been designed to make work pay, support families and encourage entrepreneurship.  The good news is that the economy continues to grow strongly, the public finances are in a strong position and we will exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact this year.</p>  <p>  The latest Exchequer return figures published on Tuesday are positive, but we know that the job of recovery is not yet complete.  Our recovery is strong, but we must continue to nurture it as the benefits of a growing economy have not yet been felt by all.  There is work to do and the Government and the country continue to do it.  We all know what has to be achieved and it is only natural that we may have different opinions at times as to how best to achieve our objectives.  For me, one of the welcome aspects of budget 2016 is the debate it has generated and the way in which so much information on how it was prepared is in the public domain.  I see this as very positive as it reflects the Government's commitment to openness and transparency.  It also reflects how much we value input from all sides.</p>  <p>  I note, in particular, that Governor Honohan of the Central Bank provided me, as is the norm, with his insights and advice on the economy in advance of budget 2016.  He rightly highlighted some of the key risks facing the economy, including any potential for mismanagement of the public finances and the use of once-off revenue to underpin long-term expenditure commitments.  I strongly point out that budget 2016 represents the first budget under the new fiscal rules which are designed to prevent the boom bust cycles of the past from recurring.  However, the economy is not yet performing at full capacity and for that reason, the Government has introduced a modest fiscal package to reduce unemployment, fix the supply side of the economy and reward and incentivise work.  Under the EU fiscal rules which were adopted into Irish law after the fiscal stability treaty, Ireland must implement a 0.6% of GDP improvement in the structural balance in 2016.  The Department of Finance forecasts show that Ireland will make a 0.8% structural improvement; we are, therefore, doing more than is required.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, one-off proceeds from asset sales such as the State's shareholding in the banking sector cannot be used to finance day-to-day expenditure.  The statistical treatment of such revenue is such that it will primarily be directed towards reducing Ireland's elevated debt level.  This will help to underpin Ireland's fiscal sustainability in the medium term.  I know also that Professor McHale of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, initially suggested we make a 1% structural adjustment because of the position in the economic cycle.  He later corrected the record and acknowledged that only a 0.6% adjustment was required and that Ireland was going beyond this by making an adjustment of 0.8%.  The IFAC will publish a detailed response to budget 2016 in the fiscal assessment report later this month and I look forward to its assessment.</p>  <p>  I would now like to draw attention to some of the main themes of the Finance Bill.  As Members know, the Government has set a key objective for the years ahead of ensuring every family will be better off in employment.  We must strike the right balance between rewarding work for the very lowest paid and keeping the tax base as broad as possible.  My aim is to make it more attractive to return to work, to stay in work, to ensure work rewards individuals adequately and to encourage emigrants to return home.</p>  <p>  From 1 January next year, the Bill will increase the entry threshold to USC from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000, removing over 40,000 workers from the scope of the charge entirely.  It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.  It should be noted that this figure includes individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;13,000 as not all income is within the scope of USC.  Most social welfare payments are not liable to the charge.  The Bill also provides for reductions in the three lowest rates of USC.  The amount of income liable at the second USC rate is also being extended to ensure a full-time worker on the new increased minimum wage will not enter into the third rate of USC which is being reduced to 5.5%.  The Bill also provides for the introduction of an earned income credit to the value of &euro;550.  This will be available to those with earned income who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners across the country, including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach stated, it is essential that work pays more than welfare.  This is the second Finance Bill that has allowed me the opportunity to reduce taxes on low and middle income workers.  The marginal tax rate has reduced to below 50%, to 49.5%, an important milestone on the path to making work pay.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill is also about putting more money in the pockets of individuals and families.  These changes mean that every worker and pensioner who currently pays income tax or USC, or both, will benefit from the budget changes.  Taking account of the tax and expenditure measures, for example, a family with two children on a single income of &euro;35,000 will see take home pay increase by &euro;57 a month owing to the budget; a single person working full time on the minimum wage, earning &euro;17,542, will see an increase of 4.2%, or &euro;708 a year; a family with three children, with the parents working in the civil or public service and earning &euro;55,000 and &euro;50,000, respectively, will have an additional &euro;196 per month in their pocket; while a self-employed worker earning &euro;40,000 will see a gain of &euro;1,002 in his or her annual net income, an increase of 3.5%.  I am sure this package which will deliver modest increases in people's wages from 1 January is one that is supported by the majority of Members.</p>  <p>  I now turn to the further development of the economy.  The Finance Bill will implement the knowledge development box, KDB, as announced in the budget.  The knowledge development box will provide for a 6.25% rate of corporation tax to apply to the profits arising to certain patents and copyrighted software which are the result of qualifying research and development carried out in Ireland.  The Government has committed that the KDB will comply with OECD rules once introduced.  It will be the first and only OECD-compliant box in the world.  The OECD rules allow a third category of assets to qualify in respect of very small companies, namely, those with annual income from intellectual property that is less than &euro;7.5 million and a annual global turnover of &euro;50 million.</p><p>This requires certification by an independent non-tax authority as &quot;patentable but not yet patented&quot;.  The Finance Bill allows this additional category of assets to qualify for the KDB, pending a commencement provision linked with the introduction of separate legislation by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to amend the powers of the Irish Patent Office to allow it to make the certification for the purposes of the KDB.<br/><br/>To provide robust safeguards around the quality of qualifying patents, the legislation allows only patents that have undergone a substantive examination to qualify for the KDB.  To ensure the KDB includes patents granted by the Irish Patent Office, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will also be amending patent legislation to make sure Irish patents include a substantive examination for novelty and innovative steps.  In the meantime, the Finance Bill will allow all unexamined patents - Irish and otherwise - that have been certified by an independent patent agent to be included in the KDB for one year only, until 1<sup></sup>January 2017.<br/><br/>Also announced in the budget was the introduction of country by country reporting as agreed as part of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS project.  This introduces a requirement for multinationals with Irish parent companies to file country by country reports on their income, activities and taxes with the Revenue Commissioners.  This measure illustrates Ireland's commitment to implementing the OECD BEPS recommendations.<br/><br/>The Finance Bill also introduces a petroleum production tax.  The Bill will bring into law the fiscal terms for oil and gas recommended in the Wood Mackenzie report published by the Government in June 2014.  The tax will apply to licences issued from June 2014, including licences arising from the 2015 Atlantic margin licensing round.  In another measure to support industry and entrepreneurs, the three year corporation tax relief for start­up companies is being extended to the end of 2018.<br/><br/>Before moving to examine the Bill in detail, I remind Deputies that, as I indicated in my Budget Statement, my Department will be examining the various proposals made in the report on the marine taxation review.  As regards the recommendation on the provision of appropriate tax treatment in order to support a proposed new decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels, subject to examining the detail of any proposed scheme as approved by the European Commission and to the Government being re-elected, appropriate amendments will be made to the tax code in next year's Finance Bill to assist in maximising the take-up of such a scheme.  <br/><br/>In respect of the recommendation to extend the seafarer's allowance to fishermen, my officials advise that this would not be permitted under state aid rules.  However, they will work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to consider if a different relief to target fishermen could be implemented in next year's Finance Bill.<br/><br/>I will now take Deputies through the Finance Bill.  They will appreciate that in the limited time available I cannot describe every section in detail.<br/><br/>Part I of the Bill deals with the universal social charge, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.<b></b>Sections<b></b>2 to 4, inclusive,<b></b>provide for the income tax and USC changes I have outlined.  In addition, section<b></b>2 provides for an exemption for employees for USC on employer contributions to a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, to bring the USC treatment of such contributions into line with employer contributions to occupational pension schemes.<br/><br/>Section 6<b></b>provides that vouched expenses incurred by non-resident, non-executive directors travelling in the course of their duties will be exempt from income tax.  <br/><br/>Section 8<b></b>extends the home renovation incentive for a final year, to end on 31 December 2016.  <br/><br/>Section 10<b></b>provides that an employer may provide an employee with a single annual non-cash benefit to a maximum of &euro;500 without applying PAYE, PRSI and USC to that benefit.  It is intended that this measure will commence on 1 January; however, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to enable it to apply from the date of publication of the Bill. <br/><br/><b></b>Section 13<b></b>removes from the list of specified reliefs, for the purposes of the high earners' restriction, the exemption from income tax for profits and gains from the management of woodlands.  <br/><br/>Section 15<b></b>amends the film tax credit following the budget announcement of an increase in the cap on qualifying eligible expenditure to &euro;70 million per production.  It also clarifies the definition of broadcaster and amends the information that will be published on films qualifying for the credit.  The latter change will bring our disclosure obligations into line with those specified in the relevant EU state aid guidelines.  These amendments are subject to EU approval under state aid rules.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 16<b></b>makes a number of amendments to the employment and investment incentive, EII.  Certain changes to the terms of the incentive are made in order to ensure it complies with the European Commission's general block exemption regulations from a state aid perspective.  In addition, the incentive is being extended to companies which already own and operate nursing homes for the purposes of raising funding which can be spent on extending the nursing home or residential care units associated with that nursing home.  These changes were included in a Financial resolution and came into effect on budget night.  Therefore, the increased amounts companies can raise under the incentive in a single year and in their lifetime which I announced last year have come into effect.<br/><br/><b></b>Section<b></b>17 makes a number of amendments to certain tax reliefs for farmers.  First, it extends the period for which stock relief is available until 31 December 2018.  Second, it makes a number of amendments to the registered farm partnership regime.  Third, it introduces limited tax relief for succession farm partnerships.<br/><br/>Section 18<b></b>gives effect to the legislation which implements the petroleum production tax, PPT, which I have mentioned.  The PPT will be charged on net income on a field by field basis, on a sliding scale between 0% and 40%.  In addition, a minimum PPT of 5% of the field's gross revenue, net of transportation costs, will apply to fields in each year of production, regardless of the profitability ratio.  The tax will be payable annually, with the scope for more frequent payments in the light of developments in the Irish offshore.  It will increase the maximum marginal tax take on a producing field from 40% to 55%.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 20<b></b>amends the due date for the filing of the annual encashment tax return which had been due on 20 January.  This date is being pushed out to 15 February as the original deadline was proving difficult for industry to comply with.  <br/><br/>Sections 24 and 26<b></b>make minor amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 regarding the introduction of Irish collective asset management vehicles and alternative investment funds.  These changes bring the tax regime into line with the regulatory regime and ensure Ireland will maintain its place as an internationally renowned centre for funds management and administration.<br/><br/><b></b>Section<b></b>25 amends the tax code in respect of capital allowances for certain aviation service facilities to comply with EU state aid <i>de minimis </i>guidelines.  The amendments were brought into effect by a Financial resolution on budget night.  <br/><br/>Section<b></b>27 provides that additional tier 1, AT1, capital instruments are to be regarded as debt instruments for corporate and withholding tax purposes.  This will ensure the same tax treatment will apply to these instruments as in other European countries.  <br/><br/>Section<b></b>28 extends the three-year start-up corporation tax relief for new start-ups commencing to trade in the next three years.<br/><br/><b></b>Section<b></b>30 contains the legislation that will implement the knowledge development box, as I announced in the budget and to which I referred earlier, and will provide for a 6.25% rate of corporation tax to apply to the profits arising to certain patents and copyrighted software which are the result of qualifying research and development carried out in Ireland.</p><p>Section 31 introduces country-by-country reporting in line with the approach agreed as part of the OECD BEPS project.  This introduces a requirement for multinationals with Irish parent companies to file country-by-country reports of their income, activities and taxes with the Revenue Commissioners.  It will apply for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and the first reports must be filed with Revenue by the end of 2017.  The section also enables the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations setting out further details of the information required to be filed and to provide for reports to be filed by other group companies in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>Section 32 transposes an amendment to the EU parent subsidiary directive into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to include a general anti-avoidance rule.  Section 33 replaces the existing capital gains tax relief applying to disposals of qualifying business assets by individual entrepreneurs and business people with a simplified relief which will apply from 1 January 2016.  It is a capital gains tax rate of 20% rather than the general rate of 33% to the first &euro;1 million of qualifying gains.  <br/><br/>Section 34 amends section 29 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 under which a capital gains tax charge arises where a non-resident disposes of certain specified Irish assets - mainly land or buildings - or shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value from such assets.  The amendment will prevent an avoidance practice whereby a substantial amount of cash is put into a company shortly before a sale of shares in that company so that on the date of the sale, the shares derive their value mainly from the cash and not from the land or buildings.  <br/><br/>Section 36 amends an anti-avoidance provision designed to prevent individuals avoiding capital gains tax by transferring property to controlled companies abroad.  This amendment will modify the section to allow for <i>bona fide</i>transfers undertaken for commercial reasons.  <br/><br/>Section 38 amends tax provisions which provide for a deferral of tax when an Irish company is restructured and amalgamated involving the transfer of business to another Irish company or when there is a transfer of assets within a group of companies.  The amendments are aimed at preventing the misuse of the reliefs to avoid the payment of capital gains tax on the chargeable gains arising when assets are disposed of to a third party.<br/><br/>Section 40 provides for the budget announcement that the reduced rate of alcohol product tax available for beer brewed in small breweries may be claimed up-front or by repayment.  This is subject to a commencement order and will come into operation once the Revenue Commissioners have made the necessary changes to the collection system.  This section also updates the definition of &quot;counterfeit goods&quot; to reflect the new definition in EU legislation.  <br/><br/>Section 41 clarifies and extends the powers of Revenue officers to search premises, vehicles and computers, including mobile phones, for information which may be of value in the investigation of excise offences.  This includes the introduction of new definitions and extends provisions for the retention and interrogation of computers and mobile phones for information which may be of value in the investigation of excise offences.  <br/><br/>Section 42 gives effect to the increase in the rates of tobacco products tax which came into effect on budget night.  Section 45 amends the definition of &quot;motor caravan&quot; in VRT legislation to provide that the Revenue Commissioners may prescribe the dimensions of what constitutes a motor caravan for VRT purposes.<br/><br/>Part 3 deals with value added tax, VAT.  The VAT-related amendments in the Finance Bill do not signal any major policy changes and are largely technical in nature.  Their primary focus is to prevent fraud, provide clarity and correct anomalies in the existing VAT consolidated Acts.  Section 49 extends the VAT reverse charge mechanism to certain supplies in the wholesale gas and electricity sector and to gas and electricity certificates.  This is a fraud prevention measure.  Section 57 extends the VAT exemption for betting and betting exchange services to such services when provided to customers located outside the State.<br/><br/>Part 4 deals with stamp duties.  Section 59 adds an additional qualification for the purposes of the young trained farmer stock relief.  The new qualification is the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Agriculture awarded by Dundalk Institute of Technology.  Section 60 extends the relief from stamp duty on transfers of agricultural land, including farm houses and buildings, to young trained farmers until 31 December 2018.  <br/><br/>Section 61 provides for the new stamp duty charge on cash cards, combined cards and debit cards.  The current position is that stamp duty is charged annually at the rate of &euro;2.50 for each cash and debit card and &euro;5.00 for each combined card, subject to certain exemptions which are to remain unchanged.  This flat rate charge is being replaced with a 12 cent charge on withdrawals of cash from ATM machines using these cards, which will be capped at either &euro;2.50 in the case of cash and debit card withdrawals or &euro;5 in the case of combined card withdrawals.  The new basis of charge and the revised reporting requirements for issuers of cards are to come into effect on 1 January 2016.<br/><br/>Part 5 deals with capital acquisitions tax.  Section 64 increases the group A tax-free threshold for transfers of gifts and inheritances from parents to their children and below which capital acquisitions tax does not apply by about 25% from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 with effect from 14 October 2015.  <br/><br/>Part 6 deals with miscellaneous matters.  Section 66 will provide for the capital gains tax treatment of return of value payments received by those Irish shareholders in Standard Life whose options for such treatment got delayed in the post beyond the deadline date set by the company and who were defaulted into receiving payments which would otherwise be treated under income tax rules.<br/><br/>Section 67 inserts a new subsection into section 2 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 following the signing into law of the Marriage Act 2015 to provide for the tax assessment of same-sex married couples.  Section 70 implements Council Directive 2014/107/EU, which is known as DAC 2, into Irish law.  This directive deals with the exchange of financial account information and is based on the OECD common reporting standard which Ireland legislated for in last year's Finance Act.  The section also provides for the repeal of the savings directive.  The savings directive has been effectively replaced by DAC 2 and is due to be repealed by the end of the year.  <br/><br/>Section 71 deals with Revenue's powers to request information about taxpayers from third parties and financial institutions.  The amendments will ensure that Revenue are able to seek the same information regardless of whether a taxpayer conducts business through their own name or through an online user name.  As with Revenue's existing powers, information can only be sought by Revenue where it is reasonable to believe that the information is relevant to a tax liability.  These amendments will also ensure that Ireland continues to comply with international best practice on the exchange of tax information.  <br/><br/>Section 72 will require both property managers and public offices to return additional information on let property that can be used to assist the Revenue Commissioners in their profiling and targeting of tax non-compliant persons.  Sections 77 to 80 provide for the new fuel grant to replace the excise repayment on fuel element of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which was declared incompatible with the EU energy tax directive by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The introduction of the fuel grant will ensure that no beneficiary of the scheme loses out as the result of the court's decision.  This measure will cost &euro;10 million in 2016 and in a full year.  These sections also ensure that the grant shall not be liable to tax and provide for an offence for furnishing false information for the purpose of receiving the grant.</p><p> Section 81 provides that the water conservation grant, administered by the Department of Social Protection, will be exempt from taxation.  Section 83 relates to the National Treasury Management Agency's need to buy back and cancel securities as part of its regular operations.</p> <p> At this stage, there are still a few matters under consideration for inclusion in the Finance Bill that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, also give consideration to the constructive suggestions put forward during our debate here this week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400055#CCC00200"><p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill 2015.  Under section 61, I see the Minister is making changes to the application of stamp duty on certain bank transactions, including the use of automated teller machines, ATMs.  Under that heading, I raise Bank of Ireland's announcement today setting a minimum over the counter withdrawal limit of over &euro;700 per transaction and a minimum over the counter lodgement of &euro;3,000.  The Minister has made a statement to the effect that he was surprised and feels the changes are unnecessary but he needs to go a step further because many older people, in particular, like to deal with a human being in the bank branch and not a machine.  There is an important security issue at stake.  If any undesirable person observes what is going on around a bank branch and sees an older person taking money out over the counter that person will know the Bank of Ireland the customer is taking out a minimum of &euro;700.  Similarly, small traders and farmers seeking to lodge money will have to amass a minimum of &euro;3,000 before making a lodgement over the counter.</p><p>This raises a fundamental question about the direction of the banks and banking system which are becoming increasingly impersonal and faceless and the customer relationship is no longer at the centre of banking.  That is why I have consistently called on the Minister to bring forward a White Paper on banking so that we can decide what the direction we want banking in Ireland to take.  For older people, in particular, going to an ATM presents challenges and many simply do not want to do that.  They would prefer to deal with a person in the branch.  If they use an ATM, it will typically give out &euro;50 notes, a &euro;20 note is the smallest given out and people like to have smaller denominations for their every day business.  </p><p>The Central Bank also needs to make its voice heard on this issue.  It has a vital role in consumer protection and should be exercising that function robustly.  If anyone had told the Minister or me even a few years ago that the minimum withdrawal over the counter in a bank would be &euro;700, we would have thought that person had arrived from another planet.  It is ridiculous and the Minister needs to deal with it because it is not fair on older people who rely on that personal contact in their local bank branch.  I could not pass up the opportunity to raise the issue because it is broadly relevant to the Bill.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be opposing the Finance Bill on Second Stage as it reinforces the missed opportunities in budget 2016.  As I said in my budget day speech, this is the last throw of the dice by a deeply unpopular Government desperate to be re-elected.  I want to put the budget in the context of what has been happening over the past 12 months and what is likely to occur in budget 2017.</p><p>Buried deep in the charts which accompany the budget document is a nugget of information that is particularly revealing about the Government&rsquo;s strategy over the past 12 months.  According to information provided by the Department of Finance, and confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question, there will be just &euro;500 million of &quot;fiscal space&quot; available in 2017.  This is one sixth of the pre-election blow-out that has taken place in the past few weeks and indicates a considerable slowdown in the level of tax cuts and expenditure measures which can be introduced after the election.</p><p>At the end of 2014, frightened by plummeting opinion poll ratings in the face of the Irish Water fiasco, the Government took a conscious decision to engage in a pre-election splurge.  This began with a reversal of the planned &euro;2 billion budget adjustment in 2015 and led to &euro;1.1 billion of Supplementary Estimates at the end of 2014 and a &euro;1 billion tax and expenditure giveaway for 2015.</p><p>Already this year the Government has signalled a further &euro;1.7 billion in Supplementary Estimates, without any obvious improvement in services, quite to the contrary in some areas.  It supplemented this with budget day measures amounting to &euro;1.5 billion.  The total of these measures represents an eye-watering &euro;7.3 billion.  So much for the Government&rsquo;s supposed commitment to stability and fiscal prudence.</p><p>According to October&rsquo;s Exchequer returns published yesterday, the State took in &euro;2.47 billion more in taxes in the first ten months of the year than it expected.  This is a very impressive figure but on closer examination, it is revealed that 82% of this additional revenue came from corporation tax which has proved to be one of the most volatile tax headings in recent years.</p><p>I note the comment of the Revenue Commissioners in <i>The Irish Times</i>today that the surge in corporation tax receipts is due to &quot;strong trading conditions&quot; and not &quot;one off factors&quot;.  However, it is indisputable that we have seen a boom in exports to record levels helped by a very benign international environment.  The domestic elements of the economy are still below peak levels.</p><p>Ireland remains vulnerable to a change in international factors.  We have benefitted in particular from the weak euro, low interest rates, falling energy prices and the European Central Bank&rsquo;s quantitative easing programme.  The reversal of any or all of these factors could hit Ireland particularly hard as a small, open, trading economy.  The economic turmoil in China during the summer was a stark reminder of the unstable nature of the global economy.</p><p>A considerable proportion of the additional expenditure announced in the run-up to the election is being funded by corporation tax receipts and increased dividends from the Central Bank.  These two windfalls may not be repeated in future years.  The risk associated with treating corporation tax receipts as permanent can be seen from the fact that the top ten taxpayers account for about a third of overall corporation tax revenue.  Should international trading conditions deteriorate, we could see these revenues evaporate.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, made warnings along similar lines before the budget.</p><p>By contrast, income tax and value added tax, VAT, were only marginally ahead of expectations this year to date while excise duty is actually below what was forecast.  In fact, each of these categories underperformed in October but this was masked by the strong corporation tax receipts.</p><p>The Government has failed to articulate a strategy as to how to deploy this extra money effectively.  Its record in four key domestic issues: housing, health care, mortgages and water, has been abysmal.  It is unable to point to a single concrete achievement in these areas, despite spending being massively ramped up.  There have been over-runs in health expenditure, which have failed to deal with waiting lists and accident and emergency department overcrowding.  By contrast the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, for all his talk, has failed to spend one third of the capital budget allocated to him.  All of this points to a Government without a proper plan for the management and execution of public spending.</p><p>There is now a real risk that an incoming Government will be forced into an immediate reining in of runaway spending in order to comply with EU expenditure rules.  This will also considerably reduce the scope for any further tax cuts.  In his speech to the annual Fine Gael presidential dinner in Dublin, the Taoiseach said, &quot;if returned to Government, Fine Gael will put complete abolition of the USC at the centre of the most radical overhaul of personal taxation in a generation.&quot;  He went on to commit to that within the lifetime of the next Government. </p><p>When I checked the data with the Minister for Finance he informed me that it would cost &euro;2.64 billion to abolish the universal social charge on incomes up to &euro;70,000 and a further &euro;1.4 billion to abolish it completely.  The same Minister for Finance has told us that the fiscal space for 2017 is &euro;500 million and &euro;1.1 billion for 2018.  If the fiscal space continues at a similar pace for the following three years, it will be impossible for the Taoiseach to achieve his aim unless he intends to raise general income tax rates or starve public services of additional resources.</p><p>It would seem the Taoiseach's claim on the USC is as credible as his story of deploying the Army to protect ATMs.</p> <p> I now turn to the actual tax changes introduced in this budget.  The highest gain will be for people earning &euro;70,000 and above.  They will be better off by &euro;902 a year, or 2% of net income.  By contrast, someone on &euro;25,000 will gain &euro;227, or 1% of net income.  I debated this point at length with the Minister on "Prime Time" on budget night.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed an alternative tax package combining an increase in personal tax credit and an increase in the lower USC bands which would have seen every worker earning over &euro;21,000 get an increase of &euro;293 a year and the highest percentage benefit would have gone to those earning between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000.</p> <p> This reason we took this approach for this budget is that we wanted to undo some of the damage that was done by the flat tax increases which were introduced in recent years.  When the Minister for Finance was raising taxes, he abolished the PRSI allowance, costing every employee &euro;264 a year, and introduced water charges and local property tax without reference to ability to pay.  It is worth recalling that almost 60% of income earners earn less than &euro;30,000 a year.</p> <p> A further aspect of the Government's tax strategy which is worthy of highlighting is the failure to index tax bands and tax credits.  This is a stealth tax as it has the effect of raising government tax revenue without explicitly raising tax rates.  Taxpayers will pay more tax as the income tax bands are not being adjusted to take account of expected inflation.  According to the budget document, the Department of Finance projects that inflation will be 1.2% in 2016.  To protect taxpayers from the loss of real income from inflation, the entry point for the top tax rate should have been increased by &euro;400 for a single person and &euro;800 for a married couple.  The various personal and PAYE tax credits should also have been increased to mitigate the impact of inflation.  Presumably the Minister felt he would get less of a publicity hit from using &euro;300 million of the revenue he had available for tax cuts for the less glamorous option of indexing bands when compared to cutting USC rates.  In simple terms, the Minister announced income tax reductions of &euro;595 million but the budget booklet confirms the Department expects to claw back over half of this in 2016 by not indexing tax bands and credits.</p> <p> However, on a relative basis the biggest losers from this are those earning around the entry point to the top rate, &euro;33,800.  Many extra taxpayers will be now pushed in to the top tax bracket if they get a modest pay increase.  In his response, the Minister might like to indicate how many middle income earners will now be pushed into the top tax rate as a result failure to index bands.  He might also explain the basis of his calculation that an extra &euro;300 million in tax will actually be collected by not indexing the tax system.</p> <p> I welcome the introduction of an earned income tax credit for self-employed persons.  It is something we called for two years ago.  However, the budget announcement of an earned income tax credit falls well short of full equality for the self-employed and non-PAYE income earners.  I understand that 111,600 people will benefit from the change in 2016.  A previous parliamentary reply indicated that extending the PAYE tax credit to all non-PAYE income earners would cover 284,600 cases.  As a result of the restricted nature of the measure being introduced in 2016, 173,000 people living on income derived from savings and other non-PAYE sources will continue to be discriminated against in the tax code.  Not for the first time, we find that the Government is overselling a measure it announced on multiple occasions.  </p> <p> The tax change introduced in the budget to help the self-employed is a lot less generous than the Government would like us to think.  Those who are living solely on income deriving from savings are effectively excluded.  Those people exist and they will still be discriminated against, particularly so on low incomes.  For example, in 2016, a person with &euro;15,000 of income who does not qualify for the new tax credit will pay over ten times more in tax, PRSI and universal social charge than a PAYE employee.  The actual cost of the measure to the Exchequer is just &euro;18 million in 2016, which underlines its limited nature.</p> <p> In so far as possible, people on the same income should pay the same level of tax.  Restricting the credit to what is referred to in the tax code as case I and case II income earners is difficult to defend on equity grounds.  This is not the only aspect of the tax and social welfare code where the self-employed are discriminated against.  They are subject to a means test for jobseeker's support if their business fails and they have no entitlement to other essential welfare supports such as illness benefit and occupational injuries benefits, which employees can avail of from contributions made at the PRSI class A rate.  As a country, we have a long way to go before we can say that we truly value the self-employed and their contribution to the economy.</p> <p> I welcome the modest increase in the home carer tax credit in the budget, bringing it up to &euro;1,000.  A home carer tax credit may be claimed by a married couple where one spouse cares for a dependent person such as a child, an elderly person or a person with a disability.  While Revenue makes efforts to automatically give this tax credit to some taxpayers, only 81,000 taxpayers benefited from it in 2015.  I suspect that tens of thousands of people are not claiming this tax credit because they are simply not aware of it and the Government and Revenue need to do a lot more to make people aware of the existence of this tax credit and the ability to claim it.  For example, a married couple with one earner is likely to be entitled to the credit if either spouse is engaged in the care of a family member, including a child in respect of whom child benefit can be claimed.  In particular, Revenue should be obliged to explicitly bring this &euro;1,000 credit to the attention of each taxpayer who may be entitled to benefit from it.  Revenue has access to sufficient information to make a reasonable assessment as to whether a couple would be entitled to this credit, which would amount to an extra &euro;1,000 in their pockets. </p> <p> There is another way in which the tax code can be amended to help married couples with one earner.  This goes back to the debate around individualisation.  Currently, a spouse can effectively transfer just &euro;9,000 of their standard rate band income to their spouse out of a total of &euro;33,800.  This has not been amended in a number of years and an increase in this amount would be recognition that work undertaken in the home is valued by the State.</p> <p> We have heard a lot about housing and rent certainty, or the lack of it, since the budget.  It is worth remembering that there was no mention of any form of tax relief for first-time buyers this year, despite the odds being stacked against them.  The DIRT rebate scheme introduced last year has had no impact and mortgage interest relief is being abolished from 2017.  A total of 118 applications from first-time buyers for a refund of DIRT paid over the previous four years have been received.  Just 74 applicants have received a refund of DIRT, amounting to around &euro;74,880.  It is now clear that the scheme to provide relief from DIRT for first-time buyers has not worked. In fact, the outcome is an insult to the thousands of people who are struggling to buy their first home.  A chronic lack of supply, exorbitant interest rates, which we have consistently highlighted, the abolition of mortgage interest relief and the new Central Bank rules on mortgage deposits have combined to make home ownership increasingly unaffordable and unattainable for young people.  These are the real issues that the Government should be focused on if it genuinely wants to assist people who aspire to own their own home.  The announcement of the scheme 12 months ago was well intentioned but it has failed to deliver.</p> <p> The budget also failed to deliver for savers.  The Minister for Finance is continuing to preside over a punitive tax regime for savers with no relief provided in the Finance Bill.  The Government has increased the tax on deposit savings by a massive 14% from 27% to 41%.  In addition, anyone with unearned income such as deposit interest, rent, dividends, etc., of greater than &euro;3,174 has to pay an additional 4% PRSI on deposit interest, bringing the total tax on interest to a whopping 45%.  Combined with effective zero rates of interest, it means people are effectively earning little or nothing from saving.  This is a punitive tax on people who have prudently saved money which itself has already been taxed in full.  Nearly &euro;2 billion has been collected in DIRT since 2011.  The combination of tax and inflation means real returns for savers are now negative.</p><p>By contrast in the UK, the first &pound;1,000 of interest on savings is fully tax-free.  The rates offered on tax-free products by the NTMA in Ireland through An Post have been slashed under pressure from the banks, as has been revealed through responses to freedom of information requests.  There has been no respite for savers looking for a decent return on their money in this country.<br/><br/>DIRT is a tax that is applied in a discriminatory manner.  Any single pensioner earning just over &euro;18,000, or &euro;36,000 for a couple, is liable for DIRT at the full rate of 41% even if they are only subject to income tax at 20%.  For low-income individuals under the age of 66, the situation is even worse.  Low-income earners, who have put aside some savings, pay the same rate of DIRT as millionaires, which is unfair.  Savers have also been hit in other ways through the hated levy on their private pension funds, which is now thankfully coming to an end, increased capital gains tax rates and the emasculation of the credit union sector.  All in all, the Minister has made it increasingly difficult for families to put money aside for their future economic well-being.<br/><br/>Despite a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>prior to the budget that a separate inheritance tax threshold of &euro;500,000 was to be introduced for the family home, the actual change to thresholds was relatively minor.  Inheritance tax has been a bonanza for the Government coffers.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have increased the number of people liable to pay inheritance tax by 34% and since 2010, the amount raised has more than doubled.  In 2016, the Government expects to take in &euro;375 million in tax on gifts and inheritances even after the change to thresholds in the budget.  This is &euro;5 million more than the amount it expects to raise in 2015.<br/><br/>The coalition has twice reduced the threshold for CAT as well as increasing the rate from 25% to 33%.  In the 2013 budget, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, justified these tax increases by saying, &quot;I am introducing a number of measures in the area of capital taxes to ensure that people with wealth make a fair contribution to the State.&quot;  The threshold that will apply in 2016 is still &euro;52,000 below that which applied when the Government came to power.<br/><br/>Recent increases in property values mean that far more families are now being drawn into the inheritance tax net.  In many areas, modest family homes can no longer be passed from parent to child without imposing a very large inheritance tax liability, which can often result in the forced sale of the property.  This penalises those who have prudently saved their already-taxed income during their working life so that they can pass it on to their children.  Our budget submission made proposals in this area which we will pursue further in coming months.<br/><br/>There is a need to apply an annual indexation to thresholds based on the residential property price index to give greater certainty in the application of CAT.  The change made in budget 2016 was a step in the right direction but further reform of inheritance tax rules are needed in the years ahead.  This should also encompass an easing of the restrictions on the dwelling home relief which allows a beneficiary to inherit a house free of inheritance tax if they have resided in that home for three years prior to the disposition and continue to live there for six years afterwards.  Currently, there is a very strict test that a parent cannot also have lived there during this period unless they are compelled by old age or infirmity to depend on the child.  I take this opportunity to commend my colleague, Senator Mary White, on her ongoing campaign to lift the burden of inheritance tax on families in Dublin and throughout the country.<br/><br/>The extension of CGT relief in the Finance Bill is restricted to first &euro;1 million of gains.  In contrast, the UK has a simpler, clearer and more attractive relief which applies a flat 10% rate to entrepreneurial gains of up to &pound;10 million.  The &pound;10 million limit has increased threefold since the relief was introduced.<br/><br/>I would like to raise a number of technical issues on the design of the draft measures.  An individual may hold shares directly in a company which is engaged in a business or may hold shares in a holding company which in turn holds shares in companies engaged in business.  The provisions currently recognise this.  However, the manner in which the definition of &quot;holding company&quot; is framed means that it is practically impossible for someone to claim eligibility for the relief where the corporate structure for the business, which they have owned and grown, happens to have a holding company.<br/><br/>For example, it has been suggested by some professional advisers that, in addition to holding shares, holding companies also hold bank accounts to discharge their running expenses, raise debt and lend debt to their subsidiaries and often oversee and manage the activities of subsidiaries.  In doing so, they may charge and recoup management expenses whether in the course of the conduct of a services trade or otherwise.  This means that the assets of a typical holding company do not consist wholly of shares which comprise 100% of the shares in other companies engaged in business, as the draft provisions currently require.<br/><br/>As such, the owner of the company in this instance would not be eligible for the relief.  One possible solution is to adopt a group definition approach similar to the UK approach which has worked successfully.  In addition, the requirement for a three-year period of ownership ending on the date of disposal is too long and is uncompetitive.  The restriction that in order to qualify shares are not listed on official lists of exchanges is an unnecessary limitation on the commercial freedom of a company as to whether to list its shares.<br/><br/>In other tax measures to assist with the creation of jobs, the Government has tinkered with the rules to allow companies to raise more finance under the scheme but has not made it more attractive for investors.  This is the real difficulty with how it operates.  The scheme could be improved by increasing the &euro;150,000 annual investment limit for individuals, removing EII from the high earners' restriction permanently, providing full income tax, USC and PRSI relief in the year of investment and excluding EII shares from the charge to CAT.<br/><br/>There are currently two points at which personal retirement savings accounts are disadvantaged when compared with occupational pension schemes.  The Finance Bill, as published, provides for an exemption for employees from USC on employer contributions to a PRSA to bring the USC treatment of such contributions in line with employer contributions to occupational schemes, which addresses the first major disadvantage suffered by PRSA holders.  However, a second anomaly exists in that in the case of PRSAs, both employer and employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits allowable for tax relief.  In the case of occupational pension schemes, only the employee contributions are subject to Revenue limits.  I hope the Minister will examine this issue on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>The Companies Act enacted last year was a welcome consolidation and simplification in the law relating to how companies operate.  It was particularly useful for small companies.  One aspect the Minister may wish to consider is the apparent inconsistency between the rules governing when a company needs to carry out a statutory audit under the Companies Act and those required by Revenue.  Under the new Companies Act, a company with a turnover of less than &euro;8.8 million is not required to carry out a statutory audit.  However, as I understand it, the rule applied by Revenue is that, once a firm has a turnover of greater than &euro;100,000, a full audit is required.  There is a clear case for consistency in how the law is applied and this issue should be examined.<br/><br/>Last year, I tabled amendments to the Finance Bill to provide an income tax exemption in respect of certain expense payments for relevant directors.  I cited the example of a company based in Ireland which appoints an overseas director.  If that director travels to Ireland several times a year for board meetings, Revenue's current position is that the director's flight and hotel costs represent a BIK and he or she ought to be subject to income tax on them.  By contrast, a European civil servant coming to Ireland for a meeting with the Department of Finance would not pay BIK in such circumstances.  Therefore, there was an inequality of treatment with businesses looking to avail of overseas expertise to improve their firm.<br/><br/>I welcome the changes that have been introduced in the Finance Bill as a positive step towards acknowledging the critical role that non-executive directors and boards play in the leadership and governance of businesses in Ireland.  However, I note concerns that have been expressed about the inequities created by the restrictiveness of its application to non-resident non-executive directors only and the serious anomalies that such a restriction will create for domestic Irish business and Ireland's entrepreneurial culture in general.<br/><br/>There is an increasing demand for contractors across the ICT and health care sectors.  However, multinationals looking to expand are finding it increasingly difficult to fill posts.  The current interpretation of the normal place of work by Revenue is disallowing professional contractors their business travel and accommodation expenses for tax purposes.  This is being done even though the expenses are incurred wholly and exclusively in undertaking their work.  Contractors are not freely moving to sites where the work is.  Instead, they are trying to find work locally even if it is not the most suitable.  This means that skills are not being deployed where they are most needed.  This is an area on which submissions have been made to the Minister and I ask him to examine them very closely.<br/><br/>On Committee Stage, we will deal with the issue of the knowledge development box and some outstanding issues concerning the local property tax.  While I welcome the deferral of the revaluation which was meant to happen in 2016, I am very disappointed that Dr. Thornhill has done a U-turn, as such, on the deductibility of the local property tax for income or corporation tax purposes by landlords of rental properties.  I will also comment at a later date on the fiscal council comments, which the Minister addressed in his opening remarks on Second Stage.  Overall, I look forward to a constructive and detailed engagement with the Minister and his officials on Committee Stage of Finance Bill 2015.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400058#FFF00200"><p>For the fifth year in a row we are presented with a regressive budget followed by a regressive Finance Bill.  This is the also the fifth year in a row for us to get the big lie, that there is no alternative.  When one takes a step back and looks at the Finance Bill in its entirety and asks who benefits the most, the answer is very clear.  This is a budget and Finance Bill for the multinationals, big business, the banks and high earners.  It is a Fine Gael budget and Fine Gael Finance Bill from start to finish.  There is no alternative to that in Fine Gael's eyes.  This is a slightly smaller Finance Bill than that to which we have become used in recent years, but the unfairness crammed into it is all the more remarkable for that.  The Government plays around with figures on percentages lost and gained, but it cannot deny the fundamental fact that the Finance Bill will make the wealthy even wealthier while doing very little for low earners or for the real middle-income earners.  This year, once again, my party was the only one to provide a costed alternative.  Quite literally, Sinn F&eacute;in is the only alternative to regressive budgets.</p>  <p>  In the interest of a fairer society we proposed to remove regressive taxes such as the water charge and property tax, to take workers earning under &euro;19,572 out of the USC net and to provide relief to the self-employed.  We also sought to ask those who earn upwards of &euro;100,000 individually to pay a little bit more.  However, that runs contrary to everything that Fine Gael and Labour stand for.  They went down another path, one that is clear in the Bill, namely, rewarding the top 14% of taxpayers, 27,996 of whom earn more than &euro;200,000, by &euro;902 each at a cost to the State of almost &euro;182 million.  That is the choice the Minister made when faced with all the choices presented by society.  Today, we read on the front page of newspapers about elderly people on hospital trolleys.  That is not unique to today; it will happen tomorrow, the next day and the day after that.  The situation will continue to get worse and deteriorate in the coming weeks and months because of the decisions the Government has made.</p>  <p>  Time and time again we hear from Fine Gael and Labour about the difficult choices they have made.  The choices in budget 2016 seem like natural reflexes to them.  When one has favoured the wealthy five times in a row it must become less of a hard choice.  According to Social Justice Ireland budget 2016 widened the gap between rich and poor by &euro;506 a year.  This measures the gap between the disposable income of a single unemployed person and a single person on &euro;50,000 per annum, but if compared with people on higher salaries the gap between rich and poor has widened even more.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s alternative budget was crafted with the intention of creating a fair society.  We proposed to increase the provision and quality of public services, the removal of regressive taxation such as the water charge and property tax, and to take thousands of workers out of the USC net, while at the same time supporting and encouraging the self-employed.  What is wrong with asking those with the deepest pockets to pay a little bit more?  It would have meant that those individuals earning more than &euro;100,000 would pay a little bit more.  However, that runs contrary to what Fine Gael and Labour stand for.  They went down another path, one of rewarding the top earners.  That is their choice.  It is not the republican choice.  Our choice would be different.  Once again the choices have been made and the Government tries to stand over them.  It stands over the non-abolition of water charges and instead gives &euro;182 million of tax breaks to the top 14% in society.  The Government stands over the non-scrappage of the local property tax while allowing another loophole for multinationals to avoid paying their fair bills.  The Government had choices but in the same way as it did every year, it went for the regressive choice.  This year is no different.</p>  <p>  While we welcome the introduction of the self-employed tax credit, it lacks the progressive nature of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal in our alternative budget, namely, where the credit for the self-employed would be tapered off between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000.  I also note the Minister&rsquo;s lack of commitment to alternative funding routes for self-employed entrepreneurs.  Sinn F&eacute;in is fully committed in that regard.  We proposed that the startup relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, scheme would be broadened to allow the self-employed access the scheme.  I encourage the Minister to take the suggestion on board.</p>  <p>  In the removal of income from woodlands from the high earner's restriction and the broadening of the employment scheme it is clear that Fine Gael and Labour have once again shown their commitment to the high earners in the State through their weakening instead of strengthening of the high earner's restriction.  The high earner's restriction was introduced for the specific purpose of limiting the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions by high income individuals.  However, Fine Gael and Labour think it pertinent to remove income from woodlands from the list of tax reliefs subject to the restriction, as if high earners are under big pressure at the moment and need access to more money which is exempt from taxation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Fine Gael and Labour made the tough choice to increase the overall investment limits under the employment investment incentive, which allows investors to obtain income tax relief on investments of up to &euro;150,000 per annum.  Broadly, the Government has increased the annual and overall investment limits for a company from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;5 million and from &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million, respectively, and extended the required minimum holding period from three years to four years.</p>  <p>  The Bill also expands the availability of the relief to allow companies that already own and operate nursing homes to raise funds for the purposes of expanding their existing facilities.  Let us compare that to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment to restrict the high earner's loopholes.  We will table amendments on Committee Stage but, as I have said every year since taking on the role of finance spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, we will go through the farce and the motions on Committee Stage.  The debate will be good, as it always is.  I enjoy the debate across the committee room, but we are not allowed to propose certain amendments.  Most of the amendments we propose will be ruled out of order by the Chair.  This year will be no different because the Government refused to accept the legislation I put before this House to allow for a constitutional amendment to allow for Members other than on the Government side to propose motions or amendments to legislation that would place a charge on the State.  We must do that if we are serious about political reform.  The Minister made the same argument when he was on the Opposition benches a number of years ago.  If we are serious about political reform then that constitutional restriction should be lifted.</p>  <p>  The accelerated scheme of allowances for industrial buildings provides for tax depreciation over a seven year period instead of the normal 25 year period.  That is something we must examine.  Accelerated tax deduction is allowable on buildings costing up to &euro;5 million where the expenditure is incurred by a company and &euro;1.25 million where the expenditure is incurred by an individual.</p>  <p>  When I initially heard about the changes to the petroleum production tax, I thought the Minister had finally done the right thing with regard to ensuring the proper taxation of earnings from natural resources, in particular given the report issued by the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture which recommended a major overhaul of Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms for its offshore oil and gas.  The committee recommended that the tax for future licences would be increased to 40% for small commercial discoveries, 60% for medium commercial discoveries and 80% for very large discoveries.</p><p>What is proposed here clearly falls short of what the committee recommended and Ireland still has one of the lowest tax returns from natural resources of any state.  In addition, there is no discussion or mention of retrospective action being taken against existing oil and gas fields, including the Corrib gas field, as these changes will apply in the case of any oil and gas exploration licences first awarded after 18 June 2014.</p> <p> Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the issue of Bank of Ireland and I ask the Minister to outline what he intends to do with Bank of Ireland.  What will the Minister do, given he has a major shareholding in that bank which he holds in trust on behalf of the people, as this bank again has turned around and is screwing the very same people who rescued it?  The changes announced today that are being defended by Bank of Ireland simply are not acceptable.  It is not acceptable that it has closed the door to thousands of its customers in respect of over-the-counter services below certain thresholds.  I ask the Minister to do something in this regard.  The Minister sat on his hands in respect of mortgage distress, bankruptcy terms and all the rest but on behalf of people who are contacting my office and, I am sure, those of other Deputies, I ask him to do something.  These people are deeply concerned that a bank that was rescued by this State and which only exists today because a Government stepped in and rescued it, is shutting its doors on customers because they simply do not have enough euro to deposit across the counter or because their withdrawals are below &euro;700.  This matter must be addressed and the Minister should make strong comments and should face down the bank in this regard.</p> <p> I find it disturbing that the Minister did not see fit to support my legislation concerning mortgage interest rates, which would have benefitted thousands of hard-pressed families, but did find time in this Bill to legislate for further tax deductions for the banks.  The Finance Bill 2015 proposes to allow a deduction for certain interest-dividend payments made in respect of capital instruments issued by banks to satisfy their tier 1 capital requirements.  As no deduction has been permitted for interest payable with regard to any tier 1 capital until now, this represents a significant change of course.  The Bill confirms that banks will now be able to get a tax deduction for costs associated with a tier 1 instrument held for capital requirements and furthermore, as a result of this Bill, an exemption from interest withholding tax for the banks also will apply to some of these instruments.  If there is one ideological commitment holding this coalition together, it is a commitment to the banks.  I welcome the extension of the bank levy but as the Minister is aware and as Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated, it could have been significantly increased.</p> <p> The knowledge development box is a matter that will be dealt with in great detail on Committee Stage but it illustrates the Minister's lack of commitment to domestic small and medium-sized enterprises, which still face a myriad of problems from legacy debt to problems accessing credit.  I am informed by industry sources that this regime will be of limited benefit to the domestic corporate sector given the significant costs associated with investing in and generating the qualifying intellectual property, as well as the requirement to engage in substantive operations that have a high added value for the Irish economy.  One must be upfront and not shy away from the debate on Ireland's corporation tax regime and reputation.  Sinn F&eacute;in is for an all-Ireland corporation tax rate.  It is for Ireland being a responsible member of the international community with no cloud hanging over its tax reputation.  Sinn F&eacute;in is for foreign direct investment and for domestic indigenous enterprise.  It is for being a responsible member of the international community and not simply a cog in the system that deprives the developing world of tax due to it.  However, I am far from convinced that the Government shares that aim and am deeply concerned, as I have stated repeatedly, at what the Government is planning with regard to the knowledge development box.</p> <p> Budget day also saw the announcement that the local property tax would be frozen until 2019, that is, until after the next general election.  Is it not a strange commitment for a tax that is based on value to be frozen for so long?  The truth is this tax is unpopular and rightly so.  As a system of funding local government, it has failed miserably and likewise, the attempt by the Government to remove the burden of this tax from houses infected by pyrite has been a disaster and this should be remedied as soon as possible.  I also take this opportunity, given the dreadful situation that has emerged for the residents of Longboat Quay, to call again for them to be exempt from the property tax until their homes are safe.  When I put this question to the Minister, the reply was not satisfactory.  Basically, as if the residents of Longboat Quay did not have enough problems, the reply from the Minister states it is up to each individual to determine whether his or her home is habitable and therefore to make that decision for himself or herself.  If the residents make the wrong decision or if they read the legislation wrongly, then the Revenue could come after them.  Second, it is up to them to decide what is the value.  The Minister needs to lead in this regard.  It is not the fault of the residents of Longboat Quay that they found themselves in this position.  These homes are not supposed to be habitable but as people are living in them at present, the Minister should make a clear statement to the effect that these homes should be exempt from the local property tax and each resident should notify the Revenue that his or her accommodation does not fall under the terms set down in the legislation.  However, the Minister has not done this and basically has placed the responsibility on the individuals, which carries consequences in respect of the Revenue itself.  If anyone from the Revenue is listening, perhaps the Revenue Commissioners might take a lead on this by examining the legislation and, given what is known about Longboat Quay, writing to some of these individuals to tell them their homes are not eligible under the local property tax.</p> <p> The best the Minister could have done about the housing crisis in this Finance Bill was to increase the tax clearance threshold.  It is incredible that the Government had no announcements on alleviating pressure for renters struggling to make ends meet or to deal with the issue of supply in the housing market.  However, once again showing where the priorities of Fine Gael and the Labour Party lie, the Minister did find time for an amendment that has been made to increase the threshold for obtaining a CG50 tax clearance certificate from &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million for houses.  The CG50 clearance provisions provide for a deduction of 15% from the purchase price of certain property-related assets, to be paid over to the Revenue Commissioners in certain circumstances where a tax clearance certificate is not provided by the person disposing of the assets.  However, there is an exemption where the proceeds are below the threshold, which now has been expanded by the Minister.  Many people look to the budget to see where the priorities of the State lie.  These people would quite rightly have been disgusted by the lack of action on rent certainty or house building in the budget.  At a time of a severe housing emergency, the total capital spend next year will decrease.  This is a damning statistic, which shows where the priorities of the Government lie.</p> <p> I welcome, following Sinn F&eacute;in's lead, the reduction in this Bill to the administration charge applying to the export of a vehicle for the purposes of the vehicle registration tax, VRT, export repayment scheme, from &euro;500 to &euro;100.  However, the Minister did not go as far as Sinn F&eacute;in, which called for its complete abolition.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the amendment regarding the alcohol products tax rebate for microbreweries, which may now be claimed at source.  Unfortunately, the Minister again did not go as far as Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal in its alternative budget, which was to broaden this relief by 5,000 hectolitres.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports this burgeoning indigenous industry, which is a good example of a fine indigenous industry.</p> <p> On budget night, I supported the move to lower the burden of commercial road tax.  However, I must now ask whether the urgency behind the motion passed that night had anything to do with the then pending Supreme Court decision, of which Members now are aware, in which that court ruled that for the purposes of motor tax, the trailer weight of a vehicle should not have been included in the weight.  This is a major rule that could have serious repercussions on revenue and the entire commercial motor tax system.  Does the Minister intend to bring forward legislation on foot of that decision?  Is the State liable in respect of repayments or may there be calls on the State to deal with overpayments of motor tax by certain individuals?</p><p> I note the abundance of amendments in relation to the funds industry.  Had the Minister focused as much time on legislating for those facing home repossessions or being screwed by high mortgage repayments as he did on the funds industry we would all be in a better place.  The effect of the changes announced in the Bill is to apply to the Irish Collective Asset management Vehicle, ICAV, the same tax treatment from which Irish fund structures that are defined as collective investment undertakings currently benefit, and includes the application of tax exemptions in respect of Irish income and chargeable gains.  Elsewhere the Bill clarifies that the appointment of an Irish Alternative Investment Fund Manager, AIFM, to a non-Irish alternative investment fund does not bring the AIF within the charge to Irish tax in respect of income or gains from the fund solely as a result of the AIF being managed by an independent Irish manager.  I am on record expressing doubt about the need for the ICAV legislation and the manner in which it became law.  Only months later we are back fine-tuning it.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be keeping a close eye on these sections.  </p> <p> The increase in the minimum wage is welcome but we all know that this 50 cent increase will soon disappear.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for a &euro;1 increase in the minimum wage but, again, all we got was a minimalist approach by the Minister and the Government in this regard.  I welcome other positive aspects of this Bill.  For example, I am happy that the home renovation initiative has been extended and I welcome the introduction of country by country reporting.  I welcome also the increased powers for Revenue, which will hopefully yield greater income for the State.  The increase in the carer's credit is also welcome.</p> <p> I recently reviewed the statistics on lending over the last couple of months by our financial institutions.  It is clear that the banks are not lending to households.  There has been a decrease month-on-month in regard to mortgage lending for homes.  Short-term lending of less than one year is the only area in respect of which there is growth, although in the context of overall contraction.  I assume this relates to extension and renovation of houses under the home renovation scheme.  There is a serious problem in regard to lending to households by our financial institutions which needs proper scrutiny in order that we can identify what needs to be done in this regard.  </p> <p> Last week to little fanfare the Central Bank published an economic letter which states that the affects of austerity were underestimated because many households cannot borrow at low interest rates and that the crisis in financial markets caused by zero interest rates also affected others - which were unstated but are presumably businesses.  In its jargon, "The cumulative multiplier over the 2011-2013 period amounts to 0.7 and 1.0 in the baseline, but increases to 1.3 with a reasonably calibrated financial accelerator and a crisis-related increase of the share of credit constrained households".  It goes on to say, "In the latter scenario, fiscal consolidation would be largely responsible for the further decline in GDP relative to its pre-crisis trend during 2011-2013".  This is just one of the latest reports that shows up the argument that austerity did not work and that it was not necessary.  Members on the benches opposite seem to think they have done the right thing, that all the cuts were just hard choices they had to make.  No right thinking person would, of course, agree.  What is clear is that when some fiscal space does become available the priority is not to build a fair recovery, rather it is to cut taxes in a way that makes the wealthy even wealthier.</p> <p> The budget, we were told by the Minister and the Taoiseach, would be pay-back time.  Were water charges or the property tax abolished?  The answer is "No", because when they said it was payback time they meant it was payback time for the top earners.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have sold the family silver.  They have watched hundreds of thousands of our people emigrate and have stripped our communities of resources in the name of austerity.  They now have no intention of building a fair recovery.  The Government has decided on one policy and one policy only and that is tax cuts. It has set out its stall.  It is about hollowing out our society and building an unfair and an unjust Ireland for our children.  </p> <p> We have all heard the harrowing stories in regard to services.  We hear all the time in our constituency offices of children with disabilities being unable to access the type of supports they need from the health services.  We have all heard the stories about children going to school without breakfast.  We have heard from teachers that these children are easily identifiable because they are the children who cannot concentrate, who grip their pencils weakly and who continually turn around because they are unable to focus owing to a hunger in their bellies.  The Government could have addressed all of these issues or it could at least have begun to address them.  It could have started by addressing some of the issues that present in this capital city, including that right now, at 8 p.m., there are many parents who, because they and their families are homeless, are tucking their children into bed in a one bedroom hotel room, similar to the type of room in which I stay while in Dublin when on D&aacute;il business, and all because this Government had different priorities.  </p> <p> I do not understand why we have a Finance Bill before us that provides &euro;182 million of tax breaks to those individuals that earn over &euro;70,000 per annum.  It does not make any sense.  At the same time, there were over 400 people on hospital trolleys today.  The Minister can pretend as the Taoiseach did earlier today that this is the result of hospital managers not doing their jobs.  The Taoiseach said earlier that he did not know why this problem is not being solved given hospitals have been provided with sufficient money, nurses and doctors to do so.  I am sure when it comes to the housing crisis the same will be said, that the county council managers and councillors will be accused of not doing their job despite the fact they are being given the money and so on to do so.  That is all bull and we know it.  </p> <p> This country has been starved of resources for the last number of years.  What the Minister is now doing is setting us down a very dangerous path.  We know that tax receipts have increased and that an additional &euro;2 billion in corporation tax has been taken in so far this year.  That might continue for the next number of years because with the introduction of country by country reporting, for which we have been calling for many years, companies will be trying to get their act together before they have to start reporting next year.  Under questioning from me the officials in the Department of Finance said they could not understand why there has been a 40% increase in corporation tax.  It is not that companies are 40% more profitable.  We all know that they could not all be 40% more profitable.  There are serious questions remaining around the economy yet this Government has set out a stall of cutting stable taxes, which is income tax, while at the same time starving public services of necessary funds to deal not only with demographic pressures but enhanced service provision and to address crises in a number of key areas such as housing, education and, in particular, health.  We all know that there are other crises coming down the road in terms of the pension time-bomb and a number of other issues.</p> <p> If all of this goes belly-up the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will be long gone.  He will be sitting back enjoying his pension and, hopefully, his retirement.  If this goes belly-up who will pay the price?  What the Government is now doing is exactly what Fianna F&aacute;il did.  Professor Honohan and others, including members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, have pointed out to the Minister the dangers of what he is doing in terms of cutting stable taxation and starving public services of the type of investment needed.  What he is doing is reckless.</p> <p> When we make the claim to the Taoiseach that homelessness is this Government's policy, that patients on hospital trolleys is its policy, we do so because we believe that these are the choices made in this Finance Bill.</p><p>The Government has chosen to cut taxes for the wealthiest in our society.  It cannot have it both ways.  We cannot fix the crisis in these areas if the Government continues to cut taxes for people who are not demanding that it do so.  The Government can tinker around the edges of the homelessness crisis, the health crisis and the trolley crisis but it will not solve those crises if it does not have the political will to invest the necessary resources.  It is very clear that the Government has done what it has done and that it believes it is popular in terms of the forthcoming election.  However, it is playing with fire in terms of the economy.  The Government has chosen a very dangerous road, one which it has stated it will continue to go down over the coming years.  Deputy Michael McGrath was right when he asked how the Government would abolish the universal social charge without increasing taxes in the next five years.  It must be remembered, however, that his party is saying the same thing, namely, that it will also abolish the universal social charge.  The Deputy is right in saying that the Government cannot do it but he is not acknowledging that his party cannot do it either.</p></speech>

First, I would not underestimate how outraged people are about the decision of Bank of Ireland to essentially exclude most of its customers from doing business in its branches.  This sums up everything that we have done wrong and it will be a constant theme in all the points I want to make about this Bill.  What people find infuriating is that this is a case of here we go again.  The banks we bailed out - which brought the country to its knees and which cost us six or seven years of cruel suffering - have decided to just turn around and spit at us in the face.  It is as simple as that.  This bank is spitting at us in the face.  People are outraged about it and I do not blame them.  This is on top of the banks' refusal to give proper debt relief to those who are in mortgage arrears.  People find the latter nauseating.  Somebody texted me before I came to the House and suggested that Bank of Ireland customers should be outside its branches tomorrow picketing, protesting and taking their money out of their accounts.  I could not agree more.  What is happening is disgusting.  However, those in government allowed it to happen because of their determination to nurse the banks back to health, sell them off to the private sector and allow them to be a law unto themselves in order that they can do it all over again to us.  It is the small things that sometimes cause explosions and the Government may find that this will become a focus for some of the accumulated anger about the way it has let the banks off the hook.</p>  <p>  In my initial response to the budget, I made many of the points about the generally unfair and regressive impact it will have and the laughably so-called tax give-away or "give-back".  The points I made on budget day have been underlined by previous speakers.  However, I will put it very simply: why does somebody earning in excess of &euro;70,000 need &euro;1,000 more when there are people who cannot afford to pay their rent, who are ending up sleeping in cars, tents, hostels or on the street and to whom &euro;1,000 would make a considerable difference?  Why did the Government need to give &euro;1,000 back to people who have more than enough to pay the bills?  That amount is ten times more than the Government gives to somebody on social welfare.  It is cruelly unfair and it shows the callousness of the Government and its complete lack of understanding of what is happening to many thousands of families.  Some 130,000 families are on housing waiting lists, thousands of people are in emergency accommodation and tens of thousands of others are in mortgage arrears and fear the loss of the roof over their heads because they cannot pay the bills.  These people literally cannot keep the roof over their heads.  They should have been the sole focus of the Government's budget changes in terms of giving anything back but instead it is giving multiples to the people earning in excess of &euro;70,000 a year.  That is obscene.</p>  <p>  As I said on budget day, in some ways all of that is small beer compared to the really big-ticket item contained in this Bill.  As I noted previously, it is like the magician's trick - one hand is keeping people occupied with the smaller detail while the other is doing the real business.  That is how magicians work and that is how this Government works.  The really big-ticket item, the real give-away, is contained in this Finance Bill in something that, relatively speaking, has received little attention, which is focused on only in the business pages, and that is the knowledge box.  This is where we reveal the true colours of the Government in its determination to continue the wholesale transfer of wealth from the poor and the less well off to the super rich, to accelerate this process and to frustrate the efforts of a growing chorus of international voices demanding that something be done about this concentration of wealth in the hands of the multinational corporations.  The concentration to which I refer has reached obscene levels.  Just as the noose is beginning to tighten on these people, the Irish Government gives them another way out by means of a new double Irish mechanism.  Let us not forget that the double Irish mechanism, which has allowed them to avoid tens upon tens of billions of euro in taxes in recent years, will be phased out up to 2020.  As of the beginning of next year, they will have two ways to avoid tax, they will have the knowledge box and they will have the double Irish mechanism, just so they can work out exactly how they are going to operate this tax system to ensure they do not have to pay any extra at all.</p>  <p>  That is part of the explanation for the mystery of the sudden appearance of &euro;2 billion in tax revenue, the unexplained &euro;2 billion.  From where did it come?  It has come from the corporations which, courtesy of the Government, have been using the double Irish to avoid tax for the past number of years.  Then, because the whistle was blown by some of us who became Members of the D&aacute;il and by a growing number of people around the world who said "This stuff has to stop", money mysteriously appeared which now can potentially be taxable income.  This money will not, of course, be taxed because even though it will be included on the books, it will benefit from the knowledge box provision.  Previously, this money was siphoned off.  It could not be clearer what is going on.  It all centres around precisely the abuse, exploitation and manipulation of things such as intellectual property and patents, which are at the centre of the knowledge box, and that is precisely what was at the centre of the double Irish, whereby increasing billions of euro were siphoned out of the system through the so-called trade charges - or royalties - on intellectual property and patents.  The Minister's Department even produced a paper on this matter for the sub-committee that was examining it.  Again, that was prompted by some of us who demanded that it be investigated, although the Minister refused to allow some of the main players involved to come before the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure.  So terrified is he of these multinationals, he would not even allow a discussion about the suggestion that they should come before the committee to happen in public - the cameras had to be switched off.</p>  <p>  The figures have again been buried in these papers that nobody reads.  They show that the amount of income that was siphoned off under the category of trade charges increased from &euro;5 billion in 2006 to &euro;21 billion in 2011.  Some &euro;16 billion extra each year was siphoned off through royalties and patents under the double Irish.  Now the same will be done with the knowledge box.  Billions and billions of euro will be siphoned off.</p><p>Why are the people not grateful for the so-called budget giveback?  Why has it not given us a bounce in the polls?  Why is Labour still going to be obliterated in the coming election?  The Government could have saved itself from that if it was just willing to make some of these guys in question pay some extra tax and, in so far as it got a little bounce from them this year, given it back to the people who actually needed it.</p> <p> Our alternative is for an extra fiscal space of &euro;2.2 billion.  This includes adding in the &euro;700 million that under the EU fiscal rules one is not allowed to.  That &euro;2.2 billion would cover the cost of abolishing property tax, water charges and reversing almost all of the social protection cuts imposed since this Government came into office.  If, in addition to that, one made the multinationals pay the actual 12.5% on corporation tax, imposed the financial transaction tax and imposed a third level of PRSI on employers and employees who earn in excess of &euro;100,000 a year, then the Government would get an extra &euro;4.3 billion which would cover the cost of giving &euro;1.5 billion extra to education, &euro;1 billion extra to health, and abolishing the universal social charge, USC, for everyone earning less than &euro;70,000 a year.  People would be grateful for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1192" speakername="Clare Daly" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400062#KKK00300"><p>When he launched his budget, the Minister for Finance told us proudly that he was concentrating his available resources on tax reductions for low and middle-income families by reducing the marginal rate for people earning less than &euro;70,000 per year.  From this, we can deduce he believes that somebody just shy of earning &euro;70,000 a year is a middle-income earner.  While I do not believe that is an excessive amount of money, we have to be very clear that the number of people in this society earning above that amount is tiny.  In fact, only 3.3% of households have a single PAYE earner with an income of &euro;75,000 or more and only 6.6% of dual-income families do.  The scandal that we really should be discussing is the fact that 60% of all of those people who pay tax in Ireland have an income of less than &euro;35,000 a year.  Someone earning &euro;70,000 a year in that context is far from being in the middle.</p><p>Labelling them so, however, is yet another attempt to hide the fact the Government&rsquo;s budget this year, like all of its other ones, is a Robin Hood in reverse budget.  It is a budget that benefits high earners more than it does middle and low-income earners.  The points have been well articulated.  The USC cuts being introduced in this Bill will give the top 20% of households on average nearly twice the benefit to their disposable incomes as that given to those who are actually in the middle.  It is probably not surprising given that the Taoiseach told us at one stage that he believed the minimum wage was &euro;35,000 a year, which it is obviously nowhere near.</p><p>What the Government has done in this budget is not only reduced the tax burden of those at the top of society - it was not very burdensome on them in the first place - but it has failed to target the massive sources of that wealth which could be harnessed to deliver vital public services and a transformation of living standards.  The budget contains not a single extra measure to tackle those at the top of society, however.  We have that against the backdrop of the scandal that the top 100 individuals in this society saw their personal wealth grow by &euro;12 billion in one year alone.  Now we have an Ireland where the top 20% has a 70% share of the wealth, while the bottom 20% has a 0.2% share.  The policies put forward in this Bill and the budget are only going to aggravate that situation.  It is a total scandal that we have not sought to go after that wealth in any shape or form.</p><p>Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I believe one of the key parts of this Bill is the so-called knowledge box.  This is one thing and one thing only, namely another weapon in Ireland&rsquo;s already impressive armoury of tax avoidance schemes for corporations and big business.  We have activities that can be loosely defined as research and development, qualifying to be taxed at only 6.25%, a minuscule amount.  In David McWilliams&rsquo;s recent television programme on wealth in Ireland, he pointed to studies from the American bureau of economic statistics which showed many of the multinationals operating in Ireland earn $970,000 profit per employee but only pay $25,000 in tax per employee, meaning a 4% effective tax rate on that wealth.  Obviously IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, welcomes the knowledge box.  The Minister has said it is a &ldquo;significant enhancement to our corporation tax regime [which] shows Ireland&rsquo;s ability to retain our core strengths, while keeping a keen competitive edge in attracting and retaining quality jobs and investment to our country.&rdquo;</p><p>That simply is not the case.  What we have been subjected to is a rehash of the argument that the corporation tax regime in this State is crucial to our economy, the cornerstone of our economic policy.  The reality is that it is not.  The number of jobs dependent on the multinational sector is relatively small by comparison to the overall scale of the economy.  Of course, we welcome the jobs that are provided.  However, they are only a tiny part of the economy.  They disproportionately impact on our economy because of the amount of moneys washing in and out through these companies and inflating our GDP, gross domestic product.</p><p>According to the US Congressional Research Service, the profits of US-controlled corporations, as a percentage of GDP in Ireland, was a massive 42% in 2010, up from 7.6% in 2004.  In Germany, as a point of comparison, the percentage was 0.4%.  Germany is a productive economic powerhouse while Ireland is a country that prostitutes itself out on enticing money in to engage in tax avoidance schemes.  Not only is it a shoddy set-up, it is destructive because of the huge figures involved, the inflation of our GDP and the smoke-and-mirror effects of the movement of the big sums of money through the large companies locating their European headquarters here.  These all give a cover to the Government to take attention away from the real discussion we need to have on the lack of a proper indigenous and local industrial economic policy.  That has been part of the ploy in this.</p><p>Our tax and foreign direct investment policies, aggravated by the Bill, have actually turned Ireland into a service platform for flighty and transient international capital with little consideration for the domestic economy.  Michael Taft put it very well when he pointed out that the multinational sector has been grafted on the domestic economy but is indifferent to its long-term health.  In that context, the knowledge box is really just the latest attempt to convince everybody that what is happening here is not industrial scale tax avoidance.  However, no one believes that.  Ireland is a tax haven and everyone knows it from the US Congressional Research Service to the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights to Dr. James Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin.  He said, &ldquo;This is complex, and multinationals love complexity because it allows them to develop tax avoidance strategies.  The last thing they want is simplicity.&rdquo;  <i>The New York Times</i>has described the knowledge box as something akin to an onshore alternative to the double-Irish tax arrangement that this year&rsquo;s budget was supposed to be doing away with.</p><p>This knowledge box proposal is a sham.  The cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s economic policy is not productive capacity, investment or job creation but tax avoidance, which is pretty shameful when one thinks about it.  While we could give the country-to-country reporting measures included in the Bill a guarded welcome, we know the Government only brought them in under duress and extreme international scrutiny.  What impact, if any, they will have is really unknown at this stage.  We will not be holding our breath in that regard.</p><p>There are loads of sleights of hand which mark this Bill as a total policy in neoliberalism which has hallmarked this Government.  With one hand, it tinkers around with the tax credits for home carers.  That is fair enough.  However, with the other hand, the carer&rsquo;s allowance was cut by 8% over the Government&rsquo;s term.</p><p>Home help hours have been cut, with 600,000 hours being taken from the service, yet the Government is giving tax breaks to nursing homes under the guise of encouraging small business.  The Government is exempting them from paying tax and giving them access to cheap credit.  This Government is incentivising the privatisation of the care of the elderly.  It is madness.  </p> <p> It sickened me to hear the Minister when moving this Bill reference for possibly the fifth time a measure people are already entitled to, which is an exemption from paying local property tax when the house is affected by pyrite.  The Government said it brought in this exemption three years ago but people have not been able to claim it because of the clumsy way in which it was introduced.  People would have had to spend thousands of euro to get an exemption worth hundreds of euro, which is obvious lunacy.  The ridiculous situation is that the State did not require testing in order for people to be included in the Government's remediation scheme but required them to have a test carried out in order to get a tax exemption.  I see nothing in this other than the Minister's words, again, that this will be addressed.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

For the past two to three years, the haulage industry has been haemorrhaging jobs.  Northern Ireland had a tax rate of &euro;900 for a lorry.  The equivalent in this country was &euro;4,500 to &euro;5,000.  The measure will repay in its own way because it will create jobs.  It is a badly needed boost for the haulage industry which has been struggling severely.  I advocated the introduction of a measure similar to that introduced by England, which was a &pound;10 sterling tariff on every one of our lorries that went over there.  I have spoken about the introduction of such a measure but we have not done it yet.</p>  <p>  I welcome the provision of an extra year for children in preschools.  Parents in middle Ireland have been struggling with large mortgages and the banks have done nothing about the situation except to put a gun to their heads and not listen to them.  The provision of an extra year of child care is a small relief for these parents.</p>  <p>  A first step has been made on behalf of the self-employed.  I would have preferred if all the steps had been taken in introducing a tax credit equivalent to that enjoyed by PAYE workers.  We speak of middle Ireland and the ordinary PAYE worker earning &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 a year.  These people are being crippled by the universal social charge.  They have struggled over the past three to four years to rear families and keep going, day to day, with expenses creeping up on them.  They struggled to survive.  I would have preferred to see more given to them because they kept this country going over the past few years.  They are the people who in the hour of call put their shoulders to the wheel.  Everyone in this category is tortured by the universal social charge.  They hate this unjustified charge and should have benefitted more from the changes introduced.</p>  <p>  At a time when we talk about the country improving, it was sad to see in the area of agriculture &euro;1,000 cut from the areas of natural constraints scheme, or the disadvantaged areas scheme, as it was once called, when our country hit a crossroads.  I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine lobbied the Minister for Finance but he did not achieve anything in this regard in the budget.  To put it simply, there was nothing other than the &euro;550 tax credit for the small farm family.  There were measures in respect of transferring the farm to the next generation but that refers to bigger farmers only.  It does not affect the small farm family.  All we got in terms of the agriculture portfolio was the beef data and genomics scheme.  This is a ferociously complicated scheme that is going nowhere except to bring us down a dangerous road.  We are telling Europe we will produce quicker something that eats less and dies sooner.  This concerns carbon and in four or five years time we will be caught out on this issue.</p>  <p>  Sadly, the same Minister was not able to deliver anything for farmers in this budget in respect of the GLAS scheme.  Forecasts on the different types of measures that would be introduced were given to Europe but these were not projected correctly.  There has been no solace in the budget for the small farm family, which is my concern and not the landlord farmer.  I do not know if it is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or someone else that we should hold responsible but it is sad to see this budget deliver nothing for small farm families.</p>  <p>  The country is starting to recover and there are green shoots here and there but they are scarce in many a part of the country, especially down my neck of the woods.  I do not know if the issue is one of more money, although I do not think it is, but hospital services at the moment are in chaos.  I do not know if we need someone who can handle the situation better or whether managers are the problem, but something needs to be done quickly because people are being treated horrendously.</p>  <p>  Prior to the budget, I spoke about the credit union movement.  After the people of Ireland coming to its aid today we saw the arrogance of Bank of Ireland when it told people not to come to the teller at the counter if they are not withdrawing &euro;700 or more.  Let us think of a pensioner on &euro;200 or so a week.  These people may on a Friday go to a bank.  They are not used to bank cards.  Many of them are not used to computers.  These people are now being turned away.  Will the Minister for Finance please give the reins to the likes of the credit unions?  The Minister might not believe or understand this but the banks, once they got the money, have abandoned rural Ireland.  The last things left are the post offices and the credit unions.  The credit unions need facilities to provide direct debit facilities and cards for transactions.  When a person walks into a credit union, someone will be there to greet an elderly person and ask if he or she needs help, which means so much to those people.  At the moment, all we see in a bank is a machine.  We have to press buttons, as if it were a piano, to lodge or withdraw money.  Now if customers go to the counter and are withdrawing less than &euro;700, which might not even be in their accounts - there might not be &euro;300, or &euro;200 even, in the account - the bank expects them not to attend at the counter.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis is chaotic.  On my first day in this House a year ago, the budget was announced.  I heard lovely figures on housing being thrown about.  Like many things in here, there was a lot of talk but little happened.  Nothing has been solved in the housing crisis over the past year.  Huge numbers of people are being housed in temporary accommodation.  It is time for someone to take the bull by the horns.  Someone needs to roll up his or her sleeves.</p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle would like me to finish.</p></speech>

We correctly cry when they die in horrendous fires in halting sites, yet its children are put on the PULSE machine in racial profiling.  We put them into accommodation the budgets for which have been decimated over the past number of years.</p>  <p>  The reality is that Travellers are not a priority.  In the case of Traveller women, they might as well not exist.  In America, where racial profiling is an established fact, black women are three to four times more likely to end up in prison than white women.  In Ireland, Traveller women are 22 times more likely to end up in prison than settled women.  Most of them on meeting the justice system for the first time do not get probation, community service or anything else but go straight to incarceration.  These are women who have a life expectancy that is 11.5 years shorter than the life expectancy of women in the rest of the population.  It is a life expectancy that is akin to that of the 1960s.</p>  <p>  We let them have an all-Ireland Traveller health study, but the conclusions of it were not implemented in the five year term of this Government.  If we are to give any credibility to the claim that we support rights for Travellers, recognise their differences and respect them as equal citizens, we must recognise them as an independent ethnic group.  It is not a panacea and it will not solve all the issues they face, but it is a starting point.  I think particularly of Traveller women who are the most marginalised, with 81.2% without work and who cannot escape domestic violence situations.  They need this motion to be passed.</p></speech>

With regard to the history of the Traveller community, experts say that the separation from settled communities happened 1,000 to 2,000 years ago.  That makes it, to my mind and the minds of the experts, a distinct ethnic minority.  It is interesting that the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has expressed serious concern at this State's persistent refusal to regard Travellers as an ethnic minority.</p>  <p>  I am a member of the human rights committee in Strasbourg.  There are international criteria established for ethnic minorities and the Travellers have satisfied these internationally recognised criteria for the past 20 years.  It is beyond belief that in 2015 we should still have to debate this issue and not recognise that they are an ethnic minority.  I have some knowledge of this subject because I was chairperson with regard to Traveller accommodation in Waterford and I know many Traveller people in the county, some who wish to be housed and some who wish to stay nomadic.  That is their preference.  Personally, I would like everybody to be housed in good quality accommodation and so forth but if it affects the Traveller community that they are part of, that must be recognised.</p>  <p>  I refer the Minister again to the European Union, the Council of Europe and the human rights committee in Europe.  They should be recognised.</p></speech>

The utterly unspeakable tragedy that occurred in Carrickmines must be the catalyst, if all of the tears are not to be crocodile tears, for radical, urgent and immediate change in how we treat Travellers.</p>  <p>  In considering my contribution to this debate and in putting forward amendments, I thought that the first people I should consult should be the Travellers themselves.  Incidentally, that should be the guide to our policy, our response to this tragedy and to what is needed.  My amendments simply convey to the Minister what representatives of the Travellers said is required.  They said, first, that we must establish a public inquiry into what happened in Carrickmines.  It is worth mentioning that the Romanian Prime Minister has just resigned amid mass protests in Romania following the death of dozens of Romanians in a fire in a nightclub in the last few days.  That should give us pause for thought about our response and our responsibility for what happened in Carrickmines.</p>  <p>  They have asked also for the immediate reversal of the 87% cuts that have been imposed on the Traveller accommodation programme, which has led to the appalling situation with Traveller accommodation throughout the country.  Those cuts must be reversed.  They ask that we enact a series of measures to address State racism affecting Travellers, including the immediate recognition - no messing around, no reviews and no talks - of Traveller ethnicity and a policy of zero tolerance when it comes to politicians or public officials who play around with anti-Traveller racism, which they do all of the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400064#MMM00900"><p>The tragic deaths of the two young Traveller families at the Carrickmines halting site has sadly brought a serious problem to national attention.  There are 29,000 Travellers in Ireland and 4% of them are living in halting sites.  The concept of halting sites as temporary is misleading and erroneous.  Providing safe and acceptable sites, with running water, sanitation and electricity, is imperative.  It is totally unacceptable that these vital services have been neglected in the austerity cutbacks over the past number of years, leaving living conditions in many of these sites highly hazardous and dangerous as regards health and safety.</p>  <p>  The dramatic budget decrease for Traveller programmes from &euro;35 million in 2010 to &euro;4.3 million this year has impacted adversely on all aspects of Travellers' lives, their general living conditions and the social and educational supports in the programmes.  The recent tragedy has brought renewed focus on the wider difficulties faced by many in Ireland's Traveller community.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has written to all local authorities in the State to highlight the duty on public bodies to eliminate discrimination in their daily work.  The Chief Commissioner, Ms Emily Logan, has confirmed that she has written to the senior management of all local authorities drawing attention to the public sector's duty, provided for under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, to provide proper necessities for this community.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister and the Government to act on what she has recommended.</p></speech>

I fully support this motion.  It is a shame on us that it must be debated here at all tonight.  Traveller ethnicity should have been recognised years ago, without any debate and without the need for it to be raised in the D&aacute;il tonight.</p>  <p>  The tragic events in Carrickmines brought home to many people the conditions in which we, the settled community, force Travellers to live throughout the country.</p><p>Traveller men have a life expectancy which is 15 years less than that of the settled community while Traveller women have a life expectancy which is 11 years less.  The infant mortality rate in the Traveller community is 3.5 times that of the settled community and the suicide rate in the Traveller community is six times that of the settled community.</p> <p> That is down to us, the settled community.  That is down to every one of the citizens, right across this country, who objects every time proposals are made to help Traveller families.  Every one of us has to look at ourselves and look at the decisions we make.  When we do this, we are reinforcing the early deaths, the infant mortality and the suicide rate of Travellers across this country.  As citizens, we all have to stand up and defend the defenceless in our communities and ensure we provide for everybody.  That will be a measure of us as a nation, if we do this properly.</p> <p> The Government should support the motion, withdraw the amendment and recognise Travellers as an ethnic group within our society.  This will then perhaps give Travellers the means to exert those rights and protect themselves.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I begin by expressing my sympathy with the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families over the appalling tragedy in Carrickmines last month.  </p>  <p>  There is no question there is absolute truth in the figures mentioned by Deputy Pringle in terms of life expectancy, to just take that one very blatant and obvious example of how the Traveller community suffers from discrimination.  That can also be seen on the housing front, which is from where this motion arises, and in the unemployment situation.  I am aware from my work with the Traveller community in my own constituency, and from my wife's work with Travellers over several years, how difficult it is for Traveller people to, for example, break into the workforce.  I remember my wife telling me about a young Traveller woman she had taught who had a job in a drapery store but in order to get that job, she had to disguise the fact she was a Traveller.  In a sense, that points very clearly to the question of discrimination.</p>  <p>  With regard to the whole question of ethnicity, if the Traveller community has a common view on that issue, I am quite happy that it be granted ethnicity.  Given what Deputy Halligan said about DNA examination, it seems the Traveller community split from the more settled Irish community more than 1,000 years ago.  Ironically, that makes Travellers probably the most Irish group within this country because most of us, if we look back on our past, will find many aspects of it lead us to other countries as well as to Ireland.</p>  <p>  When I was a county councillor on South Dublin County Council between 1999 and 2011, on several occasions we had proposals to build Traveller accommodation.  Before I was on the council, there had been quite a number of situations where there was a stand-off between the settled community and Travellers over accommodation.  However, in conjunction with other parties - Deputy Crowe will remember this because he was on the council at the time - we made strides because we decided not to make this a political issue.  As a result, quite a number of Traveller accommodation was delivered.  It is a pity that was not taken on board by, for example, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which seems to have done as little as possible.  Then, under the guidance of a previous county manager in South Dublin County Council, efforts were made, with some degree of success, to employ Travellers in various sections of the county council.  In that sense, in a small way, and I do not want to overstate it, we pointed a way towards the future.  It is very important that more effort is made between the Traveller community and the settled community to bring about a situation whereby it is possible for more Travellers to get involved in the workforce.</p>  <p>  It would be very easy for me just to sit down at this stage.  However, if we are being frank and honest, there is a long story of tension between the Irish settled community and the Traveller community, and it has probably got worse in recent years.  Part of that arises from the fact some of the areas of work Travellers would originally have been involved in, such as selling items door to door, and production and mending of kitchen utensils, have gone.  It is also the case that, in an urban setting, the whole business of keeping horses, which I know is dear to the heart of some Travellers, has become a difficulty.  There needs to be a serious discussion between the settled community and the Traveller community as to how we can best live side by side in that regard.  I would like it if we could get to a situation, on a formal basis, where there was regular discussion between the Traveller community and the settled community as to how we can both move forward together.</p>  <p>  Some of the fears the settled community have in regard to Travellers are unfounded but, unfortunately, there are examples which do not help.  In that regard, it is very good that, for example, a number of Traveller women I know, and Pavee Point, make it clear that, like the settled community, the Traveller community must be subject to the rule of law.  However, things sometimes happen that cause real problems.  For example, in South Dublin County Council, there was at one stage a loan scheme for buying caravans and, unfortunately, that had to be abandoned because so few of the loans were repaid.</p>  <p>  We must try to get something positive out of this appalling negative happening in Carrickmines.  I suggest that we set up, on a permanent basis, a forum where there is continuous dialogue between the Traveller community and the settled community as to how we can best move forward together so that, on both sides, people can lead fulfilling lives.  That is a real challenge for us and it is a challenge we must rise to in order to get away from the situation where life expectancy among Travellers is so much less than it is among the settled community.</p><p>We need to get to a situation where living conditions are satisfactory for both the settled and Traveller communities and to a position where Travellers who want to can move into a more settled, permanent situation.  If we are to gain something positive from this appalling tragedy, we need to have a regular forum that will point the way to the future.</p></speech>

First, I would like to be associated with extending condolences to the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families.  The fire that occurred was such a tragic event that it is difficult to find the words to speak about it.  Everybody has been touched by this dreadful event and hopefully this debate will help to focus on the issues and some good might ensue from it.</p>  <p>  I welcome the new national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy which will be in place by 2016.  This is a move in the right direction and I will return to this issue later.  Communication on this issue is vital.  However, I do not agree with the attempt to define the Traveller community as a separate ethnic group.  Society is now an open, tolerant society and our cities are now multicultural and multi-religious.  This is fantastic.  We have become a melting pot of different cultures and religions and are an example to much of the world as to how countries should progress.  In that regard, I do not like the creation of artificial divides and labels.  I see no benefit to that and believe that what might sound like a good idea, may have unforeseen consequences in the longer term.  Therefore, I would prefer to deal with the issues than to create further labels.</p>  <p>  I dislike the powerful word that keeps cropping up, which has been used tonight.  That word is "racism" and it is used far too frequently.  It stifles discussion.  People have fears, but the "racism" ticket should not be pulled out each time someone disagrees with another.  It ruins discussion and is unfair on both the Traveller and settled communities.  If I had my way, that word would not be part of this discussion.  We need a more frank and honest approach.</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier, in the past Travellers had a good rapport with settled communities in rural areas.  They worked on the land as seasonal workers and farmers relied on them.  However, mechanisation has changed this and people have moved on from that.  Many of the traditional roles of Travellers are now gone.  We need to work around this.</p>  <p>  The issue of accommodation needs to be discussed.  The accommodation we think the Traveller community needs is not always what they want.  Their culture has a huge interest in horses and these need space and accommodation.  I heard a member of the Traveller community say recently that if his book or film was very successful, he would not build a house but would buy a bit of land and put a caravan on it.  Travellers want different things and have different aspirations and that is fine.  We need proper communication and discussion in order to arrive at a situation where suitable accommodation is available.</p>  <p>  We also need to work on the issue of Traveller feuding.  We need conflict resolution, because out of control feuding makes people nervous and afraid.  We need to tackle this.</p>  <p>  On the issue of housing that is purchased for the Traveller community and other groups, there is a perception that we are not getting value and that many of the houses being purchased are purchased at above market value.  We need to examine that issue.  Some people have suggested that we take responsibility for dealing with accommodation for Travellers away from councillors.  I disagree completely.  Right across the country, councillors deal with every sector and they are, for the most part, fair minded.  While some people might have a different view on councillors, they are accountable to the public.  Removing the responsibility for this from public councillors and handing it to people who are unaccountable would be a dangerous route to take.  Like all of us, councillors will face the people in the ultimate test, the election.</p>  <p>  I deal with many issues in my clinic.  Travellers come in to discuss their accommodation needs and I am delighted they feel comfortable enough to do so.  However, I also deal with people from the settled community who are genuinely afraid of certain elements within the Traveller community.  Some people are terrified and they may or may not be right to feel that way.  Communication is vital if we are to break through this difficulty.  Nothing will happen without proper communication.  We will succeed or fail on this.  Mention has been made of the need for more money and the discussion always seems to revert to that.  Money alone will not solve this issue.  It will help, but will not solve it.  We need to deal with the issue in a structured way that allows free speech.</p>  <p>  Across the board, our discussion of social housing for both the settled and Traveller communities must deal with the issue of anti-social behaviour.  People are afraid that anti-social behaviour will come to their community and they will have to deal with it for the rest of their days.  Anti-social behaviour is not exclusive to Travellers, but occurs across the board.  If we had a mechanism that dealt effectively and quickly with serious anti-social issues that crop up across the country, many of the people's fears would be relieved.  Many people in my area are looking to be rehoused because they are prisoners in their own homes.  They are afraid to stay in their houses and are parking their cars away from them because of anti-social behaviour.  This issue needs to be dealt with as it is a huge cost to communities.  Why should people who are living respectfully in their communities have to leave?  This does not make sense.</p>  <p>  In order for free speech to work here and for people to be able to express their opinions honestly and in a straightforward manner, we need to take away emotive language like "racism" from the debate and need to start addressing the thorny issues.  A conversation happens here, but another conversation happens outside of the House.  We need to ensure people-----</p></speech>

I have experienced a difficulty around the whole area of how the Civil Service system, through no fault of its own probably, deals with illiterate people, whether they are Travellers or not.  My office is in Rathkeale and 50% of my community are Travellers.  We do not have anti-social behaviour or crime.  That is a fact and if anybody wants to visit us they are welcome.  Sometimes we feel vilified by the media image or impression that is given of our community.  When I talk about our community I am talking about 50% Traveller and 50% settled.</p>  <p>  I wish to talk about some specific issues I have encountered.  I met a group of six young Traveller women - I am meeting a group of 12 on Friday - who described being called in because they were being cut off from their jobseeker's allowance or another benefit.  They have to line up in a queue, which is intimidating for them.  They then have to present themselves at a hatch and are given a form which they cannot deal with.  They are embarrassed.  I have also met one or two from the settled community who feel like this as well.  They do not know how to deal with what is required of them  or respond.  That is one side of it.  Inside the hatch is somebody who has to deal with many difficulties, who may have five, six or ten people in a queue and does not have the time to deal with the situation.  They may not even have been advised on how to deal with it.</p>  <p>  Given our situation in Newcastle West, the employment exchange and Department of Social Protection have a level of recognition but there is an issue for people who are illiterate and have to present themselves at these offices.  Even those who are literate often tell me that it is the language they cannot deal with - the words of officialdom.  They are not used to dealing with words of officialdom and that does not only apply to the Travelling community but often to the settled community as well.  I am highlighting it in these circumstances because I meet this issue regularly.</p>  <p>  To give an example of these kind of difficulties, one of the girls came to me and said she was being cut off from her jobseeker's allowance.  The social welfare people told her she had to look for a job and asked would she go around to the bars and see could she get a job collecting glasses.  She said to me, "Sure, we are not allowed into a bar until we are married".  I am just expressing that there is a different culture within the Travelling community that the system does not understand.  A book will be published shortly dealing with this area, which is very welcome.  I have asked the Oireachtas Library to obtain a copy.</p>  <p>  When we - the Travellers or the settled community where my office is - see programmes like "The Town the Travellers Took Over" or the big fat gypsy weddings it must be asked what kind of message is being given.  The networks play these programmes over and over again.  Maybe it is good TV but do those who produce and present these shows understand there are people they might hurt?  It is very easy to offer an inducement to a family of any community to do a programme about how they deal with any of their events, but how does it make everybody else in that community feel about the way they are being presented?  We are all entitled to have the type of weddings that we want in our families, whether we are from Australia, America, the United Kingdom, Ireland or from the Travelling community.  We are entitled without being almost vilified or suffering implications.  Good luck to everybody who has their weddings, in my view.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn for proposing this motion, and also the excellent work of Traveller groups like Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Movement, Minceirs Whiden and the Traveller Women's Forum.  Brigid Quilligan made an important point yesterday that Travellers were completely absent from Leinster House.  It would be very encouraging if the next Taoiseach were to appoint a member of the Traveller community to the Seanad to begin to change that.</p>  <p>  It is important that we as a people challenge prejudices and racism in everyday life.  After the Carrickmines tragedy in which five children and five adults lost their lives, I thought maybe we would see an outpouring of humanity by settled people towards Travellers, or at the very least towards this family.  Instead, we saw hatred, bitterness and casual racism rear its ugly head across a section of the settled community.  It underlined the day- to-day marginalisation of Travellers by wider society and the challenges we face.</p>  <p>  It was the tip of the iceberg, unfortunately.  In the weeks that followed, we saw middle class, settled people protesting against the housing of an orphaned child because he was a Traveller.  Then we had the Taoiseach and a senior Labour Minister speaking of Travellers as if they were second class citizens who could not be trusted to wake their loved ones in well-worn Irish tradition.  It is time we faced up to this bigotry at a community and an institutional level.  Travellers have a distinct ethnicity, with a language and a culture that must be respected, supported and cherished because they are every bit as Irish as you and me and the communities we represent.  They are part of our rich heritage and will always be part of our future.</p>  <p>  They, like all citizens, have a right to a home.  Many Traveller families have moved out of their communities because of a lack of accommodation and have been placed in private rented accommodation, receiving rent supplement or rental accommodation scheme payments.  Local authorities have deliberately abandoned their role in providing Traveller accommodation.  Many halting sites have been left abandoned by those charged with their management and the people living there must put up with awful, inhuman conditions.  These conditions are a threat to the health and safety of the residents and played no small part in the deaths at Carrickmines.</p>  <p>  Over ten years ago Dunsink Lane, which served as a vital link between Finglas and Castleknock, was blocked off with boulders by a large force of garda&iacute;.  Some 300 men, women and children were isolated in a cul-de-sac by these boulders, placed there without consultation or discussion.  It was a decision taken by politicians along with the local authorities of Fingal and Dublin city.</p><p>I warned these people against such measures and stood against them and with the people.  They thought they could wall off Travellers from the rest of the community and forget they existed but they were utterly wrong.  That blockade remains.  Traveller children have grown up with barely a memory of when their home was not blocked off from the rest of the world - a constant reminder that they are not accepted and that they are less than us.  We must take the hand of the bigoted or populist politician or county official out of the delivery of Traveller accommodation.  We must act against councils that refuse to house Travellers and support those that will.  In time, we must form an agency that is directly responsible for Traveller accommodation on a national basis and will combine expertise and knowledge to best provide for the Traveller community and support it to flourish as a distinct group as well as being part of the wider local community.  </p> <p> The tragic deaths of ten men, women and children from the Traveller community in Carrickmines should have been a turning point.  It should have given pause for reflection on the part of the settled community regarding its treatment of the Traveller community.  Instead it was another excuse for some to spew their hateful bile on comment pages and Facebook feeds.  For others, it meant little at all.  There was no national day of mourning, official or unofficial.  In Wexford, pubs stayed closed as a mark of disrespect.  The Connors, Gilberts and Lynches were treated in death as they were treated in life - as less than us and as people to be suspicious of.  </p> <p> We can change this horrible climate of bigotry and distrust but it will not come with well-meaning statements.  It will not even come just by well-meaning people challenging casual bigotry.  It will come when we begin to reform our society to cherish all the children of the nation equally. </p></speech>

Regardless of whether it is life expectancy, health outcomes, education outcomes or suicide rates, Travellers compare disastrously with the settled community.  If we look at the unemployment rates among the Traveller community, we can see that it stands at 80%.  Travellers have suffered more than the settled community as the labour market has tightened massively over the past number of years due to the recession.  </p>  <p>  If these factors were associated with any group in Irish society, there would be absolute outrage and it would not take the deaths of unfortunate individuals for this issue to become part of the debate.  There would be outrage on a regular basis but the truth of the matter is that because it is happening to people from the Traveller community, it is, by and large, ignored in the political discourse.  In a liberal democracy, every individual should be judged on the basis on their individual character.  Unfortunately, this is not happening.  Once a Traveller speaks, signs his or her name, applies for a job or tries to book an event, the shutters come down across the country.</p>  <p>  The fact is that those shutters come down at Government level as well.  When the recession hit, Travellers experienced the biggest chop.  When it comes to cuts, Travellers are positively discriminated against.  We have seen &euro;30 million taken away from Traveller-orientated programmes over the past number of years.  To put that in perspective, that is a cut of 88%.  I cannot think of any other section of Government expenditure that has been hammered so much.  </p>  <p>  We have also seen Ministers in the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government actively try to stop Traveller families from gaining accommodation by making representations to local authorities.  Right across the country, we see councillors in establishment parties actively using their time against the interests of Travellers.  A councillor in Donegal stated that Travellers should live in isolation.  A Fine Gael election candidate in the south of Dublin said that giving land in an affluent area to Travellers was a waste of valuable resources.  We also see how the media hypes up and sensationalises any story that occurs in this community.  </p>  <p>  Caithfidh an Rialtas beart a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir a bhriathar agus t&aacute; deis ag an Rialtas an rud ceart a dh&eacute;anamh anois.

Discrimination against Travellers is an all too regular occurrence and generally accepted within society.  Comments such as "sure aren't they just Irish" and "why don't they just live in houses" are commonplace and are probably some of the more mature comments one is likely to hear.  Couple that with the derogatory words used to distinguish them from settled society and it is not easy listening.</p>  <p>  Nomadism, or the wish to move around, is an integral part of what it means to be Traveller.  In 1963, Travellers became part of a political discourse, one that viewed their culture as that of wrongdoers.  There was a huge political push to coerce members of the Traveller community into assimilating into Irish society, thus allowing a distinguishing part of their culture to fade into the abyss.  From that year, to the present day, there have been efforts by successive Governments to advance this approach in the hope that Travellers, as the word implies, would fall into place and assimilate or insert themselves into the cracks and travel no more.  This is evident in the institutional discrimination that exists within the policies in these Houses.</p>  <p>  All of these attempts have failed and have isolated as well as disenfranchised a lot of people within the Traveller community.  It is the whole concept of cause and effect.  The failure to recognise their status as a nomadic group of people with a particular lifestyle has left the waters somewhat muddied.  I do not deny for one minute that there are problems within the Traveller community but much like any other group, one will always have a percentage of those who will do wrong in the eyes of the law.  We in settled society are not expected to speak out on these issues that occur and yet a double standard seems to apply when it comes to Travellers.</p>  <p>  It is when this wrong is done in accordance with a long-standing culture dating back well before policy ever existed that it becomes a fundamental flaw within policy and those who construct it.  Take for example the "illegal" parking on roadsides or in unused spaces.  Why is it that Government cannot provide spaces for Travellers to live in - a space with clean running water and basic electricity that has something above a Third World standard of human waste disposal facilities?  The Government should be providing these facilities in every county and should uphold basic human rights.  </p>  <p>  Travellers' health has suffered severely as a result of long-term Government policy.  Traveller men live on average ten years less than settled men while Traveller women live on average 12 years less than their settled peers.  With regards to mental health, the suicide rate within the Traveller community is six times higher than that of the settled community.</p><p>Education allows people to become empowered.  Home schooling or a home school liaison service is a reality for many children, so why not adapt this in a way that suits another type of lifestyle and culture?  This in turn can only have positive effects on society as a whole.  Education does not just stop at Travellers.  The wider population also needs to educate itself in what it means to be a Traveller, and understand, without prejudice, the Traveller culture.</p> <p> The Equal Status Act 2000 recognised members of the Traveller community as a group not to be discriminated against under the nine grounds of discrimination, although this is largely yet to become evident in practical terms.  Traveller culture, and its origins, must be understood and respected.  It is only then that we can come together and tackle the social isolation, mental health issues and the criminalisation of a culture.</p> <p> Not too long ago we had a vote on the human rights and equal status of citizens of our country in the form the marriage equality referendum.  We cannot cherrypick those who deserve equality and those who do not: the essence of equality is the fair treatment of everyone.  It is time for this House to recognise Travellers as a minority ethnic group.</p></speech>

I offer my sincere condolences to the members of the community here tonight and to the wider Traveller community.</p>  <p>  We all know that Travellers experience racism and discrimination with the effect that they are disadvantaged in many ways: in getting a job, in having a standard of living compatible with the rest of the community, in their health, life expectancy, the level of education they can attain and above all in the standard of housing in which it is considered acceptable for Travellers to live.  There has been a policy among successive Governments to leave the Travellers to their own devices and do nothing about combatting the attitudes to them which are nothing short of racist.  It was very annoying to listen to some comments by Deputy Barry.  Effectively, what he said bordered on racism.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of Carrickmines we are all, naturally, focussing on the situation of Traveller housing.  I am aware of the call from representative organisations for a central agency to deal with Traveller housing and to take that function away from local authorities.  I am not surprised by this call, as it is clear that the political will is not there at local or national level to deal decently and humanely with Traveller housing.  We can all see as we drive around the country some of those sites on housing estates reserved for Travellers.  In many areas halting sites are hidden from public view.  This is an indictment of our society.</p>  <p>  I remember vividly in 1962 walking home from a football match with five lads like myself, ten and 11 years old.  We passed a place known as the "barny brook" where there was a tent pitched by two men in their late twenties or early thirties, and a fire lighting.  These men had been travelling around the community fixing pots, pans, buckets and so forth.  What has stood out in my mind to this day was the fact that four of us walking by crossed the road, away from these two Travellers.  That did not just happen, it was learned.  It was the way people looked at the Traveller community, seeing it as different, and that created a sense of fear.  It was prejudice and it was wrong.</p>  <p>  I live in Ardfert, where there is an integrated approach to Travellers.  They go to school, sitting with my grandchildren and my children before them.  That was not always the case.  There was a time when it was very difficult for Traveller families and children to have an education like the one my children and other people's children have.  The problem that continues to exist is the local representatives' lack of responsibility at council and national levels.  If we do not show leadership how can we blame others outside that circle?  Irrespective of what people think, we have to show leadership and that means giving equal rights across the board to every person in our society.  That includes recognising the ethnicity of the Traveller community and making sure it has the same right as we all have, the right to education, to health care and to be free citizens.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy English, to support this motion. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="20:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400069#RRR00300"><p>On Tuesday, 20 October I was in Bray for the funerals of Tara Gilbert, who had been pregnant, her partner Willy Lynch, their daughters Jodie and Kelsey and Willy&rsquo;s brother Jimmy.  Two days later I was in Sandyford for the funerals of Sylvia and Tommy Connors and their children Jimmy, Christy and Mary.  Sylvia was the sister of Willy and Jimmy Lynch.  They were all victims of the fire at the halting site at Glenamuck.  In my life I have been to too many funerals but I freely admit that I found these two especially sad and upsetting.  I extend to the Lynch, Connors and Gilbert families and to the entire Traveller community my deepest sympathies.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a n-anam.  Go raibh s&iacute;och&aacute;in s&iacute;ora&iacute; acu.</p><p>Sylvia, Willy and Jimmy&rsquo;s brother, John, spoke at Thursday&rsquo;s funeral.  His voice frequently faltered as he tried to hold back the raw emotion evident in his face.  He described the last day they had all been together:</p><blockquote>We had a lovely day.  The kids were playing in my garden... But the next morning came the call.  I thought it was a hoax call.  Then, in a moment, I realised all my family was gone.  My brothers, my sister, my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law, my nephews and nieces.  The whole lot gone in one go.</blockquote><p>Imagine getting that call.</p><p>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in, an Teachta D&aacute;la McDonald, comhairleoir&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus daoine eile &oacute; Shinn F&eacute;in ansin chun comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh leis an phobal Lucht Si&uacute;il agus chun seasamh leo go poibl&iacute;.  The Traveller community, however, needs more than mere sympathy and solidarity.  The prejudice and discrimination many Travellers face has worsened over recent years.  The response of Governments and the health and educational institutions of the State has been appalling.</p><p>The opposition to the erection of a temporary halting site for those bereaved by the Carrickmines fire is deeply disappointing.  The decision to provide the families with a site on a parking lot that lacks basic amenities, is an indictment of this and successive Governments.  It is deeply shameful.  Some people in the settled community blame Travellers for anti-social behaviour and crime.  Even if some Travellers, like some in the settled community, behave badly that is no reason to demonise and exclude an entire community.  The vast majority of Travellers are decent and good God-fearing people.</p><p>Ignorance breeds fear.  The only cure for ignorance is knowledge.  That comes from education and engagement.  Surely all citizens should have the right to receive equal service in shops and pubs, to access education and health services, work and accommodation, on the same basis as all others.  Why cannot every Irish citizen enjoy the rights and entitlements that come with that citizenship on the same basis as all others, and have their children treated as we would wish to be treated also?  Regrettably this is not the case.  Every Traveller child faces a life in which he or she will not be part of wider Irish society but will be part of the most socially disadvantaged group in that society.  That child will leave school earlier, have little prospect of work, will suffer ill-health and poverty, and will die younger than one in the settled community.  He or she will endure substandard living conditions; will have no access to basic facilities such as sanitation, water and electricity; and will face discrimination in employment and most will never work.  Cutbacks in education, health and other services have impacted severely on the Traveller community.  The Traveller suicide rate is six times that of the settled community.  At the root of all these problems are the unacceptable levels of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion experienced by Travellers at institutional and other levels.</p><p>I am proud to be Irish.</p><p>The people of Ireland are no mean people.  We hold ourselves in high regard, with some justification.  We are creative, innovative and generous.  Like all human beings, though, we have our faults.  A friend of mine, a very successful businessperson, told me once that the Irish would save someone from drowning, but they would never teach them how to swim.  That remark could explain why there is an underlying racism at work in our society which has created its own unique form of apartheid.  <br/><br/>In the aftermath of the Carrickmines fire we should up hold a mirror to ourselves as a people.  Could it be that our attitude is, in reality, that there is no place in modern Ireland for the Traveller community?  This is at odds with the generosity and inclusiveness demonstrated by Irish society in the recent marriage equality campaign, the solidarity shown with refugees from the Middle East, or the amazing amounts of money raised each year by charities for international relief programmes.  The widespread expressions of sympathy following the Carrickmines fire have provided some hope this situation could begin to be turned around, but there is an onus on politicians and the Government to ensure something positive, something good comes from this disaster.  Caithfimid amharc d&aacute;ir&iacute;re fadt&eacute;armach a thabhairt ar&iacute;s ar an d&oacute;igh a chaitheann muid mar phobal leis an Lucht Si&uacute;il.<br/><br/>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended that the State recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community.  The Government needs to act on this recommendation, implementation of which does not need legislation or a constitutional referendum.  Such a development would not of itself solve the problems which confront the Traveller community, but it would demonstrate leadership on the issue by the Government and set a clear and positive example.  Much more, however, needs to be done.  There is among Travellers an articulate grassroots leadership which is well able to voice Travellers' issues and also to raise the level of that community's awareness of their rights.  Some of them are in the Visitors Gallery.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte mh&oacute;r rompu uilig.<br/><br/>There is also, after decades of discrimination and demonisation, a sense of demoralisation, low self-worth and inferiority among some Travellers.  This has to be combated.  Yesterday morning I received a letter from a woman member of the Traveller community that illustrates some of the difficulties they face.  She wrote:</p><blockquote>I applied for a bay in a permanent halting site in 1994.  At the time I was 32 years of age with a young family.  I am now 53 years old with most of my family reared and I am now a grandmother of 14 grandchildren and I am still on the list for a bay in a permanent halting site.  Our site is situated beside a dump and a recycling waste food plant - in the warmer weather we are constantly infested with flies, the whole site is infested with rats, we feel our case is hopeless and I feel with the way things are going I will be dead by the time that they build a permanent halting site.</blockquote><p>There is an urgent need to establish a national forum, across the island of Ireland, involving Travellers and members of the settled community, including representatives of all political parties, the Government, local authorities, the health and education sectors and media organisations to plan a way forward.  Such a forum could discuss openly and in detail how discrimination and prejudice against Travellers could be confronted, including prejudicial attitudes facilitated by the actions of some politicians and media outlets.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; molta&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun oideachas a chur ar an phobal maidir leis an Lucht Si&uacute;il.  Two weeks ago when I put suggestion this to the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il, he rejected it.  His view is that existing structures can meet this need, but patently they cannot.  Therefore, as we approach the centenary celebration of the 1916 Rising and the Proclamation, what kind of society do we want?  What kind of Ireland do we want?  Do we want the same as we have now?  Is this good enough?  Did the Proclamation read, &quot;Irish men and Irish women, unless you are a Traveller&quot;?  Do we want an Ireland where we put a grieving family in a car park to live as we celebrate the 1916 Rising, or where a woman rears her children and grandchildren on a rat infested, fly infested dump beside a waste food recycling plant, or do we want an Ireland in which we seek to implement the great ideas of equality and human and civil rights that mark the Proclamation as one of the great freedom charters of modern times?<br/><br/>After the Carrickmines fire, there is an onus on all of us to stop and examine what occurred, why it occurred and how Travellers are treated.  The Proclamation declares that we are all equal.  This means that if the rights of one person are diminished, the rights of all are diminished.  This is not solely a legislative issue or a problem about a lack of resources.  It is a moral issue.  If the Minister of State wants to understand, even in a very small way, how Travellers feel, he should try and put himself in their shoes.  How would he look at the world, at Ireland, then?  There have been a number of negative telephone calls to our party criticising our decision to table this Private Members' motion.  Of course, we could have opted for a safer issue, but what sort of republicans would we be then?  We cannot overcome this challenge except by strong and resolute leadership and clear and unequivocal legislation that underpins equality for every citizen.  Of course, legislation cannot solve this problem alone.  It will only be finally solved when our society embraces the differences among citizens that make up the diversity and uniqueness of the Irish nation.  That means that leaders, including the Government, must lead by example.  I urge all Deputies to support Sinn F&eacute;in's motion and let us begin the work of making our society better for all but especially for those in the Traveller community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="20:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400070#SSS00200"><p>I will answer on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I listened to some of the contributions in the past hour, but I missed the first half of the discussion last night.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion addresses many issues facing the Traveller community and there is no doubt that the Traveller community is one that experiences poorer outcomes.  That point is well made in the motion and has been retained in the Government's counter-motion which seeks to take a more balanced approach and reflect the work being done in various Departments to bring about a real improvement in the lives of Travellers and their status in Irish society.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;400 million has been invested in Traveller-specific accommodation in the past 15 years.  Additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need and distributed equally among all children, including members of the Traveller community.  Substantial investment has also been made through the local and community development programme, with funding of &euro;1.17 million for the national Traveller partnership in 2015 alone.</p>  <p>  None of this is to deny that outcomes for members of the Traveller community in Irish society persistently remain at levels hugely inconsistent with those for the wider settled community, but we need to acknowledge the work that is being done and the resources that have been committed.  The Department of Justice and Equality recently launched a comprehensive consultation process, with a view to putting in place a revised national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy to improve the situation for the Traveller and Roma communities.  Phase 1 of the process was an initial round of consultations to identify the priority themes to be addressed in a revised strategy.  Some 37 submissions were received and they are being analysed and considered by the Department, from which a paper on which to base the next phase will be ready for publication very shortly.  Phase 2 of the process will be based on this paper which will contain suggested high level objectives within each of the agreed themes identified in phase 1.  A number of public consultations will take place nationwide in early 2016 and further submissions will then be sought.  These submissions will inform the final phase which will focus on precise actions under each objective and include continued consultation with the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy steering group to develop a draft strategy for Government approval.  It is intended that the revised national strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and be in place as early as possible in 2016.</p>  <p>  Turning to the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group, it is worth mentioning that, at the request of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, the four national level Traveller NGOs provided a paper setting out why being recognised as an ethnic group was important to Travellers and what it would mean to them.</p><p>The paper sets out in a very positive way what Travellers see as the advantages of recognition.  It does not claim that there would be any onerous legal implications or that there would be any implications whatsoever for public expenditure, nor does it claim that there are any international human rights laws or obligations that recognition would somehow conjure into being.  Concerns Departments had formerly about legal implications and financial costs have been resolved.  In other words, there are no cost implications and almost no legal implications.  As indicated in the Government's amendment, this is an issue that is being examined in the context of discussions on to the proposed new Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and we know that in the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, we have a passionate advocate for change and for recognition.</p> <p> The divide between the Traveller community and the majority community has been all-too apparent in recent weeks.  We need a two-way process.  The majority community needs to affirm and recognise the value of Traveller heritage and culture, and move away from the all-too-easy practice of stereotyping all members of the Traveller community based on the anti-social behaviour of a few.  Another part of the reality is the State and its agencies need to improve the effectiveness of our responses to the needs of the Traveller community.  Within this there must be meaningful consultation with the Traveller community whose voice should be heard and should influence service responses.</p> <p> The Government has some areas of disagreement with the Deputies' proposal, but not with the spirit and intention of the motion.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion calls for the establishment of an all-Ireland forum on Traveller issues.  While the Government is not convinced of the utility of precisely this approach, nonetheless there may be a value in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality continuing a national-level dialogue with Traveller interests and all other stakeholders, following the recommendations of its earlier report on this issue.  I propose that the committee might initiate a national dialogue involving Travellers and the settled community, including representatives of all political parties, central government, local authorities, health and education sectors, and representatives of media organisations, to facilitate the development of greater mutual understanding between Travellers and the settled community, and respect for the heritage and culture of Travellers and their contribution to the wider society.</p></speech>

He said a number of things that are very pertinent to the debate.  While he can correct me if I am wrong, he said there was no financial or legal impediment to recognising Traveller ethnicity.  If there is no financial or legal impediment to granting ethnic status to Travellers, one wonders why we are not doing it.</p>  <p>  The process is pretty simple and was outlined last night by the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The Taoiseach needs to come in here and make a statement to this Chamber.  He needs to write a couple of letters to the various organisations within the EU stating that we are now recognising the Traveller community as an ethnic group.  We then need to look at any legislative changes.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has already said there are no legal impediments to it, so we should just get on with it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said he agreed with the spirit of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion but disagreed with one aspect of it, which is the creation of an all-Ireland forum.  He may call me a cynic, but the creation of an all-Ireland forum would expose this State's attitude to the Traveller community because given that Travellers within the Six Counties already have their ethnicity recognised, it then exposes the hypocrisy of this State in not recognising that very same ethnicity.  I believe that is the reason the Government is opposed to an all-Ireland forum.</p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Barry's speech and was shocked by some of what he said.  If one needs any reason to understand why Travellers suffer from discrimination, one only has to look at some of Deputy Barry's statements.  He brought into the debate on ethnicity the issue of anti-social behaviour and then went on to say that he was not talking about Travellers specifically but about people in general.  As the motion is about recognising Traveller ethnicity, by even bringing in issues such as anti-social behaviour the Deputy is implying that is one of the reasons we should not grant recognition of ethnicity to the Traveller community.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry also said that people were coming to his office to express concerns about Travellers who may be getting accommodation in the locality.  He said that they have genuine fears.  I would like to know what they are.  Plenty of members of the Traveller community come into my office.  My constituency has three halting sites.  We have a large Traveller community in Cork North Central and they form an integral part of the community.  Some of them are living in conditions of squalor.  What the families in the Spring Lane halting site on the north side of Cork city have to endure is beyond belief.  The Minister of State should visit the site.</p>  <p>  Returning to what Deputy Barry said about people expressing genuine concerns about Travellers getting accommodation next to them or within their estate, he failed to mention something which may not happen in his constituency but certainly happens in mine.  People come to my office and express concerns about members of the settled community who may be getting a house near them.  There is almost an impression that if a Traveller moves in next to one, one will see an increase in crime rates and anti-social behaviour but that is not the case.  I know that from first-hand, as there are Travellers who live in my housing estate.  They are some of the most decent people - salt of the earth.  If one had a problem in the morning they would be the first to knock at one's door.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  The problem we have in this Chamber is that there is no leadership.  As with the issue of marriage equality, the public is so far ahead of those of us in this Chamber when it comes to Traveller ethnicity that we need to get our head out of our backside and get on with the job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-11-04a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="20:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110400071#TTT00400"><p>I also listened to Deputy Barry's speech and his appeal that we respect free speech.  I point out to him that hundreds of Irish citizens felt it was acceptable to log on to the<i>journal.ie</i>website and give a thumbs-down to expressions of sympathy, including a simple &quot;rest in peace&quot; and &quot;my heart goes out to the families&quot; from decent Irish citizens about the fact that ten human beings - ten Irish citizens - including five children and a pregnant woman were burnt to death in the most horrific circumstances.  Hundreds of our citizens gave a thumbs-down to expressing sympathy.  Deputy Barry says we need to stop using the word &quot;racism&quot;.  It reminded me of one of the greatest advocates of equality and human dignity in human history, Abraham Lincoln, who once said, &quot;Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt&quot;.</p><p>We support the amendment tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett which strengthens the motion and reflects Deputy Boyd Barrett's commitment to the Traveller community and his partnership with them.  However, we will not support the Government's amendment.  In reference to the Traveller community we use terms such as &quot;experience endemic racism and discrimination&quot;; the Government will not use those words.  We use words such as &quot;prejudice&quot;, &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;social exclusion&quot;; the Government will not use those words.  We state that many Travellers live in &quot;intolerable substandard living conditions&quot;; the Government will not use those words.</p><p>We called for an all-Ireland Travellers forum.  I wish to read the relevant part of the motion because it is an important contribution in terms of what we seek.  We seek to &quot;establish an all-Ireland forum involving Travellers and the settled community, including representatives of all political parties, central government, local authorities, health and education sectors and representatives of media organisations, to be tasked with&quot;, and we outline the responsibilities it would have.  It is an eminently sensible proposal but it has been rejected by the Government.<br/><br/>The motion also calls on the State to &quot;recognise&quot; Traveller ethnicity.  We did not use the word &quot;grant&quot; because Travellers are an ethnic minority in the State.  They are as Irish as anybody in these Houses and they are a unique part of the fabric of this nation.  They have a unique history.  It is a unique story that is part of our story and it needs to be recognised.  To recognise Traveller ethnicity is not to recognise separateness, it is to be inclusive, to bring them into the embrace, warmth, love and promise of the Republic.  That is what it means.  We in this Chamber need to recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller people.  What we hear in response from the Government is that it will consider it.  That is not good enough.  It is no longer good enough to consider the matter anymore.<br/><br/>The leaders of the Traveller community have called for a new national Traveller accommodation consultative committee or some new agency that will take ownership of the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation throughout the State.  Local authorities have failed in this regard.  There is a lack of local leadership.  We have seen some of that spirit evident in the Chamber tonight.  In the absence of local leadership, we need to give responsibility for the issue to a new authority but that call has been rejected.<br/><br/>I wish to quote from some of the comments made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and Deputy Ciara Conway, both from the Labour Party.  It is important to do so.  The Minister of State said:</p><blockquote>I do not accept the premise that we should deal in the terms of popular opinion when advocating the rights of a minority.  Outside of a referendum, I do not believe we should deal in focus group equality or that we should rely on polls in regard to how we should proceed on issues of equality.  The fact that advocating for the rights of a minority might be unpopular is surely the reason we should collectively strive to ensure that equality is realised.<br /><br />[He continued] As alluded to earlier, since the foundation of this State we have experimented with what may be termed &quot;sameness&quot;.  Sameness is a lie.  Since the foundation of this State people with mental health challenges have been incarcerated.  Approximately 200,000 people with mental health issues were incarcerated in the 1950s.  Young mothers who were unmarried were told that they were wrong and had to be placed in laundries.  People who had troubled backgrounds and behavioural difficulties were also told that they were wrong and had to be sent to industrial schools ... Sameness is a lie while diversity is the truth ... The fact that this measure would not be popular, would not do so well in a poll or might be rejected by a focus group is the very reason we have to support it.  Let us reject focus group equality.</blockquote><p>The Minister of State's speech was tremendous and we applaud it.  We also note the comments of Deputy Ciara Conway.  This is important in terms of her Government colleagues who will vote for the amended Government motion tonight.  She said:</p><blockquote>I have read some of the briefing information I have received from the Department.  I could hear the frustration in the voice of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  It will be noted that he did not read from a script because I am not sure the Department [or indeed his Government colleagues] [are] completely on board with what he had to say.</blockquote><p>She referred to the briefing note she received in which three steps were outlined.  That is a reference to the three simple steps the Oireachtas justice committee agreed on a unanimous, all-party basis for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality to stand up in this historic Chamber and recognise, on behalf of the State, the ethnicity of the Traveller people.  The second step is to write to the international human rights bodies who have demanded this for decades to tell them we have finally done that, and then to work with the Traveller communities on the necessary changes and new dispensation that is required.  It is simple stuff.<br/><br/>Deputy Conway also stated:</p><blockquote>Essentially, we are waiting for someone to make a speech and someone else to write a letter, while people's lives hang in the balance.  That is simply not good enough.  If it involved any other group in society, we would not be waiting for someone to stand up and make a speech and for somebody else to write a letter.</blockquote><p>These are powerful words.  If those Deputies are present, I imagine they will vote with the Government.  They will do so even though they have expressed their frustration and anger, in good faith, with their Government colleagues.  I will not attack them for that but I will say to those Government colleagues who did not speak in the Chamber, or the likes of Deputy Tom Barry and others, that they need to read what the Minister of State and Deputy Conway said, what we have said and what has been said by various Deputies across the House, namely, that it is time to be on the right side of history.<br/><br/>When we first talked about women's rights - the right of women to take seats in parliament, the right of women to go out and work and to receive equal pay - those ideas were unpopular when they were first raised.  When we talked about rights for the LGBT community, lesbian and gay citizens, it was not popular.  We know that talk of Traveller rights tonight is not popular.  That is because for decades there has not been the necessary leadership.  We are haunted by the ghost of the 1963 report from the Commission on Itinerancy, one of the most shameful reports in the history of this State, that demonised and criminalised 40,000 Irish citizens - men, women and children - some of whom are here today.  That is the stain we must remove.  That is the ghost we must take away.  We need to have a new beginning.<br/><br/>In the seats of the Gallery are the leaders, the men and women of the Traveller community who have spent their lives as second-class citizens in this State and who have been denied the promise of the words of the 1916 Proclamation.  During the 100th anniversary next year, let us bring them all back into the Gallery to watch their Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality, whoever that might be, finally, belatedly, recognise their culture, their dignity, their beauty, their humanity, their contribution and their part in our history.  That is a day I long for, and we will see it.</p></speech>
