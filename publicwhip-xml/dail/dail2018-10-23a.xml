We learned today that more than 6,000 people who are waiting for elderly care services could be waiting for up to two years.  These are just a number of the issues, all of which have been impacted by the chronic crisis in recruiting and retaining qualified consultants.  There are 3,176 approved consultant posts in our health service but as only 2,713 have been filled, there are about 463 unfilled qualified consultant posts.  Our accident and emergency departments are left without specialist qualified consultants on too regular a basis and there is a chronic shortage across the board in psychiatry across the country.  There are other examples.  In effect, the shortage of qualified consultants is impacting on the quality and timeliness of care for many patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  There is general agreement that the cuts to new entrant consultant salaries, particularly those introduced in October 2012, constitute the key factor in this chronic inability to attract and recruit consultants to the Irish health service.  A cut of up to 30% was introduced in October 2012.  This pay differential is a major inhibitor in terms of recruiting qualified consultants.  We have an unprecedented number of unfilled permanent posts as a result of that, which is clearly undermining the quality and provision of essential care to patients across the acute hospital service.  </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has confirmed the difficulty in recruiting consultants.  </p><p>Everybody seems to have identified the pay differential between consultants recruited post 2012 and their colleagues recruited before that.  The differential which can be up to 57% is the major factor.  When we add the fact that we have 40% fewer consultants than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average we see the impact on the hospital services.  For example, in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, there are 6,500 new patients waiting to see a consultant urologist.  St. James's Hospital has advertised twice and has failed to recruit a consultant.  In Cork, approximately 6,000 patients are awaiting outpatient reviews for eye surgery.  In a recent survey by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, of 300 recently appointed consultants, post-2012, 70% are seriously considering resigning from their public hospital posts unless the discrimination against them ends.  Does the Taoiseach accept that we have a very serious issue in recruiting qualified consultants to the health service?  Does he accept that the post-2012 pay differential is a key factor and does he accept this is having an impact on patient care adding to waiting lists and undermining overall quality and what does he propose to do about it?</p></speech>

When we ask 14,000 of our patients, as we do every year, how they rate their experience of our health service, 85% of public patients say they rate our public health service highly, that their experience is good or very good or even excellent.  When it comes to patient outcomes, for example, we see big improvements in survival rates for cancer, heart attack and stroke over the past five to ten years happening because of new technology and the hard work of our front-line staff and Government investment and policies behind them.  For example, on the issue of overcrowding, today 297 patients await a hospital bed.  That is down 24% on this day last year and down 20% on the same day two years ago.  If one looks at the HSE special delivery unit, SDU, official numbers, month on month, there has been a decrease in the number of people waiting on trolleys every month since May.</p></speech>

If we consider waiting times, yes, there are far too many people on waiting lists but the most important point is how long they wait.  People now wait on average fewer than six months for an operation or procedure that they need.  There are 50,000 waiting more than three months, most people wait fewer than six months for an operation or procedure.  For example, at the end of July 2017, there were almost 8,000 patients waiting more than three months for cataract procedures.  That number is down to 4,000.  We all get lots of queries about hips and knees.  The number waiting more than three months in July 2017 was 2,400.  That is down to 1,717.  Similarly, there were 2,600 people waiting for tonsil procedures during the summer of 2017.  That is down to 1,150.  We can see that the investment in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in particular, is reducing waiting times considerably for patients waiting for an operation or procedure.  We now plan to bring that approach to outpatients as well, making sure that money actually follows the patient.</p></speech>

There was a protest some weeks ago demanding an extra &euro;1 billion for health.  We have provided more than that for next year.  We need more and more to make sure that money gets to the patient.  That has not always been happening.</p></speech>

I very specifically focused on the issue of  recruitment and retention of qualified consultants.  I pointed out that there is a crisis in recruiting consultants because of a pay differential - the discriminatory pay difference between those recruited after 2012 and those before 2012 - and the Taoiseach chose not to answer the question at all.</p>  <p>  He did refer to improvements in cancer and heart disease.  The cardiovascular strategy of the late 1990s and the cancer strategies and the centres of excellence are the bedrock or foundation stone for the different quality of care in those two sectors.</p><p>It was long before the Taoiseach arrived on the scene.<br/><br/>I am glad the Taoiseach outlined the impact of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  He opposed its inclusion in the confidence and supply agreement three years ago.  It took us a long time to convince him and his colleagues about the merits of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and I am glad that in some areas, the numbers are reducing.  Hopefully over the next year with the budget allocation that will also happen.<br/><br/>The Public Service Pay Commission has acknowledged the difficulty.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge the issue?</p></speech>

The Government accepts we have a problem in recruiting and retaining consultants in our public hospital system.  What is being done about it?  We have a three-year pay agreement, which involves pay increases and pay restoration for consultants, including two pay increases next year and an increment.  We have negotiated with ICTU an arrangement for new entrants recruited after 2011-12 to equalise the pay scales.  It does not do that fully for consultants, but it goes a considerable way towards that.  There will be two pay increases, pay restoration, an increment, as well as special measures for new entrants, all happening next year.  Those pay increases take a big chunk out of that extra &euro;1 billion for healthcare next year.  We need to ensure we do not allow all the money go into extra pay and pay rises.  We also need to ensure there is money for new services, new drugs, new equipment and new buildings.</p>  <p>  We accept the Public Service Pay Commission report, which I have read as have the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The best thing we can do now is to engage with the IMO and the IHCA on what can be done to improve the situation.  We also need to bear in mind some realities.  We probably need a new approach.  We have more doctors working in our health service than ever before, but we are not seeing that matched in an increase in activity in-----</p></speech>

I offer sympathy to the Taoiseach and his party colleagues.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p>  <p>  This morning, Care Alliance Ireland published a report on the provision and shortcomings of public provision of home care.  Its findings are stark and they highlight a shocking reality facing thousands of our most vulnerable citizens in need of care and support.</p>  <p>  The report finds that more than 6,000 people are on waiting lists for home-care packages, a finding that was also communicated to my party colleague, An Teachta O'Reilly, in which the HSE acknowledged to her that the number of people waiting for home-care support stands at 6,118.  The report states that people are waiting for up to two years in some cases for home-care support and that the average waiting time in one HSE area is six to nine months.  </p>  <p>  The report also estimates that there is an 18% gap across the board between the number of care hours being provided and those required.  In one HSE area only 60% of hours requested are being provided.  The figures are absolutely shocking.  They are shocking because services have been cut and they remain underfunded.</p>  <p>  The report finds that there was a reduction in services between 2009 and 2012 and, most acutely, between 2011 and 2012, under a Fine Gael and Labour Government when there was a reduction of 1.5 million home-care hours.</p><p>Despite the service remaining underfunded, no additional resources were allocated for home care supports in next year's budget.  That illustrates a complete disregard for the value of home care.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, it is one of the most important services provided within the public system.  Care delivered in the home is the preferred form of care for most people and their families, particularly older people.  The vast majority of older citizens want to live independently and comfortably in their own home for as long as possible.  Home care packages are also vital for many with a disability or in medical need.</p> <p> Providing these packages makes absolute sense socially, but also economically.  It saves the State money and frees up resources.  Failure to provide adequate care through these packages leaves people stuck in hospitals or forced into residential facilities when they could return home.  This has a knock-on effect, contributing to the trolley and waiting list crises in our hospitals as beds are occupied by those who want to, and who are ready to, return home but who are prevented from doing so.</p> <p> The HSE has said home support services must be delivered within the funding available.  The logical solution is to make more funding available.  Will the Taoiseach revisit his allocation of funding to provide for additional home care packages next year?  Will he, in line with the report's recommendations, move quickly to delivering a fairer, better home care support service?</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to visit the house yesterday.  Many of us served with Seymour for a period.  He truly was a wonderful public representative, a gentle giant and a good friend to many of us.  There will be an opportunity at a later date to pay tribute to him in a more substantial way.</p>  <p>  With regard to home care, the Government, HSE and health policy very much favour it.  It enables older people, but not just older people, to get out of hospital much quicker.  In many cases, good home care means they never have to go to hospital at all.  It also means people who need it, particularly elderly citizens, are able to spend much more time in their homes before they have to go into long-term residential care.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to 2011 and 2012.  I have no doubt she is correct in what she said in that regard but, of course, it is not 2011 or 2012; it is now 2018.  There has been a considerable increase in resources and funding for home care during the past three years.  In 2015, for example, the budget for home care was &euro;306 million.  This year it is &euro;420 million, representing an increase of more than 30% in the past three years alone.  An additional &euro;1 billion will be provided for health services next year.  That has not yet been allocated.  I am certain some of it will be allocated for extra home help and home care packages.  We need to make sure, however, that the &euro;1 billion gets to the patients.  We need to come together as a House and make sure it does not get lost in red tape and in meeting pay demands and other demands.  We must make sure it goes to the patients and is allocated for extra home help and home care packages, new medicines, new services and new equipment.  The big challenge we face collectively in this House over the next couple of months is making sure the &euro;1 billion, or as much of it as possible, gets to the patients, which means better care for them, including extra home help and extra home care packages.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HSE service plan provided for 17 million home help hours.  This allocation provided home help to 50,500 people.  We acknowledge absolutely that there will be a need for additional resources next year; that is planned.  We acknowledge that there are inconsistencies in waiting times from one region to the next.  In some places, the waiting time is as little as 24 days while, in others, it is six to nine months, on average.  It is, of course, a policy dilemma.  When one allows for regional autonomy, there will be regional variation, but we need to bear that in mind.</p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, we plan to develop a statutory scheme for home care, very much using the fair deal model.  People can now apply to the scheme for long-term care.  If they qualify for it, they will get long-term care in approximately four weeks but, because we do not have a statutory scheme of that kind for home care, some people may get home care within 24 days while others may have to wait for six to nine months.  We believe we now need to establish a statutory scheme for home care that is not the same as the fair deal scheme but that works on that model, which has proven to be a success.</p></speech>

That is not a matter of controversy.  The report is very clear and the figures are not wrong.  The 1.5 million hours cut from the system have not been fully replaced and there is a 16% deficit in the hours required.  The report also proposes how that might be funded, saying that somewhere north of an additional &euro;100 million must be dedicated to the service.  Will the Taoiseach do that?  I am sure he is familiar with this through his constituency work.  I have constituents who have a home care package that amounts to half an hour per day.  This is for people who are sick or have serious disabilities.  One would barely have one's coat off and the kettle switched on in half an hour.  It is a derisory allocation.</p>  <p>  The system has been starved of resources and the past damage has been done.  Now, the repair work must start.  Rather than make vague assertions, will the Taoiseach dedicate the resources necessary to meet and close that 16% gap in service provision?</p></speech>

As Head of the Government, I want to ensure that the extra &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money we are putting into the health service next year, or at least as much of it as possible, gets to the patients.  That means additional home care packages, new medicine, new equipment and new buildings.  I would welcome Sinn F&eacute;in's ideas as to how that &euro;1 billion should be broken down and spent.  It is not good enough for a serious Opposition party, certainly not one that wishes to be in government, to come here every week demanding more funding for all forms of health care and it all adding up to &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion.  There is only so much that can be dedicated to the health service next year.  There is an extra &euro;1 billion, which is a big increase.  I hope the Deputy shares my desire that priority be given to patients and that the money goes to patient care and additionality, not to paying more for the same.  More of the same is not the solution for our health service.  There has been an increase in spending on home care from &euro;306 million in 2015 to &euro;420 million, a massive increase of &euro;120 million in three years.  We are not seeing the results of that for patients.  That is why we need a new system and a new way of providing home care.  We believe a statutory scheme is the way to go, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, not just more of the same.</p></speech>

Significantly, I pose this question on the same day that we await the Taoiseach's decision on the mother and baby home in Tuam.  I sincerely hope he will decide on a full excavation and exhumation of the site with a view to maximum information being made available.  This is also the day we have learned, quite incredibly, that the Government has changed the application process for compensation for women who worked in Magdalen laundries.  It now requires them to specify the number of weekly hours worked, completely disregarding the spirit and content of the Quirke report.</p>  <p>  Similarly, there is the case of Caranua and the rationale and content of its purpose.  It was established to provide support to people who experienced abuse in institutions as children.  In 2013, the chairwoman said there should be smooth and uncomplicated access to the fund.  The chief executive officer, CEO, said it was about putting survivors at the heart of the process.  It was always a defined group with a defined amount of money.  It was meant to be rolled out transparently and with minimum bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.  It is a classic example of the institution becoming more important than the people it was set up to serve.</p><p>Survivors have confirmed that its mode of delivery has added to their abuse.<br/><br/>Rather than rolling out a fair and transparent system based on a comprehensive plan the applicants have, at best, been subjected to an <i>ad hoc</i>, haphazard and unprofessional system which has succeeded in traumatising them again.  People have come to Deputies at the end of their tether.  Among the issues raised are the constant changing of personnel, no timely response on the phones, no timely response to letters and no giving of information relating to rights, especially the right of appeal.  In essence, there has been a recreation for the applicants of the abuse suffered in institutions.  Caranua is certainly misnamed.  Rather than being a new friend, it is the old friend, the seanchara, with an arbitrary use of power, which is perfectly encapsulated in the way in which the arbitrary limit of &euro;15,000 was brought in.  This was retrospective and left applicants in limbo with no knowledge as to their rights.  We now have an appeals system and I pay tribute to the appeals officers who have highlighted the concerns.  One appeals officer is working with a significant backlog.  Having recognised the need for it, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will immediately put in an additional appeals officer?  Will he examine what is happening on the ground and take a hands-on approach to stop injustice being repeated when it is unnecessary?</p></speech>

The Cabinet accepted her recommendations today.  I would like to give the Minister the opportunity to outline her recommendations in detail at 3 p.m. when she is able to do so.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Magdalen redress scheme, the Government's intention is to comply with and implement the Ombudsman's recommendations on the scheme, which is to extend the scheme to a wider group of women who did not live in the Magdalen laundries but who worked in them and lived in adjacent institutions.  In doing so, we operate as a Government in good faith, accepting the Ombudsman's recommendations and trying to implement them.  The scheme is, however, based on the amount of time a woman spent in the institution and the number of hours she worked there, so it is necessary to ask that question.  This is the way the scheme works; it is linked to the amount of time spent in the institution and the number of hours worked there.  This is how the financial award is calculated, which is the fairest way to do it.</p>  <p>  Caranua as a body has, at this stage, allocated over &euro;100 million to people who needed additional practical supports, often advice and counselling and in some cases assistance to modify their homes and with their healthcare.  Many of the people who received some of that &euro;100 million have put it to good use and it has helped them in their lives.  I absolutely appreciate, as with any system or application process, that it can be difficult.  It can be frustrating to fill in forms and it can be difficult to answer questions.  Sometimes people do not get the answer they want.  This is why we have an appeals mechanism.</p>  <p>  I will have to give consideration to the issue around an additional appeals officer.  I do not know whether that is necessary, but I will certainly speak to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, about that.  If the Deputy knows of individual cases of people who have had a bad experience of Caranua, perhaps she could pass them on to the Minister or to me and we will try to check them out.  As is always the case with any application system, there will be people who are satisfied with how it worked and with the award they received, and there will also be people who are very dissatisfied.  This is why we have an appeals system for them.</p></speech>

There has been a large number of appeals, 66% of which have been upheld in one way or another.  That figure speaks volumes.  Second, the administration of this scheme has become abusive in itself.  This issue has been raised by me, by my colleagues last week in the Chamber in a Topical Issue debate, and by various Members through parliamentary questions.  A Private Members' motion also highlighted the difficulties on the ground.  It is not a matter of certain individuals being frustrated.  The system is unjust, arbitrary and unfair and it recreates the abuse that was suffered when these applicants were children in the institutions.</p><p>The need for an appeals officer has been clearly set out by the appeals officer's report, which gives the number of appeals.  In one year 87 appeals were received in the period and 140 were carried over.  There has been a carry-over of 34 into this year, along with other appeals.  The most basic requirement at this stage is to have a second appeals officer so that people bringing appeals can be dealt with with dignity.  </p> <p> Second, on the right to know that one can appeal, the Taoiseach should at the very least ensure that information is crystal clear.  For the third year in a row the appeals officer says that it is not clear.</p></speech>

It was established to provide practical and financial support to survivors of residential institutions.  It has already provided support in the region of &euro;100 million to survivors and former residents of those institutions to help them with their lives.  It is certainly not designed to abuse anyone; it is designed to help them.  It has helped a lot of people, many of whom I have met in the course of my work.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's two specific asks, I will speak to the Minister, Deputy McHugh, about this.  I absolutely agree that if people are not informed that they have a right of appeal, they should be.  That would seem to me to be elementary.  When it comes to any application procedure people should be made aware of the option or right to appeal.  I will follow up on that.  I cannot, here on the floor of the Chamber, say whether a second appeals officer is necessary but I will certainly examine the issue.</p></speech>

That concern is based on two issues: the question of ownership and the question of ethos.  On ownership, most people simply cannot fathom why the State would even contemplate gifting a valuable asset worth more than &euro;300 million to a private entity.  That must stop.  Does the Taoiseach agree?</p>  <p>  There is also grave concern, especially among women, about the fact that it is proposed to transfer ownership of the new national maternity hospital - and it will be called the National Maternity Hospital -  to a private religious entity, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It is wholly inappropriate that this should be the case in this day and age.  The fear, which is very well founded, is that women will be denied access to the full range of healthcare services provided for under the law.  We know that religious orders have a special place in the Constitution.  Under Article 44, a religious order can control what it owns.  When the Supreme Court has been asked to interpret this part of the Constitution it has always supported the right of the order to protect its own ethos.  We know that when it comes down to deciding the ethos of Elm Park the Constitution will have to prevail and the order will win out.  </p>  <p>  The Mulvey report was a brokered deal done behind closed doors between two private institutions, St. Vincent's and Holles Street, with no reference at all to the public interest but the Minister, Deputy Harris, continues to blindly maintain that the Mulvey report can provide a solution.  What is the status of this report now?  Surely it is redundant.  </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Minister for Health asked for a month to get to grips with the crisis facing him.  He has now had 17 months and he has not managed to square this circle because it is simply not possible.  Can the Taoiseach now give an undertaking that the new national maternity hospital will be taken into public ownership as a condition of public funding; that the more than &euro;300 million which has been earmarked for the new build will be conditional on this change in ownership; and that the new national maternity hospital will be governed by a new secular charter which is fit for the 21st century?</p></speech>

We want to see it go to tender, if not this year certainly next year and we want to see it go to construction next year.  It involves the development of a new maternity hospital on the campus of St. Vincent's at Elm Park and also improvements to that hospital.  The new hospital will be funded by the State and is included in Project Ireland 2040.  The hospital will have full operational and clinical independence.  We intend that it should apply the medical ethics of our State and our Republic and not those of any religious order.  The development will represent a flagship project of the national maternity strategy and will constitute the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland.  However, it is essential that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this very significant State investment are robust.  Considerable work is under way and has been undertaken to develop a legal framework for this project to protect the public's significant investment in the new hospital.  This legal framework will also underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital from St. Vincent's.  Once finalised - and it has not been finalised yet - the proposals will be subject to consideration by the Government, the national maternity hospital itself and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I assure the House that patient care in the new hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and that any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there.</p>  <p>  It should also be said that the model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.  Government policy is to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services to provide the best clinical outcomes.  This has already been done in Cork, for example, so we want to have it done in Limerick as well with the relocation of St. Munchin's to the University Hospital Limerick site at Dooradoyle, the Rotunda to Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown and the Coombe to St. James's Hospital where it will be trilocated with the national children's hospital that is now under construction.  </p></speech>

It is simply not possible under the law as it stands to give that guarantee.  This is not about protecting an investment; it is about ownership.  When it comes to ownership, the Constitution will always trump any agreement that has been done between the Government and a private religious entity.  It is somewhat ironic that the Minister for Health recently set up a group to examine the strange relationship between voluntary hospitals - especially those that are religious based - and the State and to make recommendations for how that relationship can be renegotiated in the future.  It is ironic that he looks as if he is about to take steps to repeat the mistakes of the past without having regard to any lessons learned.</p>  <p>  In light of what the Taoiseach has said today, I am asking if he will give an undertaking that any draft agreement that is proposed to be done with St. Vincent's Hospital in respect of the national maternity hospital will be brought before the House before it is signed off on by Government.  People simply cannot believe, on the evidence of the Constitution and the laws we know of, that what the Taoiseach is proposing is actually possible.  </p></speech>

We have a good example already of how we have taken three hospitals that had a voluntary religious ethos and put them together on one site with a statutory board.  This is a matter that is not yet resolved but if the Deputy can see what we have done with the children's hospital, it is the kind of outcome we will be looking to achieve with regard to the national maternity hospital.</p>  <p>  We have quite a number of voluntary hospitals in Ireland.  A lot of our hospices are run by voluntary bodies which are often associated with religious bodies.  We should not make an automatic assumption that it is always a bad thing because there is a long history and tradition of care there and many people have a very high regard for some of those hospitals.</p></speech>

He also announced he had decided to establish a compassionate access programme.  The D&aacute;il has been extremely patient about this, as have people around the country.  There were reviews in June and July of this year, but when people will have access to this programme remains a mystery.  The numbers using the existing framework for importing medicinal cannabis, based on an endorsement by one's general practitioner, GP, and consultant, is growing all the time.  Patients such as Ms Vera Twomey must travel overseas to Europe every three months to secure the medicinal cannabis which has been identified by their specialists and GPs.  This cannot go on.  The number of people seeking access is growing, and, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the HPRA study identified medicinal cannabis as helpful for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, persons who get sick from chemotherapy, and those suffering from cancer, spasticity or multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Nearly two years later, there is no sign of the access programme being established.  Can the Taoiseach shed some light on this and give me a timeline - or get the Minister to do so - as to when people will have access to this programme?</p></speech>

The deportation order for Shepherd Machaya is anything but compassionate.  He has lived nine years in direct provision, a pretty awful system, but he made an effort to secure a FETAC level 5 qualification before going to DCU, where he completed his first year with flying colours, but now he is being threatened with deportation.  Some 13,000 friends, fellow students, the students' union, and DCU, which is a university of sanctuary, are all pleading with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Government to be compassionate, humanitarian and revoke that order to allow Shepherd Machaya to remain here, finish his studies and contribute to Irish society.  I do not understand why the Minister would throw out somebody who is studying IT systems and business management when they could contribute to Irish society.

The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, said that it was doing great altogether, and that we should look at Limerick and see how well it was doing.  The Taoiseach visited Tipperary town approximately five years ago when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He saw it for himself.  Not a penny has been invested by this Government or the previous Government, and we have had no meaningful visit from the IDA or anyone else.  Will the Taoiseach take action and set up a task force to deal with the chronic unemployment and lack of investment in Tipperary town, both in terms of infrastructure, including the main road, and job incentives?

Anybody coming into a Department should do exactly that.</p>  <p>  Education is one of the areas in which we have seen enormous improvements in the past several years, whether it is new subjects such as computer science or physical education for the leaving certificate, whether it is the introduction of new subjects such as Lithuanian for the junior cycle, whether it is &euro;11 billion secured for the budget next year or whether it is more people from non-traditional backgrounds entering third level education than ever before.  There have been really good results in terms of the performance of children in English and maths.  If one judges education in terms of outcomes, our teachers, lecturers, schools, universities and the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, have done an excellent job in the past several years.</p></speech>

The M7 carries 80,000 commuters and motorists every day and is the main artery between Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford travelling through Kildare.  Necessary works are going on until 2020 to widen the motorway.  We need to have an increased level of work in the evening time and over weekends to ensure it will be finished before time.</p>  <p>  There have been several accidents over the past few days where motorists have been delayed for up to an hour.

How did this information come to be in the possession of that journalist and newspaper?  Surely information of this kind would have been contained in a Department of Justice and Equality or Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, file.  How else would it have been received by a journalist?  Potentially, this seems to be a very serious data breach.  If it is a data breach it suggests officials at the Department of Justice and Equality were briefing against a nine year old.

In spite of that, many women in County Cork are still waiting unreasonably long times for access to gynaecological health services in Cork University Maternity Hospital.  Some 354 women are currently awaiting treatment, up from 341 in August.  I have raised this issue in the House on several occasions.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was considering governance changes that would make improvements.  There were some improvements but the waiting list has grown again.  A one stop shop was identified, a vacant theatre was to be opened for the first time and vacant consultant posts were to be filled.  Those actions need to be taken.  What action will be taken to improve access to such services for women in County Cork?</p></speech>

If he did so today, he would understand the serious overcrowding issues on the northern commuter and DART line due to the chronic lack of capital investment in commuter rail services over the past six or seven years.  Page 128 of the programme for Government contains a commitment to investing in public transport.  What additional capital funds will the Taoiseach and the Government allocate to Irish Rail to improve the chronic situation in the greater Dublin area and particularly on the northern commuter-----</p></speech>

The chronic lack of investment in our infrastructure for six or seven years - possibly longer than that - occurred for a reason.  It occurred as a consequence of the appalling mismanagement of Ireland's economy in the period before 2008-09.  Because the economy is back on track, we have been able to invest in infrastructure again over the past two years.  Project Ireland 2040 provides for considerable capital investment in Irish Rail to improve DART services and have them run every ten minutes and to extend the DART to Drogheda and Maynooth and along the Kildare line.</p></speech>

They are seeking an increase in their pensions and see arbitration by Government as the only solution to assist them in their quest.  They are coming before an Oireachtas committee on Thursday.  Will the Taoiseach and Government look at this group to see if there is any possibility of increasing their pensions because people on the State pension have rightly received an increase since 2018 and this group is seeking the same?</p></speech>

One application that was brought to my attention this week involved applicants who been in the process for three years.  Despite the fact that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has said that increased resources and staff are being made available to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in this time of national crisis in respect of the housing sector and the provision of housing, it is appalling to think that a one-off house cannot be dealt with adequately within the time assigned by the board.  If that is the case, why can the Government not bring forward legislation to put them on a statutory basis to deal with them in a timely manner, which An Bord Plean&aacute;la should do so anyway?</p></speech>

It has gone through much reform that has resulted in a lot of success and fast-track planning.  It is something we can certainly look at because these issues come up a lot with regard to length of time but the staffing issue must help resolve some of that.  However, I am prepared to look at it.</p></speech>

The World Economic Forum says it will take women 217 years to catch up in terms of pay parity if we wait for employers.  Today, 8,000 workers - women and men - in Glasgow are taking strike action for 48 hours to win equal pay.  Will the Taoiseach join me in sending solidarity to them because they are home care workers and education workers who provide essential public services - work that is not valued enough?  The Glasgow women's strike is something that should be taken up by workers everywhere.  Otherwise we will wait 200 years for equality.</p></speech>

The staff numbers have been reduced by four.</p><p>In further alignment with the Secretary General's report, the reformed GIS team now incorporates the Government Press Office, giving a total of 17 on the newly combined team.</p><p>This includes <i>MerrionStreet.ie</i>.<br/><br/>The civil servants in the reformed GIS come under the management of the assistant secretary for corporate affairs, while respecting the role of the Government press secretary and the deputy and assistant Government press secretaries in day-to-day management of press and communications.  The work of the GIS includes the work of the Government press office, the digital team or <i>MerrionStreet.ie</i>, central support services for other Departments, providing services to the media, managing media events, and producing communications material across all platforms.<br/><br/>The GIS is supporting the development of the single Government identity, the single web portal project, <i>www.gov.ie</i>, and capacity-building in communications across government.  The GIS continues to have a co-ordinating and supporting role for national, cross-Government communications, as has always been the case, but such campaigns are being led and funded by the relevant line Department.</p></reply>

Instead of seeing modern communications, what we are seeing is very traditional old-style marketing.  It may use new platforms but there is nothing modern about the focus on selling messages rather than engaging with citizens in a real way.</p>  <p>  In recent days, the Taoiseach has begun appearing in paid online advertisements on Brexit.  Could he tell us how many views he has bought for his video?  With the dramatic extension of policy advertising and the central role played by the Taoiseach and his Ministers, most modern communications companies would undertake a review of its effectiveness.  Can the Taoiseach state whether any studies have been commissioned on whether the politician-focused advertising on which the Government is spending millions of euro is effective?  Have we become a more creative society?  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, and the Taoiseach have been appearing regularly in paid advertisements in supplements telling us that creativity is great.  Creative Ireland is costing a lot of money and there have been many supplements and photographs.  I am not clear, however, about their impact.</p>  <p>  It is purported that the video produced for the UN Security Council campaign cost approximately &euro;100,000, and that &euro;370,000 was expended on it overall.  One hundred thousand euro was spent on a five-minute video, which seemed to be more about the domestic audience than the international audience.  We have won the campaign before.  On previous occasions, we have had people elected to the Security Council but it did not involve this sort of elaborate razzmatazz and videos of the Taoiseach and others with backdrops, music and all the rest of it.  That is all fine but people who know what Security Council elections are all about are aware it is about the hard grind of knocking on doors.  It takes a long time to make contacts, which are built up over a number of years.  Arrangements must be made with other countries and alliances have to be developed.  Therefore, I question the need for a video production costing &euro;100,000 for the campaign.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach indicated to me its purpose and audience.  The audience seems to be domestic rather than international.  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether he has undertaken any analyses or studies of the effectiveness of all this?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said previously that it is part of the e-government strategy for the period 2017 to 2020 to rationalise existing Government websites and online services over time.  Will the <i>gov.ie</i>portal replace in time all the departmental websites, some of which are a bit outdated and many of which are not very user-friendly?  Will the departmental websites be redesigned in line with the <i>gov.ie</i>interface?</p><p>It was envisaged as part of the e-government strategy that there would be, by last month, an online health portal added to the suite of services available through the <i>MyGov.ie</i>service.  This has not happened.  When will that portal be added?  What exactly will the service provide?  How will it direct people?  How will people interact with it?</p></speech>

It might be a useful exercise.</p><p>Creative Ireland and the UN Security Council campaigns are not run out of my Department or funded by it.  With regard to the UN Security Council campaign more broadly, it obviously has different aspects.  There is traditional lobbying at diplomatic and political levels.  I used the Asia&ndash;Europe summit on Friday in Brussels as an opportunity to do that.  I met bilaterally, in a formal context, the President of Mongolia and the Prime Minister of Norway.  I also met the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan and the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.  I obviously had many other interactions on Thursday evening and Friday with many government representatives and world leaders.  I used the occasion as an opportunity to make our case and pitch for a seat on the UN Security Council.  Should I have the opportunity to continue in office between now and the election in 2020, that will be a big part of the work I do as Taoiseach.  Obviously it is happening all the time at diplomatic level.  Ministers are incorporating this work into their regular bilateral meetings.</p><p>Beyond diplomatic and political lobbying, there is, of course, what we actually do as a country, including the stance we take in the United Nations and the position we take on important issues.  As part of the budget last week, there was a very large increase in commitment to overseas development assistance.  I often hear political parties in this Chamber demanding that we increase our contribution to overseas development aid by a certain amount.  We exceeded any figure produced by any party in our commitment.  That now allows us to start moving up the scale again in terms of the proportion of our national income that is committed to overseas development aid.  We had been at about 0.5% at one stage but the figure fell to about 0.3%.  We are now going to start increasing the proportion again, however.  We have an ongoing commitment to peacekeeping.  We are increasing our level of participation in the mission in Lebanon, as the Deputy knows, taking the place of the Finns and Estonians, who are not continuing any more.  It is important to have a public-awareness aspect to the campaign informing the public about what the Government is doing and how its money is being spent, particularly when it relates to overseas development aid, peacekeeping and our work in the United Nations.  In addition, the Global Ireland 2025 initiative, to which I am very committed, is expanding our diplomatic presence around the world.  New embassies are being set up and we are expanding significantly the remit and operations of agencies such as IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and InterTrade Ireland.  The Deputies will have seen in the budget a real, substantial commitment to all of those things.  This is a new approach to foreign policy that is bursting with substance, whether in respect of Global Ireland 2025 or our UN Security Council campaign.</p><p>With regard to <i>gov.ie</i>, I am not fully up to date on how the project is going.  The plan is that <i>gov.ie</i>will become the portal for access to all Departments and services.  To be honest, I am not quite sure how rapidly it is developing.  I believe it is run out of the Office of Government Procurement.  I am afraid I do not know the position on the health portal yet but I will certainly find out and advise the Deputy by correspondence.</p></speech>

The report concerned a very sensitive issue touching on the lives of women, some of whom are very ill, and of families, some of whom are grieving after a devastating bereavement.</p>  <p>  The leaking of this information was not done with any regard for the interests of the families and the women concerned and it frustrated the plans that had been put in place to have Dr. Scally brief the women and families and patients&rsquo; representatives at the same time as the Cabinet meeting and ahead of the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  The matter is being investigated by a senior official who did not receive a copy of the report in advance of its publication.  I do not wish to pre-empt the investigation by attempting at this stage to answer questions that will have to be considered as part of that inquiry.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300020#S00900"><p>When someone in government decided to leak and spin the Scally report, the Taoiseach said at the time he was disgusted by it, and he condemned in very clear terms what had happened.  The question remains whether he was sincere in this or whether he is just scared to find a culprit because the culprit could be very much part of a near-permanent obsession with spin in the Taoiseach's Government.</p><p>We should be clear about this.  The Taoiseach knows, or it should be easy for him to determine, every person in the Government who had access to the report's findings.  It appears that it was in the Taoiseach's office and in the office of the Minister for Health.  The leaking of the report was unquestionably morally repugnant, given the significance of the issue involved.  As the Taoiseach said, it frustrated the objective in the first instance of meeting with the women who have been affected by this and briefing them on the content of the report.  It was also a clear breach of the confidentiality of Cabinet documents and official papers.</p> <p> Would it not have been preferable to bring in an outsider with the power and authority to get to the bottom of what was a callous and cynical attempt at media manipulation?  There is no question that the objective was to manipulate the public discourse on the Scally report in advance of its publication.  This is not new.  Leaks have occurred with a number of reports in order for the Government to get its line out first.  When will the senior official the Taoiseach has appointed report to him?  It has been approximately six weeks and the person surely has a timeline as to when we can expect a report on the investigation.

The Minister for Health complained in the House about the manner in which some of that information was being drip fed.  In the immediate aftermath of this latest leak the people affected said they were incredibly hurt.  They had put a great deal of faith in the Scally report and they had put a lot of themselves into getting to the truth in that report.  Can the Taoiseach update us on the current stage of the investigation?  My understanding is that a limited number of people had access to the information that somehow found its way into the public domain so it is a little odd that the senior person, given whatever assistance the Taoiseach has provided, cannot identify the person concerned.  It is not as if there were multiple copies of this report left lying around so I cannot understand the reason for the delay.  Has the Taoiseach identified the person who leaked the report?  If and when that person is identified, will he or she be subject to disciplinary action?  Can the Taoiseach advise if the Minister, Deputy Harris, was aware of the leak in advance?</p></speech>

None of the recommendations appeared in the press, nor did any of the findings.  What appeared in the press in advance was one aspect of the report, which was that it was Dr. Scally's opinion that a commission of inquiry was not warranted.  None of the recommendations or findings was leaked, only the aspect concerning Dr. Scally's opinion regarding a commission of investigation.  Perhaps one could say that one line from the entire report was leaked to the press in advance.</p>  <p>  I note Deputy Martin's allegations.  He regularly makes allegations in the House without any evidence to support them.  He certainly has a penchant for innuendo and conspiracy theories.  The report would have been available to more than the Department of Health and the Office of the Taoiseach.  It would have been available to Dr. Scally, his team and many of the advisers who assisted him in putting the report together.  Deputy Martin's presumption that only somebody in the Government, a civil servant or a politician had access to the report is not the case.  Of course, it could have been leaked by somebody who did not have the report at all because all that was leaked was one aspect of it - the fact that it was Dr. Scally's opinion that a commission of inquiry was not required.  It could have been done on a verbal basis.  As is always the case, unless there is a paper or documentary trail of some nature it is difficult to identify the culprit.  Certainly, if the person is identified and if he or she is a civil servant, politician or adviser, the person will be disciplined.  If the person is not, that does not fall to me.</p>  <p>  The only people who know are the journalists involved.  They have been asked for their co-operation.  This should not be treated as a normal story and both journalists who know have been asked to co-operate out of respect to the women and families who were upset by this.  The only other person who knows is the person who leaked the information.</p></speech>

It was a key issue.  The Minister for Health had agreed in the D&aacute;il to a commission of inquiry.  He came under pressure in the House and for whatever reason capitulated on that evening and said there would be a commission of inquiry.  The Taoiseach followed suit.  It was significant, therefore, that prior to the publication of the report a steer or spin occurred, the spin being that there was no need for a commission of inquiry.  The cynical or sceptical might say that the last thing those in authority and the various stakeholders wanted was a commission of inquiry into this and, therefore, spun in that direction via the Scally report.  That is one possibility.  A significant element was leaked and I believe it was done for a specific reason, which was to undermine the case for a commission of inquiry.  Whether one agrees or disagrees, the objective of the leak was to move away from the idea that there should be a commission of inquiry into the CervicalCheck issue.  I speak as somebody who initially supported the Government regarding a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inquiry.  However, under pressure on the floor of the House, the Minister caved in and said there would be a commission of inquiry.  Ever since Dr. Scally has reported the emphasis has been on moving away from a commission of inquiry.  That is the context.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach name the senior official who is investigating this?  Can he give the official's details, rank and his Department?  Third, the Taoiseach and I know that the media protect their sources.  It is a little much to suggest, given the propensity of Ministers to leak regularly to various senior political correspondents and people across the board, that the Taoiseach is allegedly sincere in wanting them to cough up the source.  That is breathtakingly cynical.</p></speech>

If he has any evidence that any individual, politician, adviser, civil servant or anybody associated with Dr. Scally or his team put this information in the public domain by talking to journalists, I ask him to present that evidence.  If he has no evidence, he should not make the assumption that it must have been a politician or a member of the Government.  He has no basis for that.  It should be basic decent politics in the House that we do not make allegations against each other when we have no basis or evidence for doing so.</p>  <p>  When a leak happens, I often wonder who did it.  One would presume that the person who did it somehow had a plan or thought to benefit from it in some way.  The aspect of the report that was leaked was that it was Dr. Scally's opinion that a commission of inquiry was not necessary.  Bear in mind that the Government had made a decision to establish a commission of inquiry and the Government still has no difficulty with doing so.  Even the innuendo on this occasion does not make sense.</p></speech>

These include: affordable childcare; ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability; advancing a number of important gender equality measures; and the development of an in-school speech and language therapy service, a pilot of which is now under way.</p></reply>

I was not going to make this point but there is a chronic crisis in speech and language therapy and the availability of such services for young children, even to get diagnosed and so on.</p>  <p>  On social policy and public services, does the Taoiseach accept that a huge percentage, I would go as far as to say 10% to 15%, of society does not engage with services and that there are disadvantaged communities right across the State, not only in the large urban centres but also in rural areas, which have not contributed to, or engaged in, their communities for generations and that they have become more and more isolated as the generations have passed?  Would the Taoiseach accept that this is one of the major challenges facing society?  In the past 50 years, free education has delivered enormously for society.  The next major challenge is around how to bring people who are at the periphery of society, and those who are most disadvantaged, back into society.  It is through education that it will happen but there is no sense of a coherent strategy at Government level in the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills to see if we can tackle the social isolation felt and experienced by young people and older people from various strands of society.  Perhaps I will come back to that in a subsequent question.</p></speech>

We all know about the public housing crisis, and we are aware of the dire situation in our public health service, but one crisis that is less remarked on but which is very severe is the crisis in third level education.  That crisis was not in any way addressed or acknowledged in the Government's recent budget.  The Taoiseach may have noted that the Irish Universities Association released a statement recently expressing significant regret at the failure of the Government to address the funding crisis for third level education.  The Union of Students in Ireland and other student union bodies have also expressed huge disappointment at the Taoiseach's failure to address the funding crisis for third level education and for student poverty.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that we have a crisis and that Ireland is at the bottom of the league table in Europe for funding per student?  The Irish Universities Association has helpfully included a graph with its statement, which compares Ireland with other European countries.  It shows the State investment per student in the following countries: Finland &euro;20,000 per student; Germany &euro;10,000 per student; The Netherlands &euro;14,000 per student; Norway &euro;16,000 per student; Sweden &euro;19,000 per student; and Ireland &euro;5,000 per student.  Ireland's &euro;5,000 funding per student is a tiny fraction of what is invested in third level education cross Europe.  This per student investment is going to further decline, because according to the Minister's budget speech we are expecting another 18,000 people to enter further education and university over the next number of years.  The budget, however, gave the sector a 1% increase in funding.  It was &euro;19 million extra, which is nothing.  It is a drop in the ocean that will be mopped up many times over by the increased student numbers.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that there is a problem here?  Has the Taoiseach any intention of doing something about this funding crisis in third level education?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach spoke earlier about public services.  Reference was also made to how woefully inadequate they are, but inadequate as they are, people cannot access the service if they do not have a school building to go to.  Students in schools in my constituency, and in the Taoiseach's constituency, and their parents are worried and, naturally, very anxious.  Significant structural issues have been found.  They relate to fire safety concerns, especially in Ardgillan community college.  I understand that the part of the school that was built by Western Building Systems is now closed and the students are not in school this week.  The students are off school next week for mid-term but the school wants to know if there are any plans for those students.  Where will they go and where will they be accommodated?  There is already serious pressure on school accommodation in north County Dublin.</p></speech>

I am not sure that I fully understood the question.  If the Deputy wants to come back with a supplementary question I would be happy to try to answer it again, once I understand the question.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments, I acknowledge the shortcomings, challenges and failures that exist in our public services in Ireland.  On listening to Deputy Barrett again and again, one would think that we lived in the worst country in the world and that Ireland was some sort of wasteland, and that it was an awful place to live and be a citizen.  Yet, this is a country that the UN human development index ranks fourth in the world.  That is not a measure of GDP.  It is not a measure of the size of our economy.  This index takes into account health, education, life expectancy and the quality of our public services.  The UN human development index ranks Ireland as fourth in the world, which is up from tenth or eleventh place not that long ago.  If a small UN committee made a criticism of Ireland, Deputy Boyd Barrett would be the first on his feet to tell us how awful we are, but when the UN Development Programme, with its well respected human development index, ranks us fourth in the world, the Deputy does not want to acknowledge that.  Ireland is rising, for example, when it comes to the social progress index, and it has been for a number of years.  The Deputy does not want to acknowledge that.  When we consider the Central Statistics Office statistics, the survey of income and living conditions shows that poverty and deprivation is falling in Ireland, that income inequality is narrowing, and that inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient is narrowing.  Again, the Deputy does not want to acknowledge any of that.  The Deputy also does not want to acknowledge the fact that employment levels in Ireland are at their highest.  It seems to me that there is very much a double standard here.  The Deputy wants to come in, use every example of anything that is wrong in the country but he never acknowledges the progress that we are making in the country, and he never acknowledges the fact that when taken in the round Ireland is a good country, it is a good place to live and we offer our citizens a lot of opportunities.  Yes, we can do better, but if one wants to do better one starts by acknowledging what is going well and then try to fix the things that are wrong.  One does not just rubbish everything and everyone and everything they do.  That is a defeatist and nihilistic attitude and it will not bring about any positive change for any citizens in our country.</p></speech>

This is funded by an increase of 0.1% in employers' PRSI.</p><p>That comes on top of a similar increase last year.  We have also identified a super surplus of approximately &euro;300 million in the national training fund.  That money will also be available to our higher education institutions.  Project Ireland 2040 includes a pretty major investment in our higher education institutions including our universities and institutes of technology.  One only has to travel around the country and visit our colleges and institutes of technology to see how many new buildings have been built in recent years and we are going to see a lot more.  The year 2019 will be the third year in a row in which we see a significant increase in funding for our third level institutions.</p> <p> We always have to bear in mind that it is not just about a simple calculation of how much money is spent.  If we divide the total amount of money we spent on health in Ireland by the number of patients we are one of the highest spending countries in the world, but spending does not necessarily result in outcomes.  The same thing applies in education.  It is a very simplistic and facile analysis to just take the budget and divide it by the number of students or the number of patients.</p></speech>

If it was just about spending more money our problems would be very easy to solve.  Of course it is about much more than that.</p>  <p>  Picking up on Deputy O'Reilly's question on the schools, of course what is paramount for us is the safety of students and staff.  It is going to be necessary to inspect approximately 40 schools that were built by this particular company.  We anticipate that work will be done this week, over the Hallowe'en break.  We anticipate it being completed by the middle of November.  In some cases works are going to be needed.  Those works will be done.  In some cases it may be necessary to partially or entirely vacate some schools, in others it may be possible to introduce temporary measures and to do the works over the summer.  We will pursue the builder in the courts.  In fact, that is already under way in respect of some of the fire safety issues.  It certainly appears that corners were cut back in the Celtic tiger period when it came to the building of some of these schools.  That is truly disgraceful.  We are in a very different position now.  For the last couple of years a clerk of works was present on site every day when a school was being built in order to make sure that it was built up to standard.  It certainly appears that prior to 2014 or 2015, and particularly during the Celtic tiger period, schools were built without proper oversight.  We now have to go back, make sure they are safe, fix them, and pursue the people responsible.</p></speech>

One relates to social policy.  The Taoiseach speaks about everything that is right in this country.  I preface my remarks by saying that one of the greatest social changes was free second level education.  It has now empowered almost three generations of people.  It has certainly worked enormously well but I believe that as many as 18%, or at least 10% to 15%, of people in our society are severely disadvantaged in where they are living because of family backgrounds and so forth.  They suffer from social problems, drug addiction and everything else.  They are living all over the country; they are dispersed and are not only located in the large urban centres.  The major challenge as we go forward as a society will be developing a coherent social policy that will empower these people.  People 50 years ago used the education services to improve their lot.  These people are not engaging with the education services, with the health services or with society as a whole in terms of community activity or anything else.  The major social policy question is what is the Government's thinking?  Has it come up with any special Cabinet committees to look at what social policies should be developed?  It is not an easy question but it is a challenge for society as we go forward.</p></speech>

This analysis was provided by the Irish Universities Association.  Its authors are academics so I think the Taoiseach should take them a bit more seriously rather than just trying to score political points.  The analysis points out that we are spending a small fraction of what most other European countries are spending per student.  The Taoiseach's comparison with health is facile because it fails to acknowledge that quite a considerable amount of that expenditure is out of pocket expenditure by people paying accident and emergency charges, overnight bed charges, and prescription charges.  That is all included in the expenditure as is, for that matter, private health insurance.  Public funding of health is a very different matter but we are talking about universities.  The point is we are way down the league table and our universities are now tumbling in the international rankings.  The Irish Universities Association, to say nothing of the students' unions, says that there is a very serious problem.  I would have thought that the Taoiseach should acknowledge that as an issue and seek to respond to it in a sensible way.</p></speech>

Are there plans to initiate legal proceedings in respect of the remainder?  With regard to the contingency arrangements, reference was made earlier to the question of spin versus substance.  There will have to be a roll-out of information for the parents concerned.  There is probably no need to hire an orchestra or someone to make a video about it, but it would be an idea if parents could get timely information.  My understanding is that staff in Ardgillan community college moved very quickly to inform parents but they still do not know what the plans are for the next number of weeks.  There will have to be some sort of information roll-out.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might comment on that.</p></speech>

That number includes Ardgillan community college.  We will have to see how this issue develops with regard to structural problems in the schools but if the company has not built these schools up to standard it is absolutely the intention of Government and the Department of Education and Skills to pursue that company for damages in the courts.  I agree with the Deputy in respect of information.  It is very important that parents are afforded with information and that we give them information as soon as we possibly can.  The priority is, of course, the safety of students and staff.  The second priority is to carry out the inspections of the 40 schools and to get that done as soon as we possibly can in order to find out what kind of works need to be done, to get them done, and to pursue the builder for the costs through the courts.</p>  <p>  In terms of Deputy Boyd Barrett's further contribution, I did not think there was a further question but I did answer his original question in my previous contribution when I said that funding for higher education is being increased.  It was increased last year and it will be increased next year as well.  It is important we make sure that the money is spent as well as possible.  We should judge ourselves on outcomes, not on how much we spend.  That applies across all areas of the public service.</p>  <p>  On social policy, I think I understand the question but I do not have the answer.  If the Deputy has specific examples-----</p></speech>

When was the overrun signalled to the Minister?  Was it signalled in late 2017 or early 2018?  If so, what steps did the Minister take to try to avoid this significant overrun?

A number of areas within the HSE are contributing to the overspend in 2018.  These include higher payouts under the State Claims Agency, a shortfall in private patient income, a higher level of spend in the acute and disability services sectors and, for example, the additional costs associated with Storm Emma, which amounted to about &euro;40 million.  The overspend in services is driven by the non-achievement of planned savings, higher levels and higher complexity of demand, costs associated with meeting national regulatory standards in the disability sector and the need for additional emergency placements for children and young people with disabilities.  Finally and importantly, an amount of &euro;280 million was provided in the 2018 Revised Estimates for appropriations-in-aid receipts from the UK in respect of healthcare provided under EU regulations.  These receipts are now estimated at &euro;225 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;55 million against the provision.</p><p>The HSE advises that the savings projected to be achieved by year end under the value improvement programme will be in the region of &euro;80 million.  The introduction of a savings programme into the HSE's 2018 national service plan reflects the commitment we must have in the health service to achieve greater value and efficiency across the totality of resources at its disposal.  With major increases in public funding for our health services in recent years to a level which compares favourably with spending in other countries, it is important that the scope to develop services through the improved management of existing resources also receives ongoing attention.</p><p>In presenting its 2018 national service plan in late 2017, the HSE conveyed its view of what it saw as the significant financial challenge of implementing the plan within the allocated budget for 2018.  This was not a secret; it was published on pages 2 and 3 of the national service plan.  In response, I confirmed to the HSE that the plan was to be framed having regard to the funding available.  The health sector was but one of several priority areas competing for additional funding in 2018 from the fiscal space available to the Government.  I pointed out that over &euro;600 million in additional funding was provided for the health sector in the 2018 budget and that the HSE&rsquo;s allocation had increased by approximately 20% since 2015, or by an average of 6.6% per annum, which is ahead of both the programme for Government and the confidence and supply agreement level of increase.  Taking the significant 2018 and prior year allocations into account, it is clear that issues of budgetary performance need to be addressed in certain areas and that the HSE should discharge its accountability in this regard under the performance and accountability framework. </p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>As part of the monthly performance cycle, my Department holds the HSE to account for its expenditure and for the delivery of the services set out in the national service plan.  Performance in respect of service delivery and finance is monitored monthly and, where services are experiencing significant performance issues, the HSE is required to submit an escalation report.  Finally, the Government is committed to a significant programme of legislative and managerial reform to improve performance and accountability in the HSE.  This includes the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018, which is currently before the Oireachtas.  This legislation will establish an independent board governance structure for the HSE, and as one of its functions will support the chief executive officer and HSE executive team in developing a more effective performance management and accountability system.</p></speech>

I will read back on exactly what the Minister has said but my understanding of what he said is he heard what the HSE said and told it to go back and come up with a service plan that was within budget.  I assume that is what the Minister did.  The Minister got the budget he got, which the D&aacute;il voted on.  The HSE came back to the Minister late last year and said it was not enough money for the service plan so the Minister had to do one of two things.  He had to either increase the budget or reduce the service plan.  Did the Minister instruct the HSE to reduce the service plan to make sure the HSE could deliver on budget?  Presumably he did.  If he did that, what has happened to lead to a nearly &euro;800 million overrun?  Saying things like Storm Emma and unforeseen events is not an acceptable rationale.  If one is running a &euro;16 billion or &euro;17 billion healthcare system, storms and flu epidemics happen and one plans for the unforeseen and makes sure there are contingency budgets in place.  Did the Minister ask the HSE to reduce its service plan to a level that should have allowed it and the Minister to deliver according to budget?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300024#W00800"><p>The HSE did not just tell me, it told us all in the HSE service plan, as it does most years, the challenges and risks that exist in an organisation like the HSE.  This is not the first year the HSE has needed a supplementary budget.  If one looks back to 2006, we had a long-stay charges repayment scheme of &euro;1 billion.  We had shortfalls of &euro;240 million and overrun of demand led schemes in 2007, &euro;345 million in 2008, &euro;595 million in 2010 and &euro;680 million in 2014.  I am not saying it is a good thing but we all know we need to reform our health service in order that it can deliver value for money and improve services, which is why we have all signed up to the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The law is very clear.  The HSE has a legal obligation under the Health Act to present a service plan that it signs up to delivering.  It can highlight risks and challenges and it did highlight those risks and challenges.  Ultimately when it submits a service plan to the Minister of the day, it is committing to deliver the services contained within the service plan.  It is its legal responsibility.  We need to improve the oversight and governance structures.  That is why I have appointed Sir Ciar&aacute;n Devane as the new chair designate of the HSE board.  That is why I want to put a competency-based board in place as well.  The Deputy may talk about Storm Emma or the State Claims Agency costs and say they do not explain it but they explain a fair bit of it.  Let us just take the State Claims Agency as an example.  We cannot predict the level of claims being paid out every year.  It as clear there was an overrun in that area.  It is clear Storm Emma cost &euro;40 million.  It was also clear, let us be honest, that when it came to our acute hospitals and disability sector there was a significant overspend.  When the Deputy asks what I told the HSE to do, I certainly did not tell it to reduce those services because when one is the Minister for Health, one does not have the luxury of telling sick people they are to go home and come back the next year.  We have to manage.  That is the situation that I and all my predecessors have found themselves in.</p></speech>

He can come back to the D&aacute;il and tell us he needs an extra &euro;600 million, &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million, whatever the HSE tells the Minister.  The other choice is to go back to the HSE and say he is sorry but this is the amount of money D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has voted him and they will have to figure out how to bring this in on budget.  No one is suggesting that sick people are sent away.  The Minister knows that is not being suggested.  Anyone managing a budget anywhere in the world says what they will deliver and what amount of money they have.  The third thing, which is what actually happened, if I understand the Minister, is he did not tell the HSE to adjust the service plan according to the budget therefore its warning that it did not have enough money held and we ended up where we are now with a nearly &euro;800 million overrun.  Was anything done throughout the year?  Did the Minister instruct the HSE to adjust the service plan or capital expenditure plan or whatever it was to bring it in on budget?</p></speech>

The HSE did not say it could not deliver the service plan.  The HSE produced a service plan.  It was launched by the then director general and me.  It was discussed at the Oireachtas health committee.  I am pretty sure it was debated on the floor of the House.  It produced it in the knowledge of the resources it had available to it.  It did spell out, in correspondence to me, which has been long since published and on page 2 and 3 of the service plan, the risks and the challenges it saw.  If one looks back through all service plans, the risks and challenges are always highlighted.  Nobody in the HSE said, nor legally could anyone have said, it was producing a service plan it did not believe it had adequate resources to deliver.  It has an obligation to produce a service plan it can deliver within the resources.  However, having said that it is also clear that when one looks at the HSE's budgetary performance since its establishment, it has almost always required a supplementary budget.  The question for all of us in the House and for me as Minister is how we endeavour to move to a better place in that regard.  The governance piece we are putting in place is a part of it but I also think reforming the model of healthcare is a part.  The Deputy and I have somewhat of a luxury of looking at the available resources from a health prism.  The Deputy's party and the Government sat down in budgetary talks last year and had to decide how much money we could give to health and we had to do our very best within that envelope.  I did not see anybody agitating for any more than was given on budget day.</p></speech>

Challenges exist in recruitment and retention of these professions, which is not news to the Deputy, as she knows and shares my view.  We operate against a backdrop of a global shortage of nurses and midwives.  Despite these challenges, however, the data show that we have managed to increase the number of nurses and midwives employed, which should not be ignored in this debate.</p>  <p>  When the number of nurses and midwives employed by the HSE is compared between September 2017 and September 2018, it shows there has been an increase of 1,050 whole-time equivalents, including student nurses.  Without student nurses, the increase is 1,039 whole-time equivalents.  The Deputy refers to a statement made by the HSE in its annual report for 2017 which in many ways confirms what we already know - that we are operating within a competitive recruitment market when it comes to filling positions involving health professionals, not least nurses and midwives.</p>  <p>  The recent pay proposals put forward were a positive step towards making the public health service a more attractive place to work for nurses and midwives.  The PSPC recommended an increase of 20% to the specialist qualification and location allowances for nurses.  The allowances are also to be extended to maternity services.  In addition, the commission recommended the eligibility requirements for a senior staff nurse or midwife be reduced from 20 years to 17 years.</p>  <p>The Government also proposed to address the issue of new entrant pay, not just for nurses but across the public service, which will benefit approximately 10,000 nurses to the value of approximately &euro;3,000 each.</p>  <p>  I am sorry the INMO rejected these proposals but I respect the outcome of its ballot.  On foot of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, Government is making considerable resources available to increase public service pay, including in respect of nurses.  This is on the basis that this agreement is honoured by all the parties involved.  I understand the INMO will consider its next steps when its executive meets on 5 November but I would like to see all parties, including my Department, come together during the intervening period to see if there is a way forward.  Industrial action is not something which any side wants to see.  Patients do not wish to see it, and I know nurses do not wish to see it either.  I hope that engagement will take place between nurses and their employer in advance of 5 November.</p></speech>

If the Minister does not acknowledge and address the issue of pay, he will leave nurses and midwives with no choice.  The Minister has said, and we all know, the last thing nurses wish to do is contemplate industrial action, but that involves them being given another option.  He described the recent pay proposals from the PSPC as a "positive step".  Some 94% of those balloted in the INMO have rejected it and, therefore, it is not viewed by them as a positive step.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister acknowledge that pay is a factor?  I do not mean allowances or any specific element of pay but rather actual pay, that is, what the Minister or I would call pay, which one might have in one's pocket after payday and not any one specific bit thereof that might apply to one person but not to his or her colleagues.  Will he acknowledge that pay is central and will he take any steps to address it?</p></speech>

I understand the INMO is a member of ICTU and I understand all parties to the PSSA have signed up and have agreed there would be no cost-increasing claims for improvement in pay for the duration of the agreement.  That is what the agreement which was signed up to by the unions says, namely, that there will be no increase in pay above and beyond what is spelled out in the agreement.</p>  <p>  This is a new agreement and if we start unpicking it at such an early stage it does not say much for honouring agreements that have just been agreed.  We asked the PSPC to do a body of work on an expert basis, to come together, analyse data, hear from all sides, receive submissions and make recommendations.  It made recommendations which would have put more money in the pockets of many of our nurses and midwives and, on top of that, it recommended pay rises for new entrants, which is an issue which needs to be addressed.  I respect the INMO ballot; it has made its decision in that regard.  I would like there to be engagement with it in advance of 5 November to see if a way forward can be found which respects the PSSA.</p></speech>

The point is that the parties reserve the right to go back to the table and renegotiate if the circumstances change.  When I was "back in my twos", as my dad would say, when circumstances changed we were quickly dragged back to the table in order that there would be negotiations on the subject of pay cuts.</p>  <p>  Circumstances have now changed and we face a recruitment and retention crisis.  All of our talk about Sl&aacute;intecare, reform and everything else will come to nothing unless we have the staff to deliver.  Nurses and midwives are the single biggest cohort in our health service.  Other trade unions aside from the INMO now call for a renegotiation of that agreement, just as Fianna F&aacute;il did when it felt the circumstances were right for another agreement.  There is scope, therefore, to renegotiate, and I would like to hear something more positive from the Minister about nurses' and midwives' pay.  We passed a resolution here where we all agreed pay had to be central, not for a small group, a section or a single cohort but for all nurses and midwives.</p></speech>

I must respect an agreement that the vast majority of public servants have signed up to, namely, the PSSA, to which ICTU has signed up, which is only a new agreement but which sees many benefits for people across the public service.</p>  <p>  I accept there are recruitment and retention challenges, especially the latter in the case of people working in the health service.  There are a number of measures in place to try to assist with this in the PSPC.  I had hoped they would be accepted in order that we could have further engagement along the lines the PSPC references already in its reports.  The Deputy is right when she says we need more nurses working in our health services.  They are key to the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare and I hope a resolution can be found.  It will require engagement, however, that takes place in the context of respecting the PSSA.</p></speech>

Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million for the development of mental health services, and I acknowledge Deputy Browne's commitment to this area also.  The additional funding allocated to mental health services since 2012 has provided for the recruitment of more than 1,500 posts in mental health since 2012.  In the last year alone, the number of psychiatrists increased by 14.</p>  <p>There are 340 consultant psychiatrists in the mental health services and 83 vacancies.  The HSE uses locums, short-term contracts and other arrangements to fill many of these posts to support service delivery.  In addition, we have developed our capacity in primary care through the funding of 114 assistant psychologists, a new grade whose positive impact I have seen first hand, 20 psychologists and ten advanced nurse practitioners.  This will help to manage the demand and improve access to psychiatry services.</p>  <p>  A focus of funding for 2019 will be on early intervention and support services that will assist as many service users as possible in dealing with mental health challenges before they require acute or psychiatric care.  The Government remains committed to increasing the consultant workforce and there is a significant need for psychiatrists.  It is generally acknowledged, however, that there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining certain grades of staff, particularly specialist child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, staff and consultant psychiatrists.  This is an issue not just in Ireland but internationally.</p>  <p>  The HSE undertakes continuing recruitment of consultant psychiatrists.  Campaigns have targeted international events involving prospective candidates.  In its report published on 4 September, the PSPC identified difficulties in attracting consultant applications for many posts and acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published proposals regarding mitigation of the extended salary scales for new entrants across the public service under section 4 of the PSSA.  Two separate interventions will take place at the fourth and eighth points of pay scales, involving the bypassing of two scale points.  This measure will apply from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to eligible new entrants as they reach the relevant scale points on their current increment date.  Those between the fourth and eighth points will also benefit from the first intervention on the date of their next normal increment.</p></speech>

The PSPC found there were problems, in particular, with recruitment in psychiatry, where there were 458 established posts but only 364 of them had been filled, which is approximately 79%.</p><p>However, this level is based on established posts, not on the number that should be in place under A Vision for Change, and the actual number is probably much lower than that.  In June 2018, 25 unqualified non-specialist doctors, who were not on the specialist register, were acting as psychiatric consultants, a practice that the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, described as "scandalous", and reported the matter to HIQA, the Attorney General and others.  It did not receive the coverage it deserved at the time due to other serious health issues in the news.  It is clear that there is a serious shortage of psychiatrists, however, when the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland sought to increase the number of trainee places by 10%.  This was refused and an increase of only 5% was granted.  The Government says that it cannot recruit psychiatrists but, at the same time, will not train them in sufficient numbers.  What will the Minister do about this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300026#Y00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his point acknowledging that recruiting psychiatrists is a challenge but also highlighting the increase in numbers while vacancies remain.  Given its analysis, the Public Service Pay Commission proposed that the parties to the public service stability agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken to address the pay differential between pre-existing and new entrant consultants, which has increased following the settlement of the 2008 consultant contract claim.</p>  <p>  The Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health have noted the commission's views and consideration will be given to solutions that are line with public sector pay policy and available budgets.  </p>  <p>  We will now prepare the HSE service plan for 2019.  A significant budget is in place for the delivery of mental health services, which will exceed &euro;1 billion, and an additional &euro;55 million will be available for the development of mental health services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, also remains eager to identify other ways of supporting mental health services.  An example of this was the assistant psychology posts this year, with 111 of 114 filled successfully nationally.  I accept there is much more to do but we will look to see how to further progress it in the context of the HSE service plan.</p></speech>

They were taken out of the hospitals and put in the community, and rightly so, under A Vision for Change, but the buildings are not fit for purpose.  I have been in many of them and they are often decrepit or lack proper facilities.  The psychiatrists tell me that they are spending a great deal of time in these buildings that are not fit for purpose but also performing roles that are not part of their remit such as finding hospital beds, making phone calls, opening letters and so on.  That is a waste of time that they should spend with clients.  Will the Minister examine the conditions in which many of our mental health services are provided?  They are not fit for the psychiatrists, the psychiatric nurses or other allied health professionals or for the patients who have to attend those facilities.</p></speech>

In addition to the psychology posts and the benefits they bring to the service, we are also committed to increasing the number of psychiatric nurse undergraduate places by 130 annually by 2021-22.  That will increase from 270 undergraduate posts to 400 a year.</p>  <p>  On an improved seven day a week services, which returns to the Deputy's point about the level of service we are providing, the HSE is in the final stages of recruiting the staff required to deliver seven day a week mental health service cover for the areas that do not currently have a service in place.  It is also expected to be delivered in early 2019.  </p>  <p>  I will take the Deputy's points on board as we prepare for the HSE service plan 2019.</p></speech>

The development of a sustainable scoliosis service has been prioritised by my Department and the HSE in 2018.  An additional &euro;9 million was provided to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, CHG, in 2018 to support the development and implementation of a sustainable and safe paediatric orthopaedic service for children and young people. </p>  <p>  The increased investment in scoliosis has brought stability to the service and the current capacity for services has expanded.  The CHG advises that 446 procedures will be delivered this year, compared to 371 in 2017, and 224 in 2016.  This represents a doubling of activity since 2016.  I acknowledge that it is not her word, but when the Deputy refers to manipulation, we should be clear that the number of procedures being done each year is increasing and will have doubled since 2016.  </p>  <p>  Waiting list figures for 12 October show 130 patients waiting, which includes patients who have been asked to come in for a procedure, those who have been given a date for a procedure in the near future - often one needs a date that works for the patient both clinically and logistically - and those who are waiting for a date for a procedure.  This represents a significant reduction of 61 or 32% in comparison to the same week last year when the list stood at 191 patients.</p>  <p>  The CHG advises that a number of families were offered the opportunity to have their child's surgery abroad this year but did not avail of the offer.  I can fully understand why this might be the case.  This year, one patient has had surgery abroad having deferred the procedure from 2017. </p>  <p>  The CHG advises that as of 12 October there were 42 patients on the suspended list for spinal surgery across the hospital group.</p>  <p>  The placement of patients on the suspended list for surgery is a clinical decision and is made by the treating clinician in consultation with other medical professionals, the patient and their family.  Patients are placed on the suspended list for clinical reasons such as being clinically unwell and unfit for surgery, requiring further investigations and procedures prior to their scoliosis treatment, or their condition being managed conservatively and not requiring surgical intervention at this time. </p>  <p>  Families may also request a suspension for non-clinical reasons, which is also understandable.</p></reply>

The Minister gave the target for this year.  To hit that, 100 further surgeries must be performed between now and the end of the year, including the Christmas period.  Is the Minister confident that these will take place?  To be straight with him, I would not</p>  <p>  I refer to the number of surgeries abroad that are offered and not taken.  I have spoken to many parents who are involved in this and their advocates.  They say that it is not a significant number and the factor which influences this is the availability of follow-up care here.  Even where it has been offered, parents cannot avail of it without the follow-up care here which is not always available.  What is the precise number?  Is he confident that 100 surgeries will be performed, based on the figures to date?</p></speech>

I want to re-emphasise that the CHG advises that clinical criteria for determining a care plan for scoliosis-related surgeries and other spinal procedures is complex, which we appreciate, and is based on established clinical guidelines and best practice, both nationally and internationally.  These are decisions being made by good surgeons who are operating in our health service.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the hospital Group will meet the target for procedures.  They did 224 in 2016.  The Deputy may have asked me the same question last year, when they reached 371, and now they will build on that again to reach 446.  Not only has there been additional recruitment of consultants but Cappagh hospital is also doing more work.  It is envisaged that the hospital will complete 50 paediatric spinal surgeries in 2018, against a target of 39 for this year.  That is a good example of increasing capacity for scoliosis surgeries in Ireland, which we need to do.  This year the CHG aims to deliver 446 procedures, which represents an increase in activity of 99.5% on 2016.  We have a lot more to do but we are making progress.</p></speech>

Their condition can deteriorate to the point where surgery may not be viable.  This morning, I spoke to a parent who asked what will happen to children who are left with permanent impairment as a result of delays.</p><p>Whether we accept the extent to which they are being dealt with effectively, we all acknowledge that there are delays.  Will the Minister apologise to those children and consider offering them some form of compensation?  Some of them will live with this damage for the rest of their lives.  They are still young. </p> <p> I want to draw attention again to the fact that the theatre in Crumlin hospital is still only open three days a week.  If it was open five days a week, that would be a statement of intent that we are serious about sorting out the problem.  </p></speech>

The reconfiguration of the existing orthopaedic post in Crumlin hospital is being worked through the consultant appointment approval committee.  Funding for an additional two new consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics has been provided this year.  Those posts are currently being processed and we expect that appointments will be made by the end of this year.  These posts are allocated to Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals for paediatric orthopaedics in order that existing consultants can focus on spinal surgery services.  The Mater Hospital has also been successful in the recruiting consultants ahead of profile.</p>  <p>  We are making a lot of progress on this.  I accept that children can often be clinically suitable for surgery one week, but because of the complexity of things can find themselves, on the basis of clinical advice, not being able to have surgery a week or two later, which causes significant difficulties and stress for families.  For that reason, the scoliosis co-design team is working with three advocacy groups, the consultants and Mr. Brian O'Mahony as the independent chair, to come up with a pathway of care.  It is the appropriate thing to do.  I am confident that much good progress has been made in this area, but I am also confident that the solution will involve a sustainable service that will mean we do not have to rely on outsourcing.  We should not just seek to fix the problem this year but ensure we are able to look after our children in this country.  We are seeing a lot of progress in this area.</p></speech>

She was one of the 21 Alpha-1 patients on the clinical trial for Respreeza.  In August 2017, the HSE said that it would not provide reimbursements for this drug.  There was then a stand-off for a number of months when two patients, including Marion, passed away having been off the drug for six weeks.  There have been many discussions and a number of meetings.  The Minister has met the family on two occasions at my request, to be fair to him.  However, everything is at a stand-still.  What is the status of the negotiations with the drug company regarding this important trial?  The 19 patients still on the trial, and others who need the drug, need to know.</p></reply>

I have seen first hand, through his work, their dedication to making sure that this issue is resolved for the 19 families.  I share that determination.  The HSE assessed the application for the pricing and reimbursement of Respreeza and in August 2017, the manufacturer, CSL Behring, was notified that the HSE did not recommend reimbursement.  </p>  <p>  A number of patients were on an access scheme for this product, operated by the manufacturer.  That scheme was being run independently by the manufacturer without reference to the HSE.  The company notified the HSE that it had decided to terminate the access scheme from 30 September 2017.  The Deputy knows my views on this; I believe it was a very unethical and inappropriate thing to do.  Clinical trials involve a duty of care for people, but we have been over that ground previously.  </p>  <p>  Following interventions by the HSE, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme.  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE agreed to fund the provision of the necessary nursing service, which does not usually happen, to ensure patients could continue to receive the medicine</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to liaise with the treating consultant and the company and has now drafted the terms of an agreement for the long-term care of the 19 Alpha-1 clinical trial patients.  This proposal is being reviewed by the company and I am informed that a final agreement should be reached shortly.  I view this group of 19 patients as separate and distinct.  We have a duty of care to these patients because they were on this medication for so long.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of the provision of Respreeza to other patients, it is open to the company to submit a new reimbursement application to be assessed.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no statutory role in that regard.  I understand that a new application has not been submitted.  </p>  <p>  There are two distinct issues.  The first concerns how we look after and care for the 19 patients involved in the trial.  I am happy that good progress has been made there.  I am informed that a final agreement should be reached shortly and the terms of that agreement have now been drafted, and I am happy to keep in direct contact with the Deputy on that.  The second relates to the broader cohort of patients.  The company can submit another application on that if it wishes.  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have been at this juncture for a long time, and it is frustrating.  The Minister met the family in April.  We had a commitment from the HSE that there was going to be an agreement on the 19 patients quickly.  Meetings were supposed to take place quickly but they did not happen.  A meeting took place in June, and there was a follow-up meeting to that.  There is frustration that this process has been going on for a year, and we have had no guarantee that these 19 patients will continue on the drug and that it will be administered in the correct way.  We need the guarantee.  We cannot allow these 19 patients, and those who need this drug, to continue to live in limbo.  It is not acceptable.  To be frank, the family of Marion Kelly are exhausted; phone calls and emails are not being answered anymore</p></speech>

He has separated the two issues.  The broader reimbursement issue for patients beyond the 19 on the trial is a matter of, in the first instance, the company submitting an application.  I am open to correction, but the information available to me from the HSE is that that has not yet happened.  If such an application is received, it will be assessed in accordance with the laws passed in these Houses.  The case of those 19 patients on the trial is a distinct issue.  I am in full agreement with the Deputy in that regard.  I do not believe that people can be on a clinical trial for such a long time with the company then deciding one day to no longer provide the drug.  Those people are left in an unenviable and difficult position.  I am pleased that progress is being made and that the draft terms of agreement are now in place and with the company for review.  As a result of this question, I will check with the HSE on the timeline for the conclusion of the terms of agreement.</p></speech>

She died on 1 December, and she was in my office not long before she passed away.  This is important for those who are fighting on behalf of the remaining 19 patients.  I also acknowledge the work of Deputy Brassil on this matter.  He tabled a parliamentary question to which the Minister gave a disappointing response, which is why I am speaking about this matter today.  I have also discussed the matter with the Kelly family, which has contacted me on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  This must be concluded before the first anniversary of Marion Kelly's death.  Has the drug been paid for to date?  Have all the administration costs been met?  Will the Minister ensure the HSE communicates directly with the Alpha-1 group and with the Kelly family on the current status of the negotiations?  I am losing confidence that the people dealing with this from the HSE are prioritising it to the level required.</p></speech>

On the question of the administration costs, I have no information other than what I have in front of me.  The HSE agreed that because of the unique and exceptional circumstances these 19 patients find themselves in, it would fund the provision of the necessary nursing services to ensure patients could continue to receive the medicine.  I will certainly check that that has been met because it was the commitment given.  It will be honoured.  I will also ask that the HSE arranges to meet with the Alpha-1 group and the family of Marion Kelly to update them directly about where this matter stands.  I hope that both the company and the HSE can resolve this quickly.  I accept that it has been going on for quite a long time.  I extend my sympathies and thoughts to the family of Marion Kelly.</p></speech>

Six beds closed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in August, meaning, scandalously, that 12 beds have closed in that hospital.  The other six have been closed since the end of 2017 due to staff and other resource shortages.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>In August, however, six paediatric inpatient beds were shut as a result of the inability of the consultant who works out of Crumlin hospital to provide paediatric cover because they apparently went on unplanned leave.</p></reply>

Services include a paediatric programme which is delivered by a paediatric team based on the campus with clinical oversight provided by a consultant paediatrician who is based off-campus at another hospital.  Up until recently, this consultant paediatric oversight was provided by a consultant paediatrician at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, whose contract includes a seven-hour clinical attachment to the NRH.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the consultant paediatrician in question recently went on unplanned long-term leave and, arising from this unforeseen development, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital is not currently in a position to provide consultant oversight to the NRH&rsquo;s paediatric programme.  In light of this, the NRH has reluctantly closed its inpatient paediatric service on the basis that it is not possible to appropriately assess and triage new paediatric referrals and medically manage paediatric patients without consultant paediatric input.  The suspension of this service is impacting on existing inpatients, those on the waiting list for admission, and those who are newly referred to the services and are awaiting assessment by a consultant.</p>  <p>  The Children&rsquo;s hospital group has confirmed that officials are actively working to identify another consultant paediatrician with an interest in disability to fill the vacancy to provide appropriate clinical paediatric oversight to the services provided at the NRH.  In the interim, the paediatric team at the NRH continues to offer outpatient and outreach services to children.  The NRH and HSE will continue to work closely to seek a solution to this matter.</p></reply>

The human consequences of not having these beds open are severe.  Today, I spoke to Deputy Gino Kenny's constituent who contacted us about this issue.  The individual&rsquo;s daughter had a brain tumour and surgery in Temple Street hospital in April.  She has been left with serious weakness on her left side and needs serious rehabilitation.  However, she is now unable to go to the NRH for treatment because of the closed beds.  Early intervention in serious situations such as this is important.  This is the human consequence of this.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State explain why we cannot recruit a consultant to provide the cover which will allow these beds to be reopened, given the suffering endured by people who really need it?  We need an explanation.</p></speech>

The reality is that we have an issue with consultant numbers.  Earlier, we had a discussion about the problem with the shortage of doctors.  That is a problem with which we are trying to deal.  We have seen an improvement in recent months with the return of many people from abroad.  I have seen this with speech and language and occupational therapy services.  We still have an issue with staffing.  We need more consultants.</p>  <p>  The NRH remains committed to resuming its inpatient services as soon as the resolution to the current issues around the consultant paediatrician cover is found.  The NRH and the HSE will continue to work closely to seek a solution to this matter.  The Government recognises the excellent programme which the NRH delivers and its excellent patient outcomes.  We have to deal with the issue of staffing on which we are strongly focused.</p></speech>

However, 12 beds were closed at the end of 2017.  The hospital managed to get funding to get six of them reopened but then another six were closed because it could not get the paediatric consultant cover.  If it is related, as discussed earlier, to the sort of apartheid new-entrant levels of pay for consultants as a result of austerity cuts, then it has to be addressed.  This situation cannot go on with the girl I just mentioned who needs this rehab urgently, as well as the many others who need rehab.  It is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  We need to sort this out.  We need to provide necessary resources to recruit the consultants to do this vital work.</p></speech>

We have to strongly focus on this issue.</p>  <p>  The hospital has made a submission to HSE&rsquo;s National Hospitals Office on the reopening of the six closed beds.  The office supported the NRH submission within the context of the Estimates process for 2019.  The HSE&rsquo;s operational service improvement division has also sought to reopen the six beds for the winter planning process for 2018 and 2019.  However, such considerations will only be concluded by October and November this year.  If successful, the beds will be reopened after this date.</p>  <p>  However, the HSE continues to liaise closely with the hospital on the bed capacity issue.  I will strongly focus on this because I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s arguments on the need for services for children with disabilities.</p></speech>

These are based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to diagnosis, management and public awareness of Lyme disease.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s Lyme disease sub-committee has been delayed to ensure the evidence presented in the institute's guidelines can be factored into its final report.  It is appropriate we should learn from best international practice and experience.</p>  <p>  The report should be finalised in November, at which point it will be sent for consideration to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s scientific advisory committee.  At this juncture, it would be inappropriate to consider making changes to the testing, treatment and management of the condition until this deliberative process has been completed.  I know people have been campaigning for recognition of the disease in this country.  I hope when the report is finalised we can make informed decisions as to how we can improve treatment, awareness and diagnosis in line with other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Beat down.  Broke.  Defeated.  I couldn&rsquo;t face another ten years".  If one listens to the reply he has just given, however, while work is ongoing, the campaign for the recognition of Lyme disease has gone on for years but little or nothing has been done.</p><p>While the Minister is waiting for the report, the fact of the matter is that in France the Government has a model of care and understanding of Lyme disease that could be copied by this country.  No effort is being made to inform the public in any meaningful way.  The only organisation I see doing this is Tick Talk, and Ann Maher writes to the Minister on a regular basis on behalf of the organisation highlighting the issues and the costs of going to Germany for diagnosis and treatment.  It is extremely unfair that people in this country who have Lyme disease can, like Kerry Lawless, be left undiagnosed from 2007 to 2017.  We are ruining the lives of people.  Simple mistakes are being made and not being recorded.</p></speech>

We will have the basis of information next month, which will enable us to make informed decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated in many cases using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and they help to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks and if complications develop intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  Tick Talk Ireland, the support group referenced by the Deputy that does excellent work to encourage awareness, prevention and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland, has requested that the guidelines produced by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society be used instead of those recommended in the 2012 consensus statement.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is probably aware that on 25 September a meeting took place between the Department and members of the cross-party action group on Lyme disease.  Tick Talk Ireland was represented at the meeting.  I accept this is an issue on which there is an awful lot of concern.  I accept the testimony the Deputy has given me from a person with whom he has been in contact.

We tend to do an awful lot of reports and we do not learn from other countries.  I have highlighted the fact that France seems to be leading the way but Canada has a similar approach to this disease.  In New York the same thing is happening, with a cross-departmental approach to solving the issue of Lyme disease.  If all of these countries are taking roughly the same initiative and if the European Union is debating having a similar approach then surely we can force as a matter of urgency that the report be completed and the appropriate actions out of that report to be taken.  I urge the Minister not to allow this to go on for long more.  Tick Talk and others recognise the work being done by the Minister in this area but they point out that time is hugely important to them and ask the Minister to recognise this in the context of action being taken.</p></speech>

It is to ask the Minister his views on the campaign to abolish inpatient charges for cancer patients, specifically cancer patients who do not qualify for a medical card and do not have private health insurance.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.304.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300029#BB00700"><p>I thank Deputies Scanlon and Curran for the question.  Significant progress has been made over a number of years and over the lifetime of successive Governments in dealing with cancer treatment, with significantly improving survival rates in our country.  The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 aims to build on the progress already made, with improved cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment and aftercare support.  The Irish Cancer Society made a significant input into the drawing up of the strategy and plays a very positive role in supporting people affected by cancer, for which I thank it.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the sentiment behind the society's campaign on hospital charges, making exemptions to these charges on the basis of illness or treatment risks creating inequity within the system.</p>  <p>  The statutory co-payment, which is capped at a level that is not large relative to the true cost of providing hospital services, represents an important contribution towards hospitals' operating costs.  While the overall charges are subject to ongoing review, we all need to be honest with each other about the significant financial implications their overall abolition would have.</p>  <p>  In budget 2019 the Government decided to prioritise the extension of the GP visit card income thresholds, the reduction in the drug payment scheme monthly threshold and the reduction in the prescription charges for those aged over 70 with a medical card.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy commits to consider all existing charges in the context of the annual budgetary process and this will allow for priorities to be determined in reviewing and considering the scope for a reduction in charges.</p>  <p>  I would rather see a situation where we reduce charges overall than a situation whereby we pick a reduction based on disease or condition.  While a strong case can be made, as the Irish Cancer Society did, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, cystic fibrosis and other conditions could equally make the case.  We are on a road of reform with Sl&aacute;intecare that is committed to reducing further inpatient charges and the fact the current charges are capped at a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 months is the roadmap to use.  The Department will review eligibility and charges as part of our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation and I will certainly consider it in this context.</p></reply>

Quite obviously a diagnosis of cancer for anyone is a very concerning issue.  This particular campaign is quite specific in who it addresses.  It addresses people who do not qualify for a medical card and do not have private health insurance.  If people are relatively affluent they may well have private health insurance.  It indicates that people are on a fairly restricted budget.  Many cancer treatments are over a protracted period of time.  Generally people are either in work less or not at all.  They have a reduction in income and at the very time they have a reduction in income they have additional treatment charges.  While the Minister rightly states he is trying to reduce charges and that the maximum inpatient charge in a year is &euro;800, this is a significant amount of money at a time when people are experiencing a reduction in income.  It is for a specific cohort of people, not those who are particularly affluent but those who are squeezed, who pay for everything and who get very little in return.  The concern is that the charge the Minister speaks about as being a reduced charge is a really punitive charge for this group of people.</p></speech>

I recognise it welcomed some of the measures in the budget.  It welcomed the fact we heard their call regarding a rise in the price of cigarettes, which was supported throughout the House.  It also welcomed the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys and the reduction in medication costs, although it and I want to do more in this regard.  I accept it also highlighted very much, as the Deputy has done very eloquently, the impact, albeit capped, that large costs can have on somebody at a very vulnerable moment in his or her life.  We know the burdens of cancer, not just the medical and psychological burdens but also the financial burden.  I recognise this.  What I am trying to say is that in addressing this burden I want to try to do so in a way that is not disease specific but recognises the fact there has to be an equity of access, and there are many people with a wide range of disease and illness who find themselves going to our hospitals quite a lot.  I would like to use the work we are doing through the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan to look at how best we reduce those charges.  I will certainly look at the Irish Cancer Society's submission in this context.</p></speech>

I will not reiterate all of the points.  There is the specific concern with regard to some cancers about the longevity of the treatment and that it is over a protracted period of time.  I indicated quite clearly that for some people it means taking time out of work.  They are on reduced or no income depending on what they have.  They probably do not have critical illness insurance or private health insurance.  At the very same time, they have medical expenses.  It is not just the direct medical expenses but the incidentals, including, as I stated earlier, car parking charges.  They mount up for those attending and who require ongoing regular treatment over an extended period.  If they have private health insurance, are affluent or in work it is different but there is a cohort of people who require fairly intensive treatment over an extensive period and their ability to meet these charges is quite restricted.</p></speech>

There is no doubt there are extra costs when somebody has an illness, particularly one that can last a sustained period of time, such as cancer.  It is not just a cost to the person but also to their entire family.  We all have to work to try to reduce that cost burden.  I am committed to doing that.  The Deputy referenced the issue of car parking charges and I heard him speak about these earlier.</p><p>The Deputy is correct to highlight this.  As he is aware, I have asked for a review of all car-parking charges and hope to be in a position to update the House in that regard very shortly.</p></speech>

What plans does the Minister have to improve the level of GP care?</p></reply>

As she is aware, preparations for the implementation of the termination of pregnancy services are at an advanced stage.  I welcome that the House passed the Bill through Second Stage, which is crucial, as is ensuring that the services will be ready to be put into operation.  As the Deputy is aware, it is envisaged that most terminations up to nine weeks of pregnancy will take place in the community setting.  Several medical practitioners have expressed an interest in providing termination of pregnancy services.  The Deputy heard the evidence of representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners in that regard to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  Officials in my Department and the HSE are drafting contractual proposals for the provision of these services.  It is intended that the contract will be available to qualified medical practitioners who wish to provide the services as well as organisations that provide women&rsquo;s health services.  It is vital that we have safe, accessible, woman-centred termination of pregnancy services in place by January 2019 and the Government has provided additional resources in the recent budget to ensure that will be done.</p>  <p>  More generally, engagement is due to recommence tomorrow with GP representatives on a package of measures including service improvements and reform to the general medical services, GMS, contract.  I recognise that GPs, like very many people, suffered additional burdens and costs during the financial recession.  I wish to move to a situation where their careers and operation in the community are far more sustainable.  I have reached agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, on a multi-annual investment programme in general practice and I am delighted that representatives of the IMO will meet officials of my Department to try to make progress on this.  We have set a deadline of the end of the year for progress.  That relates to the Deputy's broader point on the sustainability of general practice as we ask GPs to take on new services.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the provision of termination services, my Department and the HSE are drafting contractual proposals in that regard.  We will resource general practice to provide the services.  As I consistently stated during the referendum campaign, it is important to note that this will not in any way overwhelm the Irish health service.  That possibility is not often raised in the context of other conditions or GP attendances.</p></speech>

The average number of doctors per 1,000 patients is 3.3 in the OECD but in Ireland it is 2.7.  Unless those figures rapidly change, that will require action, particularly in areas where GPs see more patients than is the case in other areas.  North inner city Dublin has the highest level of patients to doctors in the country at 1,218 patients per GP, while next in line is a rural area, Laois-Offaly, where there are 1,176 patients per GP.  Combined with the imposition of a three-day waiting period and the possibility of doctors opting out of or conscientiously objecting to the provision of these services, there could be flashpoints in which there will be real problems accessing services to terminate pregnancies.</p>  <p>  We must also very seriously consider the level of general GP care across the country.  That needs to be addressed.  An alarming 31% of current GPs are due to retire from the profession in the next five years.  How will we replace that level of care in a timely fashion?</p></speech>

It is not good enough just to train more GPs; we must work to ensure that general practice is and will be a sustainable career for those studying to become a GP.  That is why we are providing a programme of investment as well as extra training places.  Talks on that general programme of investment are to take place tomorrow with the IMO, which has asked for the matter to be resolved before the end of the year and that a multi-annual programme of investment for general practice be implemented.  I accept that general practice took a hit in that during the economic recession under successive Governments.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, in the budget we provided specific resources relating to the termination of pregnancy, as the Deputy is aware.  As she is also aware, I have appointed Dr. Peter Boylan to work with the HSE to ensure these services are ready.  An issue raised with me by GPs and the medical colleges is the provision of a medically operated out-of-hours telephone service as an extra support for women and doctors and I have directed the HSE to have that service in place by January.</p></speech>

The three-day waiting period and two doctor visits into which women will be forced will cause genuine problems, particularly in flashpoint areas such as parts of rural Ireland and poorer areas of inner city Dublin with a far higher ratio of patients to GPs than the rest of the country.</p><p>An interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today addressed the question of conscientious objection.  The writer pointed out that doctors may object to providing the services not because they have a problem with dealing with terminations but because they have a problem with a work payment situation.  Under FEMPI, doctors' income was cut by 25% and that has not been reversed.  Numerous problems must be dealt with but my fear is that having repealed the eighth and gained access to termination the women of this country will encounter real problems accessing GPs to deliver that service, particularly in more vulnerable areas such as isolated parts of rural Ireland or poorer parts of inner city Dublin.</p></speech>

My basic premise is to do what I stated I would do during the referendum.  We asked the Irish to vote "Yes" and we published a draft general scheme which was debated the length and breadth of the country.  Regardless of my personal views, I have a responsibility and a duty to move ahead with legislation that is very closely aligned from a policy perspective to what we stated during the referendum campaign we would do.</p>  <p>  On GP numbers, the Deputy and I are largely on the same page on the issue of termination.  Those on the other side of the debate often raise concerns that not enough GPs will be willing to provide this service or they will be overwhelmed by the number of women seeking to avail of terminations or awful phrases such as that.  The evidence does not supports such views.  Many doctors put their names forward during the referendum campaign as being willing to provide such services.  The Irish College of General Practitioners indicated its views in that regard to the joint committee and I am confident that we can make progress on the matter.</p></speech>

Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures remains a key priority.  As the Deputy correctly stated, in budget 2019 we further increased investment in this area, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to increase from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019, an overall increase of 150 % since the Government came into office and entered into the confidence and supply agreement. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 inpatient day case treatments, an increase of 5,000 from the 20,000 procedures committed to in the waiting list action plan this year.  In addition, provision of 5,000 gastrointestinal scopes will be arranged by the NTPF, an increase of 1,000 from its target for this year.  Furthermore, 40,000 first outpatient appointments will be arranged.  This is a very important point.  As has been acknowledged by Fianna F&aacute;il, we have made significant progress.  There has been a very significant reduction in the inpatient day case list, from approximately 86,000 people waiting for hospital operations or procedures at its peak to the low 70,000s.  The number waiting is projected to continue to drop month on month.  We know the investment is making a difference in that area.  We now need to target outpatient lists, which is why I will be putting a particular focus on those 40,000 first outpatient appointments in terms of the resourcing of the NTPF.</p>  <p>  There have been ongoing improvements in the number of patients waiting for inpatient and day case procedures this year, with the number now at 72,700, down from a peak of 86,100.  That is a 16% reduction and the number awaiting treatment will continue to fall.  The number of patients waiting for over nine months has reduced from over 28,000 to under 19,000 in the same period, a 32% reduction.  It is expected that through the combination of HSE and NTPF activity this trend will continue.  It is projected that the overall number of patients on the inpatient day case waiting list will reduce to approximately 70,000 by the end of this year and to under 59,000 by the end of 2019.</p><p>NTPF activity next year will cover approximately 50 high to medium-volume procedures and will be through a combination of treating patients in outsourced facilities and public in-sourced facilities.  I will publish a waiting list plan with the NTPF detailing that but about 50 high to medium-volume procedures will be targeted in 2019.  </p></speech>

In the opening part of the reply, he mentioned that spending has gone up by 150% from what it was a number of years ago.  Yes, it has because it came off the back of a very low base.  I am glad to see the Minister acknowledge and identify the procedures that are being carried out.</p>  <p>  I do not want to play politics with it but I want to be very serious.  A decade ago, we were spending more than &euro;75 million on the NTPF at a time when the total health budget was considerably less than the &euro;17 billion it is today.  The Minister quite rightly identified the various procedures, including 40,000 people on the outpatient list who can be targeted this year.  I am concerned that he is not ambitious enough in respect of the NTPF.  Over the past number of years, these lists across outpatients and so forth have grown very significantly.  There is an opportunity to be more ambitious.  I would have hoped that the budget for the NTPF this year would have been more like &euro;100 million rather than &euro;75 million and that we would have a really ambitious programme.  I say that on the day when the Taoiseach stood where the Minister now stands and said that if anybody had any suggestions for the extra &euro;1 billion in health, they should tell him.  I am suggesting that a small portion of it could be directed at the NTPF with very specific targets.</p></speech>

I would just make the point that the confidence and supply agreement did commit to &euro;15 million so in fairness to Deputy Curran's party and the Government, I think we are doing more than we said we would do together through confidence and supply.  I would make the point, which the Deputy would recognise, that the funding for the NTPF is not the totality of funding on waiting list initiatives.  In fact, it is still very much at the margins.  As the Deputy rightly says, the HSE has a budget of over &euro;17 billion.  I would make the point, particularly when Deputy O'Reilly is here, that it is not all for outsourcing either.  An awful lot of it can and should be used on in-sourcing.  I have met all the hospital groups in recent days and weeks and have asked them to put forward their proposals for in-sourcing.  For example, we have opened a cataract theatre in Nenagh as a result of that.  I must also make the point that outpatient waiting lists were not published until a few years so people who say the lists are at a record high are not comparing like with like.  The previous figures were never published.</p>  <p>  We have seen a lot of progress, for example, with regard to cataracts.  At the end of July 2017, there were 10,024 people on the waiting list.  This figure has dropped to 6,626 at the end of September so we have an awful lot more to do with regard to this.  I am always happy to allocate more funding in this regard.  We will work our way through this in the service plan.</p></speech>

I look at it from a pragmatic point of view.  It delivers a service for people who are currently waiting on lists.  I think the Minister should consider being more ambitious in terms of what is available and that we need to consider extending the services offered under it.  For example, we could look at the role it could play in terms of providing services for children.  By that, I mean children who require diagnosis, be it in terms of occupational therapy or speech and language therapy and some initial treatments.  Some of those waiting lists for young children are unacceptably long.  I believe a targeted approach from the NTPF could have a role to play here and should be examined.</p></speech>

I very much see the NTPF as an agency that should be seen as an access fund and a way of making sure we can have ring-fenced budgets to ensure our patients can get more timely access to treatment, be it inpatient or outpatient.  I am ambitious when it comes to seeing the NTPF extend its remit to outpatients.  We need to do this in a careful way and that we make sure that if it is outsourced, they look after the entire episode of care so that someone is not just seen on an outpatient list and then referred back to a public hospital list for an inpatient procedure.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy with regard to the assessment of needs issue.  As the Deputy is aware, we have funding in budget 2019 that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will reflect in the service plan for 100 additional therapist posts.  I certainly do not rule out looking at other ways of using the NTPF if it can be helpful.  </p></speech>

The HSE aims to commence treatment for the majority of patients within two years of assessment with patients with greatest clinical need being prioritised for treatment.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are particular challenges at present in the south east as waiting times have been affected by difficulties in filling the orthodontist post for County Wexford.  The vacancy has been re-advertised with a closing date of 14 November 2018.   Subject to the outcome of this process, the HSE is hopeful that the post can be filled early in 2019.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, there is currently a one-day-a week assessment and review service in Enniscorthy with a treatment service being offered in Waterford and Kilkenny locations.  I appreciate that it is far from ideal but it ensures that patients from County Wexford are able to access services pending the filling of the vacant position.  In order to help address long waiting times, in 2016, the HSE procured orthodontic services in primary care from a number of private service providers.  I understand that 225 patients from the south east are being treated under this programme.  I hope we will be successful in filling the vacant orthodontist post for County Wexford.  The closing date is 14 November.  Subject to a successful outcome, we will move to fill that post as quickly as possible so that it can be operational early in 2019, which should significantly improve the service for people in the south east.  </p></speech>

Nationally, there are over 18,000 children on the waiting list, of which 7,500 have been waiting over two years.  In the south east, 3,000 children are waiting for treatment with 1,500 waiting over two years and over 150 waiting over four years for orthodontic treatment.  In my county of Wexford, 700 children are in need of orthodontic treatment.  Over two thirds of these children have been waiting in excess of two years.  My office is inundated with phone calls, texts, emails and people calling to the office.  Parents are dismayed by these waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Waiting has an impact on mental health.  Unfortunately, we live in a society where perfection is increasingly becoming an issue.  Having to wait longer during their teenage years is having an impact on the mental health of children who desperately need orthodontic treatment.</p></speech>

It is fair to say there is a particular issue in the south east, particularly in the Deputy's county with that vacant orthodontist post.  In fairness, the HSE has tried to fill it but it was not successful.  It has now re-advertised the post and hopes to fill it.  The closing date is 14 November.  I will certainly keep in close contact with the HSE with regard to making sure that if a suitable candidate is identified on 14 November, everything is put in place to ensure that person is operational and in post as quickly as possible.  I take the broader point made by the Deputy and will raise it with the HSE in the context of the service plan.</p></speech>

As he is aware, in budget 2019, we have prioritised improving access and reducing waiting times for patients with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  I am pleased to say this increase in funding will allow us to target 40,000 outpatient appointments.</p><p>The Deputy has raised with me before the importance of using the NTPF for inpatient day cases where we have seen progress.  We are also now asking it to play a role for outpatients too.  To date in 2018, the NTPF has approved almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this will increase to 40,000 appointments next year.  I recently met with the CEOs of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE to develop new proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019.</p> <p> Sligo University Hospital, through engagement with the NTPF, will be running an additional ear, nose and throat, ENT, clinic every week from November to help reduce those waiting for their first appointment.  This is good news for people in the Deputy's county.  Sligo University Hospital specifically, and Saolta Hospital Group, have demonstrated a clear commitment to reducing the number of outpatients waiting to be seen.  Since 2017 additional outpatient clinics have been held for gynaecology, general medicine and neurology to increase the number of patients seen and reduce long waiting times.  Sligo has also embraced several other approaches, including the use of virtual clinics in the orthopaedic department; a restructuring of the acute pain clinic to allow for referrals to be triaged and treated by a multidisciplinary specialist team; and the development of an ophthalmology service.  The Sligo eye care model which people talk so much about is something that I would like to see rolled out as part of our Sl&aacute;intecare plans and our HSE service plan in 2019.  We will have funding for additional outpatient and hospital appointments in 2019.  I will work with the Saolta group to consider more initiatives for Sligo.  I am very pleased that from next month we will have an additional ENT clinic every week in Sligo funded through the NTPF.</p></speech>

When the Minister took office in May 2016 there were 65 in the same category.  That is a seventeenfold increase in that time.  Nationally, the Minister is aware that the outpatient lists have hit another record high of 515,547 with almost 150,000 of those patients waiting over a year.  While I am pleased that the NTPF is finally to be used for outpatients I have a concern being from the north west, the marginalised part of the country in all disciplines and all budgetary Votes, about what proportion of the 40,000 places will be reserved for the Saolta group and, in particular, Sligo University Hospital and Letterkenny.  It is not just my county because as I am sure the Minister is well aware Sligo University Hospital services five counties or at least part thereof.  There were 20 people waiting more than a year for an orthopaedic appointment in May 2016 but now there are 475.  I am glad that the Minister mentioned another ENT clinic.  The waiting list for that was 51 in May 2016 but now it is 764.  I will let the Minister respond to that before I conclude.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is appropriate that the first area we target with NTPF funding starting next month is additional ENT clinics.  I particularly thank the hospital, one which as the Deputy knows is limited in physical space, although perhaps that is for another conversation, for arranging to run evening clinics to ensure this can be facilitated.  I also want to thank it for informing me that it is going to review the space now used by the ENT which has longest waiting times.  There is the potential to modify existing rooms with the fit-out of equipment to create three procedure rooms and to soundproof a third audiology room.  The hospital would then be able to see an additional 384 patients annually.  I very much take the Deputy's point in wanting to ensure that the Saolta group in that part of the country gets its fair share of resources.  My message to the Saolta group, and I have delivered it in person, is to come forward with as many proposals as possible.  I visited Sligo University Hospital where I delivered that message.  Any proposals that can help drive down waiting lists will be favourably received by the Department of Health.</p></speech>

It always worries me when the Minister puts the onus on the hospital to come up with a plan.  We are driving the bus up here, at least we should be.  People have been waiting for a long time not just for ENT but for the full range of procedures, although the biggest number is for ENT, and that initiative is appropriate.  If the hospital is showing such a good initiative for ENT why not go the extra mile and fund additional clinics across the spectrum with the help of the NTPF?</p></speech>

The Deputy's party has acknowledged the progress made in inpatient day cases where there has been a very significant reduction of 16% from the peak in the number of people waiting for a hospital operation or appointment.  We now need to apply that same level of scrutiny to our outpatient lists.  I am very pleased that we are in a position, through the NTPF, to fund the additional ENT clinic on a weekly basis from next month in Sligo.  I accept there is more to be done and that it is the Deputy&rsquo;s job to make the case for his region.  I will have to approach this with fairness based on clinical need.  We are driving the bus but there are many people employed within the health service to come up with ideas and put forward waiting list plans for consideration in respect of funding and I look forward to receiving them.</p></speech>

As I already said to his colleagues, Deputies MacSharry and Curran, reducing the outpatient waiting list and reducing waiting times in general is a priority and must remain a priority for Government, for all of us in this House and for the health service.  That is why we have in working with the Deputy's party increased the level of funding for the NTPF from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019, of which there will be ringfenced funding of probably &euro;6 million, although I am finalising that figure for outpatient activity.</p>  <p>  To date in 2018, the NTPF has approved almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this is projected to increase to 40,000 appointments next year.  I recently met with the chief executive officers, CEOs, of all hospital groups and the CEO of Tallaght University Hospital to invite them to bring forward new and innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019.  We now have the funding for this and I want to receive as many ideas as possible.</p>  <p>  To date this year the NTPF has approved proposals to treat more than 2,200 outpatients across a range of specialties at Tallaght University Hospital, through the provision of an additional 177 outpatient clinics. </p>  <p>  Tallaght University Hospital advises it has a waiting list decision support system in place which plans and forecasts outpatient demand, allowing the hospital to ensure planned improvements are delivered.  Tallaght University Hospital has also recently recruited new consultants in orthopaedics, neurology, and ENT, additional advanced nurse practitioners in rheumatology, and has additional physio-led clinics in specialties such as gynaecology.  This is very important as an innovative approach.  I thank Tallaght University Hospital for the work it has done.</p>  <p>  The longest waiting periods for outpatients are particularly in ENT, dermatology, urology, neurology, gynaecology and orthopaedics.  I will consider this specifically in the context of the NTPF's outpatient plan for 2019 and I look forward to receiving proposals from the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. </p></reply>

Fine Gael abolished it.  In what way had Fine Gael hoped to deal with this issue, going back six or seven years?  The Minister's answers this afternoon have all been peppered with the NTPF.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il invention.  Fine Gael scrapped it and did not want to countenance it in the confidence and supply agreement.  The Government had to be persuaded.  That is a genuine question.  In what way had Fine Gael hoped to deal with the waiting lists?  What was Fine Gael's and the Government's big idea?</p>  <p>  The Minister said for the second time since I came in here this afternoon that he welcomes ideas.  He is the Minister and he is elected.  He comes from a party that is supposed to be full of ideas.  What are his ideas?</p></speech>

I always find this point quite bizarre because if Deputy Lahart had been the Minister for Health in 2011 and had gone into the Department of Health in Hawkins House, he would have needed good luck to find money to put into any initiative because of the state Fianna F&aacute;il left the country in.  I am honoured to be the Minister for Health at a time of expansionary budgets.  The Deputy should remember that health budgets had to be cut during his party's last tenure and the beginning of my party's tenure.  The NTPF was wound up but it was not as if the then Minister, Senator James Reilly, had lots of options for initiatives to fund.</p><p>He was left with extraordinarily difficult decisions.  I am not afraid to embrace good ideas and I believe the NTPF is a good idea.  It was not necessarily run in the best way in the past.  It cherry-picked patients and allowed people who had not necessarily waited the longest to be seen.  Therefore it did not prioritise the longest-waiting patients.  It had a self-referral system that allowed a degree of cherry-picking and it did not do nearly enough insourcing.  When it came to negotiating the confidence and supply agreement, the Deputy's party only looked for &euro;15 million for it and today I am criticised for not putting more money into it even though we are allocating &euro;75 million.</p> <p> The NTPF has a role to play and I am very happy that it is playing a role.  It is important that its role is also about insourcing and not just outsourcing, and that it targets those waiting longest.  The Deputy's local hospital in Tallaght is beginning to see the benefit of that investment and I hope we will see more in 2019.</p></speech>

It abolished the HSE and scrapped the NTPF.  Universal health insurance was going to sort everything out.  Then Fine Gael decided it would not work.  It then decided it needed the HSE, having abolished the board.  It is now going to re-establish the board.  Where are the great ideas on health and innovation in health because the Minister is looking for ideas?  Fine Gael had several great ideas in 2011; each and every one of which has been abandoned.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on the neurology figures in Tallaght Hospital.  In 2016 there were 480 on the waiting list and it is now up to 1,322 - close to 1,500.  These are people who may have multiple sclerosis or have suffered a stroke.  Rather than figures, what does the Minister say to the close relations of such people who come to my clinics and are incredibly anxious?  It must be remembered that this is a waiting list just to get the appointment; it is not for treatment.  What can I say to my constituents when I go back to them?</p></speech>

As he rightly said, many of my constituents also go to that hospital so I firmly accept the need for that.</p>  <p>  Here is my big idea on health.  My big idea was not to be the Minister who decided to come up with a big bright plan that would last for my tenure, but instead to work with people on all sides of this House to develop the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il's big idea was to set up the HSE, which clearly did not work.  The next big idea was to leave Mary Harney in the Department of Health and Children for years and not have Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers touch it.  We had big ideas; lots of Ministers had big ideas.</p>  <p>  What we actually need is a cross-party plan on health that will outlast my tenure in the Department of Health.  If the Deputy is the next Minister for Health, it might also outlast his tenure.  We have plan, called Sl&aacute;intecare that every party in this House has bought into.

He has an idea of the general theme.</p>  <p>  A constituent of mine received a copy of a bill from a particular private hospital that had been paid by the individual's health insurer.  It is for two stents inserted and a one-night stay in a private ward in the hospital from 11 a.m. one morning until 11 a.m. the following morning.  The person used all their own tablets.  The cost of the medical treatment seemed reasonable at approximately &euro;1,000 and given the serious nature of the procedure, my constituent was happy enough with that charge.  However, there was a charge of &euro;7,055 for the use of the hospital's facilities and bed for a 24-hour period - probably somewhat less than that.</p>  <p>  As this seems an outrageous figure to a layperson I did some investigation into it.  I was told that included in such a payment would be things such as the use of theatre, recovery space for a patient, perhaps consumable costs but not drugs in this case, and then what the insurers might call the hotel-like accommodation costs for keeping a patient overnight.  These are probably fees agreed between all insurers and private hospitals.  This is a semi-private room and not a fully private room.  There does not seem to be a great variation between what is agreed between each private insurer and each private hospital.  Therefore there is not a significant difference between what insurers are paying to private hospitals.</p>  <p>  If this procedure had been carried out for my constituent as a private patient in a public hospital, I am told the rate of reimbursement to a public hospital for a private patient would be approximately &euro;1,000 for this procedure, the insertion of two stents.  Here is the nub of the issue.  What is the real cost of this?  I am told by the public hospital that &euro;1,000 probably does not cover this and that it is about &euro;500 per stent.  That is just for the stent, but that &euro;7,000 is nowhere near the accurate cost of it either.  Therefore, if I go as a private patient into a public hospital for a procedure, the public hospital will receive &euro;1,000 from the insurer, but if I go in as a semi-private patient into a private hospital, the insurer will pay &euro;7,000.</p>  <p>  I am thinking of all the people who scrimp and save.  During hard times there were two things most families kept going: health insurance and the mortgage.  That the cost of private insurance is so exorbitant must be linked to these kinds of charges from private hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300033#FF01600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I am aware of the particular case he mentioned.</p><p>The charges that apply in a private hospital are the subject of negotiation between the health insurers and the health service providers.  The rates for particular procedures are the subject of agreement between insurers and medical consultants, while the rates that apply for accommodation and other services in private hospitals are agreed between health insurers and each individual private hospital.  Since health insurers can negotiate with private hospitals and with consultants, it is in the insurers&rsquo; interest to negotiate the best possible rate they can for procedures and services for their customers, as this will control their claims costs.</p><p>This is in contrast with the public hospital setting, where under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 a <i>per diem</i>charge applies when a patient is admitted to hospital and the patient opts to be treated on a private basis.  Health insurers cannot negotiate with the HSE and the rates are set by legislation.  There is an objective in setting such charges from public hospitals to reduce the subsidy to private practice, including the changes that were made following the 2010 Comptroller and Auditor General report.  It should be noted that in recent years there has been no increase in private charges by public hospitals, notwithstanding the significant increase in costs, including salaries.</p><p>My colleague the Minister for Health has no role in the commercial decisions of any health insurer, and has no role in the charges for accommodation and other services that apply in any private hospital.  It is neither possible nor appropriate to comment on individual procedures without knowing the full circumstances and clinical decisions involved.</p><p>In general terms, care provided in a hospital setting will always be more expensive than care provided in a community setting and surgical procedures are considerably more expensive than medical procedures.</p><p>I note that there was a 1% decrease in claims paid by insurers last year, primarily because of a drop in insurance claims paid to public hospitals.</p><p>Significantly, from the perspective of the individual patient, it should be noted that in our community-rated health insurance market, an individual&rsquo;s premium will not be affected by his or her own claims history.  By law, insurers are not allowed to charge an individual a higher premium based on any of the individual&rsquo;s personal circumstances.  Instead, the premium for a health insurance plan is set at a rate where insurers will cover the expected claims costs that will arise based on the coverage received by their customers who are availing of that plan.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> Our community-rated private health insurance market is underpinned by a risk equalisation scheme.  The scheme involves a community rating levy collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers in respect of all policies written.  All of the moneys collected are paid over to the risk equalisation fund administered by the independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA.  The authority then redistributes the fund back to the market through credits payable to insurers in respect of insured lives to offset some of the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members.  The scheme is Exchequer neutral, with neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300034#GG00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The consultants' costs are not being questioned in this case.  I take his point on the State having no role in charging for accommodation.  Is he not even half scandalised by the cost?  There has to be a trickle-down impact from the charging of more than &euro;7,000 for an "overnight stay" in a semi-private room in a private hospital.  I have been informed by people who know far more about this than I do that the equivalent stay in a public hospital for the same procedure costs &euro;1,000.  The Minister of State has explained why and said that legislation is covering it.  He said &euro;1,000 does not cover the cost.  There is no way, however, it would cost &euro;7,000.</p>  <p>  Many constituents have shown politicians, including the Minister of State, bills received for treatment covered by private health insurers in respect of which they have been pleasantly surprised by the cost of the consultant or surgeon but absolutely outraged by, and left gasping at, the cost of the hospital facilities, even for the shortest of stays, particularly where there has not been an overnight stay.  I realise there is a cost associated with equipment, plant and ancillary staff.  Would it not help, however, if the insurer provided to the subscriber a detailed breakdown of exactly where every single cent of the sum in excess of &euro;7,000 went.?  If there are hundreds of patients in a hospital in any given week, millions of euro are paid over by health insurers.  I have read reports that the payouts last year were marginally lower, resulting in marginally lower premiums for people.  Given, however, the increases in the cost of living experienced by people over the past year, including in the cost of motor and health insurance, surely there is something the Government can do as opposed to just reciting the law and the negotiating stance of health insurers.  Surely the Government could do something for the insurer when it sees the outrageous amounts health insurers are charged by private hospitals.</p></speech>

I take his point on excessive charges considering that the cost of a routine procedure exceeded &euro;8,000.  The procedure in question was a stenting of the heart.  I take the Deputy's point that his constituents remain unhappy about the rate of the VHI charge.  These are genuine concerns.</p>  <p>  He asked what we are going to do.  Of course we must try to do something about this.  The Government and I are committed to bringing in dynamic changes to improve our public healthcare system under Sl&aacute;intecare, ensuring that the right care is provided by the right person in the right place.  Private hospitals have, and will continue to have, an important role in our national health system.  In future, however, I hope patients will be able to make an informed choice between receiving care in a private hospital, using their health insurance or another payment method, and receiving care in a world-class public hospital system.  That is our plan and what we intend to do.  We must also examine the issue of cost.  Patients and Deputy Lahart should note my focus must always be on the safety of the patient.  If it costs a little extra to insure and to save a person's life, I will be strongly supportive of that position.  Where public moneys are involved in public health services, there has to be accountability and transparency.  Above all, we have to have a quality health service.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a l&aacute;n daoine agus a dteaghlaigh i nD&uacute;n Dealgan buartha tar &eacute;is an droch nuacht faoi The Authentic Food Company an deireadh seachtaine seo caite.</p>  <p>  I first wrote to the company on 21 September having been contacted by workers and their representatives about rumours that The Authentic Food Company was closing.  The company did not respond to my initial correspondence or to representations from Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Anne Campbell.  Instead, on 19 October, the company went to the High Court.  Staff at then received notice that the company was allegedly insolvent and unable to pay wages.  I met the liquidators this morning.</p>  <p>  The managing director of The Authentic Food Company, Nik Basran, claims that management carried out a comprehensive review of the business to try to find a way to make it profitable over the long term but he said this was not possible.  The Minister of State has a responsibility to ask what type of review it is that excludes the workers' representatives and refuses to engage directly with Unite.  What kind of review is it that it can be manipulated by employers so that these workers have no notice pay, P45s, references, redundancy payments or income for six weeks.  This is very calculated, and it is sharp practice.  Will the Minister of State give the D&aacute;il a commitment that he will investigate whether this is a tactical insolvency?  We need to establish whether the British-based The Authentic Food Company deliberately wound down the Dundalk plant.  The workforce has been treated shamefully.  They cannot gain access to social welfare.  I urge the Minister of State to use his discretion to ensure the workers get their social welfare payments as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to Enterprise Ireland to encourage it to find a buyer for the plant and to assure it of Sinn F&eacute;in support for this.  I ask the Minister of State to do everything possible to have the workforce re-employed as quickly as possible.  The workers need their social welfare entitlements anois.</p></speech>

The workers will not receive their P45s for another month.  Unless immediate action is taken, they will be left high and dry for the next 30 days as we approach the Christmas period.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection must intervene and put procedures in place to ensure this matter is rectified immediately.</p>  <p>  One hundred and eighty people have just lost their jobs.  They now face a month without an income and no social welfare to tide them over.  How are they going to pay their bills or feed their families in the next 30 days?  How does the Minister of State propose to rectify this?  This mess was not of the workers' making.  How does he propose to rectify it so the workers will not be left for 30 long days without any payment whatsoever? </p></speech>

Our thoughts, like those of the two Deputies, whom I know have been in touch with the employees, are always with the families affected by the closure of a company.  It is a difficult time for them.  We all understand that very much.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.</p>  <p>  Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of section 9 or section 10, he or she may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  It is also an offence under section 11 of the Act where an employer fails to comply with section 9 or section 10.</p>  <p>  Following contact from my Department, the joint provisional liquidators of the company have advised that the consultation process with employees began on Friday, 19 October and will continue for a period of 30 days. </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the provisional liquidators as required.</p> <p> In cases where an employer is insolvent, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for the employees.  It is the liquidator&rsquo;s responsibility to seek, on behalf of employees, payment from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage related entitlements.  An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks' statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  To qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years of continuous service, be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and be over the age of 16 years.  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme are arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice and certain pension contributions.  Payments are calculated by reference to an employee's wages and are subject to a limit of &euro;600 per week.  Arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay and minimum notice are limited to eight weeks.</p> <p> My Department will ensure that the affected employees receive advice on jobseeker's payments and other income supports that may be available to them and will provide support to them in returning to work or accessing appropriate education and training and development options.  The team in the north-east division met employees of the company yesterday and provided them with information on the lntreo services available locally.  An information and recruitment event for the workforce will be held in the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dundalk on Thursday, 1 November next.  The event will be supported by other key service providers.  Local employers with job vacancies have also committed to attend.  The key message for employees is that the Department will provide any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner and will proactively help them to access opportunities available for employment.</p> <p> Finally, the Workplace Relations Commission's customer service section provides information on the rights and obligations of employees and employers, respectively, under employment rights legislation.  WRC information officials are available to meet the staff concerned, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.</p></speech>

I ask him to study my question and revert to me on it.  There is a small chink of light with his statement that: "The key message for employees is that the Department will provide any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner".  How will these people pay their rent?  Last week they were in work, this week they are not.  Where will they get the money to pay the rent?  The Minister of State has the discretion to send a very clear signal that they should be paid now.</p>  <p>  I raised other issues which I do not have time to discuss now.  They relate to liquidations such as this.  There is a responsibility on the Minister if this is a tactical liquidation which is to the advantage of the company and the disadvantage of the workers.  The company ignored the unions and communications from me and other local representatives.  It was wilful, deliberate and tactical.  The company went to the court.  The people who are the salt of the earth and who gave loyal service to this company are being abandoned.  The Minister might not have had the chance to study what I said but I ask him to take up this matter and make a difference in the lives of these workers and their families.</p></speech>

They must be compelled to talk to trade unions in situations such as this.  The worker cannot always be the loser.  Workers must be protected and the Government must provide that protection.  We raised the issue of them not receiving any payment for the next 30 days to pay bills and mortgages or to put food on the table.  My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and I have already introduced the Trade Union Representation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2018 and I sincerely hope it will not be blocked by the Government in the same way previous legislative measures have been blocked.  The Minister of State must support our efforts to rectify this.  He must make provision for social welfare payments for the workers in Dundalk.  He must also support our Bill when it is brought before the committee to prevent something like this happening again.  We seek a definitive answer.  Will the Minister of State ensure that workers receive payments in the next 30 days to tide them over until they get their P45s?</p></speech>

Some 180 people have lost their jobs as a result of this.  Our response plan was put into place immediately after the liquidator was appointed.  It was put into place on Monday but the process started over the weekend.  The emergency response plan was put in place by our teams in Dundalk.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, the first issue is that the affected employees quickly receive access to all income supports that are available.  These will be provided, as will job opportunities.  The agencies have been informed of the situation with regard to any job opportunities for people who have been affected by this.  In addition, they will get priority in the area of education and training.</p>  <p>  We have acted very quickly on this, as has the Intreo team in Dundalk.  The team met the workers on Monday afternoon at Ballymascanlon House Hotel.  The priority was to expedite payments and to offer help and assistance with registration for the public services card and so forth.  As I said earlier, an information and recruitment event will take place in the Crowne Plaza Hotel on 1 November next between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.  That is important because all agencies will be attending the event, including the education and training board, Dundalk IT, the local enterprise offices, the National Learning Network, the Revenue Commissioners, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service and the Citizens Information service, to help and assist the people who have found themselves in this unpredictable situation.

I reaffirm that now.  In fact, on the Saturday the Minister was appointed I was driving to the conference of the National Parents Council, at which I was due to speak, and when I heard the news I pulled in and sent him an email to wish him well and to raise the situation I will outline here.</p>  <p>  It is an absolute disgrace in this day and age that six children with special needs are being denied their constitutional right to education in their home town.  I will put the children's names on the record.  They are Kelly Semple, Josh O'Shea, James Tiernan, Latoyah Bowers, Jason Moran and Jack Reilly.  These children received an excellent education in a special autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Scoil Na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge.  Some 18 months ago when we collectively discussed the next steps in this regard it suddenly dawned on the Department of Education and Skills that no provision had been made at the next level for when these children would leave the ASD unit.  There were many conversations, meetings, telephone calls and emails.  In fact, I brought the parents to an education committee meeting which was dealing with the area of special educational needs in order that they could have an understanding of how we deal with these issues.</p>  <p>  Nine weeks after 1 September, when the children were told they would have a place in St. Conleth's Community College, Newbridge, they have not had an hour or a day of education.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the children were not going to school, the State and the Department would bring their parents to court for non-attendance at school.</p><p>The delays in opening the extension of the St. Conleth&rsquo;s community college and the delay in opening the autistic spectrum, ASD, unit are directly impacting on the education of the children who are waiting and on their families.  They are not the school's fault.  All children, including children with special educational needs, have a right to an education that is appropriate to their needs.  Education should be about enabling all children, in line with their abilities, to live full and independent lives so that they can contribute to their communities, co-operate with other people and continue to learn throughout their lives.</p> <p> These six children, however, are yet to start their school year, despite commitments that were made in January 2018.  At a meeting in January, the parents were told by a principal officer of the Department of Education and Skills who is in charge of special education provision, and by the head of operations for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that if there was a delay, alternative accommodation would be in place by 1 September.  This has not happened.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The parents feel very let down by the system, which I can understand.  The system was meant to support and nurture their children.  I am aware that this morning the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, lodged an application with Kildare County Council to open part of the ground floor extension.  This, however, can take up to another three weeks, which leaves us well into November.  It is completely unacceptable that these children are still waiting to start school.  They still have no date on which they can start school, there is still no alternative accommodation put in place and there is no home tuition in place.  That commitment was fully given in January in respect of the six children.</p></speech>

There is a preamble around the general allocation of money in this sector.  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required in an area, it is planned and provided for.  The NCSE sanctioned a new special class in St. Conleth's community college to meet the identified needs of students in Kildare, and the relevant teaching and SNA support has been allocated to the school.  To this end, the Department is providing a stand-alone extension to the community college in Newbridge.  This extension will provide 4,602 sq. m  of additional accommodation, including a PE hall and 552 sq. m of accommodation for children with special needs, to complement the existing 3,072 sq. m building.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department devolved the project for delivery to the KWETB.  The contractor was appointed for the project in October 2015.  Unfortunately, the project was significantly delayed primarily as a result of contractual issues.  Though progress has been less than satisfactory throughout the project, I am pleased that the building work on this project is now complete.  The Deputy will be aware of this from her conversations with the KWETB this morning.  A small number of snagging and defects issues that remained to be rectified and that prevented the extension being ready in time for 1 September have now been addressed.  Additionally, some further drainage issues that emerged and which led to a further delay in the completion of the project have been resolved.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge how disappointing these difficulties have been for the school community, including the pupils and parents concerned.  It is, however, in the nature of any building project that unforeseen issues can arise.  The objective is always to deal with these as quickly as possible to minimise delay and this has been the focus of KWETB and its design team.  When a building is completed, certifications for the constituent components are required to be registered with the local authority for the purposes of demonstrating that the building complies with building control regulations.  This was done yesterday.  The local authority is required to turn this around within three weeks.  After hearing of the Deputy's intervention, I would implore if possible that the turnaround time be brought into a more realistic timeframe.  The schools rise at the end of this week and they will then have the week off.  To give parents a bit of certainty on the issue I would like to see that happen.  I am aware there is a three-week turnaround, and if this is possible I would certainly support that.</p>  <p>  KWETB is actively communicating with the key stakeholders in respect of this project.  The school management is in regular contact with the parents concerned to keep them informed of progress with the project and met with them recently in that context.</p></speech>

I appreciate his good intentions in this regard.  He referred to school places and supports being planned for and being provided but the kernel to this is that these places were not planned for and were not provided.  Last January a sticking plaster was applied to the problem.  The problem is going to escalate in the area.  As of last year, we only had 18 places that were suitable or available for children with special needs who were leaving mainstream primary schools.  In this situation another three weeks means it will have been 12 weeks - three months - during which these children were without any type of education.  This is completely wrong.  The impacts for any child of staying out of education for this length of time can have lasting effects on their progress in school and on learning.  This especially applies to children with special educational needs.  To be fair, I am aware that the Minister has only been in office for one week but officials in his office had told the parents that alternative accommodation would be in place by 1 November.  We are now at 23 October and we have heard nothing about that, and now it is to be pushed back another three weeks.</p>  <p>  Last week, a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled stated: "In the meantime, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is continuing to work with the school and the parents to ensure that the appropriate supports are in place, including application for home tuition."  No supports whatsoever have been put in place for these six children or their parents.  This is absolutely and completely wrong.  Home tuition is a poor substitute for children who are used to attending school.  It amounts to only a maximum of nine hours per week.  From day one, we have said that this was not going to be acceptable.  Alternative avenues must be considered to have these children in the classroom to ensure that the impact on their education is minimal.  Let this be a lesson going forward to the Department and to the Minister with regard to other situations like this around the country.  It is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

Every child and every young person deserves access to education and has a right to that education.  I do not know the specifics about what was offered or if the home school tuition was offered.  For the record, up to 20 hours can be made available for home tuition.  I do not know why that was not taken up or why it was not organised.  We can explore that further, but up to 20 hours a week can be provided for home school tuition.  If the council has to take that three weeks, and if we need it in place for the week after Halloween and it be arranged, I will be happy to facilitate that.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, that does not compensate for the physical building and being in a space with their peers.  People may feel isolated enough because of certain situations and to be learning with their peers is where they want to be, first and foremost.  I am happy to stay in touch with the Deputy on this matter.</p></speech>

I am pleased for him personally and I wish him every success.</p>  <p>  The Topical Issue matter that I wish to raise affects a school in my constituency and also affects other schools.  The Minister will be aware that phase 1 of the development of Ardgillan community college, which was started in 2009, has closed elements of the school.  I would like to know how promptly the fourth year students will be re-homed.  They have been asked to stay at home, which is not acceptable, but I appreciate the unknown element in this story.  How long will the works take and what assurances can the Minister give to parents across the Balbriggan and Ardgillan community that the project will be completed as soon as possible?  What assurance can the Minister give that the State will not be left holding the can for this?</p><p>It is unacceptable that this situation has arisen and that we find ourselves in a position where we may have to close not just Tyrrelstown Educate Together, as was announced earlier, but other schools throughout the country as the result of shoddy workmanship.</p></speech>

This is a big one.  The structural safety assessments to be carried out on 30 schools built by Western Building Systems are important because the lives of the children who attend those schools are at stake.  The seriousness of that should not be lost on this House.  If the Minister were in opposition and speaking on education, he would tell Fianna F&aacute;il that it started the problem by abolishing the rigorous independent control inspections carried out by local councils in 1990 and replacing them with a series of self-certifications.  The legacy of the Galway tent and all the rest that goes with that tradition has proved to be a disaster.  What now faces us is the urgent need to make sure that schools which house children are safe.  I would like us to discuss how in the name of God this happened.  Is competitive tendering at the root of the problem?  What is supposed to be cheap and efficient ends up costing the State far more and could also end up costing lives.</p></speech>

What has been happening in our schools has put a shiver down the whole country's spine.  I have a number of questions.  Why are these issues arising now, more than one year after the fire safety audit was announced by the Department?  Western Building Systems has stated in the media that a substantial completion certificate was issued by the Department.  Is this the case?  Can the Minister confirm that the Department certified this work as being appropriate, as Western Building Systems has said?  If it did not do so, has it ever checked works independently itself or has it always relied on certificates of completion whether under the old regulation or the new regulations?  When did the appointment of clerks of works start?  I understand that only started one year ago and that it has not been done even with the new regulations.  It seems clear to met that Western Buildings Systems should be eliminated from public tendering for the moment.  The Minister is required to show significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of a public contract to do this.  There is no doubt that it has reached that threshold.  Can the Minister confirm that the Statute of Limitations is not yet in force and that there is still a period in which to sue Western Building Systems and other professionals that may well be involved in negligence here?</p></speech>

It is a bit of a baptism of fire.  It is interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies come in here and criticise the suitability of this contractor to carry out a government contract when Fianna F&aacute;il awarded the contract.

I have some questions for the Minister which come from parents of children attending Ardgillan community college who have raised them with me directly.  When will fourth years know where they are going to be accommodated?  Will they be accommodated during the works on a permanent basis?  Is the Minister going to set up and ensure that there are information sessions and a steady flow of information to parents?  How long have concerns existed regarding the community college?  Parents are concerned that perhaps officials in the Department knew about this ahead of time and that they were the last to know?  Maybe the Minister could put their minds at rest.</p></speech>

I will try to get back to them during the supplementary questions but for the purposes of the record of the House, I will lay out what has happened over recent days since I was briefed on this last Thursday.  I just want to update the House.</p>  <p> I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  Before I put the specifics on record, I assure the House that the health and safety of students and staff are of paramount importance and that any and all actions taken to date are predicated on ensuring their safety.  Ardgillan community college, Balbriggan, is a 1,000 pupil school under the patronage of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, with a current enrolment of 910 pupils.  Phase 1 of the school building was built in 2009 as a design and build contract completed on behalf of my Department by Western Building Systems.  This was followed by phase 2 in 2015, which was delivered by a different contractor.  A fire safety assessment of phase 1 was carried out and necessary works were being undertaken to remediate issues discovered during the assessment.  During the course of these works additional issues of a structural nature were identified.  Opening up works in two classrooms took place last Friday and, following an inspection by a consultant engineer on behalf of DDLETB, significant structural issues were discovered.  Having considered the engineer&rsquo;s advice, and in the interests of the health and safety of the students and staff of the school, DDLETB in consultation with my Department and school management made the decision to close phase 1 of the school building immediately.</p>  <p>  A structural assessment was carried out today at Tyrrelstown Educate Together national school and at the adjoining St Luke&rsquo;s national school.  Some of the type of issues identified in Ardgillan community college were found and both schools are being closed as a precautionary measure to allow for further detailed investigations.  This development impacts 1,200 pupils and their parents.  I am aware that there are also two cr&egrave;ches on the same site.  My Department will work closely with the school authorities in respect of interim accommodation solutions for these pupils.  The target is to have interim accommodation solutions in place for the pupils as they return to school following the mid-term break.  </p>  <p>  The Department acknowledges the disruption that school closures have on families and parents and on the students and staff of the affected school.  They will be kept fully up to date with developments.  We will have a direct line of communication from the Department for the schools.  To update the House, every school in the original bundle of 30 was contacted by the Department today.  As a result of the news this evening, the Department now intends to conduct structural assessments on all remaining schools constructed by Western Building Systems.  We are going to do structural assessments on all of them, even those built post 2014 after the building control regulations came in.  This involves some 40 schools in total.  These initial structural assessments have been commenced this week as a matter of urgency.  We will continue to do that this week and next week at a very fast rate and with great urgency.  School authorities will continue to be kept fully informed of developments.  We will also outline a timeline and chronology of the order in which schools will be contacted and assessed tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that at all times the key priority of my Department is the health and safety of students and staff.  I also want to provide assurances that every effort will be made, working closely with local authorities and communities, to identify solutions that will provide alternative accommodation for the students until matters have been resolved with their permanent school buildings.  On the question of when we seek to have students back in Ardgillan community college, we hope to have them back in the week after the mid-term break, that is Monday week.</p></speech>

Given that he has only been in the role a matter of days, he will be shocked as all of us are, regarding the developments that have directly affected 1,200 pupils and which will undoubtedly affect many more.  It is particularly shocking, and an indictment of poor construction techniques and oversight of the construction industry in the past, that children's lives are being put at risk, never mind those of the teaching faculty and management teams of those schools.  I await with interest the results in respect of the other schools that are being investigated.  I sincerely hope the Minister and the Department will be in a position to reaccommodate everybody as quickly as possible and to ensure the safety of the children across these schools.</p></speech>

The questions it raises for me do not just involve the structural assessment of the schools and the number of children and parents who are going to be displaced in their lives as a result.  Could we have a structural assessment of the system and of the use of public procurement tendering processes that put us in this place?  This is not the first competitive tendering process that has been made a hames of in the past few weeks.  We could look at broadband services, CervicalCheck, or the bus tendering process.  We need to assess the structural reasons, the hows, the whys and the conditions under which Departments sit down and say let us give this crowd such and such a contract or let us give the broadband contract to this crowd.</p><p>The criteria are obviously a whole mess.  These very expensive outcomes will cost the taxpayer, the State and ultimately the lives of children and their families.</p></speech>

I can submit them as parliamentary questions.  There is the issue of Western Building Systems, WBS, which is still looking for contracts.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has a role in procurement.  He has to show there are deficiencies in its work.  I want the Minister for Education and Skills to confirm he will say that bar has been reached and that Western Building Systems should not be getting the benefit of State contracts anymore and that it should be out.  Too much has been put up with.  This started off as very serious fire safety deficiencies and now we find there are probably more serious structural deficiencies.  That company needs to be gone and we need to get proper standards.  We need the Department of Education and Skills to inspect these projects and not just leave it to outsiders.</p></speech>

The Minister said in his response that during the course of the works in Ardgillan, additional issues of a structural nature were identified.  Can the Minister indicate when those issues were identified?  Parents are worried there was information that was known but not communicated to them.  Perhaps the Minister can provide myself and other Deputies from Fingal with a timeline of who knew what and when in order that parents' minds can be put at rest because they are concerned.  They are still sending their kids to the school.  They want to know if it is safe.</p></speech>

I met with my officials before I came into the Chamber.  I asked them to make themselves available to members of the Opposition tomorrow.  They will meet together at 10.30 a.m.  They will make contact with the Opposition spokespersons and, I suggest, the members of the education committee to do a full briefing.  This is a very serious issue.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne raised a question about WBS.  I met the Attorney General today and talked to him about future contracts.  Personally I could not stand over a situation emerging where we have two schools - I have heard some of the feedback on Ardgillan - in which there are no wall ties and wooden panels are not bolted to steel girders.  It is unacceptable that the lives of students, teachers and staff have been put at risk.  I hope that tomorrow we will have a chronological outline of which schools will be inspected next.  I am not working on the basis that it is 2009 to 2013 any more.  There is an issue with WBS.  We have to be vigilant.  There is a lot of litigation and I am advised as the Minister to be careful what I say about litigation.  I will not be careful about what I say when it comes to lives.  As a result of this decanting, many lives will be disrupted.  Parents already have very busy lives.  The most precious thing to them is obviously their children but time is also a precious thing.  We need a whole-community approach.  I implore my colleagues across the House that we try to work together on this.  There are serious questions about how we got here and how these buildings were allowed to be built in such a short period of time.  It took three months to build a two-storey to three-storey building.  These are the questions.  I will try to keep the House updated as best I can and try to keep the communication open.  My officials will be working very hard to ensure that happens.  </p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.</p></speech>

I noted that a decade had passed since the financial crisis.  In a dynamic and ever-changing global environment, the Irish economy continues to strengthen and grow.  A record number of our citizens have jobs.  Our public finances are balanced.  We have made progress and the darkest of days have passed.  The House will be aware of the many risks that remain from abroad, for example as we confront the great challenge that is Brexit, and of the many social challenges we face across our country, the needs we have to respond to in terms of shelter and housing and the further progress we need to make with regard to public services.  All of these are reasons why we need to continue to enhance the underlying strength and resilience of our economy.  In order to build this resilience, we must continue to manage our public finances responsibly and keep our tax base broad, stable and sustainable.  </p>  <p>  When I made my budget statement two weeks ago, I said budget 2019 was designed to secure our future.  It is a progressive budget with an emphasis on strengthening our national finances.  It aims to be responsible, to reflect a modern and caring Ireland and to position us well at the centre of a changing world.  Many of the changes required by the budget are contained in the Finance Bill 2018.  I will shortly set out the Bill in more detail but first I will look at some of the key themes running through it.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill delivers on our commitment to continue to make targeted changes to the income tax system within available resources and make steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden, focusing on low and middle income earners.  To ease this burden, the Bill will increase the entry point to the higher rate of income tax for all earners by &euro;750, raising it to &euro;35,300 in the case of a single worker.  The third rate of the universal social charge will be reduced from 4.75% to 4.5%.  As I said on budget day, the Government believes that workers enter the higher rate of income tax at too low a level of income.  The impact of these changes means the top marginal rate on incomes up to &euro;70,000 will be reduced to 48.5% and fewer people on incomes around the national average will have any income subject to the 40% rate of income tax.  The Bill will also provide for a modest increase in the ceiling of the second USC rate band from &euro;19,372 to &euro;19,874 to take account of changes in the minimum wage.  I am also happy to confirm an increase in the home carer credit of &euro;300.  This brings the value of the credit to &euro;1,500 per year and is expected to benefit around 85,000 working families.  For self-employed workers, the earned income credit will be increased by a further &euro;200.  To support the single affordable childcare scheme, I propose to amend section 194A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to ensure that payments to childcare providers under the scheme do not give rise to tax liabilities for the parents.  It is not my intention that payments under the scheme should give rise to tax liabilities for parents or guardians.</p><p>In the absence of any legislative relieving provisions, the payments made under the scheme would be taxable, as they are made on behalf of the parent or guardian as a contribution towards the cr&egrave;che fees.  The effect of the proposal will also be retroactive to ensure payments made under similar administrative schemes are also exempt.</p> <p> The Bill contains a number of measures relating to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, the employment and investment incentive, EII, and the start-up refunds for entrepreneurs, SURE, which seek to advance the enterprise agenda.  The take-up of KEEP has been limited and, therefore, I intend to double the ratio of share options to salary and increase the total value of options from &euro;250,000 to &euro;300,000.  The company can currently grant options to the particular employee or director up to a maximum of &euro;250,000 in any three-year period.  I propose to change while keeping the &euro;3 million overall limit for companies.  Employees will not be restricted from entering into future KEEP arrangements with future employers. </p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, I asked my Department to arrange a comprehensive review of these incentives with a focus on their efficiency and effectiveness.  Having considered the recommendations contained in the recent report by Indecon economic consultants, I propose a package of measures.  First, I propose changes to the application procedure for the incentives to a largely self-certification model.  This should address the most significant problem with the current design of the scheme relating to delays in the application process.  While primarily self-assessment, it is important to note that under the proposed new arrangements, companies may ask Revenue to confirm that they have met the requirements for general block exemption regulation compliance.  This is a fair support for many companies and investors given that they may not be familiar with EU state aid rules.</p> <p> Second, the new text also provides for a specific investor eligibility regime for investment in small enterprises through the start-up capital incentive.  In particular, and in accordance with EU state aid rules, connected persons are permitted greater freedom to invest in limited amounts in small start-ups.</p> <p> Third, the section includes a substantial consolidation and updating of the current text of Part 16 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The aim is to make the scheme more intelligible for stakeholders.  In addition, the draft brings forward a number of technical adjustments to the incentives, which seek to simplify and clarify the legislative provisions.  It also includes an anti-avoidance measure where, in the case that a holding company sells a subsidiary and the money is returned to the holding company, the holding company must return the capital to the investors immediately rather than, as at present, being able to retain the proceeds for the remainder of the four years without triggering a clawback of relief.</p> <p> Finally, in light of the substantial review just undertaken, I also propose to extend EII and SURE by an additional year to the end of 2021, which is consistent with the procedures set out in my Department's tax expenditure guidelines.  I intend that other issues raised in the lndecon report will be addressed in a subsequent finance Bill.</p> <p> In the film industry, the film tax credit acts as a stimulus to the development of an indigenous audiovisual industry to support the expression of Irish culture and the creation of high-quality employment opportunities in the State.  The relief is scheduled to end in 2020 but I propose a four-year extension of the credit until December 2024 to provide certainty to this important part of our economy.  To support the development of the sector beyond the current established hubs, I also propose to introduce, subject to state aid approval, a new, short-term regional uplift for certain productions made in areas designated under the state aid regional guidelines.  The regional uplift will commence at 5% and will be phased out over four years on a tiered basis.</p> <p> I acknowledge that income volatility is a significant difficulty for farming families and that 2018 is turning out to be a particularly difficult year.  I propose to make the income averaging scheme available to a greater range of farms.  Income averaging allows eligible farmers to calculate their taxable income as the average of their income in the current year and the previous four years, on a rolling basis, thus smoothing their tax liability over a five-year period.  I propose to extend the income averaging scheme to farmers with self-employed, off-farm income farmers whose spouses have self-employed, off-farm income, with averaging only applying in respect of farm profits, to ensure its availability to the entire sector.  In addition, the Bill renews for a further three years the 25% general stock relief on income tax, the 50% stock relief on income tax for registered farm partnerships and the 100% stack relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers.</p> <p> Before I move on to other sections, I wish to address our commitment to the ongoing process of international tax reform.  In budget 2019, I announced the introduction of two new measures from the anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD, namely, an ATAD-compliant tax regime and new controlled foreign company, CFC, rules, which are designed to prevent the artificial diversion of profits to offshore entities in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.  The new ATAD-compliant tax regime will impose a charge to tax at 12.5% on unrealised gains where companies migrate or transfer assets offshore in order that they leave the scope of Irish tax.  It replaces a pre-existing focused anti-avoidance exit charge with a new, broad-based exit tax.  The introduction of both these measures, in addition to the commitments to further action set out in the corporation tax roadmap published in September, clearly demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that Ireland's tax regime is stable, legitimate and transparent, to support continuing investment and job creation in the State.</p> <p> I wish to outline key elements of the Bill, although Deputies will appreciate that in the limited time available, it will not be possible to cover every section.  Part 1 deals with the universal social charge, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.</p> <p> Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, deal with the income tax measures I have outlined.</p> <p> Section 9 extends the benefit-in-kind, BIK, exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.  Having regard to value for money and tax equity considerations, it also applies a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption such that an electric vehicle with an original market value exceeding this limit will be subject to BIK taxation on the amount in excess of &euro;50,000.  </p> <p> Under section 14, I propose amending section 205A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to extend the same tax treatment for awards under the restorative justice process to women who were resident in institutions associated with the Magdalen laundries.</p> <p> Section 15 is a technical amendment, while section 16 introduces new accelerated capital allowances for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment, which I signalled in my Budget Statement.</p> <p> Section 17 amends and commences a relief, introduced last year in Finance Bill 2017, subject to a commencement order, which allows a benefit to employers who incur capital costs on equipment or buildings used for the purposes of providing childcare services or fitness facilities to employees.</p> <p> Section 20 relates to the relief available to certain start-up companies in their first three years of trading.  Following a review performed by my Department, I will extend the relief for a further three years to 31 December 2021.</p> <p>  Section 21 proposes that the amount of interest paid in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair a residential property that may be deducted by landlords will be increased to 100% from 1 January 2019.  This change is an acceleration of the rate of the restoration of the full value of this relief.</p> <p> Section 23 relates to ELI and SURE, section 24 deals with film relief and section 25 deals with CFCs, which I outlined earlier.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>Section 28 amends section 603A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Broadly, this provides relief from capital gains tax on the transfer of a site by a parent or civil partner to a child of the parent or a child of the civil partner, where the transfer is to enable the child to construct his or her principal private residence on the site.  The section is being amended to allow both a child and his or her spouse or civil partner to benefit from the relief available under the section.</p> <p> Section 31 amends the definition of a "sugar sweetened drink" to ensure that certain categories of beverages will be subject to sugar sweetened drinks tax where they do not meet a minimum calcium content of 119 mg per 100 ml.  The amendment fulfils the commitment made to the European Commission as part of the formal EU state aid notification process for sugar-sweetened drinks tax.</p> <p> Section 32 confirms the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax and minimum excise duty for cigarettes in support of public health policy.  Section 33 provides for an increase in the rate of betting duty and betting intermediary duty with effect from 1 January 2019.  The rate of betting duty is increased from 1% to 2% for bookmakers and remote bookmakers while betting intermediary duty is increased from 15% to 25%.</p> <p> Section 35 provides for a vehicle registration tax, VRT, surcharge of 1% on diesel cars in recognition of growing air pollution concerns from pollutants emitted in high amounts by diesel vehicles.  Section 37 extends the VRT relief for hybrid electric vehicles until 31 December 2019 in support of climate change policy.</p> <p> Section 41 gives effect to the budget increase in the VAT rate applying to tourism activities, with services and goods currently applying at 9% increasing to 13.5% from 1 January 2019, with the exception of newspapers and sports facilities.  This section also provides for a reduction in VAT on digital publications from 23% to 9%.</p> <p> Section 46 provides for the extension for a further three years to 31 December 2021 of the young trained farmers' stamp duty relief which I announced in budget 2019.  This extension must be notified to the EU authorities and is therefore being made subject to a commencement order.  This section also contains amendments to ensure a number of stamp duty related provisions in the legislation comply with EU state aid regulations and reflect current practice.</p> <p> Section 47 provides for taxpayers having a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against a decision made by Revenue in relation to a claim for a repayment of stamp duty which is not currently provided for in the legislation.  Part 5 of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax, CAT, and includes section 50 which amends the dwelling house exemption to ensure that properties which have been placed in a discretionary trust are brought within the assessment criteria for determining if the beneficiary meets the conditions to qualify for the exemption.</p> <p> Section 51 addresses my budget announcement to increase the group A tax-free threshold which applies to gifts and inheritances from parents to their children from &euro;310,000 to &euro;320,000.  This will apply to gifts or inheritances received on or after 10 October.</p> <p> Part 6 of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters and here I want to mention that section 53 makes a number of technical amendments to facilitate the operation of the tax appeals process.</p> <p> As is customary with the Finance Bill, there are still a small number of matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage and, of course, I will also consider any suggestions put forward during our debate over the next couple of days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300040#NN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2018.  At the outset, it is worth reminding ourselves what the passing of the Finance Bill means.  Along with the Social Welfare Bill, it ensures financial stability over the next 12 months.  Indeed, it was with that same purpose that Fianna F&aacute;il approached discussions for this third budget under the confidence and supply arrangement.  As in 2016 in the aftermath of the election we recognised that Ireland needed political stability to properly face a more politically unstable world.  If we were to have the instability that Sinn F&eacute;in crave we, as a country, would be in no position to have our voices heard in Brexit negotiations.  There would be nobody to articulate the Irish perspective on this crucial period in European history.  I am left questioning whether this is its preferred position as it fails to take responsibility in the Northern Ireland Assembly, fails to take responsibility in Westminster and fails to take responsibility here, as in 2016.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il does not shirk its responsibility.  This budget was certainly not one that we would have written and it is fair to say it is not one we wholly agree with, but it is one where we had an impact, an effect and delivered a change in direction.  This budget has followed the previous two budgets in that it is broadly progressive.  Under this budget, the burden is lightened for those less well off.  This is as it should be and it stands in stark contrast to the successive regressive budgets imposed under the last Government that were so decisively rejected in the election of 2016.</p>  <p>  Core to that progressivity and consequently to the confidence and supply arrangement is the principle that available Exchequer funds should be split two to one in favour of investment in vital public services over tax cuts.  The reality has been that for the last two budgets the ratio has been closer to three to one and this budget has been more like four to one.  This is a far cry from the budget of 2016 which was opportunistic in nature and designed to woo the electorate.  The electorate was having none of it for it knew the country was crying out for investment in public services and that the recovery was not being felt by all.</p>  <p>  From a fiscal perspective, the situation has undoubtedly improved but it would be a huge mistake to assume we are out of the woods.  Key vulnerabilities exist.  We are still running a deficit despite where the economy is in the business cycle which is a risky strategy by any measure.  Two thirds of the adjustments required were put in place by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Ever since, the final third has proved elusive for this Government.  We are still projected to borrow money next year to pay for the services the public requires despite the fast pace of economic growth and the extraordinary explosion on corporation tax receipts.</p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Fianna F&aacute;iI called for the establishment of the rainy day fund.  I welcome the legislation published earlier today and we will engage constructively to ensure the legislation gets through efficiently.  When the next downturn comes, we do not want to see tax increases and cuts in public services to be the only option on the table.  We do not want to be in a position where the Government of the day raids private pensions.  A sound fiscal policy based on balanced budgets and an appropriately funded rainy day fund will offer flexibility in those future circumstances.</p>  <p>  There are those in this House who offer an alternative - spend more and ignore all the economists and economic commentators by not establishing a rainy day fund.  With a national debt of over &euro;200 billion, nearly &euro;43,000 per household this is downright irresponsible.  What would Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party do in the event of a downturn?  Would they turn to the international markets?  This week we have seen the market reaction to Italy&rsquo;s policy.  Would they run to Europe for help again?  I fear this would fall on deaf ears.  Unquestionably, their policy to borrow more now and to leave no fiscal buffer whatsoever would leave Ireland hugely exposed.  Put simply, they would have to raise taxes and cut spending.  This, in effect, is what they are calling for.</p>  <p>  Brexit continues to be the most serious challenge Ireland faces.  The prolonged political turmoil and the political uncertainty that has come with it remains a dark shadow over Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects.  We are now almost five months from Brexit and yet we are no clearer on whether an agreement will be reached and what that agreement will entail.  We support the Government in their negotiations and we hope the best deal possible can be achieved come March 2019.  It is critical that a hard border is not established on this island and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected.  However, I have serious concerns about the Government&rsquo;s readiness at home and it would be remiss of me and my party to simply ignore them.</p>  <p>  The Government deceived itself and others that the backstop was guaranteed and that Northern Ireland would be protected.  Instead of engaging with opposite numbers in the UK and Northern Ireland, the Government chose to go on an all-out spin offensive.</p><p>The result has left Ireland and Irish businesses dangerously exposed.  We now know that only a third of the required customs officials will be operating by 29 March 2019.  This is based on a transitional arrangement which is growing more unlikely by the day.  The Government will not tell us exactly how many officials will be needed if a no-deal Brexit were to become a reality.  Businesses up and down the country are crying out for support but the Government has failed to hear them.  We regularly hear announcements about Brexit support schemes, but precious little follows.  For the much lauded Brexit loan scheme only ten companies have reached the sanction at finance provider stage.  Only 127 companies have availed of the "Be Prepared" grants from Enterprise Ireland, and 160 have received Intertrade Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit readiness vouchers.  Only 47 market discovery grants have been issued by Enterprise Ireland, and most shockingly of all, given the vulnerability of the agri-food sector, the low-cost loan scheme for farmers and fishermen, announced last year, has not even been established.  It shows that the Government is not supporting business.  It has announced many initiatives and we acknowledge that, but those schemes have failed to deliver any significant impact.  The schemes that do get established are overly burdensome and complex.  Many businesses simply do not have the resources or the time to apply for them.  The Government needs to address this matter urgently.</p> <p> While Fianna F&aacute;il entered into the confidence and supply arrangement to provide stability it would be a lie and it would be disingenuous to suggest that it has been plain sailing.  The crises in housing and health continue to be stains on our society, with thousands of people homeless, including children, and tens of thousands lying on hospital waiting lists.  Housing is the key test for this budget and this Government.  Instead of focussing on glossy reports and fancy announcements the Government simply needs to build social and affordable housing.  The dire record of Fine Gael on the provision of adequate affordable housing for citizens must be put right.  Now is the time for real ambition and genuine delivery.  The &euro;60 million announced to tackle the homelessness crisis is welcome, but is belated.  We should not have to wait until almost 4,000 children are homeless before action is taken.  Local authorities must be given far more autonomy to build social housing.  The cutting of red tape should help in that regard.  Young people aspiring to settle down and have kids are finding it harder and harder to get on the housing ladder.  The &euro;100 million fund for the building of affordable housing will help, but as always with this Government, implementation is key.</p> <p> Turning to the Finance Bill, it is regrettable and short-sighted that we have seen little movement on private landlords.  They are leaving the market in their droves; some 2,000 were lost this year alone, meaning at least 2,000 houses are lost to the system at a time of grave urgency and crisis.  There is no move in this Bill on mortgage interest relief for landlords who facilitate long-term leases.  I will engage with the Government to bring in such amendments at Committee Stage.</p> <p> On health, we welcome the further funding given to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, but it must be said that it is modest when compared to the crisis we face.  As public expenditure spokesperson I have to highlight the long-term funding issues facing the health Vote.  For the past number of years we have seen the HSE demand extra funding to stand still, a fraction of that amount being offered on budget day, followed by overspending the following year and a subsequent supplemental payment for health at the end of the year.  This carousel approach to budgeting will have a detrimental impact on the state of our health services for decades to come.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report sets out a sustainable pathway forward for our public health service, yet the Government has failed to give it the backing it needs.  Without financial foundation I fear the Sl&aacute;intecare report will not do what it says on the tin.</p> <p> The confidence and supply arrangement clearly states that cuts to the universal social charge ought to be directed at low and middle income earners.  This was in recognition that low and middle income earners were not feeling the recovery the Government was telling them was happening.  The changes made this year are modest but when added together to the changes in the previous two budgets they are more significant.  I acknowledge that without indexing our tax system almost 80,000 workers will face a natural tax increase next year.  The marginal band needs to be changed in recognition of that fact.  However, the increases in the home carer and earned income tax credit could be more generous.  Progress has been made, but I feel it is time that the self-employed are given an equal credit to PAYE workers in recognition of the risk they take.  I would prefer to see a &euro;2,000 home carer&rsquo;s credit in recognition of the huge services they provide to children and those living with disabilities.  The income tax changes taken together are modest but they are necessary to keep our tax system competitive.</p> <p> Keeping our competitiveness in mind, our small businesses and enterprises need far more support.  I have spoken already about how exposed our SMEs are to the impacts of Brexit.  There are similar problems when it comes to enterprise taxes.  There has been no movement yet again on capital gains tax, CGT, for entrepreneurs.  Our CGT rate of 33% is far in excess of our main competitors, so much so that businesses and SMEs are struggling to get the credit and finance they require to grow and create jobs.  The take up of the employment incentive and investment scheme, EIIS, and the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, has fallen far short of where it needs to be.  I welcome the changes in the Finance Bill in this regard, but I wonder if these changes tackle the complexity of these schemes.  We commit to working with the members of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to make sure that the changes we make to the KEEP and EIIS schemes help in that regard.  I welcome the extension of the tax relief for start-up companies until the end of 2021.</p> <p> I must take the opportunity to highlight the lack of movement on the exit tax both in the budget and the Finance Bill.  Typically the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate was linked to the exit tax rate on the early extraction of pension funds.  While I understand and acknowledge the need for an exit tax I do believe it is unfair to overly tax such extractions, especially when money is needed for serious health expenses for an individual or loved one.  I urge the Minister to look at this and at the very least to equalise the exit tax with DIRT.</p> <p> The Minister announced on budget day that he was increasing the betting tax from 1% to 2% on amounts wagered in the State and that the betting duty on the commission earned by betting intermediaries will be increased from 15% to 25%.  Healthy gambling is enjoyed by thousands of people around the country, but it would be wrong to ignore the fact that gambling addiction is a serious blight on our society.  In this light I encourage the Government to look at independent bookmakers who will be put under real pressure because of this change.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to deal with problem gambling and its delay in bringing in any meaningful regulation in this regard must be addressed.  The gambling control Bill passed way back in 2013 has yet to be implemented.  If this Government is serious about problem gambling it would put the right regulation in place to tackle the problem.</p> <p> Climate change is the challenge of our generation.  Ireland cannot relinquish its responsibility in this regard.  We signed up to the Paris Agreement and are accountable to European regulations.  Sadly, this Government will see the targets outlined in both missed by quite a long way.  It is shameful that the national development plan was not climate proofed before it was published.  I am disappointed that the Government has not done more work on carbon tax.  In the context of imminent announcements from Bord na M&oacute;na on the progress made on its decarbonisation programme and job losses in the midlands region which will affect families and whole communities, the Government cannot sit on its hands and do nothing.  I have written to the Taoiseach about this matter, requesting that he set up a just, sustainable forum for the area, funded from the carbon tax take and possibly by funding from the EU, which can distribute funds where over 500 jobs are lost in a region, to help and assist the stakeholders involved and the communities affected, the representatives of those communities and the relevant Departments.  We have to ensure that there are alternatives, that innovation and enterprise is rewarded and that those regions have a future in a decarbonised world via the provision of alternative forms of energy, which the midlands has been synonymous with for many years.  While I acknowledge that increasing carbon tax would essentially increase the cost of motoring, we cannot simply ignore it.  We need to agree a path forward similar to Sl&aacute;intecare on how to address this fundamental challenge.  The benefit in kind extension for electric vehicles and the charging of those vehicles is welcome.  However, I must ask the Minister why a cap of &euro;50,000 on the original market value was put in place.  The only viable electric cars on the market currently are expensive by their very nature and I fear that this change will leave many with no alternative but to get rid of their electric vehicles.</p> <p> The mortgage arrears crisis continues to be a major issue facing thousands of families across the country.</p><p>Banks in response to pressure from the ECB are selling their distressed loans to vulture funds.  The Government seems to think this is the only solution to the mortgage arrears crisis.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Banks should not be outsourcing their dirty work to vultures.  Instead, they should be working through their loan books.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has been particularly active in this regard.  Our Bill to establish a mortgage resolution office still requires a money message from the Government.  This Bill would remove the bank veto.  We introduced legislation to regulate vulture funds.  I acknowledge the Government's support for this Bill and the work done by officials in the Department of Finance.  My point, however, is that there is not simply one solution to mortgage arrears.  By putting in place modern and fair laws to deal with mortgage arrears, we will provide sustainable solutions to genuine arrears cases leaving strategic defaulters at the mercy of the courts.</p> <p> The Government has done precious little when it comes to high mortgage interest rates.  Its response has been the same as always, the market will sort it out.  The market, however, has not sorted it.  Irish customers pay higher interest rates than Greek customers.  I refuse to believe an Irish mortgage is more risky than a Greek mortgage.  Caps have been imposed in many eurozone countries and the sky has not fallen in.  No progress has been made to ban cash-back offers, which serve to only cloud the judgment of customers.</p> <p> No movement has been made to better enable credit unions, either individually or collectively, to enter the mortgage market to introduce much-needed competition in this area.  An Post is planning to enter the market, which is to be welcomed, but I fear this will be to the detriment of the credit union sector.  No movement has been made in establishing special purpose vehicles to enable the credit union movement to invest in social and affordable housing.  The Government has relinquished all responsibility for such an initiative, apart from allowing them to create their own vehicles as one credit union body is in the process of doing.  Credit unions offer essential services to local communities in towns and villages across the country.  Their viability and future is paramount to vibrant communities.  Many of these credit unions will fail, however, if they are not allowed to lend on a longer more profitable basis.  This will be yet another blow to rural Ireland.</p> <p> The explosion of corporation tax receipts, while positive in the short term, represents an ever increasing risk to the Exchequer.  If just a handful of major companies change their structures and move activity and assets out of Ireland, the State will lose billions of euro in tax revenue.  On another front, we have to be prepared to protect our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  We must resist European efforts to establish a digital tax and a common consolidated corporate tax base proposal.  However, we must engage and co-operate with both our European and OECD colleagues to ensure there is fair and transparent global tax regime whereby companies cannot hide tax revenue in tax havens.  In this context, I welcome our co-operation with the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  I acknowledge the changes made in this Finance Bill in this regard.</p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has consistently highlighted the significant issues facing the Tax Appeals Commission and the backlog in appeals.  An open and transparent tax appeals regime is crucial for businesses.  We need a consistent and fair tax system.  It is vital the issues in the Tax Appeals Commission are tackled and the backlog is reduced.</p> <p> In increasing the VAT rate for the tourism sector, the Government put many companies around the country under pressure.  While Dublin-based hotels are booming, the same cannot be said for many outside the city.  I urge the Government to look at supports for that sector to ensure these VAT changes do not represent the death knell for these smaller establishments.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has honoured its side of the confidence and supply arrangement.  We will not vote for this budget but we will facilitate its passage.  This budget is fairer because of confidence and supply and the influence that Fianna F&aacute;il has had on it.  We need action now from the Government in the area of housing and health, as well as no more spin but real action.  We will engage constructively on Committee Stage with all Members in order to tackle some of the issues outlined.  We look forward to bringing forward amendments and discussing them and others on Committee Stage in order that we arrive at a conclusion which will have the effect we desire for our State.</p></speech>

He is never one to try and stick the boot in although it is acknowledged by the Government that Sinn F&eacute;in is being proactive and supportive in this regard.  I remember he was one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Members who voted in its last Ard-Fheis for an electronic and frictionless Border with automatic logging of all trade between Ireland, the North and Britain.  This is very much akin to Jacob Rees-Mogg's and Theresa May's plans that everybody else throughout Europe has criticised.  Maybe Deputy Cowen is more in line with his party's councillor from Louth who has been calling publicly for a hard border.  Sometimes, it is hard to figure out which way Fianna F&aacute;il is blowing on these issues.  One thing for sure is that they will try and stick the boot into somebody, despite the ramifications Brexit could have on my constituency, the Border counties and the entire island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  As usual, our hands are tied with the Finance Bill because of the prohibition of putting down substantial amendments that may have a cost on the Exchequer.  That archaic ruling, based on the Constitution and Standing Orders, needs to be removed to ensure the Finance Bill debate can become a real one.  We should be allowed to put down substantial amendments, which will not be ruled out of order, and discuss them to improve and strengthen the legislation.</p>  <p>  This was a bad budget.  It is not what Ireland needs at this point and reinforces the mistakes made over the past several years by eroding the tax income base while other sustainable avenues for revenue, such as wealth, profits and higher incomes, were not tapped into.  In the meantime, the books are balanced only by what everybody recognises as temporary, namely, corporation tax receipts.  There was nothing of significance in the budget that screamed that it was for a country facing the uncertainty of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Much of what we have seen with this budget is similar to what happened during the Charlie McCreevy era.  Deputy Cowen should look at what happened at that time.  We had to take lectures from Fianna F&aacute;il about responsibility this evening.  This is the party that used to give standing ovations to its Minister of Finance as he cut the legs from under people, cut the blind pension, sent countless families to airports to say good-bye to their emigrating sons and daughters and destroyed the potential of local communities.  That is the responsibility on which the Deputy lectured me today.</p>  <p>  Did we have a rainy day fund in the time of Fianna F&aacute;il?  Yes, it was called the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Did we have balanced books and surpluses?  Yes we did and we will have the same in the next several years.  Did we cut income taxes at that point in time?  Yes we did, just as we are doing now.  Did the total amount of income tax actually increase year-on-year during that period?  Yes it did just as it is now.  Did we have an unreliable tax base that was balancing the books and creating a surplus?  Yes.  It was stamp duty then; now, it is corporation tax.  That is why what is happening now is similar to what happened in the past.  The crisis will never present itself in the exact same way but there are serious questions as to what we are doing in this Finance Bill by following the mistakes of the past.</p>  <p>  There was nothing in this budget which showed we learned from our past mistakes.  There was nothing in this budget for renters, the low paid or those living week to week.  Income tax and USC cuts this year will amount to &euro;284 million.  That is &euro;284 million that the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il say is not needed for our health services, childcare or building houses for those who are homeless or on the waiting lists.  In the three Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael confidence and supply budgets, &euro;750 million in tax cuts have been made to the most sustainable type of tax we have.</p><p>At the same time, we know that countless citizens are crying out for investment.  Whether in home care packages, health or education, they are looking for investment.  What seems to be the trend over recent years is to hollow out the tax base.  There is an inaccurate idea that everybody got &euro;5 a week but that is not really what happened.  The truth is that the low or average-paid worker was lucky if he or she got anything.  The Government's own figures published on budget day recognised this fact.  They state that a single worker on &euro;20,000 per year will receive &euro;14 over a year as a result of the tax changes.  This is far from &euro;5 per week.  A worker earning &euro;30,000 will receive &euro;39 a year, which is not even &euro;1 a week.  A self-employed married person on &euro;70,000 will gain &euro;15 a week.  Some gain in one week what others will not even gain in a full year.</p> <p> What logic is used to decide that workers on &euro;175,000 need &euro;589 more in their pay while a worker on &euro;18,000 does not get one extra cent, as rents multiply and insurance goes through the roof?  This is the truth behind the budget and how the spoils have been dished out by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  These figures tell us what we need to know about the budget.  It is more of the same.  It is tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest, while public services suffer without the necessary investment.</p> <p> We know tax cuts can prove to be very popular in terms of votes.  If we need a reminder of this it is Fine Gael's posters on abolishing the USC.  I am sure it has them in storage somewhere, like the nonsense perpetrated during the general election.  Fianna F&aacute;il was no better.  It wanted to get rid of 90% of the USC.  The Labour Party just followed suit and went to 80% of the USC, which would take more than &euro;5 billion out of our tax base.  It was crazy stuff.  Now we know that plan is gone and we have another plan, which is to merge the USC with PRSI.  There are very strong arguments, and all of the international evidence would suggest we are weak in terms of PRSI, but where is the plan?  There was not even a paper published at budget time.  Any requests we have with regard to freedom of information are refused because of the budgetary timeframe.  It appears there is no coherence or vision and it is just blind cuts year after year, sniping away at the tax base, just like Fianna F&aacute;il did during the Charlie McCreevy era.</p> <p> There are some positives in the Bill that I want to acknowledge.  One of these is the further progress for the self-employed credit but the Minister needs to make up his mind on whether they deserve equality.  The idea the Government is dragging this out for another year is simply not on.  These employees should have got equal treatment and this should have been equalised in 2019.</p> <p> The headline budget change this year is on VAT and restoring profitable sectors to pre-crisis rates of taxation makes sense.  I wish to distinguish the hotel sector and raise a very grave concern about how this increase is being passed on by some businesses.  I will start with this latter concern.  Having been contacted by a number of employees, I believe the VAT increase is not being passed on to the customer but instead is being applied to workers' wages.  Let me be clear about how this is working.  It is completely unacceptable and probably illegal.  I urge the Minister to back me in a call for businesses not to try to use the VAT increase to cut employees' wages.  The VAT rate must be applied to services and that is it.  If a company can absorb the cost by reducing its prices so be it but this cannot be at the expense of workers who, for example, are paid mainly on a commission based on that price.  It is scandalous abuse and cannot be tolerated.  These are very low-paid workers part of whose wages is made up of commission.  It is post-VAT commission so they are now taking a reduction in their wages but are doing exactly the same work because the 4.5% increase in VAT is an increase of nearly 50% in their sector.</p> <p> On hotels, the Minister knows I have long argued for the removal of the special rate.  I first proposed this two years ago.  The question needs to be asked as to how many hundreds of millions has the State forgone because it hesitated on this proposal.  The price reduction was never passed on to customers in the hotel sector and the Department's report shows this very clearly.  Hotels in Dublin, Cork and Galway are extremely full by any international standards and the revenue per available room metric shows Irish hotels are among the busiest and most lucrative in Europe.  Of course, I am very familiar, coming from Donegal and the western region, that not every hotel is in the same position but this ongoing subsidy is not justified and should not have been justified last year or the year before.  The Government hesitated on this and it should not have done so.</p> <p> Where I differ with the Minister is that I believe the increase should have been limited to the hotel sector.  Lumping in restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and others was wrong.  It was the wrong thing to do to increase those sectors to 13.5%.  There is no justification for a 50% increase in VAT on these services.  The Minister went too far on this issue and that will cause a lot of pain to those sectors and may cause job losses.  It is far too sudden and too steep a change for these sectors to take place in one year.</p> <p> Major changes to the flexibility granted by the EU on VAT rates and applications are, hopefully, coming down the line and they need to be used.  This will present a huge opportunity to recast our VAT system in a more socially oriented way, such as looking at zero rating for mountain rescue equipment, defibrillators, and adult bike helmets to name just a few.  I had the opportunity to attend the BUMBLEance when it came to Donegal and a number of Deputies were there.  Unfortunately, and fortunately, one of my close family members has reason to use it over and over and it has been a great help to the family.  It is funded by voluntary contributions and people are out cycling the length and breadth of Ireland and rattling buckets.  It is unacceptable that the State takes a lot of the donations raised to buy these ambulances and kit them out.  We need to look at the changes and flexibility coming from the EU and make sure we are more socially oriented in how we deal with our VAT system.</p> <p> This is another year when we see the Finance Bill promise to do its best to clean up Ireland's reputation when it comes to its role in international tax systems, but it is another year with another failure.  The main element of this failure is that yet again the exit tax, despite Government spin, is something we are legally obliged to implement.  I see no logic as to why the 12.5% rate was chosen.  It is the rate applied to profits while what we are speaking about is capital gains, which are normally charged at 33%.  I accept the old exit tax was not fit for purpose but it seems the Minister cannot let any opportunity pass without adding just a little bit of Irish exceptionalism for corporations.  The same goes for the implementation of the multilateral convention under the BEPS programme, a step we were obliged to take but where the minimalist approach was taken by opting out of article 12.  This pattern is undeniable.  It is why the Government opposes public country-by-country reporting, why we are appealing the Apple case decision and why the Minister simply refuses to do the sensible thing and include pre-2015 onshored assets under the 80% cap he introduced last year.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, made a disastrous decision when he raised the cap to 100%, effectively allowing corporations write off all of their profits.  The Minister has closed the barn door at bit but refuses to clean up the mess.  What this policy position alone puts at stake is &euro;750 million.  This is &euro;750 million that could be on the cards each year for houses, flood defences, roads and rail, except Fine Gael and its partners in Fianna F&aacute;il will not tax these billions of assets.  This is shameful.</p> <p> The Minister will note I referred to capital spending because I accept the corporation tax bonanza will not last forever.  Using these windfalls for infrastructure is the logical thing to do while they are here.  It was reported yesterday that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council will increase its warnings about using one-off funds for permanent spending.  It is right because Fine Gael refuses to raise taxes or make savings so we enter another year of fantasy budgeting.  We had it last year when we had the major hole that was clearly recognised.  I pointed it out, as did the chief executive officer of the HSE within weeks of the budget, and the Government buried its head in the sand.  If corporation tax receipts do collapse, the Minister cannot say he was not warned by this side of the House or the other bodies that have flagged the issue.</p><p>Rents are now at record levels, as are waiting lists for housing.  The scales of supply and demand are weighted heavily on one side, yet the budget and the Finance Bill help landlords.  Indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il has argued that the Government did not go far enough and should do more to help landlords.  What type of analysis is behind such a move?  Every week, we see scandalous instances of landlords renting smaller and smaller spaces for higher and higher prices.  The refrain is that not all landlords do so, but at this point it is renters who need a break rather than landlords.  My biggest problem with the 100% mortgage interest relief for landlords is that there are no conditions attached to it.  A landlord is already entitled to 100% relief if he or she takes in a social housing tenant but that incentive will be eclipsed.  There should be strict rules on prices, tenants' rights and security but instead the budget threw money at a group of people who control all of the pieces.  The alternative proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in is to bring in rent relief equivalent to one month of rent for all renters not already subsidised by the State.  For that to work, there would need to be a rent freeze.  There needs to be a rent freeze anyway, but actual relief is also needed by renters at a time of sky-high rents.  That should be the headline measure of the budget rather than an unconditional, unlimited tax break for landlords as rents spiral out of control.</p> <p> On betting tax, like the VAT rate change for hotels I welcome in principle the adoption of another Sinn F&eacute;in position through its increase.  In 2008, the then Minister for Finance announced an increase of the betting tax to 2% but that was never put into effect.  There were issues with that proposal and there are issues with the current increase.  I strongly disagree with how the Government is raising the tax.  A simple jump to 2% will hurt smaller local bookmakers.  Their concerns are not exaggerated and this measure threatens jobs.  I have met several such bookmakers and examined their accounts.  It is clear that the 1% increase will wipe out their profits and their customers will move to larger operators.  Betting is a vice which does enormous damage to our society and it should be taxed to reflect that fact.  For several years, I have proposed that the tax be increased to 3% but insisted that it be paid by punters.  The rate is crucial, as is it being a tax on winnings and paid by the punter.  If that were done, every bookmaker would be equally affected and the larger dominant market players could not simply absorb the cost, thus giving themselves another edge over local independent bookies.  It would also mean that betting duty would cover the cost of the horse and greyhound fund, which must currently be topped up from general taxation.  I am sure this will be considered in detail on Committee Stage.  In a way, the change is the worst of both worlds.  It is small enough to be absorbed by Paddy Power and similar bookmakers and large enough to ensure disaster for small bookmakers in remote rural areas.  I urge the Minister to consider this on Committee Stage.  Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to the proposal.</p> <p> I was deeply disappointed that no changes are proposed to the rules regarding bailed out banks.  The banks are entering a period of high profitability but because of built-up losses the rules allow them to do so tax free.  Ireland is almost unique in the OECD in having neither a time limit nor a cap on losses which the banks are allowed to carry forward to write off profit.  This situation is not acceptable in the context of the damage done by the banks.  They want a return to normality regarding bankers' bonuses and pay but will not tolerate a return to a normal tax situation whereby profits are taxed.  That must not go on for the planned ten or 20 years.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal is to bring in a 25% cap, which would recoup &euro;175 million for the State this year and every year until the losses are exhausted.  It is a huge missed opportunity.  The Minister commissioned a report on the back of the Finance Act 2017, which showed that a potential drop in value of the State's shares in the banks would be more than offset by the recurring value of the taxes raised.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Government has not dealt with this or considered the banking levy.</p> <p> I wish to mention a number of other issues but I am running out of time.  On small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, I note the changes to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, scheme.  That should be scrutinised on Committee Stage.  I am disappointed that the research and development tax credit, which should be changed, is not addressed in the Bill.  It disproportionately benefits large corporations.  Some 167 of the large divisions benefit by &euro;543 million while more than 1,300 other companies only claimed &euro;127 million.  The credit should have been increased to 30% for SMEs and reduced to 20% for larger divisions.  A scheme similar to that in operation in the North should have been introduced, whereby SMEs can avail of the credit and have easier access to it.  I will revisit the matter on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300044#RR00200"><p>There are several specific points I wish to raise on the technical detail of the Bill but before I do so, I wish to address the rainy day fund.  The Labour Party is at pains to understand the necessity for such a fund.  We are wondering if it was conjured up to make Fianna F&aacute;il look fiscally responsible and whether it is a Fianna F&aacute;il tool or a Fine Gael tool and we seek more transparency and openness in that regard.  While the fund may appear prudent, taking &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is just a change on paper.  It is not new money.  We would like to know where the new fund will be invested and whether it is simply a bailout fund for the banks.  The Labour Party has argued that the money should be invested in affordable housing and to bring about real social recovery.  I had hoped the Minister would give greater detail about the rainy day fund, how it will come into being and whether it will specifically be dealt with in the context of the Bill.</p>  <p>  In regard to action on climate change, Members are now well versed in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  I was hopeful that between the Minister's speech on budget day and the publication of the Bill, we would see some real and meaningful action on climate change.  We cannot ignore the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council regarding taxes on carbon and mitigating that in such a way as to ensure that those at risk of fuel poverty or dependent on the fuel allowance would benefit from certain allowances in that regard.  We cannot continue to ignore climate change and we need some real policy interventions that result in drastic changes in human behaviour.  That must start this year, particularly in the context of the IPCC report.  I am pleased that members of the panel will soon address the Joint Committee on Climate Action because it is important that we hear from them regarding radical proposals that we would like to see coming from Government.  My party and perhaps others in this House would support such measures if they were forthcoming or that the Government would take seriously certain interventions proposed by a committee or by Members of the House.  We cannot afford to let another fiscal year go by without making some real interventions or policy changes on this issue.</p>  <p>  On the universal social charge, USC, a worker on the living wage of &euro;24,500 will gain a little more than &euro;20 a year from the changes to USC but a person earning &euro;70,500, or three times more, will gain &euro;126, or six times the tax cut.  This matter will be fully discussed on Committee Stage.  Four out of five workers will gain nothing from the changes but the highest earners will gain up to &euro;130 per year.  When one combines the USC and income tax cuts, a person on &euro;70,500 or three times the living wage of &euro;24,500 will benefit from a level of tax reduction 14 times greater than will a person on the living wage.  The squeezed middle has been completely ignored in that conundrum, so it was not really a budget for that grouping in that context.  </p><p>It was a budget for those on higher incomes.  </p> <p>   The cut in USC and the move with regard to income tax thresholds will cost approximately &euro;284 million.  Every Member in this House could have thought of very good ways to spend &euro;284 million in terms of delivering better public services, not to mention much more economical steps we could have taken to deliver concrete benefits to the people who need it most.  For example, free-of-charge school books at primary and secondary level would have cost &euro;40 million while paying all public sector workers a living wage might have cost &euro;39.3 million so we would argue that it was not a solid budgetary decision.  </p> <p>  The home care tax credit is good for those with incomes but not all carers will benefit equally from a tax credit approach.  Direct services, like respite care, would be fairer and arguably more useful for many carers.  Section 8 rightly removes accommodation and healthcare from being treated as taxable benefits-in-kind for members of the Defence Forces.  This is something we welcome.  We would like a closer interrogation of that measure on Committee Stage.  </p> <p> Section 22 rightly removes the rent-a-room tax relief from short-term lettings such as Airbnb without affecting relief for student digs as well as regular lettings.  We have a proposal to support microbreweries.  We have put forward an amendment for the benefit of the Minister's officials that would amend section 78A of the Finance Act 2003, which involves relief for small breweries.  Section 78A of the Finance Act 2003 would be amended in subsection (1)(a) by substituting "60,000 hectolitres" for "40,000 hectolitres".  This would not increase the alcohol tax rebate such breweries can claim but it would allow them a greater output while still being classed as microbreweries.  The EU permits up to 200,000 hl for microbreweries so we are well inside the limits by going from 40,000 hl to 60,000 hl. </p> <p> Section 25 introduces the controlled foreign company rules, as required by the EU Council Directive 2016/1164 - ATAD.  This is an example of how the EU is rightly moving to reduce aggressive tax avoidance practices across the Union.  The ATAD, along with the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, show how countries are coming to grips with tax avoidance by multinational companies.  We openly acknowledge that Ireland is complying with these new rules and has co-operated with the OECD process as well and so it should.  However, we must also think about what this means for Ireland in the medium term.  Are we ready to replace our reliance on foreign direct investment with the next phase of our economic development?  What is that phase and are we ready?  I would argue that we are not.  We should be giving this much more serious thought.  I hoped there would be more measures in this Bill that would reflect a better industrial policy to allow for the fact that as other countries lower their rates to those of Ireland, it will have an knock-on effect on our competitiveness.  The argument is whether the writing is on the wall for the corporation tax rate with regard to its competitiveness.  There is no argument with the fact that it must be retained.  The point I am making is whether we need to shift our industrial policy to reflect our reliance on foreign direct investment and whether we should more aggressively target new markets for exports.  I am sure this is something to which the Minister will return.  </p> <p> Section 30 provides for a new exit tax that applies to people taking assets out of the jurisdiction and out of the EU.  It is arguable that this new measure has not been adequately explained by the Government.  It transposes Article 5 of the ATAD into Irish law.  We had an exit tax for individuals that was charged at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  Apparently, this closed a certain tax loophole that was being exploited.  This will now be superseded by the new tax, although there is still a measure to block the tax loophole.  As I understand it, and, again, I seek clarification, the new tax will be levied at 12.5%, which is the corporation tax rate, rather than 33% but the rate of 33% will apply if the measure is used for tax avoidance purposes.  How easy will it be to identify a tax avoidance purpose?  This will be quite difficult.  What is happening is that when assets are moved abroad, including intellectual property, we are taxing unrealised capital gains.  Why not tax them at capital gains tax rates?  Granted, there is no sale and, therefore, no realised capital gain, which poses cash flow issues, but the asset or wealth gain in monetary terms is the same as for a realised gain.  It has just not been crystalised.  Why tax it at a lower rate?  </p> <p> With regard to excise, the definition of a sugar-sweetened drink has been expanded.  With regard to the added 50 cents on a pack of 20 cigarettes, the price of cigarettes is now typically between &euro;12 and &euro;13.  This might not do much to deter committed smokers but it does help deter younger people from starting the habit.  There is an argument for ramping it up further but it is regressive in respect of those on lower incomes who are addicted.  The Healthy Ireland survey found that about 22% of Irish adults are smokers, 18% smoke on a daily basis and 4% smoke occasionally.  This still translates to about 830,000 smokers in Ireland.  It is quite a significant figure.  The price of cigarettes is only one part of a broader campaign to help people quit smoking.  We acknowledge the HSE's QUIT helpline, plain packets and warning labels on cigarettes but is the pricing mechanism actually working or has it reached its limit?  Does it have a higher proportionate cost with regard to poorer people?  </p> <p> There is another angle to this that is slightly obtuse but I will put it on the record anyway.  Will Brexit bring about the potential for smuggling?  If the UK moves to a mechanism whereby it has control over its VAT rate and levies 0% VAT on cigarettes, will we see a return to the duty-free cigarette regime we saw in the past?  If the Minister has time, could he address that and whether there is a plan for that scenario?  We would like to hear more.  </p> <p> In respect of betting duty, our proposal to lower the costs on SME bookmakers aimed to ensure that betting duty is passed on to the consumer as only the larger firms can absorb the costs.  Betting duty is currently 1% and is defined by Revenue as bets entered into by a bookmaker or remote bookmaker with persons in the State.  In our alternative budget for 2019, we called for betting duty to increase by 2% to a new rate of 3% at a yield of &euro;104 million according to Revenue's ready reckoner.  The Government's budget calls for an increase in betting duty to 2% at a yield of &euro;52 million.  Betting duty was much higher in the past.  It was up to 20% on turnover.  Let us be clear about that; it was on turnover.  The purpose of betting taxes is similar to that of excise on alcohol and tobacco, namely, a tax on "vice", a word I put in inverted commas, designed to lower the incentive for people to consume.  Compared to other European countries, betting duty in Ireland is relatively low.  In economic terms, taxes that are primarily designed to change behaviour rather than raise revenue-----</p></speech>

It is beyond frustrating that it has come to the point that Deputy Eamon Ryan and I have to bring the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 again before the D&aacute;il.  This Government has blocked and obstructed at every stage the opportunity for this D&aacute;il and, in particular, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to do their job, to deliver and to work with legislation that has passed Second Stage.  The former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, consistently refused to issue a money order for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 because this Government does not want to act on climate change.  My understanding is that the new Minister with that responsibility will maintain that refusal tonight and take the cynical step of kicking the can down the road with a national review.  </p><p>This Government does not want to take action on plastic pollution.  It does not want to take action on the health of our seas or our environment.  It seems to have to be dragged kicking and screaming as slowly and reluctantly as possible into the tiniest amount of climate action it can possibly get away with.  Children in primary and secondary schools up and down the country are doing more than the Government to protect our environment.  So many people get it.  It is a pity and a shame that the Government would not take its lead from the youth of our country who are demanding action on plastic waste.  The Minister needs to sit up and take notice because he is way behind the curve on this. </p><p>We do not have much time to deal with these problems and challenges.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC's, report two weeks ago showed us that the clock is ticking on climate action.  We have 12 years to make a difference.  By the time the Government waits around and twiddles its thumbs with a review, as it did when my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, put forward a Bill to ban microbeads two years ago, which it is only getting around to introducing now, our precious marine environments will be even more beset with plastic.  We will reach a point not that far into the future when we will have to change our phrases and idioms.  It will be a case of &quot;there is plenty more plastic in the sea&quot; because plastic will outweigh fish.</p><p>We have seen time and again when the cameras are on Ministers that they say the right thing and run slick public relations campaigns but away from the bright lights, they do not care.  In a keynote speech to the European Parliament and during his election campaign to become leader of Fine Gael, the Taoiseach made all the right noises and said all the right thing.  He said climate action would be his main focus.  Ireland would be a laggard no more, he proclaimed, but we are further behind than ever before.  Similarly with this Bill the Government says the right things in D&aacute;il debates.  It briefs the media on the issue positively but when the substantive work needs to be done in the committee rooms, it is a different story.  The Government shamefully uses administrative manoeuvres to block progress.  The truth is it is more interesting in protecting itself and its electoral prospects than protecting our rivers, streams, seas and lakes. </p><p>This is an important Bill.  It tackles the core of the plastic problem that plagues our country and our world - the trillions of disposable products that are used for just a few minutes but can pollute our environment for centuries.  We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment, killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats.  It is vital that we act and just as vital that we take that action now.  In Ireland, we produce 210,000 tonnes of plastic every year and according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, only 40% of plastic packaging is recycled.  Ireland uses and disposes of 200 million coffee cups annually.  The measures in this Bill are necessary and the Government knows that, so what exactly is it afraid of?  Does it simply not get it or not want to get it?  It is disgracefully nonchalant about one of the most critical challenges facing us.  This is an opportunity to lead but the Government is content to wait until it is pushed when these measures become mandatory under EU rules.  </p><p>The public knows these measures are necessary.  We watched &quot;Drowning in Plastic&quot; on BBC and we watched &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; in horror.  We read the story of the whale that died from eating more than 80 pieces of plastic rubbish.  We have seen the photographs of a stork trapped in a plastic bag and of a turtle with a straw trapped in its nose.  The Irish people know we need to take action for our future and our children's future.  They believe we can still make a difference.  They want to make a difference and we can have change. </p><p>The Waste Reduction Bill 2017 presents an opportunity to have a positive impact on tackling plastic waste but the Government has chosen cynical further delaying tactics like the national review it will shortly outline, further slowing down the process of change.  That is not a surprise given its appalling track record on protecting our environment.  Its national development plan was not even climate-proofed.  The Minister's party, Fine Gael, recently had a green week not comprehending the irony of giving a single week in the year to being selectively green, where it tried to pass the blame and responsibility for its own policy failings to the people of Ireland, deflecting its own failures.  The Taoiseach highlighted the benefits of switching to a reusable coffee cup while Government is blocking the Waste Reduction Bill 2018.  The level of shallow doublespeak, contradictions and evasive inconsistencies beggars belief.  All the facts and figures about plastic that I have just outlined, and that my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and Deputies around this House, will reference over the next two hours have been outlined in this House previously. </p><p>We held a Second Stage debate on this Bill facilitated by the Labour Party, and the Oireachtas committee has done detailed work on investigating and analysing the impact this Bill would have, recommending that it progress to the next Stage.  Parties across the political spectrum and Independents, including Senators and Members of the European Parliament, have called for similar schemes and the Bill is supported by 60 Tidy Towns committees and the Friends of the Earth 'Sick of Plastic' campaign petition which has more than 15,000 signatures.  However, the Government refuses to allow the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 to progress.</p><p>I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.  I wish him well in his new role but I am afraid it will likely disappoint anyone who cares about plastic waste.  I believe Government intends to abstain on our motion and to initiate a review on the best way to tackle this issue.  Is that not what Committee Stage is for?  Is it not to tease through legislation forensically and tweak it to make it as fair and effective as possible?  The best way to make progress on this issue is to listen to all the experts, activists, youth of our country, schoolchildren and legislators and respect the voice of the D&aacute;il to issue the money order for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 and let the members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment do their job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300046#TT00500"><p>I learnt today that I am still an innocent and gullible young man.</p><p>At lunchtime today I was on RT&Eacute;'s &quot;News at One&quot; discussing the motion and I felt in my heart of hearts we were going to make progress.  I thought that because today was the day when the latest scientific research survey showed that plastics are in our food chain; those plastics are in us.  Tomorrow, the European Parliament will debate the new plastics legislation coming from the European Commission and from what I hear our Government will stand firm in support.  No doubt the Fine Gael Members will be there saying we will go for a 90% recycling rate for plastic bottles, which has been the only contentious part of our Bill.  I said to myself that the Government will surely support tonight's motion.<br/><br/>All summer we have heard this kind of thing from Fine Gael Ministers.  I saw the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, at some convention claiming how good they were because there was a glass bottle on the table.  The Taoiseach was in a coffee shop tut-tutting anybody who might use a single-use cup.  They are getting the environmental message completely wrong because they are saying it is all about the consumer doing it and nothing to do with the Government.<br/><br/>We need to change.  We need to make it easy for people to do the right thing.  We need to be radical in taking plastic out of use because it is doing such harm to the environment, using up resources, and polluting our air and seas.  We hear today and we fear today that it is also polluting our own bodies.  I thought to myself that surely Fine Gael would support us.<br/><br/>When I got the news from the reporter on &quot;News at One&quot; that the Government was not going to oppose our Bill, I said it was great that we were making another step forward - the sort of step we made when Deputy Pringle's Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016 was passed.  We can do it in this D&aacute;il like when we banned plastic bags as, in fairness, Fianna F&aacute;il did years ago or the smoking ban.  There are loads of examples when we take steps forward.  I thought today would be one of those days.  When I came out and was walking down the corridor, a journalist pulled me aside and told me that the Government was not doing anything; it would not give a money order and did not want this to proceed.  It will do another review.  This is a do-nothing exercise from a do-nothing Government on the environment.<br/><br/>We do not need to rehearse; we need to debate the politics of this because the contents of the Bill are as simple as it gets.  Almost two years ago, we published the Bill banning single-use plastic items such as cups, plates, knives and forks that could be easily replaced.  It proposes putting a levy on those cups so that we switch towards reusable or compostable cups instead and setting up a new compostable municipal collection system so that all those new paper or card-based items can be collected and turned into compost and not plastic waste.  Most important, it proposes introducing a deposit-refund scheme on plastic bottles and cans which would operate relatively simply.  A levy of 20 cent would be put on the container when it is sold with the refund going to the consumer when it is returned.  It would be paid for by increasing the contribution from the business sector - the companies manufacturing them - from currently about 0.2 cent to 1 cent per container.  It would also be funded by the high-quality recycling material we would collect in this process.  This has been done in many countries in the world.  We would not need a major new review.  This is not like going to the moon or anything extraordinary.  This is tried and tested in many different jurisdictions.<br/><br/>It would also be paid for by the savings we would make by not having to spend so much on litter collection in our most beautiful spots.  Any of us, who are involved in litter clean-ups in canals, on beaches and elsewhere knows that this is one of the big litter problems.  By definition, it tends to be worst in the most scenic spots because that is where people tend to go when the weather is good and, unfortunately, they leave behind the plastic bottles and the cans.  Rather than us having to spend all that time picking it up, we can create a system where, as the international evidence shows, we can reach a 90% recycling level for those bottles with a deposit-refund scheme.  I would love the Department or anyone else to present evidence of the alternative to achieve that target.<br/><br/>Tomorrow in Europe, the Fine Gael members will be beating their chests, claiming to be great in going to a 90% target.  Meanwhile, at home in the D&aacute;il, Fine Gael is refusing to support the legislation that would deliver it.  The Taoiseach came out with nonsense today, saying that this was European legislation.  In this instance, there was a party willing to present the legislation way ahead of the European Commission and we have been blocked ever since by Fine Gael.  Now the Taoiseach today is pretending this is European stuff and nothing to do with us, which is such rubbish.<br/><br/>We need to act and we can act.  We do not need to wait for Europe to force us to do something; we are well able to do it ourselves.  We have shown it in the past.  The Irish people are good at this.  When we start doing things, we actually like to be good at it rather than all the time being seen as the one Europe chases after when we fail to deliver on the environmental directives that are in place.<br/><br/>I believe this would also be good for business.  In drafting the Bill, we were inspired by what the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is doing, working with business.  It is not kicking business.  A company such as Coca Cola in the UK claims to be supportive of this position while in Ireland it is not.  That is not sustainable.<br/><br/>If we are to achieve the levels of recycling of packaging we need, Repak cannot just defend the <i>status quo</i>.  Business has its responsibilities here, but it is also proper business.  How can a company sell a brand when it is part of this wasteful littering system where every 1 kg of plastic we use creates 6 kg of climate emissions in the atmosphere?  We need to take a leap towards environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>I do not know if others members of the Joint Committee on Climate Action feel the same as me.  In the four presentations the Secretaries General have made to that committee so far, I have been shocked at the absolute lack of vision, ambition, sense of leadership and direction.  I fear they are getting their signal from their political masters.  How could it be that every Department is coming in with no ambition and no sense of the scale of what we need to do?<br/><br/>In plastics, it is not just the provisions of our Bill.  The good thing about the Bill is that it uses existing legislation.  It even gives the Government significant time.  It does not require this to be done tomorrow.  It just provides a signal to the public service and industry that we are going in this direction and they have two, three or four years to make it happen.  If the Government wants to conduct a review, that is fine.  It has four years to conduct the review, but it needs to send the signal and show some leadership, be willing to be brave not engage in political games such as the Taoiseach saying this is down to Europe and nothing to do with us.  I think it has to do with us and this D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>It is not the only step.  If we take this step, then we take the next step to require retailers to cut out the use of non-necessary plastic packaging.  We should also require them to cut out the non-recyclable plastic packaging.  We know we have to do this.  We know that within Europe this will happen.  Why should we on every occasion say that we will not do it ourselves, but wait for someone to tell us to do it, which is what I fear the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has been advised by his Department?  That would be a shame.<br/><br/>It is a shame on this D&aacute;il that the Government is willing to use the technicality of needing a money order to denigrate and lower the importance of Opposition legislation, particularly where that legislation is absolutely bang in tune with what the European Commission has proposed and European Parliament will agree tomorrow we have to do.  As we happen to be a year ahead of it, it is not outside the ordinary or outside conventional policy thinking.  It is absolutely in tune with the direction of legislation elsewhere.  Having done our research in the detailed scrutiny stage, the Government has consistently stalled the legislation and refused to issue the money order.  Coming out today claiming it is all in favour of this while using a technicality to stop the whole thing happening represents a real wasted opportunity.  Minority government is not all about the Government doing as little as possible and stopping anyone else doing anything.  There is strength in this D&aacute;il when it passes legislation which sometimes comes from other than the Government side.<br/><br/>Carrying out the scrutiny has been useful.  I accept we could do more scrutiny and be involved in the Committee Stage.  That is what we do; we test out the argument.  However, the process here has been wrong.  The process was wrong in the committee where the final stages of our discussions on the Bill took place in private rather in public where the Minister was giving all his reasons for opposing the Bill.</p><p>It has also been wrong in the sense that the Department's story has changed every few months.  First, we were told there would be a levy on cups and then that there would not.  Then we were told there would be a pilot scheme in Cashel in Tipperary, as if one could hermetically seal Cashel and know a Tipperary bottle from a non-Tipperary bottle, unless it is a Tipperary Water bottle.  The stories changed at every turn and we have been blocked at every turn.  It is about time we stopped blocking environmental aspiration and inspiration and started working collectively to make the leap.  This State needs to make the leap to be a green country.  We can be a green country.  People are ready and dying to do this.</p> <p> We know this Bill has public support like no other we have ever produced.  It has been blocked by Fine Gael.  Every time the party comes out with the latest video or social media information about how great Fine Gael is for the environment, it should note its record will be shot if it does not let this Bill proceed to Committee Stage.  It is not an unreasonable ask.  We are willing to amend the Bill.  We would listen to every argument, examine every figure and do the sums in every way the Department might want, but carrying out another review in which nothing will happen and waiting for Europe to tell us to act is not good enough.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his new role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300048#VV00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman.</p><p>I thank Deputies Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan for tabling this motion.  I absolutely believe we need an effective policy to tackle plastics and their excessive use in Ireland.  The figures I have &mdash; I am sure the Deputies are more familiar with them than I am &mdash; show that our usage of plastic, at 58 g <i>per capita</i>, is 80% above the EU average.  We have a chronic reliance on plastics and we need to start to sort that out.</p><p>Plastic represents more than a quarter of all the packaging waste generated.  Our recycling level is at or about the EU average, which is acceptable at one level in that we have not fallen behind, but it is far from where we need to be.  The Deputies cast aspersions on the enthusiasm to endorse the 90% target for the recycling of plastic bottles.  It is important that we endorse such a target, just as we need to deliver on the target of recycling 55% of all our plastics.  These are important targets that we need to meet but we also need to develop the policy instruments to make them happen.  While I fully recognise the passion of the advocates who have set out a list of proposals, I believe that even Deputy Eamon Ryan will recognise that we ought to consider other possibilities and that an effective strategy needs to examine the full range and pick those strategies that are going to deliver effectively.</p><p>I very much welcome the decision of the European Union to ban ten particular items comprising single-use plastics that have been identified as causes of the chronic problem of ocean pollution.  I understand from EU data that as much as 500,000 tonnes of plastic from the EU make their way into our oceans.  It is important that we get to grips with meeting the targets.</p><p>I am in no way denigrating the role of the Oireachtas, as suggested, or casting aspersions on the efforts of others.  I look forward to implementing a strong range of initiatives to ensure that we meet those responsibilities to which we are signing up.</p><p>Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has been in my position, will understand that, for the Government to come forward with a set of proposals, it will have to make a fair and objective evaluation, or a regulatory impact assessment.  We must make sure we are picking the most effective policy instruments to deliver on our ambitions.  The Deputy asked what we could consider.  There is a range of actions we could consider, apart from the outright bans that the European Union is bringing forward.  We cannot introduce bans without EU endorsement because of interference with trade but we have many opportunities, through our own policy instruments, to address the problems in this area.  We can extend producer responsibility.  Deputies Ryan and Martin are keen supporters of that.</p><p>We need incentives and levies at various points in the supply chain to determine how we can change the patterns of behaviour.  We need much better labelling so people making decisions about recycling in their own homes can do so effectively and correctly.  We need better packaging designs so we do not have mixed materials that make it hard to recycle.  There is a wide range of policy instruments, including those Deputy Ryan listed.  Included are a deposit retention scheme and the levy on disposable cups.  Those are certainly measures we should consider.  I am determined to do that.</p><p>I am but a week and an hour in the job, bearing in mind the time I got to the Phoenix Park last week, but I am determined to proceed with this work speedily.  I will commission the work we promised to evaluate the issues speedily.  I will revert to the House as quickly as I can with the outcome of the evaluation.</p><p>Deputy Eamon Ryan indicated we should just proceed to Committee Stage, where he believes we can thrash this out.  I beg to differ.  Committee Stage is carried out in the political arena.  We do not have economic evaluations or the sorts of evaluations required on that Stage.  I examined the Oireachtas committee report.  It sets out the sorts of steps we need to consider.  They are fairly fundamental.  It is asked whether a deposit return scheme will increase recycling rates and whether the infrastructure is in place to support it.  It is asked how the proposals fit with a system that has a high level of curbside collection and whether there are alternatives that might offer the same or better environmental returns.  It is also asked whether infrastructure is in place to make the system work.  These are pretty fundamental questions about how we can deliver on the ambitions the Deputies have set out.</p><p>I have been through Committee Stage of many Bills in my years in the House.  Committee Stage is not an arena where people sit down and tease through evidence of the kind in question.  It comprises largely political debates in which people set out their views and hear others and at the end of which there is a vote and a count of numbers.</p><p>We need the sort of evaluation that can result in a reduction in our reliance on plastic.  Our rate of use is 80% higher than that of the rest of Europe.  We must improve our recycling rates.  I have seen various statistics in the evidence.  The committee report suggested that we are ahead of Europe, on average.  Elsewhere I have seen that we are behind Europe, on average.  I am not going to try to claim we are doing well because we certainly need to do better.</p><p>We need to examine these matters and others.  One of our candidates in the Taoiseach's constituency sent me today an idea involving the placing of reverse vending machines in beauty spots, whereby people could return plastics without having to have a barcode and without having to meet the other criteria involved in a deposit return scheme.  Perhaps this could be added to the choices we will make.</p><p>There is no doubt we need a stronger outlet for recycled plastic.  It is clear from the Commission's work in this area that if recycled plastic continues to be regarded as a second-rate material that is not admitted to the supply chains of the big branded products, we are handicapping ourselves in achieving the circular-economy approach we want to achieve.</p><p>Equally, we must get a standard for compostable cups so they can be clearly marked and separated in the waste stream and we can avoid the reliance on plastic materials.  The reason we are abstaining on this and not opposing it is that we are taking time to evaluate these issues.  We cannot impose a cost without having clearly understood who bears it, whether it will work and how it will work.</p> <p> The Deputy said he wanted a signal and that the legislation is a signal, but he has been here long enough to know that legislation is far more than a signal.  Legislation introduces obligations that must be enforced, policed and delivered.  Legislative measures are not signals of how we feel but the vehicles through which we implement policy change.  I must ensure I am in a position to stand over the validity of the choices we are making.  All I can offer the House is the assurance, based on my record in the House, and I do not wish to count the number of years, that I take this issue intensely seriously.  It is part of a much wider range of issues to which I have been given the responsibility to respond.  I appreciate the passion people feel for this because it is very important.  I hope I will be given the opportunity to work in this area in a constructive way with all Members, but my responsibility must always be to have the ability to stack up the evidence.  As an economist I must be able to provide the evidence to support the policy decisions I make.  I trained in the ESRI and came through that school.  I will act when I have the evidence and I will not delay unnecessarily.</p> <p> Any suggestions that we are against this agenda in some way are quite beside the point.  I am determined to make an impact in this area and I have been given the privilege of taking it on.  I thank the Chairman for his kind words.  While the sponsors of this motion are not happy with my position, I hope I will be able to vindicate what I have done by the actions I take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="21:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300049#WW00200"><p>I am sharing time with a number of my colleagues.  I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his new Department.  He certainly brings a wealth of experience to it, and this House and the country will benefit significantly from that.  To respond to the Minister's reference to his background and history as an economist with the ESRI, when it comes to climate change we will have to look at doing things entirely differently from how they were done in the past.  The old norms that applied to the way in which the economy grew and developed and the reliance we had on staple entities within that need to change dramatically.  While the Minister's experience will be helpful, we will have to turn it on its head somehow in respect of dealing with the environment and climate change.  I hope he will participate in that.</p><p>I thank the Green Party for bringing this motion forward.  As I stated on Second Stage of the Bill, and again at the communications committee, we will work with the Green Party, the Labour Party and others to try to bring this to fruition.  While we have some slight differences regarding how it might be implemented, we agree with it in principle.  We introduced a similar Bill with a great deal of detail but it was knocked at the first hurdle.  We had thought it through too much and, notwithstanding new politics, it failed to get through the onerous requirements of not just the money aspect of it but also the other preventive measures the Government has in its armoury. </p><p>Earlier today I met with representatives of Tr&oacute;caire to discuss the need for urgency to be injected into the debate around climate change and sustainability.  It is far too easy to be paralysed by the scale of the problem or to believe that it will be addressed by somebody else.  The report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has been absolutely clear that a fundamental shift in the mindset of policy makers must take place now.  It is not a problem for some future set of notional politicians, but for all of us now.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that Ireland must take decisive action to address it.  It will require a significant shift from everyone and, in parallel, there will have to be proper sustained investment in public transport and bioenergy and biowaste production.  Work is ongoing at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, but this report must become something tangible, which is accepted across the House and is acted upon.  Every Member knows the issues that must be addressed.  We need the political will to ensure that they are.  The time that is wasted putting off the inevitable will only result in harsher measures in the future.  That is in nobody's interest.</p><p>The Bill at the heart of this motion would form a part of that fundamental shift in thinking.  There are issues in the Bill that will require additional work.  Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin are cognisant of that and from the outset have accepted the necessity to work through them.  That is accepted by all sides.  They can be worked through on Committee and Remaining Stages if a money message is forthcoming as a result of tonight's motion.  I listened intently to the Minister and I hope that it will be forthcoming when he has concluded his detailed analytical work and accepts the new realities we face.</p><p>At the core of the Bill is a desire to address plastic waste and to reduce the levels entering landfill.  This is both timely and necessary.  In Ireland an estimated 983,380 tonnes of packaging waste were generated in 2015.  That is about the same weight as 19 <i>Titanics</i>piled on top of each other.  This is unsustainable.  In 1997, the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government set up Repak, an organisation of Irish businesses that support recycling.  Since then, Ireland's recycling rates have increased dramatically, from 15% in 1998 to 66% by 2011.  This was a steep change, but the results of the IPCC report show that we must go further.  Recycling can only go so far and reduction must also play a role.  This was part of the reason that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a levy on plastic bags in 2002.  That policy change drastically reduced the number of plastic bags consumed in Ireland from about 328 bags <i>per capita</i>to 21.  Indeed, McKinsey has shown how consumer goods companies can reduce overall packaging costs by 10% by making simple design changes.  We must empower and encourage producers to reduce the level of plastic used to create packaging in the first place.</p><p>We must also develop and improve the circular economy.  I believe that individual consumer behaviour can only go so far in reducing the volume of waste that is sent to landfill.  We could have 100% compliance in recycling our recyclable waste, but this is worth little if we do not drastically cut the amount of overall waste.  A major study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2015 found that using a circular economy approach could boost Europe&rsquo;s resource productivity by 3% by 2030.  Far more work is needed to promote the development of this vital space.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the creation of a waste reduction task force which would be responsible for identifying ways to incentivise waste reduction in the public and private sectors and promote the circular economy.  This will also benefit the consumer, who will not be responsible for disposing of huge amounts of unneeded packaging.  Those of us who have become a little more conscious of the impact of the materials we put back into our recycling system or into our black bins have come to realise that even where one makes a concerted effort to recycle material or dispose of it appropriately, there is too much packaging associated with the products we consume.  Much of this is associated with marketing techniques and we must work to reduce it.  We must incentivise behavioural change among both those who design the packaging and those who purchase it.</p><p>Recent documentaries such as &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; and &quot;Drowning in Plastic&quot; have exposed the deeply distressing effects of plastic on waters and oceans that thousands of miles from land.  At the current rate, there may be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by weight, by 2050.  This problem is transnational and so are the solutions.  However, Ireland can and should be at the forefront of ending this scourge.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Green Party's positive move in bringing it forward.  We must confront the challenge of single-use plastic.</p><p>While convenient, single-use cups and tableware can have a significant environmental impact.  It is not just that discarded plastics are visible along our roads, there is also a cost to collecting and disposing of them.  A great many people were surprised to learn that many types of coffee cups are not recyclable due to the plastic coating applied to them.  More and more people are making a greater effort to switch to reusable cups.  There is a willingness and a goodwill to deal with environmental issues.</p> <p> Ireland has a strong record in recent years in making improvements in recycling but there is space for so much more to be done.  A deposit scheme can change behaviour, as evidenced by what happened when the plastic bag levy was introduced.  Ireland was the first country to introduce this type of levy and now reusable bags have become the norm.</p> <p> The Bill to which this motion is related is lighter on detail regarding how the policy proposal should work and may need further consideration in order to make it more workable.  However, what is proposed is doable.  We should be moving towards that.  When people return their plastics, instead of getting money back they could, for example, obtain credit on their Leap cards.  In that way, we could promote public transport also.</p> <p> The recent IPCC report is very stark.  Greater urgency is needed in taking on the challenges of climate change.  I have no doubt that there is a willingness on the part of the public to take on these challenges.</p> <p> Molaim an r&uacute;n seo.

In supporting the Bill, we will work constructively with our colleagues to improve and build upon what is the in the interests of creating a different Ireland which we can pass on with pride to the next generation.</p>  <p>  I was struck by the first line of the motion, which acknowledges the gravity of the crisis for wildlife, rivers, lakes and oceans caused by the quantities of plastics that are finding their way into the environment.  Our oceans and the wildlife within them are suffering and they need protection from the devastation caused by throwaway plastic items.  It was devastating to hear Annalise Murphy, the Olympic sailor, say that a plastic bag had cost her at the Rio Olympic Games.  While competing, a plastic bag became stuck on the rudder of her boat and it cost Ms Murphy quite a few places in the race.</p>  <p>  At the current rate, there will be more plastic than fish in the seas and oceans by 2050.  This is a very worrying statistic.  The next generation represents a way forward.  There is no doubt that the Green-Schools initiative is driving environmental management and education programmes.  Promoting long-term whole-school action for the environment, Green-Schools is a student-led programme with involvement from the wider community.  The programme is operated and co-ordinated by the environment and education unit of An Taisce.  The work of students, in collaboration with teachers, parents, councils and local authorities, is second to none.  Children learn the principles of reusing, reducing and recycling.  They also learn to care for the environment from a very early age.  These children can teach us a thing or two.  The habits they learn will stay with them for a lifetime.</p></speech>

Everywhere one looks, one sees plastic in the form of packaging, disposable cutlery, coffee cups and water bottles.  This is a local, national and global crisis.  Any analysis of roadside waste in my constituency in Kildare or in any other part of Ireland would show a very high proportion of disposable coffee cups and single-use plastic water bottles.  Apart from the very unsightly waste on our roads and streets, and at some of the country's more scenic spots, the cleaning up by local authorities and local community groups gives rise to a considerable cost in terms of resources.  There is also the huge threat to marine life and there is an unknown risk and impact on people's health.  Research has shown that some plastic items can take 400 years to break down, which is shocking.  It is estimated that 2% to 5% of all plastics produced end up in the oceans causing significant problems.</p>  <p>  Much needs to be done and the State definitely needs to lead the way.  One measure recommended recently by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is the provision of free drinking water in schools.  We made that recommendation to try to bring students away from fizzy, carbonated drinks.  This would also have an impact because children would not need plastic bottles.  This one small measure could make a huge difference and minimise the need to use plastic bottles.</p>  <p>  I commend my colleagues in the Labour Party and the Green Party on bringing forward the Bill to make illegal by 2020 the sale or free distribution of single-use tableware that cannot be composted.  This is to be welcomed.  The motion also seeks the introduction of a bottle deposit scheme.  There are some issues that my party would need to address but we will do so on Committee Stage.  I will be commending the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300050#XX00400"><p>There are two aims in the context of what is proposed.  First, to make illegal by 2020 the sale or free distribution of single-use tableware that cannot be composted at a domestic composting facility and, second, the introduction of a bottle deposit scheme whereby people would pay a small deposit fee when purchasing beverages that would be reimbursed upon return of the empty can or bottle to a suitable facility.  The estimated cost in this regard would be &euro;200 million.  Repak has expressed concern regarding how this scheme might affect its nationwide recycling infrastructure, which has proved effective in raising Ireland's recycling rate from a very low base to among the highest in Europe.</p><p>On Committee Stage, Fianna F&aacute;il will work to address these concerns.  Although convenient, single-use tableware can present a major issue for Ireland's environment.  In one area of County Kerry, 30% of roadside waste is made up of disposable coffee cups.  The percentage for plastic bottles is not much lower.  This creates unsightly waste at some of Ireland's most scenic and most visited roads and waterways.  Cleaning up such waste costs local councils and community groups a considerable amount in terms of resources.  In the United Kingdom, up to 3 billion coffee cups are thrown away every year.  Currently, the vast majority of these cups cannot be recycled because they are coated with plastic.  Certain producers and retailers are, however, leading the way in the area of recycled and compostable products.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il wholeheartedly supports the principle behind the Bill to which the motion relates.  We recognise that recycling can only go so far and that it needs to be complemented by measures to simply cut down on the amount of waste we produce on a daily basis.  This was part of the reason that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a levy on plastic bags in 2002; a policy change which drastically reduced the number of plastic bags used in Ireland from approximately 328 <i>per capita</i>to 21.  We need to identify and support initiatives that reduce both unnecessary packaging and waste.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300050#XX00500"><p>Ireland is the top producer of plastic waste in Europe.  We generate an average of 61 kg per person each year, almost double the rate for the UK.  We produce the equivalent of nearly 2,000 water bottles and 5,550 disposable coffee cups per person annually.  Some 30% of the EU's plastic is recycled but the equivalent figure in Ireland is 34%.  Incineration accounts for 39% and landfill for 31%.  More than 60% of plastic waste still comes from packaging, but only 40% of this is recycled.  Ireland generated 282,148 tonnes of plastic packaging waste in 2015.  China accepted 7 million tonnes of the world's plastic scrap in 2016, which was more than half of all the waste plastic exported globally that year.  That market is now closed.  These are some statistics I took from newspaper articles and from information provided by environmental groups that have been collecting such information for a long time.</p>  <p>  Plastic waste represents a major challenge for the public, the Government and legislators.  It must be tackled.  If it was not for our Tidy Towns initiative and the people and community groups involved, the amount of plastic lying around towns and villages in rural areas would be ten times worse.</p><p>In supporting the Waste Reduction Bill, Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to work to make this happen and to do the right thing.  We introduced the plastic bag levy and we introduced Repak.  We are prepared to do things to make the environment better.  I assure the Minister, as a rural Deputy, that if I was to show him the amount of emails I have gotten from my constituents he would not believe it.  It is an issue the Irish public wants tackled.  We have a duty and responsibility to answer that call and to respond.</p></speech>

I compliment them on their opening remarks.  They were very passionately spoken and heartfelt.  I also congratulate the Minister on his new role in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  I am happy to support this motion because I sincerely believe that we are not doing enough to protect our environment.  It is critical that policy proposals be fair, workable and effective and that we have buy-in from the key stakeholders if we are to succeed in enacting the sea change in attitudes and behaviours that needs to be harnessed to gain respect for our environment and our landscape.  Illegal dumping has become the scourge of rural Ireland.  It continues to be a blight on our beautiful drumlins across Cavan and Monaghan.  Unfortunately, we see it every day on our roadsides.  It is waste made up of disposable cups, plastic bottles, and other forms of waste that make up the most appalling collage of plastics and which degrade our most scenic roadways, walkways and waterways.  Cleaning it up comes at a huge cost to our local authorities in terms of human resources and expense, not to mention the futile exercise of following the perpetrators through the courts only to achieve a fine that in most cases will never be paid.</p>  <p>  It is not an exaggeration when I tell the Minister that a significant number of hours in my constituency office are taken up by very concerned and conscientious constituents who are appalled by the deplorable behaviour of others who are abusing our scenic sites in a very intentional way, dumping all sorts of illegal plastics, mattresses, furniture and general household waste which could easily be disposed of at recycling centres.  These culprits know all too well that illegal dumping cannot be tolerated in scenic areas in particular and that councils have to act quickly and remove it.  At our own Castle Lake in Bailieborough in County Cavan, which is real beauty spot in the county, we were scourged over the summer months by campers leaving their rubbish and waste plastic bottles behind them.  We had numerous incidents in beautiful spots like Bunnoe and in quiet countryside areas where dumping continues to be a scourge for the residents and local people in the area.</p>  <p>  In protecting our environment we need to bring forward practical solutions that incentivise waste reduction, cut down on unnecessary packaging and reduce waste.  We need to start protecting and appreciating our beautiful landscape and environment.  We need to act.</p></speech>

We had Phil Hogan, Deputy Alan Kelly and Deputy Denis Naughten.  If the Minister does anything, he needs to make a start with this.  The game is up in terms of plastic.  I congratulate the Green Party for bringing this issue forward again.  The consequences are absolutely horrific.  It is constant and it is doing huge damage to our environment.  We need to face it now, not later.  Plastic was the so-called great material of the 20th century but it has turned out to be the scourge of the 21st century.  If we do not act and put new policies in place we are going to face a problem which we will not be able to overcome.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in support practical action on plastic pollution, and indeed on other pollution.  We are not just highlighting the problem or calling it out.  We put forward a comprehensive Bill last year which outlined the establishment of a deposit return scheme as called for in this motion.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill had other provisions on illegal dumping, household bin collection and so on.  While I recognise that the Green Party Bill is limited in detail, we are prepared to work with the party on Committee Stage in order to improve it.  There is very little in the Bill in terms of how the deposit scheme would work.  We had some more information tonight in the motion.  The proposal is good and we need to move ahead with it.  </p>  <p>  The policy of reduce, reuse and recycle is needed now more than ever.  The Minister talked a lot about recycling but recycling is only the second least worst option.  We need to reduce at source, or eliminate at source where we can.  We need to reuse.  Recycling is way down the chain.  It is good if it is the only option open to us, but we need to take other actions first such as eliminating waste at source or reusing.</p>  <p>  We have to ask how we are dealing with the waste.  Of course the Chinese market is now closed.  We can no longer dump it on the Chinese.  Other states like Thailand and Vietnam are also moving in the same direction.  What do we do?  Do we find another country to which to ship our waste or do we deal with it ourselves?  We see that essential change is needed in how we treat the environment.  There is a vital need to combat climate change at all levels.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in put forward Bills on waste reduction and microgeneration, an extensive paper on biogas, and a policy document, Powering Ireland 2030, all in the last number of months.  We see this motion tonight as essential and as another part of working with other parties in the D&aacute;il to get that necessary action.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in do not see this as creating a big burden.  Phil Hogan and some of the other Ministers looked at it in that way.  They said there was a recession and that we had to deal with that first.  This should be seen as a way of getting out of recession.  We will actually be dragged into a recession if we do not try to adopt and build new, green, sustainable industries and get rid of the old industries.  That is what we need to do.  We need to build our image as a green island.  We should be a leader.  We should not be behind with everything as we are at the moment in respect of climate change, the production of plastic and a whole lot of other things.  </p>  <p>  The figures in terms of plastic pollution are immense and horrific and cannot be overstated.  They have been outlined here tonight in great detail.  It is estimated that 2% to 5% of all plastic produced finishes up in the seas and oceans.  A study released by the National University of Ireland, Galway, last year found that 70% of deep sea fish sampled in the north Atlantic had ingested plastic.  Some 80% of the prawn population in Dublin Bay has ingested plastic.  It is a nice thought, is it not?  The pollution problem also affects our rivers and beaches.  Without action there may be more plastic than fish by weight by 2020.  A report by the Environment Agency Austria today shows that microplastics are being found in the human digestive system and suggests that this could affect the immune response and aid transmission of toxic chemicals.  That is a terrible thing to state.  In August a report conducted by An Taisce highlighted the shocking fact that only 8% of Irish water was judged as clean.  Ireland is the top producer of plastic in the European Union.  I mentioned our record in terms of greenhouse gas emissions earlier.  We are laggards rather than being out in front.  It is estimated that 983,280 tonnes of packaging waste was generated in 2015, that is almost 1 million tonnes.  Some 528,000 plastic cups are disposed of every day, many of them on roadways around the State.  Some 32% of plastics escape collection systems.  Where is all that going?  </p>  <p>  Once this plastic is in the environment it is difficult to extract it.  Earlier speakers mentioned Tidy Towns committees, community groups and people in rural areas picking up plastic.  If one walks along any country road, particularly after Christmas when the vegetation starts dying back, one will see the full horrors of what is being dumped on the roadsides.  The problem is the length of time it will take to decompose.  The other real problem is that 90% of plastics are derived from fossil fuels, which means that the scourge of plastic has a double negative effect in terms of carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions because it is produced from oil and fossil fuels and there are also emissions from the production process.  It has a double whammy.  </p>  <p>  We have to remember that a deposit return scheme will not solve all of these problems in itself.  Neither will a ban on single-use plastics.  However, it is a significant part of the bigger picture.  The bigger pieces of the jigsaw need to be put together.  The many elements need to be put together so that they can work together to create the change and revolution that is necessary.  Banning single-use plastics and establishing deposit return schemes deal with the end of the chain.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>This is the key.  We have to stop the conveyer belt of machines that are churning out plastic and feeding it into society.  There are millions of tonnes of it and we need to concentrate on that.  We need to put a halt on the manufacturers and stop the unnecessary waste at source.  The best way of dealing with a problem - I think the Minister will agree - is to not create it in the first place.  The easiest way to solve a problem is to not have the problem.  While I am not naive enough to think we can do it overnight, we have to change.  The Government is delaying.  I agree with the Green Party on this.  It is very frustrating.  Nearly eight years ago, I spoke to the former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, about this and here we are all this time later.  We cannot put it off any longer.  </p> <p> It is not a huge technological problem.  Other countries have these schemes up and running.  We will go at our own expense to the other countries and talk to the people.  I am willing to do it as part of a delegation from the D&aacute;il.  We will go and look at how it works in other countries.  It cannot be rocket science.  We all see it working in other countries when we go on holidays.  Let us do that and put a scheme in place.  We cannot keep denying that we have this issue and claiming it is terribly complicated to deal with.  I do not want to oversimplify the matter but the scheme I put forward would not impose a cost on the Exchequer as it would be self-financing.  This one can be as well.  There is no reason we cannot do this.  We have to try to move on this very soon.  Government policies need to change, householders have a role to play and I have a role to play as a citizen.  I will not use the word "consumer", which I have banned from my house.  I wish to God we could ban it here as well because we need to start talking about people and citizens.  We are not consumers at the end of a conveyor belt.  We need to impose an obligation on the manufacturer as a starting point.  Each of us must play a role.  We can start by handing back packaging and taking out all the rubbish that comes in the newspapers and leaving it in the shops.  We do not need to bring it home with us.  We must reduce waste at source and eliminate it.  </p> <p> I welcome that the motion refers to medical devices because an exception has to be made for syringes and other equipment that is needed.  Many people need single use plastic for medical reasons on a daily basis.  We need to provide for that and protect it.  The switch from plastics in society is necessary and urgent.  That is the message I want to give to the Minister who is new in his position.  This material was not as widespread 50 years ago.  In fact there was hardly any of it.  We can look ahead by taking a quick look back at how we managed without it.  We can plan for change.  The Government needs to think and act differently and put policies and practices in place to end plastic and create alternatives.  The good news is that the Minister has the Opposition with him, as he is hearing tonight.  This is not something on which he has to come in and battle with us on.  The game is up for plastic and it will also be up for a Government and political parties that do not take it into consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="21:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300052#ZZ00200"><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the Private Members' motion and thank the Green Party for putting it before us.  It speaks to common sense.  The scourge of single use plastics is a blight on our environment and landscape.  There is a clear demand now among the people, as articulated by the majority of Members in the House through the motion, and a clear view that we must now move towards the elimination of single use plastics on a practical basis.  If we are to give any serious consideration to the IPCC report, which we are all very familiar with at this juncture, failure to take radical and drastic action will have serious consequences for humanity.  I am not given to verbosity but when one looks at the stark figures contained in the IPCC report, there is very little time in global historical terms for us to do something radical to potentially turn things around to a more positive vein.</p>  <p>  This is a practical motion to which Members have assented.  We should not be fooled by the Government's intention to abstain on it or read that as Government assent.  It is, as has been said by Deputy Eamon Ryan, a delaying tactic.  The money message is a mechanism being used as a very blunt instrument to stunt the progress of Opposition Bills and motions in the House.  We demand action on this issue now.  If the majority of Members say we want to support the motion, that should, in a democratic process, give rise to action by the Government out of, at a minimum, sheer respect for the democratic process.  We need radical action.  We are all familiar with the idea of deposit refund schemes and all of us have seen them in operation.  They work in many western European countries and are based on pragmatism and common sense.  Why can we not move in a direction which seeks to speak to the issue of single use plastics?  We all realise as consumers and citizens that if we do not tackle this issue, the scourge of single use plastics, particularly around our coastlines, will get worse.  I speak as a sea kayaker.  It is something I do as a pastime.  There is nothing more beneficial than to be out on the ocean in a boat on one's own steam.  It is depressing to see the amount of plastic washed up on beaches with every tide or the plastic that floats at sea when one gets out far enough.  As an island nation with a proud maritime history, we need to do something to tackle it and to take leadership on this issue, if not for this generation, for future generations.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to the intervention of some of the members of the IPCC who will be before the House to address the Joint Committee on Climate Action because it will bring home to us just how stark this problem is.  We need to be jolted into action.  Sometimes in this House we are in a bit of a bubble and sometimes people outside the House know better what needs to happen in terms of actions.  They are demand action on this issue, which is not an insurmountable one.  It can be tackled with some co-operation and collaboration.</p>  <p>  The motion speaks to a pragmatic approach where we move towards an eventual phasing out of single use plastics.  In the meantime, it proposes, as an intervention, the introduction of a deposit refund scheme, as is commonplace in other countries.  We also need to consider investing in the establishment of glass bottling plants.  Perhaps this has been spoken about already and it has certainly been spoken about previously.  The idea that we become producers of glass bottles and further incentivise the constant reuse of materials is common sense.  We did this before plastics became omnipresent and there is a demand for it.</p>  <p>  There are many worthwhile causes throughout Ireland now.  Members of Clean Coasts Ballynamona in east Cork are out every weekend cleaning up beaches and doing a mighty job.  What we see in that is people power.  It is people and communities coming together across the generations, not radical action.  They want to be able to walk on pristine beaches again.  They want to ensure that water quality is of a certain standard.  It brings me to the issue of banning microplastics, on which I have a Bill that has reached Committee Stage.  The relevant committee has analysed the microplastics Bill.</p><p>I am waiting for a money message on it too.  We cannot have more stalling tactics on these issues.  I acknowledge the fact that the Green Party first brought through the microplastics Bill, on which we took up the cudgel, and that we are waiting for the Government to publish its Bill.  I know that there is a Bill in gestation, which I welcome, but we want to see it published in order that we can all examine it.  If we do not ban microplastics, I do not need to tell Deputies or anybody watching what the consequences of the constant presence of microplastics in marine life are, or what the consequences ultimately will be for humans.  One does not have to go too far to witness the insidious damage microplastics and other plastics cause to flora and fauna such as birds.  </p> <p> We have an opportunity to pass a motion in this House, but it will be meaningless as a motion if it is not followed by action.  There is a willingness on the part of this House, and every Deputy, to try to bring about radical change in our attitudes to plastics and to try to legislate for changes in human behaviour in a practical way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="21:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300053#AAA00200"><p>Everything about the Government's response to this issue is utterly cynical and it must be called out on it.  Its approach to the question of procedure makes a joke of the supposed democracy of this Parliament, while its approach to the substance of the issue makes a joke of any commitment to tackle plastic pollution.  It is a good motion, but I do not mean any offence to its movers when I say its most substantial elements simply call on the Government to recognise the support the D&aacute;il has given to a Bill which was passed on Second Stage last yea, and approve the issuing of a money message to stop using a technical measure to prevent a Bill passed by Parliament from proceeding, being debated on Committee Stage and eventually passed into law, as is the democratic will of Parliament.</p>  <p>  That Green Party Deputies are forced to use Private Members' time to bring forward a motion to state a Bill that has been passed on Second Stage should stop being blocked by the Government is utterly outrageous.  The Government is cynical not just on this issue but also on others such as the sexual education Bill, where it allows Bills to pass on Second Stage, or is forced to recognise a Bill that has been passed on Second Stage and then simply stops it because it is no longer in the limelight.  It is an utter disgrace.  The Government's response to this debate adds insult to injury.  After this debate, the Government will abstain; we will pass the motion without a vote and there will be two votes in the Parliament in favour of the Bill being brought into law, yet it still will not be brought into law because the Government will not pass the money message.  It will still go to the European State and state it is in favour of taking action, etc., while it watches the clock wind down in this parliamentary term, knowing that all of the Bills will then die with nothing having been done about them.  It is a disgrace.  It is good that the Green Party has brought forward the motion to call out the Government on it, of which we need to do more because it gets away with it.</p>  <p>  On the substance of the Bill, the unwillingness to implement the legislation underlines the unwillingness to do anything about the fundamental issue, apart from the rhetoric on climate change, as we saw in the Budget Statement a couple of weeks ago.  The point has been made about how urgent the problem is and every minute the equivalent of a bin truck full of plastic is dumped into the oceans, with the consequence that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish.  It interacts with nature in the oceans and causes starvation in marine animals and birds as it cannot be broken down.  It fills their stomachs, preventing them from ingesting food.  It becomes entangled in coral reefs, blocking light and oxygen and releasing harmful toxins, which allows disease to set in and kill the coral.  Of course, it ends up in humans.  A study conducted in Ghent University last year found that each European was possibly ingesting up to 11,000 tiny pieces of plastic every year.</p>  <p>  The approach of the Government, or at least Fine Gael, was summed up in its green week a couple of months ago, which was like something from 20 years ago in its idea that tackling the issue was all about individual responsibilty.  The use of plastic proves the point that it is not only about good individual choices.  People do not make choices in a vacuum; rather, they make them in a capitalist society where many of the choices such as on the use of plastic packaging and so on have already been made for them, driven by the need to make a profit, logistics, marketing and so forth.  We need regulations to ban the use of single-use plastics, non-recyclable plastics and, most fundamentally, oil-based plastics.  I would go further, however, and say we need to tackle those behind the manufacture of plastics, that is, the same companies which are behind the causes of climate change, namely, the big oil companies.  Fundamentally, we cannot control what we do not own; therefore, the oil companies need to be taken into public ownership.  We need to use that control to end the use of oil-based plastics and completely phase out the use of fossil fuels.</p></speech>

Deputy Paul Murphy has raised most of the important points much better than I could, but the last point he made is often overlooked in this argument, namely, that conventional plastic is made from fossil fuels and that the plastic industry is controlled by the fossil fuel industry.  While researching this issue, I was interested to learn that ethylene which is used to make most plastic products nowadays was a by-product in the extraction of shale gas, which occurs widely across North America, when ethane and propane are brought together in a cracking facility.  As the use of shale gas is the most cost-effective way of producing ethylene in the United States, it and its oil industry are pushing up the use of gas to a level that is quite frightening.  We expect the level of production of plastic to increase in the next 20 years by four times.  By 2050 there will have been a quadrupling of the production of plastic on the planet.</p>  <p>  Recyclers, individuals and campaigners who care about the environment such as the schoolchildren whom Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned are not the polluters.  The polluters are the producers and it is they on whom we must keep an eye.  Unfortunately, however, the Government's display is to lie down in front of them and state there might be unforeseen consequences for the industry.  There is no doubt that the industry lobbies the likes of the Minister to ensure it will keeps its lucrative position through its proposals to continue offshore drilling and gas.  A Bill will be brought before a committee in the next while, but by abstaining on these proposals the Government is ignoring the fact that the world needs to move to renewables.  Ignoring this issue means that the plastic industry will refuse to recognise the social and political demand on the citizens of this planet to do something about it.  It behoves the Government to take the lead on this matter.</p>  <p>  The previous Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, said the Bill might have unforeseen consequences for the waste management industry through losing profits and possibly having to pass on the cost to people who pay their bin charges.  We must reject this.  This is the industry of Tony Soprano, in which there is cut-throat competition, that makes vast profits and keeps companies offshore.  We do not even get to see its profits, but it pushes up costs all the time, which is why it is important that we begin to make the argument that waste management must be taken back under public control in order that it will be accountable.  The systems used in Scandinavian countries and even in cities across America must be implemented by a publicly accountable body, not by a waste management industry about which the Minister seems to be so concerned that he will not issue a money message.</p></speech>

I really hope that he hits the ground running because we have no choice, but I am a little doubtful after listening to him tonight.  He spoke about waiting until he had stacked up the evidence, and how he cannot impose costs and that he will abstain but there is no abstention in climate change; there is no more waiting to stack up the evidence, the evidence is overwhelming.  As repeatedly pointed out in this Chamber, the day before the budget we learned of the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that makes clear that there is no safe level of global warming.  It highlights the urgency that pertains to climate change, that climate change is a problem for the here and now and that we, as policy makers, must do something and have the conviction to do something. </p> <p> All the figures have been quoted on plastic itself.  We know there is an area three times the size of France, that 13 million tonnes of plastic end up in the world's oceans, that plastic pollution damages our marine environments and the cost is like Monopoly money, &euro;8 billion.  We know from the World Economic Forum that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the sea.  Costs differ depending on to whom one listens.  The Climate Action Network Europe has told us that non-compliance costs &euro;500 million.  The senior fellow at the Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA has told us that the costs will be &euro;3.7 billion, or &euro;5.5 billion by 2030.  I could go on, but the most fundamental statistic is that it is the poorer people who will suffer the most, the same people who contribute least to climate change.  Nevertheless, we are sitting here with another Minister and a budget that utterly failed to recognise the urgency of the action needed in climate change.  Our legislation, our mitigation plan and action did not come from nowhere; we were forced into all that legislation as we will be forced into passing the Bill being brought forward by the Green Party.  That is because we have to do it, we have absolutely no choice.  We signed up under the Paris Agreement along with 195 other countries.  Every single monitoring body tells us we are failing in our commitment.  The Taoiseach spoke of the challenge of Brexit but I would say that pales into insignificance compared with the challenge posed by climate change.  If this Government does not recognise that we will be in serious trouble.</p> <p> The clock is ticking so I will finish, but I hope the Minister has the sense to realise that delay is no longer acceptable.</p></speech>

I expected more from him.  Climate and the environment is one of the defining issues facing human kind over the coming period.  As the IPCC noted, it is something that Governments will have to be responsible for.  I support the Green Party waste management Bill as it is a no-brainer, it has to be done.</p>  <p>  The documentary "Drowning in Plastic" exposes the global consequences of plastic, focusing on marine plastic and its movement into the food chain.  In it, the presenter, Liz Bonnin asks if we can turn the tide before it is too late.  She observes the devastating effects of plastic debris in different parts of the world, from the USA to Indonesia.  She reminds us that every minute consumers buy 1 million plastic bottles, 1 million disposable cups and 2 million plastic bags, because we do not have choices as individuals, that is what is on offer to us.  Every minute, plastic finds its way into our rivers and seas which results in over 8 million tonnes going into the marine environment.  That is the evidence which is stacked up, the evidence of what we as humans will face in time.  Ms Bonnin looks at a number of species during the programme.  I do not know if the Minister has seen it.  It opens with the flesh-footed shearwater birds.  We see birds vomiting whole pieces of plastic, including bottle caps, after the parents have mistaken debris for food and fed it to their chicks.  This causes malfunctions in the reproductive system and their ability to fly and ultimately leads to malnourishment and death.  That is equal to 10 kg of plastic in a human's stomach.  That is what some animals face today.  With other sea life also mistaking plastic bags for jellyfish and microplastics for fish eggs or algae, plastic is becoming a deadly part of the food chain.  Ms Bonnin also notes the recent scientific discovery that plastic is the perfect carrier for deadly bacteria that causes cholera in humans.  Meanwhile 300,000 marine mammals and more than 400,000 sea birds are killed annually after being entangled by fishing nets, something that has brought the North-Atlantic right whale particularly close to extinction, while for fishermen, depending on low-cost methods in order to make a living, plastic often seems like their only option for durable fishing rope.  </p>  <p>  However, even if people want to change their attitude towards waste, it is not always easy.  An estimated 2 million people worldwide do not have access to proper waste management and can only throw their rubbish on their doorstep or in nearby waterways.  Who is to blame for this?  Is it the local authorities who do not provide facilities for waste disposals or the big corporations which sell heavily packaged small quantities of modern essentials such as shampoo and toothpaste to countries which are unable to dispose of them sustainably?  I blame big corporations.</p>  <p>  I agree that individuals cannot solve this issue but I support the part of the Bill that provides for a deposit return scheme.  That is something we can do.  However, the key is to ban single-use non-recyclable, non-compostable plastic tableware and so on.  Industry and corporations must be challenged to introduce alternatives to plastic.  Are we protecting Repak?  Coca Cola pay into Repak, and having paid their blood money continue to bring out cans and material that cannot be recycled.  I call on the Government to introduce the money message and acknowledge Friends of the Earth, Voice Ireland and Uplift which has run a campaign and secured a large number of signatures to petition this Government.</p></speech>

I have congratulated the Minister and the Minister of State privately but I want to do so publicly here and wish them every good luck in their new roles.</p>  <p>  The issue of plastics is a great concern to all of us.  We want to protect the environment, the human inhabitants of the world as well as our wildlife.  We have seen the horrors of the programme that showed what is happening in our seas.  It is horrific beyond belief.  </p>  <p>  As a small retailer for a good number of years, I have seen first hand the benefits of the small charge that was introduced for plastic bags.  I acknowledge that it was a culture changing event.  However, again as a small shopkeeper, I see first hand the amount of unnecessary plastics used in the packaging and delivery of the goods that we consume.  There is no need for half of the plastic, indeed there is probably not a need for even 15% or 20% of the plastic that we use daily.  We need something like the culture changing event that took place when people had to pay for plastic bags.  They stopped using them overnight.  Now it is an unusual thing for a person to say that they want a plastic bag, but it is usually for a genuine reason, such as there being lots of small things falling around, and they need the convenience.  However, I believe we can go further than we went on that occasion and that each one of us can do an awful lot more.  </p>  <p>  I compliment our farmers who are so conscientious with silage plastic, where it is bundled up and recycled, and put to very good uses such as rubber mats for underneath animals.  Our farming community is doing this already and we as ordinary consumers can do it much more and to greater effect.  </p><p> Walking the beaches of west Clare, it is absolutely amazing to see the amount of plastic washed up on them.  This takes a huge toll on our marine environment, our fish stocks and on human health.  It is thought that we are in possession of a single use plastic item for at most 15 minutes, but it takes decades or centuries for that plastic item to degrade, be it plastic cups, straws, plastic wrapping on containers or vegetables and other food stuffs, and also the wrapping on consumer items such as children's toys.  The town of Kilkee in west Clare engaged in a very interesting initiative this summer called "Keep Kilkee Plastic Free".  Businesses in Kilkee committed to avoiding the use of plastic and the sale of plastic to visitors and residents.  They banned the use of plastic coffee cups and straws.  Financial incentives were given to businesses to participate, and waste segregation bins were installed in Kilkee by Clare County Council.  It is estimated that 10,000 litres of recyclable material was diverted away from landfill.  Such voluntary action is very effective.</p> <p> Plastic pollution is a visible sign that we are living in an unsustainable fashion.  The iconic scientist and cosmologist, Stephen Hawking, predicted that we will destroy our environment in years to come and that it will be impossible for human life to continue on earth.  We are talking about the future generations, our children and our grandchildren and generations beyond them.  Supermarkets are waking up to the issue and are beginning to ban plastic usage.  They are taking plastic wrappings off vegetables and banning plastic cutlery on shelves.  Apart from voluntary avoidance of single plastic use, and apart from the new industries that are now being set up to introduce compostable alternatives, political will is required to introduce legislation or to enact legislation that is already in place which will ban and underpin the use of single use plastics.</p></speech>

I wish them well, and every good luck.  I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on this very important topic.  We all know that there is too much plastic around.  It is a demon, and it is hard to control.  As a publican I can see that plastic is everywhere, and it is hard to understand why we need so much of it.  A few years ago every bottle in the pub was made of glass.  They were all refundable, and if one gave out a few bottles for a station or something similar one made sure to get them back again.  The bottles where noted wherever they went so that they could be retrieved.  We have moved away from that.  There was nothing wrong with that system.  The bottles were brought back, washed and reused.  Today bottles are either made of plastic or glass, but they are non-returnable.  Coke bottles do not go back.  Lucozade bottles are not wanted back by the companies.  Many of the cider bottles are made from plastic.  Six-packs are wrapped up in plastic and the bottles are non-returnable, as are sparkling water bottles and Smirnoff Ice bottles.  People have no interest in bringing them back and publicans do not want to go out and get their bottles back.</p>  <p>  We have a great facility now where one can go into any shop and get a cup of tea no matter where it is.  In most shops in most rural villages one can get a cup of tea, but we are inclined to bring away a plastic cup.  People should be encouraged and incentivised to bring their own cups and reuse it all the time.</p></speech>

I confirm that I support it, and commend the Green Party for bringing the Bill forward again.  The Bill was initiated almost two years ago, and it was passed here at Second Stage on 20 June 2017.  It was then discussed on Committee Stage.  The Bill had strong, significant, indeed overwhelming support here in the Chamber, and indeed on Committee Stage.  However, the Bill has been effectively blocked by the Government, particularly by the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his refusal to issue a money message.  It appears from the speech made by the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, this evening, that that stance will continue.  In my view it is absolutely shameful.  It is anti-democratic.  The Bill has been discussed by the House, supported by the House, and has been supported on Committee Stage.  There is no doubt that any attempt to block the Bill is anti-democratic and should be reversed.  I appeal to the Minister, on the basis of democracy, to allow this Bill to continue.</p>  <p>  This is not the only issue on which the Government takes this very cynical approach.  It allows a motion or a Bill to progress through the House or to Second Stage and then cynically stops it in its tracks.  It has happened recently on the issue of the closure of post offices.  In October 2016 this Chamber was unanimous in opposing the closure of post offices.  This included members of the Government parties at the time.  However, in the last number of months An Post has adopted a policy of closing numerous post offices.  Some have closed already and further post offices will close.  It also happened, and continues to happen, on the issue of housing.  The Chamber has supported calls to declare an emergency in the area of housing, but the Government is cynically stopping that provision from being put in place.  I appeal to the Minister to allow democracy to take its course and to allow this Bill to go forward.  </p>  <p>  There are two particular elements in the Bill.  One is the ban on disposable, non-compostable tablewear.  The sale or free distribution of disposable plastic cups, glasses, plates and other tableware would be banned from 1 January 2020.  The other element is the deposit and return schemes.  The Bill states that by 1 July 2019 the Minister shall make regulations in exercise of his powers to provide for a deposit and return scheme for containers in which beverages are sold.  Those two elements are absolutely necessary; they are eminently common-sense measures.  They may make a really positive impact on tackling the question of plastic waste.  This Bill, as other speakers have said, is supported not just by Tidy Towns committees and Friends of the Earth, which has gathered approximately 15,000 signatures, but I believe there is a huge majority in the country and among the public for supporting the measures set out in this Bill.</p><p>The measures contained in it have been tried and tested successfully in many other countries.  Plastic is devastating our seas, our animals and the environment.  It is in the human food chain and is effectively polluting our bodies.  Significant volumes of packaging are being produced.  Anyone who goes to a supermarket, for example, will find they are inundated with plastic packaging.  Not too long ago, there was not much of this packaging.  We did not need it then and we do not need it now.  Much of this plastic packaging, coming from fossil fuels such as oil and gas, is not recyclable.</p> <p> The measures outlined in this motion are necessary and sensible, having been tried and tested in other jurisdictions.  They have the support of the majority of the population.  The sooner the Government agrees to allow these measures to take their course, the better.</p> <p> Waste collection services have been privatised in recent years.  This has created a disastrous situation throughout the country.  This privatisation should be reversed with local authorities allowed to recommence waste collection as a public service.</p> <p> I support the motion and hope the Minister and Government will change their minds, act in a democratic fashion and allow the measures contained in this motion take their course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="22:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300056#DDD00200"><p>Plastic waste is an emotive topic and rightly provokes passionate debate.  People are concerned about the proliferation of plastics in our lives and the impacts, known and unknown, of plastic leaking into our water and food systems.  Plastic, however, is not bad in its own right.  The development of plastic has facilitated enormous advances across engineering, human health and energy efficiency.  Lightweight and durable, plastic even plays a role in reducing the carbon footprint of transport and food production.  However, we need to be selective about how we use plastic.  We need to ensure we use it only where necessary, reuse it where possible and recycle for further and repeated use.</p>  <p>  Tackling the negative impacts of plastic on our environment is a national and global challenge.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to work collectively and internationally to protect our environment but to ensure we also maximise our potential for meaningful and sustainable improvement at home.  As a small country in a global economy, our membership of the EU gives us a seat at a table where internationally significant policies are developed.  In recent years, the EU has rolled out innovative new plans and strategies to help transition our economies from a linear model of take-make-dispose to a circular model where nothing goes to waste and resources are properly valued through efficient use and reuse.  The EU&rsquo;s circular economy action plan recognises the central part that plastics play in a modern economy.  The plastics strategy delivered this year was a key deliverable of the action plan and sets out how the European economy can address the challenge of plastic throughout the value chain across its full life cycle.</p>  <p>  Central to the strategy is a commitment to work towards ensuring all plastic packaging is recyclable by 2030.  Many of the measures recommended in the plastic strategy are well embedded into Irish resource management.  These measures include the existing extended producer responsibility schemes run by Repak and the Irish Farm Films Producers Group, the landfill levy, the plastic bag levy, as well as robust enforcement around illegal dumping and landfilling.</p>  <p>  More needs to be done, however.  The new recycling targets agreed earlier this year as part of the EU&rsquo;s circular economy legislative package demand we raise our game once again.  Ireland has come a long way in recent years to become one of Europe&rsquo;s top performers in waste management.  We need to build on this success in an informed and deliberate manner.  Rushing to introduce a deposit and refund scheme, as proposed in the Private Members&rsquo; motion, without a considered basis for action risks jeopardising the progress made.</p>  <p>  Business is also playing its part in this process.  As Ireland&rsquo;s approved compliance scheme for packaging, Repak has overseen growth in all aspects of its activity, membership numbers, tonnages recycled and recovered, as well as supporting its members in more efficient use of packaging and preventing waste.  Repak recently launched a plastic packaging strategy for its members.  The strategy sets out a response to the challenge of doubling the recycling of plastic packaging by 2030.</p>  <p>  Similarly, we must support consumers in their efforts to do the right thing around plastic recycling.  The national recycling list awareness campaigns and recycling ambassador programme help ensure these valuable materials are used as a resource for our communities and economy rather than being wasted.  People have demonstrated a strong interest in doing the right thing and knowing how to do it.  The national recycling list has put together a list of everyday household items suitable for recycling and will be accepted by every waste collection company throughout the State.  Not only does this campaign help improve the quality and, therefore, the value of our recyclate stock, this campaign is also empowering people to become active participants in our recycling society.</p>  <p>  As referred to in the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement, the first legislative proposal to emerge on foot of the plastics strategy is the proposal for a directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, commonly referred to as the single use plastic, SUP, proposal.  This is an ambitious and far-reaching proposal which aims to tackle the ten most prevalent single use plastic products found in Europe&rsquo;s marine environment, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear.  The proposal provides for the banning of certain single use plastics and the setting of targets for reducing the consumption of others.  It places clear obligations on producers and industry to contribute towards the costs of waste management, awareness raising and the clean-up of certain items.  While it points member states towards deposit and refund schemes as a means of achieving higher collection rates of plastics, it is not prescriptive and allows member states devise solutions suitable for their national territory.</p>  <p>  The proposed national study into how Ireland can achieve higher collection and recycling rates for plastic and aluminium drinks containers specifically has to be central in informing our next steps.  Talks around the implementation of the single use plastics legislation at European level are progressing rapidly, driven in no small part by the overwhelming desire of European citizens for EU governments to take effective action now.  Ultimately, industry, government and consumers alike must all work together to tackle the problem now for the sake of future generations.</p>  <p>  In the area of marine plastic, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, will be bringing in a Bill to prohibit the manufacturing, selling, importing or exporting of cosmetics, personal care products, detergents and scouring agents containing plastic microbeads which are liable to be washed into wastewater systems with the potential to reach our rivers, lakes and seas.  This is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  The Government encourages a high level of political and citizen engagement in matters relating to the environment.  Ultimately, it is the environment that sustains us all and we are all stakeholders in its protection.</p><p>While Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s Bill is well intended and genuinely motivated, we all need to pull in the one direction.  The Government intends to build on our strong waste performance record to achieve and exceed the targets set down in European legislation.  Any policy changes to be introduced need to be evidence based and soundly costed.  Making fundamental changes to our existing collection system may undermine the achievements made to date.  The Government understands the urgency behind the improvements required and the Minister has committed to ensuring a speedy conclusion to the deliberations required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="22:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300057#EEE00200"><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, well.  I agree that we all have to pull together to turn this country green.  I was struck by the Minister's comment that he was of the old ESRI school.  The ESRI school of economics will not be sufficient today.  Last weekend in Helsinki, a 15 year old Swedish schoolgirl named Greta spoke very well about climate change.  She said we cannot save the world by playing by the existing rules because the rules have to change.  The rules of economics have to change.  What we value and how we price, qualify and measure natural resources and their use in the economic system must fundamentally and radically change.  The Bill will not do this but it is part of the change.  In her speech, Greta said the politics needed to prevent the climate catastrophe do not exist today.  I hope we can prove her wrong and I hope we can be inspired by the vision of what a 15 year old stated we need to do to show we can deliver in politics.</p>  <p>  I have listened to the contributions.  We had this debate a year and a half ago when climate was not mentioned so much.  It was all about natural protection.  It is right to introduce the Waste Reduction Bill because the Oireachtas climate action committee is starting to realise the scale of the change we need to make, not just in energy but also transport and land use, and how far off course we are in this country.  We must also move towards a circular economy whereby we use materials less and really wisely.  This is complex.  It is true that sometimes one might switch from plastic to paper and the paper might have a significant carbon footprint also.  We need to use less, use things cleverly and do things with this perspective in mind in changing everything.  We will need a different understanding of economics.</p>  <p>  I stand by the Bill.  I heard various people state they would like to change it this way or that.  I would love to have a debate on Committee Stage as to what would be changed.  To be honest, I would not change it much because it is good legislation.  We would change the original section we included on a ban on single use plastic cups.  We accepted the legal advice that it might be difficult and that a levy would work just as well.  The Minister and Department seem to agree with us on this.  That is the one amendment I would make.  However, I disagree with the Minister as I believe we could introduce the ban.  We received much legal advice from our Oireachtas legal support and, having listened extensively to it, I believe the Bill stands up legally.  In fact, it is in touch with what is going on in the European Commission.  We will be out of the legal order if we do not apply these measures.</p>  <p>  Some people have stated the Bill needs to be much more detailed and longer.  I disagree.  The statutory instrument that introduced a ban on smoking in public spaces is very short.  How extensive was the statutory instrument that introduced the levy on plastic bags?  It, too, is very short.  This Bill is similar.  It is of the same school of legislation as the plastic bag levy and the smoking ban.  It is absolutely appropriate for us to make a political decision.  We introduced a smoking ban with short legislation.  We introduced a levy on plastic bags with short legislation.  A ban on single use plastics is absolutely correct and valid.  This is political rather than technical legislation because, just like the previous levies when the Waste Management Act 1996 was used for the plastic bag levy and the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 was used for the smoking ban, our Bill uses existing provisions in the 1996 Waste Management Act which, we believe, gives us all of the tools we need to do what we seek to achieve.  I would love to have a debate on Committee Stage with someone who disagrees with this analysis or thinks a ream of other legislation needs to be written to deliver the objectives we seek.  I hear no one here disagreeing with this.</p>  <p>  The closing remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, were very similar to much of what I heard from industry about how great and good we are.  I am sorry but we are not good enough.  I heard a representative of Repak, not the individual companies but the spokesperson for the organisation, admitting this and that the entire system needs to change.  The line is put out by the Department that we are exceptionally good in this country because we have a brilliant producer responsibility scheme that other countries such as the US, Australia and Germany do not have.  I am sorry but there needs to be an acknowledgement that the current system will not deliver the higher recycling rates we need.</p>  <p>  The only disagreement we have on this is how much analysis we need on the 90% recycling target.  The Minister said the Government will accept the target and my understanding is that the Government will promote it in the European Council and trilogue process.  I presume this is done on some analysis and we are not just promising to do it in Europe without having some consideration as to how we might do it.  The consideration has been done thanks to Mindy O'Brien of Voice Ireland, as well as Friends of the Earth, the Green Party research team which has done very good work on this, Dr. Dominic Hogg of Eunomia who is the best expert we brought before the committee, and the European Commission which has spent the past two or three years examining this in great detail.  We are not flying blind without research having been done.  If we commit to a 90% recycling target at the European Council tomorrow, as I understand Irish parliamentarians are ready to do, how will that target be achieved through anything other than a deposit refund scheme?  I have asked this question previously and I have not received an answer.  I ask it again this evening.  If Ministers and their officials have another method of doing it and want to send me a written answer to this question tomorrow, I would love to hear it but I do not believe it exists.</p>  <p>  This is the only point of contention and difference because, as I understand it, there is agreement on a ban on single use plastic knives, forks and plates.  This has been the case in the committee.  I understand there is also agreement on the introduction of a levy and a move towards compostable materials.  We must be careful about this technology as there are all sorts of definitions of what materials can be used to make a cup.  For this reason, the Bill will not introduce a smoking ban or achieve an end to plastic bags tomorrow.  It states we will have three or four years to work out the mechanics of what exactly are the materials we want to promote.  No one is disagreeing with the fundamental intention.  The only disagreement is on the deposit refund scheme.  The Government does not have a valid answer to the question as to what else it would do but it is banging its chest in Europe stating it is part of the 90% team.  It would be more honest and more appropriate for us to state today that we will proceed to Committee Stage and, in the same way we introduced the smoking ban and the plastic bag levy, that we want to give a political signal.  It would be fairer to industry and all of the shops, caf&eacute;s and people to give this political signal.  Sometimes this is what we need legislation to do.  Our legislation does it in an absolutely correct way as part of a legal and European-supported process.</p>  <p>  If the Minister states he will come back to us and prove he is willing to do this, I have a question.  How long will it take the Department to come around and state it is willing to give this signal?  How long will Fine Gael take?  Will the Minister come back to us within a matter of weeks and state he has done the review and he thinks it is time for us to give that signal?  It is not that we need to have the entire mechanics of the new system in place.  That will take a couple of years.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>How many weeks will it take the Government to give the all clear and issue a money message in order that the Bill can move to Committee Stage, proceed through the Houses and provide the people with another good news story on the environment?  We are good at this.  All that is missing is the new politics about which the young Swedish girl to whom I refer spoke in Helsinki last week.</p></speech>

Large chains of betting shops are able to absorb betting duty through a reduction in profit rather than passing the cost to consumers and some can cross-subsidise it through their online profits.  For the information of the officials who are with the Minister of State, an examination of the accounts of a small betting shop over a two-year period show that it will have a betting duty liability of over &euro;340,000 for each year, an amount that significantly greater than its profit margin.  An unintended consequence of the increase, if it is not passed on directly to the consumer, is that the smaller outlets will suffer but the bigger operators will quite easily absorb it into their cost base.  I ask that this be addressed or that there be an indication by the Government regarding how the measure will work because we must try to speak for the smaller, independent high-street outlets, particularly the intergenerational or family interests which are rapidly going out of business because their cost base is increasing dramatically.</p>  <p>  Section 51 looks a little like a sop to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  Some &euro;320,000 of an inheritance will now be tax free, up from &euro;310,000, at an annual cost of &euro;8.1 million.  If the extra &euro;10,000 were taxable at 33% under capital acquisitions tax, this would yield &euro;3,333 per transaction.  Dividing the &euro;8.1 million annual cost by that &euro;3,333 yield per transaction indicates that approximately 2,430 people will benefit annually from this tax cut.  One can bet that these individuals are in the top tiers of society in terms of income and wealth.  It will not be ordinary people who will benefit from this measure but, rather, those who have real wealth.</p>  <p>  On capital acquisitions tax, section 50 seems to deal with tax avoidance such that people with a beneficial interest in a dwelling held by a trust will not be able to avail of a tax exemption on inheritance tax.  It would be good to know more about that provision.  Is there routine tax avoidance by wealthy individuals who own multiple properties and set up such discretionary trusts to avoid their children being subject to inheritance or gift taxes?  I would like to hear more on this proposal.</p></speech>

I put to the Taoiseach that all 11 or 12 budgets introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael during the decade or more of austerity were accompanied by Finance Bills which provided for continually massive tax expenditures.  I refer to briefing paper 13 of 2018 by our diligent and excellent Parliamentary Budget Office, which estimated basic tax expenditure costs at over &euro;5 billion in 2016, rising from &euro;4.7 billion in 2014.  Of course, the Department of Finance only began reporting on these vast expenditures in 2014.  Members received the Department&rsquo;s report on the 2017 expenditures on the day after the budget was introduced as opposed to with the rest of the documents relating to the budget.</p>  <p>  Data on these expenditures are deficient and many of them have not been subjected to review for many years in spite of the recommendations of the 2009 report of the Commission on Taxation.  The scale of the expenditures is remarkable.  For example, the research and development tax credit cost an estimated &euro;670 million in 2016, capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief cost &euro;141 million in 2017 and a range of reliefs supporting business cost nearly &euro;560 million in 2015.  The Parliamentary Budget Office rightly declares that tax expenditures represent a departure from the equity principle of taxation and that an illusory fiscal effect is produced when such expenditures are perceived as tax cuts as opposed to what they are, namely, spending increases.</p>  <p>  When I survey the Bill, it reminds me - as has been the case with every Finance Bill introduced since I became a Member of the House - of the vast scope of tax expenditures provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and developed over the years leading to this point.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will argue, as he did earlier in the day, that much of the Bill is an attempt to close out tax loopholes and strengthen anti-tax avoidance measures.  However, the sheer detail of section 23, which addresses tax relief for investment in corporate trades, section 24, which includes amendments to tax relief for investment in films, and section 25, which implements Articles 7 and 8 of EU Directive 2016/1164, makes it very difficult for ordinary citizens to assess the net costs and benefits to the Exchequer.  The presentation of the budget and the Finance Bill must be addressed in a far more transparent and open manner.</p>  <p>  The Minister tried to quantify income tax and some other changes on budget day.  However, I seek clarity regarding the Government estimate of the tax expenditures included in the Finance Bill and, indeed, overall tax expenditures in 2017 and likely expenditures in 2018.  I read the 2017 report, which focused on a number of major expenditures rather than providing an overall view of what current tax expenditures amount to.</p>  <p>  The greatest anger directed at the Government in the recent weeks in the context of the budget relates to section 21, which provides for the amendment of section 97 of the principal Act regarding computational rules and allowable deductions.  Under section 21, residential landlords will be permitted to deduct from their rental income 100% of the interest on a loan used to purchase, improve or repair rental residential premises.  Up to this year, the relief was capped at 85% of such interest.  Section 97 (2J) currently allows for a loan interest cap of 90% for 2019 and 95% for 2020.  Why was this change a priority for the Government in light of the continuing relentless rise in domestic household rents and the its ideological refusal to address the fundamental issue of supply of housing, which should be driven by State and local authority direct development and construction?  The Residential Tenancies Board annual report for 2017 shows that almost 50,000 landlords control two or more tenancies.  This tax relief is squarely aimed at those hugely profitable businesses rather than the so-called accidental landlords spoken of lyrically by a colleague of the Minister of State opposite, namely, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local  Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Will the Minister of State outline the cost of this concession in tax expenditure terms and provide an estimate of the total cost of section 97 (2J) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997?  Section 21 of the Bill is just another example of how Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il remain completely in thrall to their big property and landlord backers and, indeed, to the Members of this House who are landlords and who, therefore, have something of a vested interest in the matter.</p>  <p>  Generally, I welcome section 22, which finally begins the process of regulating short-term lettings.</p><p>Many constituents believe that Airbnb lettings could not have been tax exempt under the rent-a-room scheme introduced by Charlie McCreevy where a householder can earn up to &euro;14,000 per year tax free from renting out a room in their house.  The new "28-day rule" provided for in section 22 amending section 216A of the 1997 Act states that the room must be rented out for at least 28 days and expressly excludes short-term lettings from the incentive.  Last month, AirBnb reported that 640,000 guests used AirBnb in Ireland during the summer months.  It has been estimated that this and other regulatory measures will return around at least 1,000 units to longer-term rental use.</p> <p> The changes to the USC and standard rate and home carer credit in sections 3, 4 and 5 are also welcome.  In my own pre-budget submission to the Minister, which we called "A Budget For All Our People", I asked for an increase of &euro;1,000 to &euro;35,550 and &euro;44,550 in the income tax standard rate bands, which was costed at &euro;168 million in the first year and &euro;195 million in a full year.  I argued that it would alleviate current economic pressures on individuals and families who are genuinely hard-pressed to make ends meet.  I thank the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for providing a facility for those of us on the Opposition benches to cost some of the ideas we had and some of the ideas we thought were coming forward in the budget.  This was very valuable and we are grateful for it.  I also believed that a modest increase in income tax credits - perhaps at a cost of &euro;100 million - would have further encouraged hard-working citizens and their families.  Given the serious risks Ireland faces in 2019, I thought that a modest indexation of USC rate bands and exemption limits at a cost of perhaps &euro;40 million might have been preferable to a further cut in rates, as advocated by Fianna F&aacute;il and which is now before us, so I welcome sections 3 and 4 in this context.  I note that the budget estimated the USC cuts at &euro;123 million in a full year and the increase of &euro;750 in the income tax standard rate band at &euro;161 million in a full year.</p> <p> Budget 2019 was generally very disappointing to citizens with disabilities.  The &euro;150 million or so that the Government came forward with seems to have been about addressing the demographics of our citizens with disabilities rather than introducing the cost of caring.  The informal Oireachtas committee on disability estimated it would cost &euro;20 per week.  All the Minister did this year was set up a study that will cost &euro;300,000.  However, I  welcome the increase in the home carer tax credit from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500.  I also welcome sections 5 and 6 with regard to compensation payments for the victims of the Magdalen laundries and others and benefit-in-kind relief for our Defence Forces with regard to accommodation and medical treatment.</p> <p> The Minister deliberately avoided increasing carbon taxes in budget 2019 or even addressing the disparity between petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles.  Section 9 does extend the exemption for electric vehicles down to the end of 2021, although it rightly applies a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption.</p> <p> Section 11 amends section 128F of the 1997 Act which provides for favourable tax treatment of share options granted under the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  We have heard a lot about this programme in the past year from the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister.  One of the questions I submitted for oral parliamentary questions is whether the Minister for Finance will indicate how many companies and employees availed of KEEP so far in 2018 and what impact he expects to result from his proposed changes to the scheme in 2019.  Media reports have called the programme "woefully unsuccessful".  There has been an inference, which the Minister of State might be able to confirm, that not even one company had applied for this tax relief.  The Minister acknowledged the low take up during his own speech on budget 2019 saying that he was "taking early action" to address it.  Of course, KEEP was introduced last year with the Finance Act 2017 and section 128F of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided that gains realised on the exercise of qualifying KEEP options by employees and directors will not be subject to income tax, USC or PRSI where the requirements of section 128F of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are satisfied.  However, capital gains tax is payable on the disposal of the shares.  Section 11 now replaces the &euro;250,000 limit in any three consecutive years of assessment with a lifetime limit of &euro;300,000 and the limit of 50% of the annual emoluments in the year of assessment is now being increased to 100% of the annual emoluments so it will be interesting to see how these changes pan out.</p> <p> Under section 56, from 1 January 2019, there will be significant changes to the operation of PAYE under the modernisation programme that has been undertaken by Revenue.  Employers will now need to calculate and report on the pay and deductions of their employees as they are being paid in real time.  It is said that this modernisation will improve the transparency and accuracy of the PAYE system.  It is expected that approximately 200,000 employers will have to implement these changes, the biggest change in reporting in around 60 years.  Of course, the first deadline of 31 October is fast approaching.  From some of the feedback we have received, there does not seem to have been sufficient communication with, and assistance to, employers in getting ready for these changes.  Perhaps the Minister might address this.  Those employers who have not yet engaged with Revenue and who miss the first deadline of 31 October will be contacted by Revenue.  Even then, it appears that the take up has been very low.  It is heartening that the changes in section 77 and Schedule 1 of the Finance Act 2017 will require employers to file a monthly USC return alongside the current requirement to file an income tax return.  Of course, the additional superannuation contribution will also be payable by public servants in accordance with Part 4 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 starting on 1 January 2019.</p> <p> In my own pre-budget submission, I urged an increase in betting duty from 1% to 3%, which would have yielded &euro;156 million in a full year.  I also believed that Ireland should at least begin to equalise the levels of excise on petrol and diesel and I note that even a modest 5 cent increase in diesel excise would have yielded &euro;165 million in a full year.  In the event, section 33 increases betting duty to 2% for bookmakers and remote bookmakers - I note the arrangements for remote betting intermediaries - which the budget books estimate will raise nearly &euro;52 million.  Section 35 does, of course, introduce a 1% VRT surcharge for diesel engine passenger vehicles from 1 January next and is estimated to raise &euro;25 million in a full year.</p> <p> Based on the booming state of the hospitality industry, the Department of Finance assessment report, which we read carefully in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and the strong arguments advanced by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I argued in my own pre-budget 2019 submission that the VAT rate could be generally increased to 11% or 11.5% and the latter rate would have raised an additional &euro;289 million for the Exchequer.  Since the Minister and his Fine Gael Government were so averse to any significant effort to broaden the tax base by requiring more tax contributions from the very highest paid cohorts - I recommended changes for those earning over &euro;120,000, particularly those earning over &euro;150,000 - or to any initial steps to broaden carbon-related taxation, the Minister ultimately decided in one go to jump back to the 13.5% VAT rates for the hospitality sector and related businesses in a single budget in section 41 before us in the Finance Bill 2018.  Like other Deputies, I have received serious complaints from small restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and other businesses that feel that given the anxieties about the effect of Brexit on tourism, the Minister might have adopted a phased or stepped approach to this change.  I note and welcome the continuation of 9% for newspapers and the new paragraph 7A in Schedule 3 of the Valued-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, which applies to electronic publications.  What does the Minister estimate will be the net additional revenues for the Exchequer in 2019 arising from section 41?  I note that a colleague who spoke earlier attributed the changes in section 51 to the influence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport but we heard before the budget that there was a lot of canvassing from Fine Gael in respect of section 51 and that Fine Gael as a whole was very disappointed with the Minister's decision to increase the Group A tax-free threshold in respect of capital acquisition tax from &euro;310,000 to &euro;320,000.</p> <p> Many citizens will look at this Finance Bill and continue to be seriously worried at Ireland's great dependence on corporation taxes from a small number of huge foreign multinationals.</p><p>They are also deeply concerned that the strong perception that the tax avoidance industry will remain untroubled by this Bill and that Ireland continues to be referred to as a tax haven in international studies like those conducted by Oxfam and others.  While providing strong incentives for start-ups, section 23, which, with sections 24 and 25, makes up the bulk of the Bill before us, seems to include a serious attempt by the Department of Finance and Revenue to tighten up reliefs in schemes like the employment investment incentive, EII, scheme and the start-up relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, scheme.  I also note the anti-avoidance provisions, that there seems to be provision for clawback of incorrect self-certified returns, and that EII and SURE are extended to the end of 2021.  What are the latest estimates for tax expenditures under this section and the likely overall impact of these changes, including on promoting jobs, because that is what it should be about, which make up a large part of this Bill?</p> <p> Film tax expenditures cost nearly &euro;90 million in 2015.  I notice the time-limited, tapered regional reliefs in section 24.  How will they impact on tax expenditure?  Section 25 refers to controlled foreign companies and is said to be an anti-tax evasion measure.  The Minister said it is part of our international obligations under anti-tax evasion measures.  We voted on the new anti-tax avoidance directive rules on budget night and the D&aacute;il approved the 12.5% tax which many of us supported because we thought it was at least a start.  It is for unrealised gains where companies migrate or transfer assets offshore.  The Minister of State might explain how the new broadly based exit tax improves on what he called the pre-existing focused anti-avoidance exit charge that he referred to earlier tonight.  What is the difference resulting from this very long section?  The controlled foreign company rules in the detailed section 25 insert a new part 35B into the principal Act, but I notice that in the new chapter 3 there are very significant exemptions applied to the application of this new exit tax and perhaps the Minister will respond on the reasons behind such exemptions.  The Minister said tonight that these measures in section 25 fulfil our commitment under the corporation tax roadmap, but constituents will ask whether this section finally begins to address tax evasion structures such as, for example, the single malt and other devices to evade taxes in our jurisdiction.  That is something the Minister of State and the Minister might respond to as the debate proceeds.</p> <p> Many constituents are also alarmed by the recent reports from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD, showing the total foreign direct investment inflows to the State declined by &euro;71 billion in the first half of 2018.  This follows the so-called Trump tax reforms and highlights the failure of the Government to broaden the Irish tax base.  The Minister of State and the Minister might have had an opportunity to read the report entitled Budget 2019 - Issues for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas produced yesterday or the day before by the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO.  That report raises significant problems with the publication of the budget and of this Finance Bill 2018.  Besides querying whether the Minister has placed his total faith in an orderly Brexit and whether he is pursuing a countercyclical stance, the PBO raises important issues in the estimation of Votes.  For example, can we believe the amounts estimated for the Department of Health or the Department of Justice and Equality?  It has requested major improvements in the accessibility, accuracy and consistency in the reporting of budget information.  The PBO identifies several errors in the document entitled Budget 2019 - Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  Is the Department aware of this and beginning to address it?  It asks that, once the text has been amended, the corrected information should be laid before the Oireachtas.  It is a very serious charge that there are inaccuracies in documents presented to us along with the budget.  The PBO welcomes the announcement made in respect of green budgeting and also asks for much greater progress in respect of equality and gender budgeting.  We had a debate last Thursday on that matter.</p> <p> On some of the questions asked in that report, for example, the publication of a fully costed estimate for Brexit contingency measures, we are almost as vague as Theresa May's backbenchers on what will be the cost.  The Minister of State might say that she says the divorce deal is 95% done but what kind of money are we talking about?  Why are the Supplementary Estimates already included in Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the budget 2019 expenditure report?  The PBO asks why Supplementary Estimates which were not approved by this House should be included in that report.  Why, for example, is the Christmas bonus not included in the 2019 allocations?  Is that not misleading D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  I hope the Minister of State and the Minister will respond to these criticisms.  They are also very welcome to attend the Committee on Budgetary Oversight at an early date to answer all the questions rightly raised by the PBO.  There are several welcome measures in the Finance Bill 2018 but there are also huge lacunae and gaps, particularly on tax expenditure.  We need much fuller information and all the figures so that we can properly conduct the finances of the nation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="23:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300060#HHH00200"><p>I am pleased to speak on this Bill which seeks to give effect to the taxation changes announced on budget day.  The Bill also provides for the budget day announcements of a reduction to 4.5% in the 4.75% rate of universal social charge, USC, and an increase in the ceiling at which the 2% rate of USC is payable.  We know from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that income tax, including USC, is the largest individual source of tax revenue in Ireland, accounting for over 35% of the total.  Fluctuations in this source of revenue have a significant bearing on the total tax revenue.  The research also finds that income tax revenue automatically increases by 2% for every 1% increase in taxable income.  For USC, revenue automatically increases by 1.2% for every 1% increase in taxable income.  The results imply that income tax revenues are more sensitive to economic fluctuations than the revenue arising from USC.</p>  <p>  While this might appear to be a reason for the Government to leave the USC intact and not seek to abolish it, given how stable a source of income it is, I do think we need to reconsider that position given how hated the tax is among ordinary workers.  Hated is the proper adjective, and the Minister of State must know that.  It is hated, it is punitive and it is very hard on low-income earners.  It is a grossly and inherently unfair system.  It was introduced for a short time but, like everything else, it is a source of confidence and supply such as the Government has from Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is too cushy for the Government and it does not want to do anything with it for the ordinary people.  I would not expect much different from Fine Gael.</p>  <p>  I note that the Finance Bill also provides for an increase in the home carer tax credit and the earned income tax credit.  This will certainly bring partial relief to the many thousands of people who are affected but it most certainly does not go far enough.  Family Carers Ireland has described the budget as bitterly disappointing while acknowledging that the modest &euro;5 increase in weekly social welfare payments to some carers will be a small help.  It also accepts that other measures are a step in the right direction, such as the &euro;300 increase in the home carer tax credit, reduced prescription charges for those aged over 70, a &euro;150 million increase in funding for the badly needed disability services, &euro;55 million in additional funding for mental health services, which is very badly needed because there is an endemic mental health problem, and an extra &euro;20 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which will not go anywhere, with people languishing in all kinds of queues.  I hope the &euro;55 million for mental health care will be spent on mental health and that there will be a seismic shift towards spending it on therapies and counselling rather than, as most of it is at the moment, on pharmaceuticals and medicines.  We need a full re-evaluation of how we deal with mental health, not dishing out prescriptions willy-nilly and greasing the fat paws of those in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>  <p>  Family Carers Ireland also says that there are many family carers who may not have seen any benefit from this budget.  This is especially true for families juggling paid employment and a caring role, young carers and full-time carers who are not in receipt of carer's allowance due to means testing.  They do not get a shilling nor a cent.  This is an issue that must be dealt with, especially in light of the findings I highlighted earlier this year that found 7,041 people stated that they provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member.  That is a staggering figure and we are lucky to have them.  We should praise them and try to support them, not penalise them.</p><p>Where would our hospitals be if those 7,041 volunteers were not there?  We must look at that.</p> <p> There is another issue with disability in my county.  The initial finding that 138 carers in County Tipperary are aged under 15 is deeply concerning.  This situation demands immediate examination.  They are little more than children - little adolescents.  They should not be expected to be caring.  While it is certainly wonderful that they would be interested in caring or helping out, ag cabhr&uacute; leis na daoine aosta, it is not appropriate to have that burden placed on them.  They need to be in school and at play, involved in sport and other activities their siblings, colleagues and friends are doing, not having the arduous burden of having to care for others.  This is disgraceful.</p> <p> These statistics demonstrate the clear need for Government to prioritise and fully resource carers' needs.  It needs to ensure they are provided with every level of assistance possible, which is clearly not happening when young people feel obliged to do that.  While, as I said, it is good to look after their loved ones, they should not be the sole carer inhibiting their education, creativity, and participation in sport, music, song, dance, literature, theatre or any activity they enjoy.  They should not be tied into houses looking after people.</p> <p> With a sector of our society providing more than 250,000 hours of care every week - not every year - it is very clear that the work they are doing is of fundamental importance.  Without them how would our hospitals and nursing homes operate?  We would not cope if those 250,000 hours a week were not provided.  We need to show respect for that.  It is keeping people out of hospitals and keeping them where they are happiest in their homes where they can make a better recovery.  That needs to be reflected in the Government's approach to carers and their families in the future.  It is a missed opportunity.</p> <p> We also note from reports today by Eilish O'Regan that the people in need of HSE home-care packages are waiting for more than two years in some cases for the service while the average delay is three and a half months.  A damning new report reveals today that the current waiting list for home-care packages is 6,100.  Where is the Government's moral compass?  Has it sunk that low looking after the fat cats and everybody else that it ignores these people who have given so much service to the State?  They have paid their taxes, raised their families and housed themselves.  These people are waiting when they need it most when they are vulnerable, ill and feeble.  Some 6,100 are on a waiting list with some of them waiting up to two and a half years.</p> <p> Eilish O'Regan and other journalists have exposed this, but it is like water of a duck's back for the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and our Teflon Taoiseach, who is good for spin and PR.  As Deputy Naughten said when he resigned ten days ago, the Taoiseach is interested in optics rather than fibre optics and opinion polls rather than telecoms poles.  He has an obsession with that.  He had the audacity to put a &euro;5 million spin machine in place at the beginning of the year.  He, mar dhea, withdrew it, but we are not fooled; we know he still has it.  He is like a spinning top.  He keeps spinning until he goes out of control and he will fly off it some day in a heap, briste agus caillte.  It is disgraceful to have that kind of waiting list and the Government should be ashamed of it.</p> <p> It is reported that pensioners are finding it more difficult to access home care than was the case a decade ago.  The Minister of State and his colleagues have been in government for seven years.  When they came to office, it was a case of what they were not going to do while there but it is now more difficult for pensioners to access home-care packages than it was ten years ago.  What are we doing in this country?  Where are we going?  Where is the moral compass?  The Minister of State does not have it.  If he has it, it is in the soles of his shoes or someplace else?  It may be in a spin office up in Government Buildings.</p> <p> The findings are taken from an investigation by Care Alliance Ireland.  I salute the family carers and Catherine Cox.  I also salute Councillor Richie Molloy, a manager for family carers in south Tipperary.  Care Alliance Ireland executive director, Liam O&rsquo;Sullivan, estimated there is a gap of 18%, or 4 million care hours, between what is needed and the service people receive.  An bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it ag &eacute;isteacht?  Those are not my figures; they come from a director of Care Alliance Ireland, Liam O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The gap is not four, 40, 400 or 4,000, but 4 million care hours.  The Minister of State should hang his head in shame.  That is the gap between what is needed and the service people receive.  It is a staggering indictment of the Government and its services.</p> <p> The Taoiseach stood up this morning proclaiming that &euro;17 billion is allocated to the HSE, &euro;1 billion more than last year.  It was a great pronouncement.  However, that money is being syphoned off and going into a black hole.  The waste is staggering and yet the most vulnerable of all are 4 million care hours short.  We have plenty for the private care companies and the prices they charge.  That is what this Government is all about - looking after its friends in private places, looking after the retired HSE officials and Department officials who set up their own private services even though they created the gap when they were in the service and they are allowing their own businesses to thrive afterwards.  It is disgusting and I feel ashamed to be in any way associated with it.</p> <p> What has the Minister provided for in this Bill that will prevent this awful situation from getting any worse?  Ten years ago it was better.  I know we had a crash and a crisis.  During the last general election campaign all the Fine Gael talk was about recovery; that did not get it very far.</p> <p> The Finance Bill also provides for the change in the 9% VAT rate for hotels, restaurants and a range of other services to 13.5%, as well as a 50-cent increase in the excise duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes.  We should deal with the cigarettes in another situation.  People are addicted to them.  Increasing the excise duty every year is not helping the situation for some young people.</p> <p> However, the increase in the VAT was outrageous.  The Government was repeatedly warned.  As Deputy Broughan said earlier, Dublin hotels are booming - not all of them, but the majority of them.  However, anything outside the Pale is struggling.  It was reckless in the extreme to increase that rate of VAT.  The Government had all the warnings indicating that we are not having the same recovery.  The Minister of State should know that as he comes from the south east in Wexford, which is not having the same boom and madness as there is in this city.  It was stupid, foolish, shortsighted and patently wrong.</p> <p> We know the reaction to this measure has been one of dismay within the tourism sector.  In his budget address, the Minister said a review of the 9% VAT rate had found that the measure had done its job.  What job?  I remember a former Taoiseach with the slogan of "A lot done.  More to do."  What job?  It has done the job in Dublin.  Once Dublin is doing fine, to hell with rural Ireland.  The old saying of Oliver Cromwell to those in the Minister of State's county and my county of "to hell or to Connacht" prevails under this Government again.  It is back again as to hell or to Dublin - the high road or no road, an b&oacute;thar dorcha.  T&aacute; an b&oacute;thar glas i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath but it is not all rosy in Dublin; there are many problems with people homeless and people trying to get a bed for the night and people trying to survive with the cost of living.  We need only consider the cost of student accommodation and the disgraceful way they are being treated.  These are young people we want to nurture.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  The Government forgets about that all the time.</p> <p> The Minister said in the new economic reality it was appropriate to increase the rate of VAT in the tourism sector to 13.5% from January 2019.  This will raise &euro;466 million, which is a nice figure.  Let us consider the damage it will do to fledgling recovering trade in places like County Tipperary, in towns like Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Dungarvan and right up into Thurles, Nenagh, Borrisokane and all the smaller villages as well as the beautiful lake district in Tipperary and the famed Rock of Cashel.  We are increasing the numbers, but now we are going to kill it off.  The Minister could have increased it by 1 percentage point without being so greedy.  However, he would not listen to anybody.</p> <p> It may have done its job in some areas of Dublin and in particular the city centre, but it is absolutely the case that this measure is still needed in rural Ireland.  Why could the Minister of State not make that point or does he have no say?  Is all down to the sacred trio of Leo, Paschal and Eoghan, the three Dublin city slickers who hardly know where Naas is or where Monaghan is?</p><p>They know only about Dublin, selfies and spin and everything that goes with them.  It was a stupid decision.</p> <p> On stamp duty, section 46 of the Finance Bill 2018 provides for the extension of young trained farmer stamp duty relief for a further three years, until the end of 2021.  That is welcome.  Agriculture helped in the recovery of the economy after various recessions, but it has not done so this time because we are in dire straits.  The measure provides for a full exemption from stamp duty on transfers of farmland to certain young trained farmers.  The exemption from stamp duty has been designed to encourage the transfer of farmland to a new generation of farmers with relevant qualifications.  The transfer may be by way of a gift or sale.  It is a good measure.  In order to be eligible, a farmer must be under the age of 35 years on the date of deed of transfer and also have attained one of the necessary qualifications.  This is very important.  Farmers need to be up and at it, educated, the best and the brightest.  We need to be as good as those anywhere else in Europe.  The young trained farmer must also, for a period of five years from the date of execution of the deed of transfer, spend not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming the land and retain ownership of it.  This is punitive enough, but I can see why it is necessary.  Transfers by way of lease, or where there is a power of revocation, will not qualify for the exemption.  I understand that, too.  As Mr. Connor Finnerty has reported in AgriLand, some additional measures were added to the Finance Bill 2018 that had not been announced by the Minister on budget day.</p> <p> Section 46 of the Bill is also being availed of to bring the legislative provisions that deal with the young trained farmer stamp duty relief and the stamp duty farm consolidation relief into compliance with the EU state aid regulations that apply to them.  The provisions include requiring that a business plan be provided for Teagasc before a newly qualified young trained farmer can receive a refund of the stamp duty he or she has paid in the course of a previous purchase of land.  As well as this, a cumulative lifetime cap of &euro;70,000 will apply to the amount of tax relief or credit that can be enjoyed by a farmer by way of the young trained farmer stamp duty relief, the stock relief for young trained farmers and the succession farm partnerships tax credit.  Provisions will also include a number of other technical changes to the legislation governing the young trained farmer stamp duty relief and the stamp duty farm consolidation relief to ensure they are state-aid compliant.</p> <p> Income averaging and stock relief are important.  They are sought by the IFA and other bodies.  The Bill includes details of the income averaging and stock relief changes announced.  Income averaging allows eligible farmers to calculate their taxable income as the average of their income in the current year and the previous four years on a rolling basis, thus smoothing their tax liability in a five-year cycle.  This is important in a year like this - bliain uaf&aacute;sach, when we had a wet spring with snow, sneachta, and then a severe drought.</p> <p> Certain farmers are not entitled to avail of the income averaging regime if they, or their spouses or civil partners, earn another income off the land.  The amendment recently announced by the Minister will extend the scheme to such farmers.  That is welcome.  Averaging will apply only to farm profits.  The measure will increase the number of farmers who are able to avail of the scheme.  Furthermore, stock relief is a relief from income tax in respect of increases in the value of a farm's trading stock.  It is allowable as a deduction of a defined percentage amount of the increase in the value of trading stock at the end of an accounting period, over and above the opening value.  </p> <p> The 25% general stock relief on income tax, the 50% stock relief on income tax for registered farm partnerships and the 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers were due to expire in December.  I welcome their extension, as have all farming bodies.  The long-standing reliefs have been extended for a further three-year period.</p> <p> I have made many suggestions in many areas.  I made one about the vulture funds that were buying all of the land in my county, Tipperary, one being Coolmore.  The tax reliefs are brought forward for young farmers, small farmers, to allow for the transfer of land in families.  The company in question now has 24,000 or 25,000 acres.  It is buying and buying.  The Government has refused to reinstate the Land Commission.  It has turned a blind eye because some years agao its members were all brought to Coolmore and fed and watered.  It is disgusting and disgraceful.  Not a perch of land can be bought in County Tipperary by any young farmer or anyone with a family farm.  The vulture funds which are using Chinese and other money and which have big, fat cheque books are getting the relief.  It is time to separate the chaff from the oats.  The same applies to the VAT rate which applies to hotels in Dublin by comparison with those in the country.  The relief scheme was not set up for these vulture funds.  They are no better than the vulture funds that come in from abroad and that are victimising people who require houses.  They are also buying houses and getting away scot free and laughing all the way to the bank in using this wonderful scheme which was set up for family farms.  They are hijacking and abusing it.  We believed the Government would change it this year, but it did not.  Therefore, the vulture funds will have another 12 months to do what they like.  I will be tabling amendments to the Finance Bill, as I did last year, to try to impose a 50% tax on acquisitions of land-holdings over 750 acres.  The Minister knows that would be a high threshold in counties Wexford and Tipperary.  In that regard, I draw attention to the figure of 27,000 acres.  The vulture funds are buying up all of the straw this year, leaving all farmers without a bit to purchase.  That is not welcome in Ireland.  It is like having the landlords back again.  I came here from the House of Commons in London this morning.  The British landlords did not treat our people like this before the first shots were fired in the Civil War at Soloheadbeg in 1919.  Those concerned had to pick up arms.  Are we going to see something like that happen in County Tipperary, east Waterford, west Waterford, east Cork, County Kilkenny and up into Dublin to stop it?  There are other vulture funds, so-called syndicates, up here.  What they are doing is wrong.  Is the Government so blind that it cannot see that the scheme it brought forward for good reasons is being hijacked and abused by conglomerates such as the one in question and putting ordinary people out of business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-23a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300062#KKK00200"><p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to the Finance Bill.  I had only two and half minutes to speak about the budget.  This is a welcome change.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill is the statutory mechanism used to give effect to the measures announced in the budget.  It is timely to reflect in a more positive way on from where we have come and how much we have developed in recent years, in addition to the great sacrifices that had to be made by the people and politicians to get where we are.  There are many things that we still have not achieved; about which there is no doubt.  We have a serious housing problem which affects young people and with which we have to deal sooner rather than later.  I would certainly like something to be done in this area as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  As much as anybody else, I am fully aware of the exigencies.  I was a member of the special housing committee that met two years ago to examine how we should deal with the housing crisis in the country generally.  I suggested, as I have done many times, the way to deal with the issue was to go back to the old-fashioned system of relying on local authority and affordable houses.  That system was changed about 25 years ago when approved housing bodies were given the responsibility to take over from the local authorities and replace them.  For my sins, I predicted at the time that this would not work, but everybody scoffed and said it was the greatest idea ever and that it was bound to solve the problem.  It was said it would bring private money to the public house-building programme, without any major sacrifice.  That was wrong; it did not happen in that way.  All that happened was that the particular housing requirement was not met and it has not been met since.  It will not be met as long as these bodies are competing.  Let me outline my reason for thinking this, without meaning any disrespect to the housing bodies.  In fact, the special housing bodies are very good and proved that they were very good at dealing with specific and very acute problems.  They should never have been expected to deal with the thrust, body and weight of the housing requirement.  Along the way some wise person decided to change the terms "local authority houses" and "affordable houses" and to use instead the term "social housing", as if identifying such housing was free in some way or other.  That did a lot of damage to the efforts being made to deal with the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  We must remember that housing provision poses an ongoing problem; it does not go away.  Every year a new crop of people require housing to be provided in one form or another.  Those in the lower income group are competing with those in the middle income group.  They are coming downhill at the former and competing with them at the bottom of the ladder.  It is a very unfair game.  Neither the middle income group nor the lower income group is being satisfied and they cannot be because house prices are being controlled by one sector.</p><p>The housing crisis is being controlled by the same sector.  It will never change unless there are specific changes to the structure of the housing development process and responsibility is returned to the local authorities.  They must in turn be given a programme each year with targets they must meet and provide.  That is easily done because all the budgetary and census figures are available.  They are available in respect of the need to provide school places, public utilities and services.  Housing is nothing exceptional in that regard.  It is just another issue that must be dealt with.</p> <p> The other issue in this regard relates to taxation in general.  Local authority housing applicants who find themselves forced up the ladder to compete with others in the private housing sector in some cases end up spending up to &euro;2,000 per month.  That is a lethal situation.  The affordable and local authority housing system was part of our taxation system when it was working properly.  That meant the people in a particular income bracket were not forced to seek higher wages, because that is the only other way they could go.  That happened in the case of benchmarking some years ago.  Benchmarking was introduced to address the fact that it was not possible for people to live due to the cost of living arising from massively increasing house prices.  Benchmarking was introduced in the public sector but it impacted on the private sector in turn and inflated the economy to the extent that we know what happened eventually.  It should not have happened but that is the way it was.</p> <p> It is no harm to reflect on the way we used to do things and on the way we appear to have got into a rut and are unable to look at the positive things that were there.  It is easy for the Opposition to pour cold water on everything the Government does.  It does it very well, and I am sure I did it too when I was in a similar situation.  However, I have learned new ways to do it from listening to the Opposition over the last couple of years.  It was always a feature of this House that there was a recognition by whoever was in opposition of the efforts of those in government in difficult times.  They always gave credit for that.  That has disappeared now.  In fact, the only thing that happens now is that whoever is in government is blamed for everything that goes wrong and the Opposition takes credit for everything that does not go wrong - I did not say goes right, but what does not go wrong.  We must learn from that.  The way we debate in the House has changed, and not for the better.  We should never say anything in the House that we could not say to people outside the House.  That is part and parcel of what we must do if we are to establish respect for each other in the House.  In return, people outside the House will have respect for the Members of the House and for each other.  We were quite good at that over the years even in turbulent times but we have lost our way in that regard in more recent times.</p> <p> I wish to refer briefly to the current position and the challenges that lie ahead.  The Finance Bill must be viewed against international global challenges and the potential for world trade wars.  When Peter Sutherland was alive he was a major player in achieving equilibrium in world trade and the WTO.  He spent a great deal of time working on it and was very successful.  His influence was positive and we reached a situation where small countries were no longer the minions and targeted all the time.  Of course, some of the larger economies do not like that.  They would prefer to have minions in their vicinity, like great white sharks and others.  It is always good to have minions in their vicinity so they can rely on them for support on particular occasions.  At present, there is a distinct threat of a global trade war and we must keep that in mind particularly when dealing with the budget and Finance Bill.  We must recognise that the threat is ahead of us and hope that it does not get worse.</p> <p> There is also the issue of any diminution of foreign direct investment here.  Some Members of the House would welcome that.  They will say that there should not be any foreign direct investment and that it should be elsewhere.  Of course, elsewhere will always welcome that because elsewhere wants to attract foreign direct investment.  It is our competitor.  When we are in that situation we must recognise that not everybody is on our side.</p> <p> The obvious threat of Brexit has not gone away.  Its effects will not go away unless there is a change of heart in our neighbour across the water.  We would all hope that there would be and that it would revert back to what prevailed heretofore, acknowledging the sacrosanctity of the Good Friday Agreement and the necessity to underwrite it and stay with it.  All of us should recognise the benefits of the Single Market of more than 500 million people.  It is a sizeable market in anybody's back garden, without going to the wider global sphere.  Starting with a market of 500 million people is a fair advantage.  We must ensure that we do not have a situation where our next door neighbour withdraws from the scene and we end up paying for it.  That could happen, and we must guard against it.  We will do that by being certain we retain sufficient ownership of our economy at all times so we can battle as well as anybody else in the troubled waters that might lie ahead.  I have great confidence in our ability as a nation to survive in that situation.</p> <p> In addition, we have a duty to look after our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  We are inextricably linked economically and socially despite all the things that have happened.  As the Queen said in her speech, we might be better off if some of them had not happened.  Now, however, we must ensure that we do nothing disruptive.  We will not do that in this jurisdiction but we must hope that in adjoining jurisdictions we do not find ourselves in a less providential situation than we had heretofore.  This island must be able to trade in a Single Market, North and South, for the benefit of both the North and the South.  Together we can play our part.  A united Ireland aside, this is simple economics and we have a major role to play in the European Union as well.</p> <p> In recent years we endured probably the most rigorous test we have ever faced, when we found ourselves broken.  I am not attributing a political agenda to this because these things can happen at any time.  We must try to ensure they do not happen again or that we have done our best to avert the worst excesses of what might happen.  Items such as the Rainy Day Fund, while not massive, are an indication of what we have in mind at budget time and in the Finance Bill.  It is a wise decision because, if need be, we will be in a position to borrow on the international markets at low interest rates.  If we do things wrong and throw caution to the wind by spending injudiciously, we will not have that backing.  Not even our European colleagues would be secure with that.  It is important to ensure that our European colleagues have sufficient confidence in us as a nation to withstand anything that happens, and they will as long as we are prudent in how we manage our finances.  We should also remember that notwithstanding the fact the IMF has withdrawn from Government Buildings, a problem still remains.  We must remain alert and try to ensure that when that time comes we will recover again if we have to, we will depend on ourselves to do it and we will accept the support of our colleagues in Europe in that effort.</p></speech>
