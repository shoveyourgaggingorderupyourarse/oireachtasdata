The scheme will open to applications this October and good progress continues to be made as we work towards that timeframe.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Childcare Support Act last July, detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are now being finalised.  An IT development contractor, Codec, is working with officials from my Department and Pobal to develop the scheme's supporting IT system so that it will be available on schedule.</p><p>Since 18 February, school-age childcare services can register with Tusla and will be able to participate in the scheme from the outset.  A national communications campaign is also underway.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports to allow everyone - parents, providers and representative groups - to prepare for the scheme.  Key elements of the campaign in March included the launch of a new website, <i>wwv.ncs.gov.ie</i>, as well as a major nationwide training programme for providers offering over 12,500 training places across 600 venues.  I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in both the website and the training.</p><p>By raising the thresholds for income-related subsidies in budget 2019, I have poverty proofed the scheme for families on lower incomes and enabled more families with higher incomes to access support.  Families with a net household income of under &euro;26,000 will benefit from the maximum subsidies while families of a net household income of up to &euro;60,000 will also benefit.</p><p>I will continue to work intensively to deliver this landmark scheme, which will alter the landscape of childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life.</p></speech>

I know that Codec is the name of the company involved in the ICT side of the scheme.  Is the ICT on target or up and running?  Are there any flaws that will prohibit it being fully rolled out in September?  Regarding the communication teams and training and support, will there be adequate time and training for the various providers?  I am delighted to hear about 600 different locations around the country so I am sure there are adequate opportunities for people to attend.  Is an allowance to enable them to attend this training available?  Has extra time been allocated to their facility because it must take in somebody to enable another person to go or are events scheduled for the evening?  Is it being delivered through the city and county childcare committees?  Could the Minister repeat the name of the website?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, an oversight group was established at the very beginning and continues to monitor the development of it.  Part of that involves ongoing risk assessment relating to the timing.  It is not to say that it is completely without risk regarding being delivered on time.  I must be honest about that.  However, with regard to having that kind of risk approach to assessing the development of it, I am assured that it will be delivered on time and we will have an opportunity to pilot it before it goes fully live.</p>  <p>  We have launched an initial communications approach and programme.  There will be a couple of others particularly geared towards parents.  We are offering training for providers.  I will have to revert to the Deputy regarding her questions about the details of the training.</p></speech>

Has the Department carried out a risk assessment regarding the uploading of documents, particularly from the childcare providers?  It is my understanding that more than half of the premises in Leitrim do not have access to broadband.  Perhaps the Department needs to do this as part of its risk assessment.  It is a very valuable piece of it, particularly with regard to Leitrim, based on the feedback I am getting.  What will the Minister do regarding the upcoming budget negotiations?  Does she plan to see the expansion of the net household income threshold as part of budgetary negotiations?</p></speech>

I will feed that in and get back to her in terms of looking at and assessing that issue.  The ultimate success of the national child care scheme is rooted in that.  It is also important to say that there is still the possibility of parents making applications on paper to the service provider.  It is not the case that it is totally dependent on online facilities.  It is worrying nonetheless and I will ask my officials to look at that and see how we can assess risk in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second question, the investment in the national childcare scheme and that we will finally have it provides us with a much easier way to increase investment, both at the lower as well as the higher end.  It will be my ambition to look for increases on both sides.</p></speech>

In 2018, as part of the planning processes to develop services for victims of domestic violence, Tusla began the process of reviewing emergency domestic violence accommodation provision in the Dublin region.  The findings of this review will inform decision-making on the funding.  It will also inform Tusla&rsquo;s project to review specialist domestic violence accommodation nationally, which will be completed by the end of 2019.  Importantly, it will also inform the Estimates process for 2020.  I am pleased to confirm that a new refuge is due to open in south Dublin by the end of the third quarter of 2019.  This refuge will have five family units and accommodate five adults and up to 15 children.</p>  <p>  We need to improve geographic access.  It is already difficult for women and children to leave the family home, but this becomes even more challenging when there is no safe place to go which is within a reasonable distance.  This is also a key obligation to be met under the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, the Istanbul Convention, which Ireland ratified on 8 March of this year.</p>  <p>  Currently there are challenges for Tusla in ensuring that we have the right number of refuge places in the right place for those who need them.  Tusla will continue to work with service providers to plan for additional refuge developments where they are needed.  Currently, 22 of the 59 organisations funded by Tusla provide emergency refuge and emergency non-refuge accommodation to victims of domestic violence and their children, with a total of 155 family units of emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  We are all aware of the detrimental effects that domestic violence has on victims and their children. This is why I have prioritised the development of these services.</p></speech>

There has been no increase in the number of spaces available in recent years.  On 22 February 2018, the Minister told the House that Ireland was exceeding the recommendations for the minimum refuge provision for domestic violence spaces, because there were 155 family units comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and eight emergency non-refuge family units.  She based this on the fact that she claimed that the Council of Europe recommend one place per 10,000 women.  In fact, the Council of Europe recommends that provision be set at one place or family place per 7,500 to 10,000 members of the population.  On that basis, it would appear that our domestic violence refuge spaces are 70% less than the recommended amount.  To reach these European guidelines, we would in fact need 331 more spaces.  Does the Minister accept these figures and will we see any significant increase in capacity over the coming years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800004#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Those are very important issues that she has pointed out.  In terms of the calculation of her figures, I would have to do them myself but let us assume that she has done her maths right.  The most important thing that the Deputy is identifying is what guidelines Ireland ought to follow to determine the number of refuge places that we have available.  Indeed, as the Deputy indicated, we have a Council of Europe document which indicates the minimum standards to help us identify the appropriate number.  The first issue then is what this number should be.  The Deputy may be aware that the document offers two standards relating to fulfilling our obligations under the Council of Europe recommendations, one which is being followed, and the other on which the Deputy has just commented.  In light of the Deputy's questions but also my ongoing interest in prioritising this issue, it is worth looking again at the most appropriate standard to follow in light of the evidence that is coming to bear on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800004#B00700"><p>These Council of Europe recommendations were made in 1998.  It is 20 years on and we are still not reaching the targets.  I have asked before and it seems very difficult to get answers as to how full these centres are.  This information is very important to us to understand the demand that exists.</p>  <p>  In responses I received recently to questions, I was told Cork as a whole has only five domestic violence refuge spaces.  That is incredible.  There are other counties such as Carlow, Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon where there are no places whatsoever.  In these counties with no places, we are seeing mothers and children having to move to other counties to get services.  That is not acceptable and I hope we look at this, going forward.</p>  <p>  The Minister made a comment about the Rathmines centre that is due to be opened soon.  My understanding is that this centre has been taken over by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Even though we have problem in homelessness, which I understand, it seems that we are taking from one to give to the other.  Women who are fleeing domestic violence need specialist services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800004#B00800"><p>Three matters arise here.  First, on the numbers that we ought to have according to the Council of Europe, Tusla is applying a standard of shelter space per 10,000 head of female population.  There is another standard of shelter space per 7,500 head of adult population.  That is what the Deputy is arguing we should have instead, which means we need to increase provision.  I am saying in response that we need to look at that again.</p>  <p>  Second, there is a very important piece of research, a national survey, that Tusla is conducting now to identify, by working with stakeholders and service providers throughout the country, where the needs are and where the services ought to be.  The Deputy is correct that there are nine counties where we do not have domestic violence refuges.  This is important research and it is not just a case of putting them anywhere in each of those counties.  Instead, it is done on an evidence basis, with research being done as to where they should be located and what kind of services should be provided.  There are obviously different models.</p>  <p>  The final point was on the Rathmines refuge shelter.  It is a very important shelter for me.  Some of my closest colleagues founded it many years ago.  I have been there myself and it will be opened, if a little bit later than anticipated.  While they are waiting to sort out some other outstanding issues - not building issues - the building has been offered for homeless people, some of whom are fleeing domestic violence.</p></speech>

The need for greater consistency in the provision of aftercare planning and services has been identified in Tusla's 2019 business plan.</p><p>The budget I have secured for Tusla for 2019 will enable it to progress these plans.  Individual children in care have very different needs as they approach the age of 18, as the Deputy is aware.  Many children will have lived for significant periods in stable foster care and when they leave school they will have similar ambitions and supports available to them as to their peers.  Other children will have experienced a fractured and traumatic childhood and will need a range of supports to manage the transition to adulthood.  It is for this reason that children who are in residential care and those with identified additional needs are prioritised for an aftercare worker.  Aftercare support builds on the work already undertaken by foster carers, social workers and residential care staff and is dependent on the full participation and consent of the young person.  We also rely on partnership with agencies such as the HSE, housing agencies and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  While all young people in care should have an aftercare plan with identified supports, not all will have an aftercare worker allocated to them.  This decision is based on the assessment of the young person&rsquo;s need.</p> <p> Almost half of young people leaving foster care continue to live with their former carers.  Some of these young people will be completing secondary school and undertaking further education, while a smaller number may have ongoing dependencies and disabilities.  The carers of young people who have been in a stable long-term foster care placement will remain their main support.  The majority of aftercare planning is likely to focus on the ongoing financial support provided by Tusla.  There are other young people whose situation is less straightforward when they reach 18 and are leaving care.  In recognition of this I have succeeded in having young people leaving care included as a separate category for funding under the capital assistance scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800005#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  At the outset I must acknowledge the fantastic work that foster parents and social care workers do to provide support.  I would not be asking this question if foster carers, care leavers and Empowering People In Care, EPIC, had not come to me and said that they had a problem, so much so that they are planning to march through the streets of Dublin in May to highlight the disparity in support.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this.  A lot of the disparity comes down to geography.  Normally I am not one for advocating marches or anything like that.  However, the Minister and I, and anyone else who engages with children's issues and youth affairs, understand that geography plays a huge part in this.  There is a huge lack of social care workers or access to them.  Moreover, if a young person loses a parent and finds himself or herself in foster care 11 months before his or her 18th birthday, he or she does not get the aftercare plan or the supports others benefit from.</p>  <p>  My biggest question is this.  The Minister talked about the Tusla business plan.  Have other plans been put in place to prevent children falling between the cracks?</p></speech>

I think marches are great.  Having said that, being a Minister I need to know what the issues are before they happen.  We will have those engagements.  In my initial answer I noted that Tusla informs me that there is a really deep assessment of the needs of the individual child or young person.  While all of them are entitled to an aftercare plan, some of them will not necessarily need an aftercare worker given the stability of their background.  Children may be staying with their foster carers etc.  As such, it is not necessarily a bad thing if they do not have one.  However, we need an aftercare plan.</p>  <p>  I have a list of the number of available aftercare workers per county etc.  If there is a geographic disparity in how young people's needs for aftercare workers are met, this absolutely must be looked at.  I will ask Tusla to ensure that we examine that.</p></speech>

Young people are living this experience and they are the best people to describe it.  The Minister is right.  Not everybody will require the assistance of a social care worker.  However, these children should all be entitled to an aftercare plan.  The Minister has heard me say before that every child needs a second chance.  I talk about that where education is concerned.  We know that a lot of these young people's peers might go into first year in college and find the course is not for them.  Children in aftercare should also be given a second chance.  However, if the course does not suit them the funding stops and they are left to the wide world without any supports.  This is a huge reason for the Minister to consider bringing the children to the table with the Department or Tusla to tell us how we can progress these issues.</p></speech>

I wish to say two things in response to her questions.  Regarding the number of aftercare workers, I would like to put on record that we need to fill some more posts.  Tusla now has 111 posts in aftercare.  Some 89 of them are filled by aftercare workers.  There are 11 vacancies at aftercare worker grade.  Tusla recently held a competition for 11 management posts.  An additional 18 aftercare workers are employed by other organisations such as Focus Ireland and Don Bosco Care.  I wish to put that on the record.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's second point, I am very much in favour of hearing from the people who experience the issues themselves, in this case the young people who have been in care.  The Deputy may be aware that EPIC has an advisory council of young people which effectively does that kind of work.  I have met with and listened to its members.  They have developed materials.  I was recently in Tallaght at one of EPIC's awareness-raising events highlighting the needs of young people in aftercare.  I will raise that issue with EPIC.  In other words, such a group already exists.  The Deputy may be suggesting that we need to widen it and provide the opportunity for others to come forward.  We will look at that.  I thank the Deputy.</p></speech>

Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department works closely with Tusla to provide supports to help them with the challenges they face.  It is worth remembering that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child, it will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  We now provide free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness, including a daily meal for each child.  That is one thing my Department has done.  Some 310 children have been registered under this scheme in the current programme year.  Tusla also supports homeless families experiencing problems with school attendance through the school completion programme.  Children whose families are homeless are prioritised for services such as homework clubs and breakfast clubs.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, have agreed a joint protocol to facilitate an interagency response to the many challenges posed by homelessness.  As part of the protocol, Tusla provides support to the DHRE&rsquo;s "one-stop shop" assessment centres.  Here, Tusla staff deal with matters of child protection and welfare, educational welfare and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  Tusla&rsquo;s homelessness liaison officer also supports these centres.  Family resource centres provide facilities where homeless children and families can avail of a safe, warm environment for homework, relaxation and nutritious food.  Tusla is engaging with the centres to offer further enhanced services across the greater Dublin area in 2019.</p>  <p>  A minority of young people leaving care can have particularly complex needs.  Following a suggestion from Fr. Peter McVerry I have succeeded in having them included for the first time as a separate category for funding under the capital assistance scheme.</p><p>That provides targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling approved housing bodies to acquire residential units to accommodate them.  I may come back to that.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>It has been a complex and arduous process to initiate.  My Department and Tusla have developed principles and criteria relating to funding proposals under CAS.  Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide and where necessary advocate for additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan.<br/><br/>I am pleased to be able to confirm that as of 31 December 2018 ten care leavers were in occupancy of secure accommodation under the scheme while an additional 40 units, consisting of a mix of one and two bed units across the State, have been purchased or are sale agreed.  These should be available for other young people leaving care in the near future.  The security provided by a tenancy in CAS accommodation, combined with the aftercare supports identified by Tusla as part of the aftercare planning process, can help ensure that these young people have a safe base from which to begin their transition to independent adult life.<br/><br/>Our response to homelessness overall is a test of our compassion as a society.  We need to eliminate child and family homelessness.  While we work towards this we must provide the supports necessary to help them live in a way that goes some way to addressing the challenges of the situation.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minster that the Government parties, and Fianna F&aacute;il which props it up, deserve to be hammered at the ballot box in May for failures in housing and homelessness.  The Minister stated she thinks marches are great.  I put it to her that the "Raise the Roof" national housing demonstration on 18 May should now be built into a massive anti-Government protest.  I also put it to the Minister that the Government now has no excuse not to allow Solidarity's Anti-Evictions Bill 2018 pass all Stages in the Oireachtas and become part of the law of the land.</p></speech>

I find it distressing that there has been such a rise in homelessness and especially that it includes more than 160 children.  I am certainly with the Deputy in respect of that.  In light of the changes in the numbers, and the increase in numbers that we have in the headlines of the front pages of the newspapers today, a rethink on some of the things the Government is doing is required.  We need to do more.  Having reflected on this, and also on the recent report from the United Nations special rapporteur, that is particularly the case in respect of the private rental sector.  There is a need to examine this issue again in the context of some of the legislation currently going through this House, such as the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing that.</p>  <p>  I refer to examining what else can be done to ensure security of tenure for those who in the private rental sector and especially those most vulnerable.  I have been raising my own concerns and questions in respect of that debate and I will continue to do so.  It is also true, however, that some of the things the Government has been doing appear to be working on the basis of evidence and numbers.  I refer to the example of the rent pressure zones, RPZs, that from December of 2017 have been having a positive affect.  That is shown in the data presented by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, today.  We do, however, as I have indicated, need to tighten up the regulations further in that sector.  I expect the Minster for Housing, Planning and Local Government will be making further changes in that regard in the coming week.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Zappone, was asked for a comment.  She stated that should be a "wake up call".  We found out yesterday that the numbers are 50% higher than that.  Has she woken up yet?  Has the Government woken up yet?  We all know the number one cause of homelessness in this country is eviction from the private rental sector.  Solidarity's Anti-Evictions Bill 2018 provides a number of practical remedies for staunching the flow.  It aims to ban the sale of property as grounds for eviction.  That is law in The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden.  It is supported by Threshold.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister, Deputy Zappone, support that?  I am asking her a direct question.  The Bill would also ban renovation as grounds for eviction.  I refer to so-called "renovictions".  If these measures had been implemented when the Minister stated we needed to wake up, a year and a half ago, then we would be nowhere near 10,000 homeless at this stage.  That is because many of those evictions would have been banned.  Does the Minister support this Bill and does she support the practical remedies, such as banning the sale of property as grounds for eviction as supported by Threshold?</p></speech>

My view as an Independent Member of Government is that it is very helpful to have the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  It adds to the debate in respect of what is required in order to ensure we have additional security of tenure in our private rental sector.  That is what I will support.  Deputy Barry quoted me and, yes, it was a wake up call.  It is exceptionally distressing to know today that even with that wake up call the numbers of people in homelessness are continuing to rise.  I am also stating, therefore, that we need to do more and perhaps to do some things differently.</p>  <p>  I refer to the rental issue in the private sector especially.  One of the things the Government has pursued, however, is to develop a new model of cost rental options for low income families.  That is on the basis of my commitment to it and putting it into A Programme for a Partnership Government.  In the Land Development Agency scheme in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown area, which was announced yesterday, half of the 600 units will be rented at a substantially discounted price.  That is one action that will make a difference in that area and that action is ongoing.</p></speech>

The special rapporteur met with representatives of a number of Departments and agencies during her visit.  I met with her at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Her report assesses the situation in Ireland and makes a range of recommendations relevant to a number of Departments.  I welcome the report.  I have already taken steps to address a number of the recommendations relevant to my Department.  For example, a submission will shortly be made to the Attorney General on the ratification of the second optional protocol on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.  We will shortly be opening a pilot "one house" centre for victims of child abuse.  This will bring together the supports from Tusla, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under one roof in one house.</p>  <p>  The development of a national strategy covering child sexual abuse and exploitation was among the recommendations of the December 2017 Garda Inspectorate report, Responding to Child Sexual Abuse - a Follow Up Review.  An independently-chaired inter-agency implementation group, comprising representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, has been established to examine the recommendations in that report, including in relation to the desirability of a national strategy or other overarching whole of Government framework that would coherently draw together the existing actions and key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Regarding the culture of silence in respect of issues of child abuse, I believe this exists too.  I do, however, genuinely believe that we are making progress in acknowledging and confronting the dark, shameful unspoken secrets that exist in our communities.  The Children First Act 2015, which I fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, mandatory reporting of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.  There has been an increase in reports of concerns about children who may be at risk.  I think this is some evidence towards moving through that culture of silence.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as the special rapporteur does also, that there have been measures implemented, particularly in respect of preventing and responding to abuse now.  Progress has been made in this area and that is a fact.  I am glad to see the Minister has announced other measures which are also going to be implemented.  I would really like to focus, however, on some of the historical points as well.  How we deal with the past does inform how we deal with the future.</p>  <p>  The special rapporteur was particularly critical on some of these issues.  I refer in particular to her call for a "comprehensive national examination of forced and illegal adoptions, including audits of the records in the hands of the State while ensuring that individuals whose records were falsified have access to information and redress".  The special rapporteur also called for a full investigation into the human rights abuses in the Magdalene laundries and was very concerned that we do not have enough proper information with regard to abuse now and the lack of records.</p><p>Are there plans in those areas to address some of the recommendations made?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that a review of sample files within the custody of the State is taking place.  The process is being overseen by an independent reviewer, Marion Reynolds, the former deputy director of social services in Northern Ireland.  The findings of the review will assist me in reaching a decision on what, if any, subsequent action might be deemed to be necessary to identify more fully the scale of illegal birth registrations.  As I expect to receive the report in the Easter period, it is imminent.  Some of the other issues raised by the Deputy could form part of it.  She made a point about developing a new strategy.  We are examining its desirability.  One thing at which the group is looking is a way to keep it as a possibility.  However, what is most important is following through on implementing actions identified in other settings and frameworks.</p></speech>

The point was made.  Those involved were critical of the remit of the mother and baby homes commission not being broad enough to deal with the illegal adoption issue.  While it is welcome that the Minister might have the report in April, we need to be moving to implement its findings.  The probe was clear in respect of the culture of silence and the prevention of survivors from being able to talk and about how it constituted further abuse.  It is regrettable that we keep having piecemeal investigations, rather than doing the job comprehensively.  To me, in some ways it is part of the same process of denial.  Are we to be dragged kicking and screaming to deal with the matter eventually, come clean and have a full acknowledgement as a society of how the people concerned were wronged?  Tragically, the longer we delay, the more the number of actual survivors will dwindle.  We need to dig deeper into some of the points made about the culture of silence and undertake a comprehensive review.  Again, I am keen to emphasise the urgency, particularly in dealing with the issue of illegal adoptions.</p></speech>

I feel it too, especially when I meet those involved.  I met some of them two evenings ago at the extraordinary exhibition at the National Museum that I launched.  It was called "(A)ddressing our Hidden Truths" by Alison Lowry.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made one point about how the commission should have had broader terms of reference to consider illegal registrations or adoptions.  The commission is looking at the issue of adoptions to the extent that it has to do with what happened in the mother and baby homes.  We are doing another block of work at the same time in the light of what Tusla has found.  In some ways, it is good that it is happening in parallel, as distinct from widening the terms of the commission.  Already it has so much to do that it has had to delay.  Things are happening in parallel, which is good, especially in the context of the need for urgency and the questions to be answered.  I hope the Deputy agrees with me on the process in approaching the matter of illegal registrations first through the use of sample methodology, etc. and then reviewing what has been found.  That is a reasonable way to look at the wider issues involved.  That is what I am hoping to do.</p></speech>

I introduced regulations for the first time for this purpose in February.  They will promote quality of service for children.  In addition, registration with Tusla will allow school-age childcare services to take part in the national childcare scheme when it opens later this year, thus addressing the issue of affordability for parents.</p>  <p>  While the regulations are critical for quality and affordability, I am conscious of the impact they may have on providers and I have made provisions accordingly.  For example, all existing services have been given until 18 May to apply for registration.  Services already registered as preschool services have been given an extended timeframe to 18 August.  In addition, I have recently provided for a six-month extension of the date on which the minimum child-adult ratio will come into force.  The minimum ratio of one adult to 12 children will come into force in mid-August, allowing services that have operated with a higher child-adult ratio more time to adjust.</p>  <p>  The regulations reflect advice received from the school-age childcare standards working group which included representatives from across the sector.  In developing its proposals the working group reviewed international evidence and practice.  The group was reconvened in September during the drafting of the regulations for consultation specifically on the child-adult ratio.  A ratio of 11:1 has been introduced for three to five year old children in the free preschool programme.  I believe a 12:1 ratio for school-age children who may be as young as four years of age is appropriate.  It should be recognised that in non-term time periods children may attend such services for 40 to 50 hours per week.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that the regulations that came into force in February represent a first stage only.  Public consultation is planned this summer in advance of developing a fuller set of regulations that will cover additional quality objectives.</p></speech>

It was an area in which regulation was needed.  It needed to be put on a statutory footing.  However, I possibly disagree with the Minister on the ratio being 12:1.  I might not disagree with a 12:1 ratio for junior or senior infants.  Such children would be in junior aftercare services.  However, when children are leaving a classroom setting where the ratio is 26:1 and entering a setting where the ratio is 12:1, I have to think about the cost and staffing implications.  We all know that in the childcare sector the cream was in after-school care services.  That is where those involved in the sector made their money in many settings.  I am a little disappointed that possibly there might not have been enough consultation on the ratio.  I think I said this the last time I was before the Minister in the Chamber.  The ratio will be at the end in closing some of these services.  I am not being alarmist, but the ratio of 12:1 is probably too tight.  I acknowledge that there is a May and an August deadline, but I would have preferred if there had been some consultation on the ratio to start the conversation.</p></speech>

The 12:1 ratio is based on many views, as well as international research and evidence.  That is how ultimately we came to the figure of 12:1.  The second point is that we have discussed the matter previously.  Was there enough consultation?  The action plan for school-age childcare published in 2017 included a commitment to introduce a quality assurance system for school-age childcare services.  It was on that basis that we pulled together the working group to respond to an urgent need to address the affordability of school-age childcare services as expressed by parents and providers.  My Department acted quickly on receipt of the draft standards to introduce statutory regulations.  They included the issue of ratios.  The new regulations will enable school-age childcare services to take part in the national childcare scheme to be introduced later this year.  That was part of the need for urgency.  The Deputy asked about the group.  Many of those involved were representative of the sector, etc.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  As she is aware, there will be additional consultation.  I have identified the need for further consultation in the development of a fuller set of regulations.  The Deputy is requesting whether the child-adult ratio could be looked at in that context. I will bring that request back to the Department.</p></speech>

I was in contact with my city and county childcare body and unable to obtain a definite answer.  That information would be welcome.</p><p>How many of the new providers would have signed up to it as well?  That will be a barometer of how people in the industry see this going.</p> <p> Does the Minister have any concerns regarding the impact of this regulation on the affordability and accessibility of after-school care, and how does she formally plan to support that sector?  I believe there will be providers who will need transitional support, be it in staffing terms or otherwise.  I would say some of them are oversubscribed.  There will be a capacity issue.  I would like to hear how the Department will address it.</p></speech>

They are rooted in listening to and being with the childcare providers.  In terms of the numbers of people who have signed up, I do not have that information but I will certainly get it for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Deputy Rabbitte will agree that we need the regulations.  We need quality in our school age childcare services.  There has been a determination initially of some of the basics of what that quality requires.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that we need that, and we have done that.</p>  <p>  If there are services that will find that kind of approach to quality more challenging than they have in the past, it is a good question whether they will require some support to get there.  I will bring that back to the Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has a habit of supporting people in transition, and if that is required, that is a useful request.  The bottom line is that together we need to make the regulations to ensure the quality and then to support people in the childcare sector.</p></speech>

I have allocated significant funding in recent years for this purpose and for improving the quality of infrastructure nationwide.  In 2019, I have secured a capital budget of &euro;9.6 million for the sector which will enable a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting the transition of services to the forthcoming national childcare scheme.</p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;6.1 million of this funding for the 2019 early learning and care and school age childcare capital programmes.  This funding will be delivered in three strands.  A total of &euro;4.23 million will be available under strand A, which will offer grants of up to &euro;50,000 to early learning and care providers for the creation of new places for children from newborns to aged three where demand for these is clearly evidenced.  I have allocated &euro;875,000 to strand B, which will offer individual grants of up to &euro;15,000 to aid community or not-for-profit early learning and care services in addressing fire safety issues.  Finally, there will be &euro;1 million for strand C, which will offer individual grants of up to &euro;20,000 to school age childcare providers for the creation of new school age places where demand for these is clearly demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The application window for the early learning and care and school age capital programmes opened on 25 February and closed yesterday, 27 March 2019.  Applications will now move to the appraisal stage, which is undertaken by Pobal and overseen by my Department.  Applications will be appraised using a fair process based on a number of criteria, including demonstration of need, value for money, capacity of the organisation, including compliance with scheme rules, project achievability, and socio-economic deprivation in the service's location.  Grants will be allocated to applications of the highest quality.  In accordance with the principles of fairness and equity, no funding will be earmarked in advance for any particular area in the country, but County Meath and other counties identified will be able to compete fairly alongside all other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Capital programmes are necessarily a budget limited exercise.  The maximum grant size available under each of these strands has been determined to optimise what can be delivered by each grant and to maximise the number of providers and children who will ultimately benefit from the funding.  Decisions on the award of capital grants are due to be delivered in June 2019, once the appraisal process has concluded.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased to have ensured that childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and to have secured &euro;250 million in capital funding for childcare under the plan.  This represents the kind of large-scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been undertaken since the earlier national childcare investment programme that concluded in 2010.  This investment will be essential to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new national childcare scheme is introduced.  The national childcare scheme, NCS, will radically alter how this country supports the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare.  Research is ongoing in my Department to determine areas of specified need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years.</p></speech>

Can she get the following information?  How many places will strands A and C support on average throughout the country?  With the creation of the additional early childhood care and education, ECCE places arising from the second year of it, has the Department enough funding for capital projects to support that expansion?  Certain providers, be they in the community or the private sectors, feel restricted.  They would like to take on extra children but they cannot fulfil the agreement for the two years because they just do not have the funding, although they might have the space.</p>  <p>  I refer to the idea of accumulating some of the grants.  Grants are provided for the ECCE in the morning.  If providers can also get access to the grant for the after-school care in the evening and they can tie that in with the fire safety grant, how many cr&egrave;ches or providers get full return and how many can get only a part of that grant mechanism?</p></speech>

I gather she asks the question because she is wondering if there is enough funding for the places that are required where they are required.  As I said, I will certainly ask for that.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department, along with Pobal, has worked diligently and with considerable technical expertise, at least in the past, to try to answer these types of questions and to develop methodologies to ascertain, as we move into the future, how we ensure that we do that.  It is good that the Deputy asks that question and that they will continue to do that.</p>  <p>  One of the concerns may be around where we have newly built estates with young demographics.  With the kind of methodology that is being developed, the monitoring capacity is conducted through the use of a so-called geosparcity index which categorises a geographical area in regard to the supply of and demand for childcare.  That merely demonstrates that there is attention to this and methodologies being developed to ensure that we can keep up with what we need and where we need it.</p></speech>

While the &euro;9 million sounds like big money, I am concerned about its scale when spread across the country where there will be the various demands.  The Minister has set maximum figures for the various different schemes.  What level of funding does she see being allocated to each of the different providers?  Is the Minister looking at providing a grant of &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000?  Will she give a smaller number of providers the maximum grant in each of the headings or will it be spread very thinly throughout the country?</p>  <p>  Pobal has also set out a chart on how it will distribute and one of the priorities relates to disadvantage.</p><p>Will areas with very quick and dramatic population growth, such as Ovens and Ballincollig, be considered or have an opportunity to be prioritised?</p> <p> Under Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain, the need for Irish language support is recognised by the Government.  We are aware that early years are more significant in this regard.  Will Irish language providers be prioritised in recognition of Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain and the Government's commitments in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800009#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  My answer to the first set of questions was trying to identify grants, up to certain amounts, according to the various strands.  In strand A, for example, grants of up to &euro;50,000 will be offered to early learning and care providers for the creation of places for those between zero and three.  The Deputy is wondering how, given the limited resources, it will be determined how much to give various providers in light of applications of really high quality.  I understand this is partly what he is asking about.  As he knows, I do not do the work in question.  Pobal and my Department receive the information.  I have tried to identify the criteria whereby the decisions are made.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about increasing populations and the Irish language.  We work on this.  I may address it in response to another question.  The First 5 strategy and the commitment to the Government in that regard need to be attended to also.  I hear that in terms of the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I have already said many of the providers have space.  When there was population expansion, the national schools rented portakabins to ensure the demand was met.  Childcare providers want the maximum number using their services and to offer an affordable, accessible, quality childcare service but their capacity is limited.  Has the Department costed the leasing of suitable portakabins to the providers while they are awaiting the approval of capital funding?  Considering that so many new schools are being built, are there portakabins available that we could hand over to some of the cr&egrave;ches?</p></speech>

I need clarification on Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain and the support for the Irish language providers.  As the Minister said, they need to be attended to but this does not appear to be in the criteria.  Could the Minister outline how she intends to attend to Irish language groups and to put in place supports for language development in the earlier years, the crucial years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800009#G00500"><p>On Deputy Rabbitte's question, I do not know whether the Department has considered the matter.  I will feed that in.  It is an interesting recommendation.  What the Deputy is suggesting is a form of transition to ensure that a year or a couple of years do not go by with insufficient capacity.  Anything we can find that offers support in this regard would be helpful.  At the same time, resources are limited, and this must be considered also.</p>  <p>  All the Deputies' questions are critical in the sense of trying to be a little ahead of the curve to ensure we have enough places and sufficient capacity.  As the Deputies know, we have been developing methodologies for this for quite some time, but their suggestions are helpful.</p>  <p>  There was a question on additional criteria in respect of grants for preschools, cr&egrave;ches and childcare centres, including na&iacute;onra&iacute;.  The suggestion that learning through Irish could be part of the criteria is very interesting.  I will feed that back.  It would need to be considered in the context of the capital grant section that does the work or the working groups being formed to consider how to make progress on all the commitments in the First 5 strategy, in addition to commitments regarding preschool, in particular, and Irish language initiatives in the context of the work of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I will raise the matter with my Department to determine the best way to consider it and possibly include it.</p></speech>

I involved myself directly in recent matters relating to safeguarding and child protection when they arose in Scouting Ireland because I was made aware of concerns expressed to the organisation by Tusla.  I am not a safeguarding expert but I believe that when issues raised by the State&rsquo;s experts are brought to my attention, I have a duty to respond.  I believe this is the right thing to do.</p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland, in common with all organisations dealing with children and young people, has legislative obligations under the Children First Act.  These include the obligation to report any safeguarding matters to Tusla.  Tusla can advise any entity on its safeguarding policies and procedures as well as on its child safeguarding statement.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department received a copy of a letter, dated 18 February 2019, written by Tusla to the CEO of Scouting Ireland raising certain concerns.  I am aware that a meeting was held between Tusla and Scouting Ireland on 7 March, the outcome of which was an agreed action plan to address the concerns raised by Tusla.  Scouting Ireland had already engaged child safeguarding expert Mr. Ian Elliott to advise on its safeguarding policies and procedures some time ago and he is still engaged on a consultancy basis.</p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland has assured me that it will continue to engage fully with Tusla to ensure the safeguarding of young people.  On general governance requirements, Scouting Ireland has been working since last year to bring its governance up to a high standard.  This has followed from the governance review carried out by Ms Jillian van Turnhout and the recommendations contained within that review.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that one of the key recommendations in Ms van Turnhout&rsquo;s review, on the appointment of a full-time safeguarding manager, has recently been implemented.</p>  <p>  I will keep the situation under careful review.  Any decision on continuation of funding is contingent on the receipt of a report confirming its compliance with all the recommendations in the van Turnhout report.  I am expecting the report from Scouting Ireland this week.  I will require a commitment from Scouting Ireland to ongoing engagement with Tusla that will demonstrate the implementation of its recently agreed action plan.</p></speech>

Some of the issues are now being worked through, and we hope we have reached a more positive space with regard to Tusla's interaction with Scouting Ireland.</p><p>All Members wish for some comfort to be given to the thousands of families with children and members of which are volunteers that Scouting Ireland is a safe place to be.  All Members believe it to be a safe place, but there are some inherent risks.</p> <p> However, definitive answers from the Minister regarding the Tusla review of supervision of children are required.  She has given no indication so far today in that regard.  She discussed governance and the review by Ms Jillian van Turnhout.  However, I wish to know where we are in regard to the safeguarding piece.  Mr. Ian Elliot has been investigating historical cases.  Is he to report directly to the Department?  Where are we in terms of the quality of the engagement or actions arising from the engagement between Tusla and Scouting Ireland?</p></speech>

My expectation and understanding is that Tusla will continue to support Scouting Ireland in order to ensure that those actions are implemented.  The first step is that Tusla makes a presentation on Children First legislation and safeguarding to the board of directors at its next scheduled board meeting.  I assume that will be done or has already been done.  A safeguarding manager has been recruited, as recommended in the action plan.</p>  <p>  On some of the Deputy's other questions, Scouting Ireland will review its safeguarding risk assessment relevant procedures, particularly its code in respect of overnight trips and jamborees, in collaboration with Tusla.  It is doing so and that will continue.  I hope and expect that it will indicate to me that that has been done to the satisfaction of both parties.  Tusla has requested that Scouting Ireland agree to an independent evaluation of its helpline.  It will draw learning from that and apply it to its current and future policies, procedures and practice relevant to the helpline.</p></speech>

I understand that the organisation to which the Deputy refers is a member of the new communities partnership, an independent national network of more than 150 immigrant-led groups comprising 65 nationalities which has offices in Dublin and Cork.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, funds the new communities partnership, which is registered as a charitable organisation.  Tusla has informed me that the new communities partnership does not fund the organisation in question.</p>  <p>  Under Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla funds a range of community, voluntary and charitable organisations which provide services to vulnerable children and families.  Tusla has a service level agreement with the new communities partnership which governs the funding provided to the organisation and sets out the resources to be provided and the outputs to be delivered.</p></speech>

However, concerns were raised regarding the group to which I refer.  A magazine article raised certain issues and there were concerns that it was receiving funding.  There was also reference to a particular individual involved in the organisation being a Tusla staff officer.  If all of that information is incorrect, the person who wrote the article has questions to answer.</p>  <p>  There is an overall question which alarmed me.  I represent north inner city Dublin, which has very diverse communities with many nationalities.  However, what we see in childcare organisations is the coming together of nationalities and an inclusiveness.  The other aspect to my question was whether nationalities are in some way being separated such that each nationality may have its own childcare facility or separate funding rather than operating in a spirit of inclusiveness and bringing people together.  That is the background to my question.</p></speech>

I agree with the points she raises on the substantive issue.  Specifically in regard to this issue, it is important to clarify that Tusla provides funding on the basis of certain service level agreements or objectives or looking for certain things to be delivered by a number of organisations under the new communities partnership.  It is the new communities partnership that makes the decision on how to ensure those objectives and services are best provided.  It is helpful for the Deputy to raise her questions and concerns, particularly in regard to the new communities partnership which is effectively making the decisions on the basis of the service level agreement.  If she so wishes, I will list the general description of services to be provided under the service level agreement, but I am unsure if that is the point she wishes to be addressed.</p></speech>

It is important that the Minister clarified it and that there is a commitment to inclusiveness when it comes to childcare facilities.  We recently celebrated the Chinese new year with a fabulous festival held just off Hill Street in the north inner city.  The Hill Street family resource centre does amazing work, at the core of which is inclusiveness.  I was alarmed that Tusla could be funding an organisation that was moving away from that ethos.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.98.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800010#H01000"><p>I have raised the issue of social worker vacancies in Tusla a couple of times with the Minister in recent months.  All Members were struck by the comments of the new chairperson of Tusla and former Deputy, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, at the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, where he stated that Tusla is running to stand still in regard to recruitment and retention.  Although 142 social workers were recruited in 2018, 158 left the organisation.  Since 2014, approximately 800 social workers have been recruited, but the net gain is only approximately 4%.  The former Deputy also referred to legacy issues and cultural changes which must be confronted.  What did he mean by that?  What is the current situation in that regard?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800010#H01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his very important questions.  There are currently 321 vacant posts for social workers in Tusla.  The agency is actively trying to fill these funded posts.  It is acknowledged that there is a shortage of social workers in Ireland and internationally which makes recruitment of the required staff very challenging.  The scale of the challenge is significant.  For example, in 2018, the Tusla recruitment section appointed 142 new social workers but 158 social workers left or retired from the agency during the same period, as the Deputy pointed out.  The turnover rate for social workers has fallen from 9.5% in 2017 to 7.8% in 2018.  This may reflect the recent work that Tusla has undertaken to address retention issues.  Tusla is operating a year-round rolling campaign to recruit more social workers and will open a graduate campaign in April, as in previous years.  It is also seeking to recruit other supporting grades so as to enable social workers to concentrate on their core tasks.</p>  <p>  Although the Deputy referred in his question to a six-week timeframe to have all cases investigated, I can confirm that all referrals to Tusla child welfare and protection services are screened immediately to determine whether they meet the threshold for social work intervention.  Referrals undergo a preliminary inquiry which seeks to assess the level of risk and whether the referral relates to a child protection matter or child welfare, or whether a family support intervention is more appropriate.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that a new national approach to practice, entitled "Signs of Safety", was introduced on 5 February 2018.  This new approach introduced changes to the preliminary inquiry step of the referral process.  The timeframe for carrying out preliminary inquiries is now five days.  This step may involve gathering relevant information about the child or asking for immediate protective action for the safety of the child, if required.</p>  <p>  Last Tuesday, the board of Tusla approved the agency&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic workforce plan.  I expect that this will chart the way forward in terms of a realistic approach to the personnel deficits being experienced by Tusla.</p></speech>

She told me last month that at that stage, Tusla had 499 agency staff and that 226 of those were social workers.  What percentage of the total social worker staff are agency staff?  It is welcome to hear that the turnover rate is beginning to fall.  The Minister told me previously that the overall rate for Tusla was reducing to 5% or 6%, which is the normal rate one would expect in an organisation, but grave concern was expressed recently at the committee by the Irish Foster Care Association.  Ms Bond, from that association, made the point that social workers have a caseload of approximately 30 children per worker, which seems an incredibly high number given that in the UK, the figure might be 17 or 18.</p>  <p>  I also asked the Minister previously about the breakdown across the regions.  Last year, there were 282 vacancies with 61 in Dublin south, 57 in Dublin west, 89 in Dublin north east, 70 in Dublin mid-Leinster, one in residential and four in national service.  Those are very big deficits which remain.</p>  <p>  The Minister made a fundamental point to me in a previous answer.  She said there are only 200 to 250 social work graduates each year from our universities.  Is it time, therefore, that we widened out the educational programme?</p></speech>

The Deputy&rsquo;s first question is on the percentage of agency staff.  I can get the figure to him but what I would say is that whatever it is, it is too high.</p></speech>

That is the objective of Tusla as well as myself.</p>  <p>  The board has finally agreed this multi-annual strategic workforce plan, which has been quite some time in coming.  It is a very significant achievement by the current board under the chairmanship of Mr. Rabbitte.  It took a long time because it was a complex thing to develop but it will provide a basis on which hopefully we can approach this issue with a deeper understanding of both how to mix the staff in appropriate ways and also according to the regions and settings.  The Deputy's question was around the breakdown across the regions.  We have to look at the regions, the particular needs arising in the context of the regions and the ideal model of a mix of approaches or teams to support young people and children.  That is all contained within the workforce plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800011#J00500"><p>Tusla told us that at the end of the second quarter last year, approximately 515 children were awaiting an allocation of a social worker, which is 130 more than in the previous quarter, and approximately 546 children did not have an up-to-date care plan.  Those figures are disturbing.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 8 in our joint committee's report on the provision of foster care services in Ireland stated that all children in foster care should be provided with a dedicated social worker.  Given that 92% of the 6,300 children in State care are placed in foster care, has that recommendation been implemented?  Importantly, in respect of aftercare, 1,800 young people aged 18 to 22 were in receipt of aftercare supports in Tusla at the end of the fourth quarter.  That was in 2016.  Is that an area that has been addressed?</p>  <p>  Finally, I know it is a longer-term process but what is the Minister's view of the suggestion made by the chairperson that we should expand the provision of social worker courses outside of traditional universities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800011#J00600"><p>It is important to put all those figures on the record because that is the basis on which we are trying to move forward and improve matters.  I would make two brief points in that regard.  The Deputy mentioned that Catherine Bond of the Irish Foster Care Association appeared before the committee.  One of the points she made that I was particularly struck by was that perhaps Tusla should conduct exit interviews when social workers retire or move on to help us understand retention issues.  That is a great suggestion.  Retention is an issue.  Recruitment is an issue but also the supply in order to recruit.  I have identified that recruitment will be approached in a much more strategic manner now that we have a workforce plan.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked two questions relating to the supply.  The Department has already gathered together the various appropriate institutes of higher learning, along with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and others, to examine if we can increase the number of places for social work training.  One of the key areas has to do with work placement issues.  It is not just that they study in the colleges.  They need a placement and we need to mainstream or institutionalise those placements.  That is one of the first tasks on which that group will work to ultimately increase the supply.</p></speech>

I will be bringing the Bill back to the Seanad soon and intend to have it passed by both Houses by the end of this session.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Bill seeks to balance the rights to identity and to privacy, which sometimes conflict with one another.  Given the constitutional context, striking the balance between those rights is proving to be challenging.  Members of the Oireachtas, stakeholders and lobby groups have expressed concerns about those specific aspects of the Bill which seek to achieve that balance.  In particular, the requirement for adopted people to sign an undertaking declaring that they would not contact their birth parent was considered by some to be offensive to adopted people.</p>  <p>  Having listened to these concerns, I engaged again with the Office of the Attorney General seeking to revisit the privacy provisions and to strengthen the right to identity.  I recently secured Government approval to draft amendments to revise these provisions in the Bill.  The revised scheme will seek to remove the requirement to sign an undertaking.  It will also provide people applying for birth information with the opportunity to make their case about why this should be released, in circumstances where its release is being opposed by a birth parent.  My officials are actively working on drafting the necessary amendments, with the assistance of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the delay with progressing the Bill.  It has been a long and arduous legislative journey but new draft legislation was announced by the Deputy's colleague, the former Minister, Mary Hanafin, in May 2001.  Eighteen years later, I am confident that this revision will have a positive impact on access to birth information and will be an improvement on the existing provisions in the Bill but it will only finally succeed if Members of the Oireachtas support it.  It reflects my sincere efforts to tilt the balance more strongly in favour of applicants&rsquo; right to identity and access to birth information, while maintaining protections for a small cohort of potentially vulnerable birth parents.</p></speech>

All the information she has laid before the House today is welcome.  To follow on from that, when does she plan to meet the various groups that would have fed into the process previously, as they want to have an input into the amendments?  Does she plan to have a consultation or a round-table discussion with the various interested parties to ensure the Bill makes its way through the Seanad?  There has been much hurt and upset about this and 18 years on, many people are waiting with bated breath for the passing of this legislation.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure there is communication and dialogue and not stalling?</p></speech>

I am confident at this stage that we have pushed as far as we can in terms of the constitutional limits and restrictions on the right to identity and the protection of the birth parents to bring that together in the best possible way for both sets of stakeholders, having listened to the stakeholders from different sides for quite some time.  I am confident about that but I need Members of the House to support it to ensure its passage.</p></speech>

There are 6,480 adults and 3,784 children living in emergency accommodation.  As we know, these figures do not tell the full story.  They have been massaged and managed to try to keep them as low as possible.  Despite the massaging, management and spin, they represent the reality for the adults and children concerned under the watch of the Government.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in 2016 when Rebuilding Ireland was re-launched.  At the time, he said it was an ambitious plan and that it was the Government's main priority.  He also said: "If urgency is not there, we will get into the system."  In July 2016 there were 6,525 people living in emergency accommodation.  The only things that have gone into the system since are almost 4,000 more people.  They have entered emergency accommodation because of inaction under Rebuilding Ireland which was the T&aacute;naiste's plan when he was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as well as the Government's.  It was tailored to meet economic conditions of the time.  It outlined the many changes the Government was going to make, but, as in the case of every initiative taken by the Government, it was based and founded on spin and had no substance.  The figures announced yesterday are what we have to show for it, which is a source of sadness and anger.  Surely, the figures should represent a call to action by the Government, instead of spin and more promises.</p>  <p>  We need action on a number of issues.  The local authorities still do not have discretion to build small or medium housing estates.  They still have to interact with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to receive clearance and so on.  We also need action on evictions.  Deputy Frank O'Rourke has done a lot of work in this area.  People have to be evicted into homelessness before they can access a HAP scheme payment.  If the Government will not listen to voices in this House, surely it will listen to the United Nations which hammered its policies, in particular, for allowing vulture funds to buy properties and then rent them at high rates.  There is a range of people dealing with this issue who are losing confidence in the Government's ability, but it will not listen.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in an interview this morning with Bryan Dobson, accused him of having an ideological position because he was being asked hard questions.</p>  <p>  Will the Government finally fess up to the fact that its plan, Rebuilding Ireland, is not working?  The Government and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government need to re-orient their housing plan to deliver and address the fact that under their watch there are 6,480 adults and 3,784 children dependent on emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

Nobody is denying the figures or the fact that there are far too many individuals, families and children who are homeless in Ireland.  Rebuilding Ireland is a plan to try to respond to that problem, as well as to a whole series of other challenges in the housing market, a market that was fundamentally broken and that we are fixing.  It is important to deal with the facts, as well as the emotion.  There is a lot of emotion in this debate, understandably so.  I have met many families and individuals who are homeless because, as the Deputy said, I was previously the Minister with responsibility for housing.  It is important to say that, as a Government, we are committed to increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 by 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 being the figure agreed to by the all-party Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.</p></speech>

The local authority stock of social housing increased by over 8,000 and this year the figure will be over 10,000.  Last year 5,135 individuals exited homelessness into independent tenancies, an increase of 8% on the figure for the previous year.  That is a record level of exits out of homelessness in a calendar year.  There are 27 family hubs in operation, with capacity for 650 families.  I accept that it is not enough.  To be honest, families should not be in hubs; they should be in social housing or another long-term, stable rental arrangement to give them a home.  We are listening to others in this House and experts outside it.  Rebuilding Ireland was always a policy initiative that would change. depending on where the pressures were and from where the demands were coming.  That is happening.  The number of people who are being taken out of homelessness is higher than ever before. </p></speech>

This is not just about numbers.  The T&aacute;naiste said there was too much emotion involved in dealing with this issue, but perhaps there is not enough emotion in the debate.  We are talking about real people in this so-called republic who are living in hotel rooms, bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs.  There are 4,000 children whose lives have been wrecked before they have even begun, many of whom have never known a place they could call home.  At the national conference last weekend the Taoiseach had the audacity to say Fine Gael's housing plan was working and that the Government was on the right track.  It might be working for landlords, the vulture funds and property speculators, but it is certainly not working for ordinary people whom the Government is supposed to protect.</p>  <p>  The Minister went on radio this morning, but for whom did he bat?  It was clear that it was not for the 10,000 homeless persons in the State, or those who were facing rent hikes or eviction.  He batted, as he always does, for landlords because that is the side he and Fine Gael are on.  He accused the interviewer, Bryan Dobson, of asking ideological questions when he was asked to defend the Government's abysmal record on social housing construction.  Fine Gael has turned it into an ideological issue.  Making sure people have a roof over their head should never be the subject of an ideological dispute in this House; it should be an automatic right.  The Government is failing those who are homeless, those who are renting and those who aspire to own their own home because it simply does not get it.  The housing system is broken.  We need real homes, bricks and mortar from all sources - social, affordable and private.  That requires adequate investment and means doubling the investment in social housing construction.  It means real rent certainty and introducing a three-year rent freeze.  We need to stem the number of people entering homelessness or who are at risk thereof.  That means legislating.  The single biggest cause of homelessness is landlords selling properties and evicting their tenants.  The Government could do something about that in this House today.</p>  <p>  There will be legislation before the D&aacute;il this evening, brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin.  When he brought it forward previously, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il failed to support it.  It is based on the Focus Ireland amendment.  It would prevent buy-to-let landlords from booting tenants out of their homes and into homelessness.  The T&aacute;naiste and Fianna F&aacute;il can take a stand if they are genuine about the comments they have made by supporting the legislation to stop landlords from evicting tenants because they want to sell their homes, which is the major cause of homelessness in the State.  That needs to be done.  Deputies need to support the legislation.</p></speech>

It is an emotive topic, but we need to talk about numbers and facts, as well as the emotion.  I am not saying we exclude one or the other.  The State is not the only one facing this challenge.  Last year almost 20,000 households approached housing bodies in Northern Ireland because they considered themselves to be homeless and solutions had to be found there as well as here.  It is a challenge many countries are facing and we need to do more.  It is unacceptable in Ireland to have children and families living in long-term emergency accommodation - we all accept this - but the way we resolve it must make sense and be legally sound.  The legislation I understand Sinn F&eacute;in will propose this evening would do nothing retrospectively for families or individuals who are under pressure.</p></speech>

We need landlords in the market.  It needs to be viable for landlords to operate in and predictable as a marketplace.  We also need more protections for tenants.  When I was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I introduced many extra protections for tenants, to which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has added and will add again next week.  The key issue is the number of families and individuals entering homelessness.  We are accelerating housing supply as quickly as we can.  It is working and we are meeting the targets set by us and this House in the Rebuilding Ireland plan.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposal after proposal.  Fianna F&aacute;il trumpeted last year's budget as the housing budget and stated it had secured major decisions from the Government on housing.  Six months later we have record numbers of homeless persons in the State.  The T&aacute;naiste continues to make the argument that the Government's plan is working, but the figures tell us otherwise.  The fact is we have the highest and fastest growing level of child homelessness in the European Union and, despite Fine Gael having been in government for eight years, the situation is getting worse.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a doubling of investment in social and affordable homes, but the Government has rejected this.  It has a decision to make today.  The major cause of homelessness in the State is landlords evicting their tenants into homelessness.  We can take the bold and correct decision today to support the Focus Ireland amendment which Deputy &Oacute; Broin's legislation would enshrine in law.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il rejected the legislation in 2016.  This is the time to do the right thing by supporting that legislation.  The Government cannot cry crocodile tears on the issue of homelessness, especially child homelessness, while at the same time sitting on its hands and continuing to allow landlords to evict their tenants into child homelessness.  The Government legislation will do nothing to protect tenants who have been served notice to quit.  It is time to stop the spin.  It is time for substance and this Parliament to legislate.  It must take a side to ensure it will protect those who are facing the nightmare of homelessness.  There are already 10,264 people homeless and, unless something is done and action taken, as we have suggested, the situation will only get worse.  We have told the Government this year after year, but, unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears.</p></speech>

Some 10,200 people are in emergency accommodation, 3,784 of whom are children whose lives will be irredeemably scarred and marked by the experience of living in emergency accommodation for one or two years.  For many of them, those years were preceded by the insecurity of facing eviction or unaffordable rents in private rented accommodation before they were evicted for sale or refurbishment.  The Government has refused to take action in this regard and has voted against legislation that has sought to prevent those children from entering that shameful, unacceptable situation.  Is the Government not ashamed?  Does it not accept that its policies have failed?</p>  <p>  Since Rebuilding Ireland was published, the number of adults in emergency accommodation has increased by 117%, the number of children in emergency accommodation has increased by 247%, while the number of children in emergency accommodation since Fine Gael entered Government in 2011 has increased by 470%.  Is the Government not ashamed of that?  Does it bother the Government that misery is being visited on those thousands of families, on top of the more than 100,000 families waiting a decade or more on social housing lists?  Tens of thousands of working people - a whole generation - whose income is above the threshold to get them on a social housing list cannot afford the obscene prices and rents that are available in the private market.  It is a whole generation locked out.</p>  <p>  While that is happening, what is happening to the landlords to which the Government sold vast amounts of property through the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA?  The situation has even been condemned by the United Nations, which agrees with what we are saying.  A total of 93% of the property assets sold by NAMA have been sold to foreign investors that sit on land and speculate on it.  Margaret Sweeney of Ires REIT has paid herself &euro;680,000, while the profits of Cairn Homes, the largest owner of land in Dublin, increased by 267% last year.  Is the Government not ashamed?  Is it not true that the reason it is not delivering the social and affordable housing on the scale necessary to deal with the crisis and alleviate the suffering is that it is worried it will interfere with the profits of companies such as Cairn Homes, Hines and Ires REIT, which were invited into the country but do not even pay tax because of loopholes the Government has created regarding the massive profits the companies are accumulating?  Is the Government not ashamed?</p></speech>

Of course, I am conscious that 10,000 people will be in emergency accommodation tonight.  I am not happy about that and the Government should not be either, but we will change it.  We must focus, however, on where the problem is.  Through the Rebuilding Ireland programme, we are delivering significantly more supply year on year, taking more individuals and families out of homelessness than ever before and putting them into tenancies and homes.  What we have not done is overtake the number of families who are entering homelessness, which I accept, and we need to do more in that area, but it is also important to point out what we are doing and what is working.  In truth, we are trying to fix a fundamentally broken housing market that collapsed during a property and banking crisis.  We are trying to return to a point of building approximately 35,000 housing units of all types and we are getting there.  Last year, just over 18,000 units were built and we added 8,400 social houses.  On top of that, there is a heavy reliance on the housing assistance payment, which, while too great, is necessary in the short term while we increase the number of builds, bring voids back into use, put long-term leasing arrangements in place and so on.  The figure exceeded 8,000 last year and will exceed 10,000 this year.  Some 25,000 housing units, I hope, will be built this year and up to 30,000 next year.  We are moving in the right direction on those metrics.</p>  <p>  The rental market, too, was broken and we are fixing it, which is why the Government introduced rent pressure zones and limited rental inflation within those rent pressure zones.  At the same time, however, we must ensure that there is investment and building to deliver supply.  What many Deputies seem to suggest is that the State should simply do it all and build houses for virtually everybody.  There is not the capacity to do that in the short term and the Deputy knows that.  Money is not the issue; rather, it is a matter of capacity and pace of build.  We need to empower and fund local authorities to build much more and then hold them to account on the targets we set for them and the targets they set for themselves.  That is happening and the details are published on the website of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in order that people can see who is or is not performing.  We need to remain on that journey of providing more supply and, through legislation, we need to do more to protect tenants and ensure that they will not find themselves homeless and unable to find alternative accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will bring forward proposals in that regard next week.  Some Deputies have made their own proposals but they do not stack up.  It is important we do not agree to something we know may cause an even deeper problem in the medium term.</p></speech>

I inform the T&aacute;naiste and anyone watching the debate that last Tuesday, Raise the Roof agreed to hold another national demonstration on 18 May, for which we make an appeal to everyone in emergency accommodation, on a housing list or who cannot afford the obscene rents or property prices being charged in the private market.  We will appeal to everyone who is in mortgage distress to come out onto the streets and ensure the coming election is a referendum on the failed housing policies of the Government.  We gave the Government solutions in the motion which the Government ignored but was passed by the House.  The Government must stop evictions into homelessness now.  It must freeze rents now, build at least 10,000 council houses per year, not the pathetic 2,000 that were built last year, and it must expropriate any land or property that is being sat on and speculated on by the investors the Government invited into the country.  Even the UN has condemned the Government for handing over the residential property market to vultures that exploit the misery of people affected by the housing crisis.</p><p>We have offered the solutions and the Government ignores them.  Is it not the case that the Government ignores them because it is worried that they will impact on the profits of Cairn Homes, Ires REIT, Lone Star, Kennedy Wilson and such, which are making an obscene fortune from the misery of people affected by this crisis?</p></speech>

I raised it with the Taoiseach in February and again over the past year.  Unfortunately, in ainneoin ruda&iacute; a bheith ag feabhs&uacute;, t&aacute; siad ag dul in olcas.  We now have 2,000 people suffering on a waiting list for serious surgery on shoulders and ankles.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues to put themselves in the position of those people who are now on a waiting list.  The rain poured in while the Government was talking about a rainy day fund and it put two theatres out of operation.  The list has gone up exponentially and I now have a letter from the consultant orthopaedic surgeon, on behalf of ten surgeons, telling us that the list is now 2,000 and has been accumulating on foot of the lack of infrastructure.  The situation is becoming unbearable for patients who are clinically worsening as they wait to be admitted for surgery.  They are clinically disimproving.  At this stage, it is incumbent on senior management in either Saolta or the Health Service Executive to make a public statement to the people on their waiting list, either to say that they can handle the problem or that the problem is too big for them to address.  It is unprecedented for a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, on behalf of nine others, to write to Deputies and to the Minister on more than one occasion to highlight this situation.  He stated it is now becoming a growing regional crisis and it gave him no satisfaction to write that.</p>  <p>  My question to the T&aacute;naiste is as it was in February and all of last year.  How could it be so difficult to put up two modular theatres?  What type of health executive do we have in Saolta?  It told us last February that tender documents had gone out and in May that contract documents had gone out, were about to be signed and the modular theatres were about to go up.  On Tuesday, we found out that the whole process has been stopped.  We do not know what happened but I know that more than 2,000 patients are suffering with no other alternative arrangements having been made for them, with a series of misrepresentations from Saolta, even to the Minister for Health.  He understood that the contracts had been signed.  I have asked for an urgent meeting with the Minister for Health.  I appeal again to the Government to take a hands-on approach and put itself in the position of any of those patients who are waiting for complex surgery because the Saolta University Health Care Group cannot provide modular theatres.  What hope have we for a children's hospital?</p></speech>

She has asked this question before in this House and many other public representatives for Galway have also raised a lot of frustration with regard to this issue.  As outlined and confirmed this week by my ministerial colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, in a Topical Issue debate, the HSE has been obliged to terminate the procurement process to provide the orthopaedic modular units.  I am assured that the HSE will commence a new procurement process as soon as possible.  I think the Deputy knows the background to this.  Leaks developed in the roof of the building on the campus of Merlin Park hospital that houses the hospital's two orthopaedic theatres in September 2017.  Remedial works took place last year and one of those theatres has reopened but it has resulted in about one third less throughput, which has resulted in longer waiting lists.  For a problem to be caused by a leak in a roof in September 2017 and for us to still be talking about a procurement process to get a modular unit in place to remedy that situation in 2019 should frustrate everybody in this House.  That is why there needs to be a sense of real urgency to solve this problem as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The tendering process was undertaken for the provision of two modular theatres for orthopaedics on the Merlin Park hospital site and a successful vendor was selected for the project, contracts were engaged and were under discussion between both parties, and a planning application was submitted last December.  Saolta advised that unfortunately, contracts could not be executed and that the decision was taken to terminate the procurement process.  Saolta has further advised that a revised procurement strategy is being put in place to restore full capacity at Merlin Park to immediately address the waiting list issues.  The hospital is currently working to optimise current capacity to treat patients.</p>  <p>  As for what went wrong, the HSE has now confirmed that it has terminated its letter of intent with Falcon Healthcare on this project after failing to reach agreement on the terms of the contract.  Falcon Healthcare was attempting to remove key elements of the tender from the contract and the HSE could not accept the revised terms as they were in breach of what was tendered.  As I said earlier, the HSE will now commence a new procurement process as quickly as it can.  I can understand the frustration and will certainly pass that on to the Minister for Health, with whom I know Deputy Connolly has already raised the matter.</p></speech>

It is beyond frustration and beyond anger.  If a Government can stand over 2,000 people suffering and getting worse, there is something seriously wrong.  If Saolta and the Health Service Executive cannot erect two modular theatres, which were supposed to be temporary, something is seriously wrong.  We appeal to and ask the Government to take a hands-on approach.  That was done by the Minister in October 2017.  We had all the stakeholders somewhere in this building and they said the theatres would be provided.  They have not been provided since then.  I cannot stand here as an elected representative and talk about frustration.  These people are suffering.  Something is seriously wrong with management and decisions relating to management have to be made by the Minister.  This is in a hospital that has 67 nursing vacancies, 35 physiotherapy and occupational therapy vacancies, 23 management and administration vacancies, which, on reflection, we may need fewer of, and 17 other vacancies which have not been identified.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to stand here and talk about frustration.  We need a solution to this.  There has to be some way to put in modular theatres as a matter of urgency.  They are temporary.  We are avoiding the local authority for planning and many other things.</p></speech>

A procurement process went wrong because of a difference of view between the company involved and management.  It fell apart and has now been terminated.  It needs to be replaced as quickly as possible with a new process to deliver the infrastructure as quickly as it can allow.  In the meantime one of the theatres is working, but the throughput is not what it would be if both theatres were up and running.  I will, of course, pass on not only the Deputy's frustration but also that of the House generally on the issue to the Minister and the Department.  We cannot simply bypass all procedures.  There is a tendering and procurement process that the State needs to abide by.  Because the last one fell apart, it needs to put a new process in place as quickly as possible.  It also needs to finalise the planning permission because the application was only lodged in December.  My understanding is further information has been requested and needs to be delivered by the applicant.  In many ways, it is not possible to defend the timelines here and I am not attempting to do so.  I will exert appropriate pressure to make sure the timelines are shortened to have the project concluded as quickly as possible.  It should not be rocket science to put in place modular units to respond to a leak in a roof and some other issues that have emerged since September 2017.  We need to conclude the project as speedily as possible.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has consistently said there are discussions under way, but there are no notes, yet on page 6 of the <i>Financial Times</i>this morning, if the T&aacute;naiste wants to read it, there is a detailed report in which Irish Government figures are quoted as conceding that there might not be any way to avoid controls.  When will the T&aacute;naiste be clear with the House?  There will be a vote, possibly tomorrow, such that before this House meets again, there may or may not be some pathway to Brexit.

We had a long stakeholders' meeting again yesterday at which all parties who wanted to be were present and we discussed the issue.  The Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on Brexit was there and understands the position clearly.  There is no magic plan that will resolve the all-island economy issues in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  It will require further conversations with the European Commission and may also involve conversations with the British Government if it looks like we are approaching a no-deal Brexit.  I suggest the Deputy speak to his party's spokesperson on Brexit who is well briefed on the issue.</p></speech>

In the midst of the crisis the Minister for Health offered repeat smear tests to all women who wanted one, but he never ensured there would be the capacity to deliver them.  We now know that it has resulted in up to 78,000 women having to wait up to six months for their results.  Yesterday it was reported that just 7% of resubmitted smear tests had been checked.  That leaves 2,400 women waiting for repeat test results, despite having been promised priority in testing and results within four to six weeks.  If the US laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, cannot deliver the results on time, the Minister needs to resource laboratories in Ireland to carry out this testing.  What are his plans to have this issue sorted as soon as possible on behalf of all the women who have been left waiting?</p></speech>

The ushers are very much part of the make-up of Leinster House and how it operates.  The relationship between the ushers and Members is a very friendly one.  Donal has been a huge part of that relationship and I really do wish him well in his retirement.</p>  <p>  With respect, I think Deputy Pearse Doherty is mixing up two issues.  The issue that was the subject of media attention yesterday was specifically related to Quest Diagnostics.  The Deputy is right, there is retesting for reassurance purposes.  Many of the women concerned have not received their results within the timelines that would have been outlined for them.  I am told that Quest Diagnostics is stating it will have the results within the next two weeks for the remaining women involved.  I could perhaps send him more detail, if he wants to receive it.</p></speech>

In the Dublin area and I think parts of Cork, where a lot of people are renting, landlords are increasingly selling their houses because they have come out of negative equity and the bank may well be forcing them to sell.  The consequence is that very often there is no place for the family and the children to go to, except into homelessness.

On the other hand, Tipperary County Council has spent &euro;371,000 per unit on houses in Cabra in Thurles for Traveller families that have been lying idle since last October.  The Minister of State, Deputy English might answer this question.  The average price of a house in Tipperary is &euro;167,000.  These have cost a staggering &euro;371,000 per house and the families are refusing to move into them.  They have horses grazing on the lawns.  Are we going to review the Traveller accommodation plan?  A councillor had a motion down at a meeting yesterday and the director of services refused to attend to deal with it.  This is causing great anger and angst all over Tipperary and beyond.  If we give in to a set of preconditions for people to move into state-of-the-art houses, built at enormous cost and which are almost three times the cost of normal houses, we will set a very bad precedent in Tipperary and I do not want that.  It is time this was resolved and I ask the Minister of State to intervene with the county council.  This is the cost to date, not the full cost.  The reply I have got says it is the cost to date.  There is subterfuge going on here.  There is a &euro;500,000 increase on what we knew at first.  I want to know if this will be allowed to continue.  It is farcical when people throughout the country are waiting for houses and sleeping on the streets.</p></speech>

I again appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to accept Deputy &Oacute; Broin's very reasonable Bill which we will discuss later on this evening.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about a programme in his Department for the Uighur nation in China.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste about this several times and about the fact that concentration camps have been established by the Chinese Government over recent years in which up to 2 million Uighur people, who form a central Asian nation that should be independent, have been incarcerated by the Chinese Government.  This is happening on the T&aacute;naiste's watch.  We know the history of concentration camps on our Continent and we know about the outrageous events that happened in the past, most recently in the former Yugoslavia.  There are concentration camps right now in north-west China in the Uighur nation, which, like Tibet beside it, should be an independent country, but this Chinese dictatorship that illegally took over those countries in the late 1940s continues to do this and to incarcerate a very significant section, particularly the young men, of that nation, which is mostly an Islamic nation.  Is the T&aacute;naiste doing anything about this which is happening on his watch?  What sanctions are the T&aacute;naiste and the European Union going to take?</p></speech>

This green card demonstrates to relevant authorities that a vehicle being driven in their jurisdiction has valid motor insurance.  At present, there is no requirement to have a green card when driving in Northern Ireland because vehicles that travel within the EU are covered under the terms of the EU motor insurance directive.</p>  <p>  I come from Dundalk, a Border area, and as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, many people from Dundalk have been travelling to and fro for work and education to name but a few matters.  Some insurance companies are giving the green cards but most insurance companies are not giving them.  In fairness, the T&aacute;naiste maintained that if there is a no deal exit, everybody will get a green card.  All the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross is saying is that he expects the insurance companies to give green cards.  Nobody wants a no-deal Brexit but the only certainty we have is that the Government can put pressure on insurance companies to issue green cards to every person in Ireland who could be crossing the Border.</p></speech>

Some companies have sent them out to people just in case.  My understanding is that about 1 million of these green cards have been printed.  I would like to see a situation where we can agree an approach with the European Commission in terms of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit that would not require the use of green cards on the island of Ireland, but that is not agreed yet so we have to proceed with caution in the contingency planning that may be necessary.</p></speech>

It relates to the future of St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar as well as Ramelton Community Hospital and Lifford Community Hospital.  There was a march last Saturday at which many hundreds of people in the Stranorlar and Ballybofey area came out to march about the lack of prioritisation by the Government of funding for St. Joseph's Community Hospital because, as the Minister of State knows, the Government indicated back in 2016 that it was its plan to close all three hospitals.  Will  the Minister of State update us today on the funding commitment towards those three hospitals?  Will he also give us an assurance that an allocation will immediately be made in the HSE capital plan for those three hospitals?  Will he further give a commitment that the design phase, in particular for St. Joseph's Community Hospital and Ramelton Community Hospital, will commence immediately to ensure that they are brought up to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards and that the long-stay residential beds there will continue for those communities into the future?</p></speech>

Consultants are working side by side and doing the same work but some are being paid 30% less.  That has resulted in one in five consultant posts being vacant, so this is affecting every community and hospital in the country.  It is impossible to recruit consultants and part of the reason for that is the pay disparity.</p><p>I would like to know the Government's view on this issue.  Many countries facing similar problems have taken proactive actions to address the issue.  What is the Government going to do to address it?  It is leading to gaps in our service, longer waiting lists, as was mentioned this morning, and unmet need for our patients.</p></speech>

We would like to see it addressed.  That has to be done on a phased basis because of the economic impact.  We already have made very significant strides in addressing the issues affecting consultants' pay, with very significant investment in trying to bring that up to speed.  We want to address the new consultants issue but it has to come on a step-by-step basis as we are addressing the nurses' and general practitioners' issues.  We cannot do it all in one quick-fix solution.  The Government has expressed its desire to see that issue addressed but we have to do it within the terms of the existing pay agreement.  We cannot work outside that.  We have to do it within the infrastructure that is available to us.</p></speech>

Irish Water has made an application for planning which has been forwarded to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I understand a special case has to be made under imperative reasons for overriding public interest, IROPI, legislation.  It needs to be dealt with immediately.  I know it is with the Departments.

This indeed was good news for the people, but the HSE cross-border team has been advising those looking to go to the North of Ireland for operations under the scheme that if they do not have a consultation before 12 April, it is not guaranteed that they will be reimbursed after that date.  There might be a little bit of confusion out there.  I have a number of buses heading to the North of Ireland in the next weeks.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clear this matter up?

They had been promised that there would be a new green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, that they could enter, but it now seems there is nowhere to go until the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations are complete, and they are a movable feast.

I think the figure was about &euro;78 million or so in extra expenditure on supports for farmers.

I can use much stronger language than that.  It is at least a national scandal.  Wicklow is no different from any other county in the State.  From December to February, the number of those in emergency accommodation increased by 25%.  In December in Wicklow, 12 beds were opened in the cold weather initiative, which essentially is emergency accommodation.  There is actually a waiting list for people to get into that accommodation.  This Sunday, the premises will close because the funding expires.  The funding was only in place until the end of March.  I listened to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, say funding is not an issue when it comes to addressing homelessness, but clearly it is.  These people are going to be evicted by the Government back onto the streets because there is no alternative accommodation for them.

In January of this year, 4,500 women were invited to have a repeat smear.  The test was ordered on foot of samples taken between 2015 and 2018 which were not tested within the 30-day recommended timeframe.  Since the start of February, 2,500 repeat smear test samples have been sent to the Quest Diagnostics lab in the US.  The HSE confirmed yesterday that only 200 women have received their results so far.  This delay is causing undue stress and worry for a system in which women are losing confidence.  Women are being informed that the test they undertook in 2015 has to be redone four years later.  What plans has the HSE to deal with these unreasonable delays?  The scale of the crisis seems to be running out of control.  Women need to feel confident in this screening service but we are lurching from crisis to crisis.</p></speech>

I would like to read into the record the official position to respond, we hope, to the concerns that exist.  The HSE reports that since 8 February, 2,572 repeat smear test samples have been received incrementally by Quest Diagnostics and more than 200 results have been reported in the past week.  The anticipated timeframe for reporting the results of these tests was four to six weeks and clearly some test results are now slightly beyond this timeframe.  However, the HSE has advised that the vast majority of women awaiting results for these repeat tests remain within the four to six-week timeframe committed to by the lab.  A small number of women are, regrettably, waiting longer.  The HSE has reported that the establishment of an ICT system for dealing with these repeat tests took longer than anticipated.  The HSE has also stated that the laboratory is confident that remaining results will be reported to women within the next two weeks and that future samples received will have results issued within the stated four to six-week timeframe.  I hope that within the next two weeks we will get reassurance and clarity on these issues.</p></speech>

Today I will direct my question to the Minister for Education and Skills.  It relates to the provision of State contracts for the construction of schools.  What is the Government doing about contracts awarded where the contractor is not meeting the completion date even though there are no extenuating circumstances?  The Minister visited a school in Mullingar yesterday - I understand in a personal capacity, whatever that is meant to mean - to see why a school that was due to open in September 2018 has yet to be opened.  The contractor continues to extend his completion date.  It is having a severe effect on the students who are using a facility that is not fit for purpose at the moment.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, Westmeath County Council has a service level agreement with the Department to ensure the project is completed.  People are anxious to ensure the project is completed before September.  I was there because I was invited down by Deputy Peter Burke.  We are also anxious that this project finishes.  I will not get into the detail of a contract.  I have no prerogative in that regard.  However, people's minds are focused to get something completed.  I was there yesterday and the men were working on site.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800019#R01700"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to increase the sentence for persons convicted of conspiring or soliciting to commit murder.</blockquote><p>The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which deals with the offence of conspiracy.  Specifically the Bill proposes to increase the maximum sentence for somebody convicted of conspiracy to murder.  At present that penalty is provided for in section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  The maximum sentence that can be imposed on a person found guilty of conspiracy to murder, where the person obviously has not been murdered, is a sentence of ten years.  The Bill proposes to amend that provision so that a court could impose a sentence of up to life imprisonment for someone found guilty of the serious crime of conspiracy to murder.</p><p>This legislation arises from a case last year where an Estonian man was convicted by the Special Criminal Court.  He had arrived from Estonia for the purpose of carrying out a murder for which he was hired by an Irish criminal gang.  Through the good work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na he was apprehended.  The Garda was able to identify that there were text messages identifying the person whom he was asked to kill and his reply indicating that he proposed to kill the person with &quot;one shot to the head&quot;.  It was a very well-organised criminal operation.</p><p>Fortunately, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na apprehended the individual and he was charged with the offence of conspiracy to murder.  Sensibly, he made the decision to plead guilty.  As a result, when he came before the Special Criminal Court, it was essential that the court gave him some recognition for his having pleaded guilty at a very early stage.  The court noted that the maximum sentence was ten years' imprisonment.  Taking into account his guilty plea, the appropriate sentence given to him was one of six years.  The effect of that is that somebody who has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder, a very serious offence, will find themselves out of prison in approximately four years.</p><p>The legislation proposes to amend section 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  It is anomalous that somebody found guilty of such a serious offence will only be exposed to sentence of up to ten years.  The Bill seeks to increase that sentence to one of up to life imprisonment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800025#AA00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>The <i>voisinage</i>or neighbourhood arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland have provided reciprocal fishing access for more than 50 years.  They have allowed boats from Northern Ireland to fish in Irish coastal waters.  They have also allowed and continue to allow Irish-registered fishing boats access to fish in coastal waters off Northern Ireland.  The Bill seeks to address a requirement identified by the Supreme Court, that is, giving the arrangements a legal footing to cement our ongoing relationship with Northern Ireland.  The Supreme Court upheld the finding by the High Court that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements were not invalid but that there was insufficient provision for them in domestic law.</p><p>Section 1 of the Bill proposes to provide a legal provision to allow Northern Ireland boats to resume reciprocal fishing access under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements by amending section 10 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.</p><p>The proposed new section 10(1) asserts Ireland's exclusive right to fish within the exclusive fishery limits of the State by maintaining previous provisions excluding foreign sea-fishing boats from Ireland's exclusive fishery limits unless authorised by law to fish there.  Subsection (4) provides that anyone who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence.  Subsection (2) explicitly provides for access to fish by sea-fishing vessels owned and operated in Northern Ireland within the area between zero to six nautical miles as measured from the baseline of the State's exclusive fishery limits.  It further describes that this access is subject to the same conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing vessels.  This is consistent with the concept of reciprocity, which is fundamental to the arrangements.  Subsection (3) specifies this conditionality of access to give further assurance to the House that there is no question of preferential treatment for Northern Ireland vessels while fishing in our zero to six nautical mile zone.  The policies and principles necessary for applying equivalent conditions are listed in paragraphs (a) to (e), with a further regulatory making provision in paragraph (f).  <br/><br/>Section 2 of the Bill provides for a Short Title to the legislation, a collective citation and that the Bill, if enacted, will come into effect by means of a commencement order.  Much has been said in previous debates on this Bill about engagement with the fishing industry.  I regularly meet representatives of the fishing industry, including the producer organisations and the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, which is constituted of representatives of all the regional fisheries forums.  Both of these groups were briefed on the Bill as part of regular meetings and attended at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in June 2017 to give their views on the Bill.  It is safe to say that they have made their views known.<br/><br/>On Thursday last, I hosted a further consultation session with the fishing industry representatives at the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty and our discussions were detailed and considered.  The Bill I present to the House today, as passed by the Seanad, reflects amendments adopted which address the main concerns expressed by fishing industry representatives on seeking equal application of rules and regulations.  I also undertook to put on record the assurances received to date from the UK Government on its commitment to the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements for our boats and boats from Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>While there has been much scaremongering, the access arrangements for Northern Ireland vessels will not change from what they were before.  Northern Ireland vessels will simply regain the fishing access they have had for decades under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements in the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State, subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.  While Northern Irish fishing boats are being granted access to fish, I have been asked to clarify the issue of the impact on Irish fishermen&rsquo;s quotas under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.  Northern Irish boats wishing to avail of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements to fish for quota species under the Common Fisheries Policy in the zero to six mile area will need to have the necessary authorisation from their own fisheries administration to avail of UK quota for the species in question.  This has always been the case and will continue to be the case.  There is no question of other countries' vessels gaining access to the Irish zero to six nautical mile zone as a result of this Bill.  The Bill clearly stipulates the boats that may avail of the access.  What we are doing via this Bill is to reinstate arrangements which had been in operation up to the point of the Supreme Court judgment and which have been suspended on our side only pending passage of this legislation.  This Bill seeks to re-establish the reciprocity on our side of these arrangements.  <br/><br/>I acknowledge and understand concerns that have arisen on the issue of long-term reciprocity, particularly given the sensitivities around access to fishing generally in UK waters with Brexit looming.  For its part, the UK Government has set out a consistent position on the matter of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements for Northern Ireland.  On 5 July 2017, the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, wrote to me on the matter of the withdrawal from the London Fisheries Convention and expressly stated that the UK Government remains committed to the principles behind the <i>voisinage</i>agreement between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I will quote the pertinent elements of the letter for the benefit of the House:</p><blockquote>As the Prime Minister has said, we are committed to protecting our strong, historic ties with Ireland and to finding a solution that works for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We also remain committed to the principles behind the voisinage agreement between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I know that you have discussed this issue with George Eustice.  Please be assured that we are keen to work with you to find a firm legal footing for this agreement as soon as possible.</blockquote><p>On 6 June 2018, I received a letter from the Minister, Mr. George Eustice, reaffirming the UK Government commitment and to protecting and supporting continued co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Again, I will quote the pertinent elements of the letter for the benefit of the House:</p><blockquote>The UK has not to date suspended the operation of the Agreement but we are increasingly concerned about the asymmetric application of the agreement and the lack of progress to rectify the situation.  I would like to reassure you that the UK Government remains committed to the principles behind the Voisinage Agreement and to protecting and supporting continued cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  We have continued to honour the agreement, however, we will not be able to accept this unequal application indefinitely.</blockquote><p>He went on to state:</p><blockquote>I would welcome an update on progress of the Bill and steps which you are taking to put the agreement on a firm legal footing.  We are keen to explore possible solutions to make sure that the Agreement can be reinstated as quickly as possible and that it can benefit both Irish and Northern Irish fishers.</blockquote><p>In December 2018, the UK Government again reiterated its commitment in response to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee fourth report as follows:</p><blockquote>The UK Government remains committed to the principles behind the Voisinage Arrangement and to protecting and supporting continued cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  We have continued to honour the agreement.  However, we will not be able to accept this unequal application indefinitely.</blockquote><p>The week before last, on March 18, I met with the Minister, Mr. Goodwill, while we were both in Brussels and he again reiterated the UK Government commitment to the arrangements.  In view of the finding of our Supreme Court, I took the opportunity to ask the Minister, Mr. Goodwill, if the arrangement is legally sound on their side and he expressed confidence that it is.  It is important to be aware that the UK has demonstrated its commitment to the arrangements in continuing to allow Irish sea-fishing boats to benefit from access to the Northern Ireland zero to six nautical mile zone in circumstances of unequal application.  It is time that we act to restore our side of this reciprocal arrangement.  I ask the House to accept this Bill and to demonstrate that we are, and we will continue to be, good neighbours with Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The Bill was introduced in the Seanad two years ago.  In the intervening two years, nothing was done until two vessels were apprehended and we now have to deal with this Bill as a matter of urgency.  In an interview to RT&Eacute; and a national newspaper the Minister, Deputy Creed, pointed the finger at the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and suggested it was responsible for the delay and withdrawal of this Bill in the Seanad.  That is not perception, but a fact, and I ask the Minister to deal with it.  It is not a political charge but it is factual one.  I refer in that regard to the RT&Eacute; and newspaper interviews of November and December of last year.</p>  <p>  This Bill should have been dealt with and the blame for it not being dealt with must be laid at the foot of the Government and, in particular the Minister, Deputy Creed, who decided that this would evaporate until such time as a vessel was apprehended.  It is for that reason we are here today rushing through this legislation.  We on this side of the House accept the principle of this Bill and the need to correct the historical failure to underpin the agreement of former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, and Captain Terence O'Neill, some 50 years ago, which was beneficial to small vessels on both sides of the Border within the nought to six nautical mile zone.</p><p>We are here now because of the decision taken by the Supreme Court which while it accepted there was an informal agreement said it had to be underpinned by primary legislation.  Can the Minister confirm to this House that the view of the courts is that the <i>voisinage</i>agreement does not distinguish between sea fish and aquaculture?  Is it correct that the judgment against the State on the <i>voisinage</i>agreement covers all species, not only sea fish?  This referred only to sea fish when it was first established before a practice in the 1990s extended to other activities such as aquaculture and non-quota species.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to confirm to the House that the Supreme Court judgment does not differentiate between species in terms of interdependence on the <i>voisinage</i>agreement and what is permitted to fish under the terms of that agreement.  I also ask if the same interpretation is taken by the UK authorities on what is permitted.<br/><br/>The greatest area of concern is not necessarily sea fishing but mussel seed fishing.  I have concerns about this.  There is a Donegal man on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House.  Deputy McConalogue and I met with the man's brother rather than the man himself because of the <i>sub judice</i>rule and his brother is very well versed on the issues.  I am sure the Minister was asked this in the Seanad, but I ask him to extend the courtesy of meeting with that man before the end of the day and of taking his concerns on board.<br/><br/>Is the Minister satisfied that, if we enter into this agreement, the mussel seed resource of this State can be protected in a sustainable way?  I am not sure if anyone has details of the state of our mussel resource and that is important to have.  We must ensure that resource is managed so it is not decimated at the expense of those who have been fishing it for years.<br/><br/>The Minister referred to meeting various Ministers from the UK Government.  They have asked the Minister if he is going to put this on a legal footing.  Is this on a legal footing in the UK?  We cannot question the judgment of the courts but the Minister might tell us if the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Robert Goodwill, MP, or the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, MP, are prepared to do that.<br/><br/>Does the Minister have any plans to introduce management measures under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 and, if so, what type of management measures is he considering?  Will those management measures apply to all non-quota species, aquaculture or both?<br/><br/>Despite having two years to prepare this Bill, the Minister found that a lot of progress was made in the time after he withdrew the Bill from the Seanad as a result of meetings with stakeholders which were requested by Opposition spokespersons when we met him in his office on two occasions.  We insisted that telephone calls on a Wednesday evening did not constitute consultation and the Minister eventually conceded to have consultations in the Department's office in Clonakilty.  It is unfortunate that, even still, there were those who did not have the opportunity of consultation because some of those who were not consulted are more seriously affected than those who were consulted.<br/><br/>Does the 18 m restriction only apply to sea fisheries and not to aquaculture activities?<br/><br/>I want to give an opportunity to my colleague, Deputy McConalogue, but I hope that, during the course of Committee Stage, we will have an opportunity to ask more specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800027#CC00200"><p>The Minister has handled this legislation badly over the past couple of years and the past number of weeks in particular.  He failed to consult properly with the fishery organisations and that would have remained the case if not for the stance that Fianna F&aacute;il took in insisting that, once the Bill completed Committee Stage in the Seanad, there had to be proper consultation.  It was the Minister's intention to move ahead without engaging appropriately with the fishery organisations and more is rightfully expected of the Minister with responsibility for fisheries.  That sort of approach was disrespectful to key stakeholders when it comes to the development of policy and national legislation.</p><p>This issue comes against the backdrop of Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il has traditionally been supportive of operating on a 32-county basis and ensuring there are good relations and no barriers to trade on land or water.  We support the principle of <i>voisinage</i>in that regard and particularly at the moment when our national message on Brexit is to try and ensure that there will be no hard border or barriers to trade on the island of Ireland.  Likewise, it is important that we are consistent, from a national point of view, in our approach to our waters and there is, therefore, an imperative to reinstate this <i>voisinage</i>agreement.</p><p>This led to a court case which the Department lost and that begs real questions of the Department about the costs associated with the case and its decision to pursue it.  The courts found against the Government on the basis that there should have been a statutory underpinning of <i>voisinage</i>in order for it to be lawful and continue.  The courts found that the fisherman concerned had not been well served by the State.  It is unfortunate and unacceptable that one of those fisherman, a constituent of mine from Greencastle in County Donegal, Gerard Kelly, has been outside the D&aacute;il for the past three days and the Minister has not seen fit to meet and engage with him on this issue and take his views on board.  The Minister makes the case about the <i>sub judice</i>rule but, given that the second part of that case was decided in the courts last week, I do not accept that as an excuse for not meeting Mr. Kelly.  The Minister should have taken the time to do that and it should have happened.</p><p>The other key issue that needs to be addressed is the management of the fisheries concerned.  We need fair play whereby fishing vessels and fishermen operating under Irish licences are not disadvantaged when compared to the terms and conditions afforded to fishing vessels in Northern Ireland.  There are big issues there as to how mussel fishery, in particular, is managed for its own health and ensuring that the fishermen continue to have a sustainable livelihood.  The Minister must properly engage with the sector after this legislation is enacted to ensure there is a strong and properly regulated management structure in place to ensure fishery is regulated and that Irish registered boats are given a fair crack of the whip and an opportunity to make a living.  I ask the Minister for assurances today that he will engage on allocation rights because I know the Bill is covering and reinstating the access that previously existed under the <i>voisinage </i>arrangements before the Supreme Court judgment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1330" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800027#CC00300"><p>We are an island people and, despite this, Governments have in the past failed to defend, promote and protect the fishing industry effectively.  Successive Governments, both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, have failed to invest in and encourage the development of fish-related industries, specifically fish processing.  At the same time, billions of euro worth of fish have been taken from Irish waters.  This is not only a massive loss to Irish fishing communities but also to the economy of the island.  Only a small proportion of the catch was taken by the Irish fleet.  It is underdeveloped and, as fishing families know, it is often a risky and dangerous occupation.</p><p>A sense of the frustration of many of those in the fishing industry, particularly due to the lack of consultation, is personified by the fisherman on hunger strike at the gates of Teach Laighean.<br/><br/>In our time, we have seen the decline of the fishing industry and a significant loss of jobs over recent decades.  Approximately 9,000 and 4,000 people are directly employed in fishing and processing, respectively.  There is an onus on the Government to maximise the exploitation of the natural fishing resources in a managed and sustainable fashion, which should include a dedicated fisheries Minister.  For the Government of an island nation, even one partitioned as we are at this time, not to conserve, manage or develop our fishing stocks for the national good makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>The Bill is about giving legal effect to a convention in place since the 1960s that has allowed Irish fishing vessels from any part of this island to fish in any part of the waters of this island.  It was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016 and but for the recent embarrassing arrest of two Northern trawlers, it might not be up for debate today.  As the Minister has acknowledged, the Bill has caused considerable concern among the fishing organisations.  Many are worried that if it becomes law, it could inadvertently open the door to the fishing fleets of the contracting parties to the London Fisheries Convention gaining de facto access to the six-mile zone.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consulted some of the fishing organisations and our amendments are intended to address this concern.  I ask the Minister to support the amendments.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 4 specifies that the beneficial owner of the sea-fishing boat could be resident in the North, thereby addressing the abuse of the spirit of the <i>voisinage</i>agreement, which saw multinational speculators use an address of convenience in the North to access inshore fisheries.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that amendment No. 8 was ruled out of order.  Nevertheless, the spirit of the amendment is relevant and I appeal to the Minister to agree that the Government should seek to bring forward urgently and implement an all-Ireland sustainability and conservation management plan for non-quota species within the six-mile limit.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 9 is about ensuring a sustainable inshore fishery around the entire coast of our island and islands.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 10 directly addresses concerns raised by the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO, which outlined a worry that at least six other countries will have access to Ireland&rsquo;s six-mile zone.  Our amendment states: &ldquo;No provisions of this Act shall apply to the contracting parties under the London Fisheries Convention outside of the Republic of Ireland and the North of Ireland.&rdquo;  I urge the Minister and the Government to accept that the fishing organisations have genuine fears about the potential impact of the Bill on the sustainability of the fishing stock and, consequently, of jobs within the six-mile limit.  Our amendment addresses the concerns of the IFPO and others.<br/><br/>We should also remind ourselves of the imperative of the Good Friday Agreement.  The all-Ireland agreement emphasised the need for &ldquo;consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland - including through implementation on an all-island and cross-border basis - on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the Administrations, North and South.&quot;  It also urged the production of &ldquo;common policies, in areas where there is a mutual cross-border and all-island benefit&quot;.  It is clear that fishing is one such area.  Specifically, among the areas for North-South co-operation and implementation identified in the Good Friday Agreement are the issues of inland fisheries, aquaculture and marine matters.  The defence of the Good Friday Agreement, which has been at the heart of the Brexit debate and negotiations, must be a priority and the agreement must be protected, which includes protecting the rights of those Irish citizens who work in the fishing industry in every part of this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800028#DD00200"><p>All parties will support the all-Ireland aspect of the <i>voisinage</i>agreement and the opportunity it offers for fishermen and women all along the coast, particularly inshore fishermen and women who are at the lower end of the income scale within the fishing industry.  As the Minister is aware, the issue came about because of the Supreme Court decision in 2016, and the Government's delay in dealing with the issue has been raised consistently in the House.  That point has been made by other Deputies and, therefore, there is no point in commenting further on it.  The way to resolve any problem in any dispute is through consultation, listening and trying to address its causes.  Were it not for the request that came from our meetings with the Minister after he met the four producers' organisations, we would not be where we are today.  There are concerns with the Bill and its consequences, mainly in respect of the mussel industry but it is about much more than that industry.  Other industries are equally concerned and must not be glossed over.  A number of amendments have been tabled and I hope they will be addressed and considered in a positive way.  We will await the Minister's response to them before deciding what to do.  Overall, the most important part of the debate is that we emerge with a positive result to address the problems surrounding the reinstatement of the <i>voisinage</i>agreement from this part of our island.</p><p>Deputy Adams mentioned a management plan.  I have been involved in fishing for most of my life.  Without a proper management plan, fishing is wide open to abuse, whether from outside our jurisdictions or otherwise.  A proper management plan is the way to deal with the problem.  The amendments address a significant concern relating to fishing carried out on owner-occupied boats that have a flag of convenience and are registered in the Six Counties.  That has to be put to bed today.  One of the proposed amendments will change the requirement for the fishing boat to be &quot;owned and operated&quot; in the North to instead requiring the beneficial owner to be resident on the island of Ireland, North or South, and that must be considered.</p><p>Even though the Minister has ruled it out, the amendment relating to all-Ireland sustainability and conservation is central to the survival of any fishery.  There needs to be conservation with the purpose of sustaining the industry.  Otherwise, the industry will be fished out, as is happening all along the coast.  Overfishing has destroyed many industries, such as those of lobster, brown crab, crayfish and mussels, and it has put people who are totally dependent on the sector in a bad way. </p><p>Another amendment will provide that any vessel &quot;availing of the access permitted under the Act shall only be entitled to fish for a quota or allocation of any species&quot;.  I again await the Minister's response to the amendment, which goes to the heart of the problem.  I expect the Minister's response will help us all to make a proper decision at the end of the debate.</p><p>Has the Minister met representatives of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF?  I know he has met representatives of the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation, the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation, as well as Francis O'Donnell and his organisation.  The NIFF, too, has serious concerns and must be listened to.  We have tabled amendments, which we will discuss later, while other Deputies have tabled other amendments and we will listen to the debate.  The most important aspect is to do right by fishermen throughout the island to ensure they will get justice.  Their livelihoods must be collectively protected and they must not be open to abuse.  There is serious concern about the opening up of access to the six-mile zone for six other countries on foot of the Bill.  We must address that matter today and we must determine exactly where the Minister and the Government stand on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800028#DD00300"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution on this important legislation on behalf of the Labour Party.  Like a number of Deputies present, we have pointed out the deficiencies and defects in the Bill, or at least those which may arise consequential to its implementation.</p><p>We do so in deference and with respect to the large number of groups and individuals whom we have met and who have contacted us as a party directly.  Some of their views are significant and need to be addressed.  We are fully cognisant of and aware of them and conversant with the background and genesis of the Bill and why it has arisen, so I will not rehash that.  I regret that we are in this difficult situation.  I do not think that we would be in such a situation if the opportunities available to the Minister had been taken up by him and officials in the past two years.  There have been more than two years to reflect on this issue.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member along with a number of colleagues here, has done much positive work on this.  We appreciate that this is an all-island situation which has to be addressed.  We are not blind to the realities of it.  I acknowledge that the Minister has had meetings with various people from the industry and some progress has been made to address some of the concerns of the fish-producing organisations, but there are other individuals involved too.  Since April or May 2017, as my colleague, Senator Nash, said, there has been radio silence.  That is a lost opportunity from the past two years.  The time could have been used constructively to engage with parliamentarians, fish-producing groups, individuals and organisations.<br/><br/>People are concerned about this.  I have spoken to Mr. Kelly, his brother, and other people who are involved.  I spoke to Mr. Kelly and Mr. Barlow two years and two months ago.  We had a very detailed conversation.  One cannot but admire their pluck and courage to take on the State.  At any opportunity I get as a barrister, I am delighted to take on the State because I believe in fighting for the small people.  I have often gone in and am prepared to do it <i>pro bono</i>if I have to.  With the amount of financial resources that they invested in the Supreme Court, one cannot but laud their bravery and fortitude.  That is why we are here today.  It is important that the courts look at those things.<br/><br/>The <i>voisinage</i>agreement and London agreement are there, but as other people have indicated, people are rightly concerned about the impact of Brexit, which has far-reaching tentacles, as we know, and the ability of the British Government to honour its side of any agreement and reciprocal arrangements.  Brexit represents a significant challenge to the fishing industry, like so many other industries in this country.  It is clear that people feel aggrieved that, while we have many positive benefits from the EU, this area has suffered greatly.  The Supreme Court has made a determination on this significant national resource-based industry in respect of exploitation of our rich fishing grounds and our quota share.  I know there been pluses and win-wins in other areas but fishermen and fisherwomen feel shortchanged, especially small fishermen and women who do not have large multi-million euro boats or trawlers available to them.  Their capacity to earn a livelihood is diminishing daily and the threat of total extinction of their way of live and ability to earn a living is moving into view.<br/><br/>We must fight to safeguard Irish interests relating to our fishing grounds and quota share, and the naked exploitation of our resources.  While I am an inlander, more used to lakes, rivers and canals than the sea, I have listened to the anguish and plight of the mussel sea fishermen and others and how they feel.  I appreciate that this is another argument which will arise in the second part of the judgment.  A High Court case will be taken in this regard.  It is a matter of gravest concern for these people, who try to eke out a living in difficult and challenging circumstances.  It is in this context that my colleagues, Senators Ged Nash and Kevin Humphreys, raised it.  I have never seen so many people participate, even at our own parliamentary party meeting.  Deputy Howlin had some correspondence from people in Wexford on this relating to sea mussel exploitation.  Senator Nash received correspondence relating to Louth.  Councillor Martin Farren from Donegal was in constant contact with me about this.  Deputy Brendan Ryan raised Swords, Skerries and so on.  The context has certainly enlightened people in a big way.<br/><br/>I know the Minister gave some concessions on the size and length of the boat, with regard to the 18 m boats within six nautical miles.  We are all aware of the statements which emanated from Secretary of State Gove on behalf of the British Government that the British Government intends to take back control of all of the waters governed by the UK jurisdiction.  Are we to assume that, with the correspondence going back and forth from the British Government, there will be a level playing pitch?  It can hardly get the time of day right over there now, never mind talking about this type of thing.  That is a genuine fear and we have to face up to that and face the realities.  It was consistent in many ways that the British would like to see the spirit and letter of the previous <i>voisinage</i>agreement provided for, respected and honoured.  How can we accept the bona fides of some of those expressions that the <i>voisinage</i>may be honoured by both sides and that there would be reciprocity in the absence of any commitment by the British Government to legislate to give effect to that?  That has to be addressed.  Will legislation be forthcoming from the British Government to give effect to the <i>voisinage</i>agreement and the reciprocal argument?  If we were living in normal times, with letters of commitment flowing back and forth, even back when iar-Thaoiseach Lemass and Terence O'Neill were there, that was grand and they were honoured.<br/><br/>We are living in very uncertain times.  Normal business has been suspended in the UK.  Only an hour ago, they were talking about maybe having a third meaningful vote.  They do not know whether they will have a third meaningful vote.  This issue arrived back on the agenda as a result of recent events in Dundalk Bay.  It is a sensitive time and issues are magnified in the context of Brexit and the delicate North-South and east-west relationships, which we all appreciate, as other colleagues have said.  This has nothing to do with Brexit but everything to do with our rights, as a sovereign parliament, to make laws to govern our part.  We have to take into account the interests of the people and communities that we represent.  They tell us that they are deeply concerned.  That is a point we have to make clearly in this regard.<br/><br/>The reality is that we have no idea what the post-Brexit fisheries or fishing relationship will be.  I acknowledge that the Minister is doing his best.  People are saying that we should stall the horses.  There are mediation proposals where everybody would get an opportunity to mediate and see what would satisfy the arrangements that we are trying to make on an all-island basis.  If we were to legislate, people are concerned that access would only be provided for the Irish inshore for those vessels that are owned, managed and operated by those who reside in Northern Ireland and have their businesses in Northern Ireland.  I met the Minister and his officials and he indicated that that is not possible because that may bring other ramifications and consequences, as I understand it.  I remember discussing a Dutch multinational corporation vessel with a Northern Ireland flag as a convenience, which in effect allowed UK vessels to fish in the Irish inshore.  There is a significant impact on available resources from that.  That letter from those people in Wexford was a salutary lesson on the impact that it was.  Those people were saying that they are going off the pitch altogether.  There will be none of them left and that will have an impact on employment.<br/><br/>I do not live on the coast but I see many here who do, such as Deputy Ferris.  They probably made their living in the past from fishing.  As the Labour Party's spokesperson for community and rural development, I know how hard it is to get three jobs in an area.  I am sure there are ten, 12 or 15 jobs in some of those areas.  I am sure they have reared families on that.  That is the concern that we have.  We know that it has to be looked at on an all-island basis to ensure that everything works out, but the issue is that vessels registered all over the place can come in and engage in exploitation.  We have to tread carefully.  It is a pity that we did not get an opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny, because then we can get under the bonnet of legislation, so to speak, and tease it out.  We all want to see a positive North-South relationship, which is very important.  Our responsibility as a sovereign Parliament in the Republic of Ireland is to legislate in the interests of those trying to make out those limits.  We have to nurture good relations.  I have been inundated.  The Irish Farmers' Association is a powerful lobbying group although I do not kowtow to it, thanks be to God, even it does not do as much.  In 27 years, this is the issue on which I have seen the most representations.  I was taken by that with regard to what we can do to advance matters.  It is a difficult and delicate situation.  I know that the Minister has set it out and I will not rehash that.</p><p>The Labour Party knows there is an objective to be achieved.  The question is how to achieve it and the impact and consequences of the legislative basis that we are putting in to underpin the previous agreement.  People tell me that under the reciprocity agreement, very few from the Republic go into the Northern Ireland waters.  Our coast represents 84% of the total.  Equality is an important issue too. </p></speech>

It could have been dealt with in the past couple of years rather than waiting till the last minute to push it through.  That has made a difference in how we would consider this legislation.  We were prepared to speak on it before but the Government let it sit until we came to so-called Brexit or whatever is going to happen, and all of a sudden there is a mad panic to get it passed.  That is a very retrograde step but it is not all that surprising when we think that the <i>voisinage </i>agreement has been around since the 1960s and has never been put on a legislative footing.  This is not a reflection on the present Minister but on Irish Governments all along, for example, the common travel area has been around since 1922, 1923 or 1924 and was never put on a legislative footing.  One would wonder what Government actually does in this State when it does nothing that will have an impact.  Then it becomes a major crisis when we suddenly realise this is going to happen and we have done nothing about it, and legislation is rushed to deal with these issues.  It is appalling and is a sad reflection on this D&aacute;il that these issues have never been dealt with in a timely fashion.  If this had been dealt with in the 1960s and put on a legislative footing, this case would never have come up but that is a different matter.  This shows the way Government has operated in this country.  How many other things are left that we do not know about and that we will discover have not been put on a legislative footing and the D&aacute;il has to rush to legislate for only when the proverbial hits the fan?</p><p>We do not know how much fish Northern vessels catch in Irish waters or how much fish Irish vessels catch in Northern waters yet we have a Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The SFPA is unable to answer queries about how much fish is affected by this.  That is the nature of this Government and Department.</p><p>We are actually talking about making sure that access is guaranteed for Dutch vessels to take mussel seed from around the State.  This legislation should deal with mussel dredging and mussels, which were the subject of a Supreme Court case.  We should be able to protect that industry.  </p><p>This Department allowed Irish-based fishermen around our coast to buy Northern-registered vessels in order that they could get into the business because it is so expensive here.  Fishermen who grow up in the communities and want to pursue that livelihood cannot afford to get into it because of the nonsensical system whereby previous Governments have allowed the tonnage system to become a private market and fishermen and people are excluded from it.  The Department has turned a blind eye to people buying licensed boats in the North and fishing them in the South.  It is appalling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800030#FF00300"><p>Whether or not we allow access for fishermen on both sides of the Border for up to six nautical miles off the coast of each other's jurisdictions is hardly the biggest problem.  What is more important is what type of fishermen we allow.  Are we allowing small self-employed business people or all fishing operations, including large corporate fleets?  I know plenty of small fishermen who are only interested in sustainable fishing because that is the only way they can maintain a livelihood, by fishing when it is sustainable to do so.  Those ethics do not apply to large corporate owners who sail in, take as much as they can and off they go.  They just plunder where they can.</p>  <p>  Aggressive fishing by Northern Ireland vessels has damaged our sustainable mussel-fishing industry.  Michael Crowley from Killinick in Wexford was one of the fishermen who took a case to the Supreme Court.  Some of our largest mussel seedbeds are in the south east and I have spoken to many fishermen who are very concerned about huge Dutch multinational corporations with boats that are registered in Northern Ireland coming down to the south coast and destroying the mussel seed stocks.  They use a Northern Irish register as a flag of convenience.  How can we guarantee that boats registered in Northern Ireland are in fact Northern Irish owned and manned by genuine Northern Irish fishermen?  That has to be a crucial issue.  Many fishermen are also concerned about UK boats getting access.  The Minister said in his press release yesterday that he would address this registration issue today but it has not been addressed through the amendments to the Bill.  The reference to residency in Deputy Clare Daly's amendments seeks to address this registration issue.</p>  <p>  I find it very odd that the Government is rushing through this legislation at such breakneck speed simply in order to give a legal basis to what is a 60 year old agreement, a gentleman's agreement, one with no previous legislative basis and that is no longer suitable or appropriate to the modern world in which fishermen now operate.  The Minister has acknowledged this point in debates about the Bill.  He said the world has moved on quite significantly.  If so, why do we not devise a new agreement that accurately reflects the realities of modern fishing?  We also do not yet know what the Common Fisheries Policy arrangements will be and the UK Government has already indicated that it will withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention.  Very few, if any, Southern-registered fishing boats fish inside Northern Ireland's six-mile limit and it is important to remember that when we talk about neighbourliness or reciprocating the deal.  Several of the lads down home have told me that they are run out of the place when they go up off the Northern Ireland coast.  </p></speech>

However, I am one of the many Deputies who vehemently disagree with that position and believe this is a very dangerous Bill.  As other Deputies have said, nobody in here has any massive objection to Northern Irish fishermen getting access to our six nautical mile zone.  We are talking about neighbourliness and so on and no one has a problem with that.  There is, however, a very big problem with Dutch corporations flying Northern Irish flags of convenience coming to our inshore and decimating our natural resources.  That is what this is about.  It happened to our mussel seed, until the case taken before the Supreme Court in 2016.  It was devastated by foreign boats.  Available mussel seed dropped from 30,000 tonnes in 2002 to just 2,400 tonnes in 2013, pillaged by foreign interests with zero interest in fishing sustainably in our inshore.  That is what is at stake here.</p>  <p>  The Minister made the point in the Seanad that things have moved on, the ownership model has changed and when Senators voiced their concerns about what was going on, the Minister more or less said there is nothing we can do to stop it, that is the way it is, it is free movement and all that.  We strongly disagree with those statements and there is something we can do.  First, we can insert into this legislation a provision that only boats owned and operated in the North by people either resident there or in the Republic gain inshore fishing rights provided under this Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that, his real objective is exposed.  The other option is to put this entire Bill into the bin.  Both of those options are dramatically better than pushing this through today with unseemly haste.  </p><p>IIt is not a case of moving with the times, European free movement or whatever buzzwords the Government is fond of.  It is 100% standard practice for national authorities to retain control of the six mile zone and to restrict access to same to local boats if they want to.  That is their prerogative and there is nothing in European fisheries legislation that says we have to open it up to foreign boats.  It is entirely a choice that the Government is making.  That is what it is.  Equally, the Supreme Court did not instruct the Government to introduce a law in this area.  All that it said was that the previous informal arrangement was illegal because it had no basis in law.  The choice to legislate is entirely the Minister's choice and it is on his head if our inshore is turned into a wasteland, as it will be if he does not agree to the amendments that we have put forward.  That would address the issue of the foreign boats but without that we are talking about standing over a wasteland.</p></speech>

I listened to it very clearly.  One of the things he said is that politicians are scaremongering.  Politicians are not scaremongering.  It is our constitutional right to raise concerns that are out there.  This Bill has lain in the Minister's Department for two years.  Every speaker has been picking up on that.</p>  <p>  I have been calling for a stand-alone Minister for the fisheries and I have been justified in my call because something as important as this which could have serious consequences for inshore fishermen and for fishermen in general is being rushed through the D&aacute;il.  The Rural Independent Group along with a few Independent colleagues and Labour called last week for an extension of time on this debate and I am disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in refused to vote with us on that to allow us that time and voted with Fine Gael because we need time to discuss this.  This cannot be rushed through and it should not be rushed through.</p>  <p>  The island of Ireland has a coastline of 7,500 km.  Fishing has always been important to coastal communities but extremely bad Government policies over the years have left fishing in ruins.  An area known as the Irish Box was created in 1985.  When Portugal and Spain joined the EU, both countries were banned from fishing inside it until 1986, at which point only a maximum of 40 boats were allowed to fish inside it.  At that time, the Irish trawlers could catch an abundance of fish anywhere from the shoreline to ten miles offshore.  It was almost unheard of in 1985 to fish out of sight of the land.  Then Spain complained that it was discriminated against so the 200 mile zone that protected the Irish fishing grounds from overfishing was removed and they argued that a conservation area was all that was needed.  What happened since then?  The Spanish have raped our waters.  Huge deepwater trawlers work 24/7 for 52 weeks of the year in Irish waters.  The Irish trawlers are spending days before they can reach ground where they can make a viable living.</p>  <p>  We are supposed to be in the EU.  That would suggest to any right thinking person that the same rules would apply but that is not the case.  Irish boats have to adhere to an extremely strict quota with electronic logbooks, the must give notice to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, hours before they reach harbour so that they can be inspected on arrival, have their landings observed and sometimes wait after landing to make sure their logbook tallies with the weight.  If there are any discrepancies, they face huge fines and confiscation of their catch, nets and gear at a huge cost but the Spanish fishermen can come into the pier and land their catch straight into an articulated truck without anybody from the SFPA to monitor it because it is powerless as the Spanish have a fleet quota.  Nobody knows how much they are landing.  Then there are Spanish trucks which we all know about in west Cork and they railroad right down through the roads through Glengarriff and Adrigole blowing cars left, right and centre.  It is well known throughout west Cork and it is becoming a huge issue right down through Kealkill on their way to the ports so they can just railroad their way.  This is an unbelievable situation to be allowed to carry on in 2019.</p>  <p>  If we compare fishing off the Irish coast since 1985 it is barren in comparison.  Ireland needs to reclaim the 200 mile exclusion zone immediately.  It is already too late.  It will take decades to recover but it needs to happen now.  Castletownbere is more like a Spanish fishing port than an Irish port with so many Spanish boats landing fish caught in Irish waters.</p>  <p>  Irish fishermen have lost their traditional right to fish for salmon since 2010.  This was the worst thing ever to happen in coastal communities.  It was meant to be reviewed after seven years and it is now 2019 and there has still been no review.  It has been scientifically proven since that it was not the fishermen who were responsible for the decline.  Our rivers are heavily polluted, the spawning beds are shaded by trees and our rivers are neglected but as usual, the easy target is the fishermen: ban them and their way of making a living and take away their traditional rights.  The indigenous people are totally discriminated against.  The fishermen have no voice.  That is what they feel out there.  Like the Native American, they are being pushed aside by bullies.  Where was the EU when this was happening?  Where is it now?  Our rights are being violated.  It is the basic right to feed their families and their survival is being taken away.</p>  <p>  I refer to people such as Gerard Kelly, who is outside on his third day on hunger strike.  Does the Minister have any humanity?  I know he will say that there are certain restraints and he cannot talk about certain matters but God damn it he is standing outside there and he is lying there every night.  It would not kill anybody to go out and talk to the person because he has a heart.  He is only thinking of his livelihood and the livelihoods of his fellow fishermen.  Surely to God it would not hurt anybody to go out and talk to him.  The Minister said he would not do so after the Seanad debate on Tuesday and he is continuing in that stance.  That man is still outside the D&aacute;il.  His family is sincerely worried, I am worried and I call on him to call this off because we will try to take up the fight in here if we will be listened to.</p>  <p>  Since the mid 1990s, fishermen have lost their rights to fish for salmon and they have lost their right to fish for spurdogs because they are protected as a member of the shark species.  They have lost their right to drift net for tuna and they have lost their right to fish for bass.  Half of the white fish fleet has been decommissioned.  Where does it end?  Yet, our Government will not appoint a stand-alone Minister for fishing.  The Minister is responsible for agriculture and that is where his full efforts and concentration should be.  I ask the Minister and many fishermen would challenge him to come to any pier in Ireland and name ten different species of fish or fishing gear to explain how the gear works.  It will not be until fishermen get a Minister who can do that and show he or she has a knowledge of the fishing industry that they can hope to be represented in a fair manner at any level.</p>  <p>  If the Minister looks back to A Programme for a Partnership Government, there were one and a half pages in it set aside out of hundreds of pages.  It just shows the little interest this Government has in fishermen.  A Programme for a Partnership Government stated that: "This Government recognises that the greatest national resource that Ireland has is the sea that surrounds the island."  However, this Government is already selling out our greatest national resource and is being supported in doing so by much of the so called Opposition in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The fishing industry has got a poor deal from successive Governments.  The fishing industry got a poor deal when Ireland negotiated its entry into the EU.  Much of our waters were given away.  I mention the bluefin quota and I thank the Minister because in fairness he did listen to what I asked in my plea that the Irish Government would apply for a bluefin quota.  That is the kind of fight we need going forward and I will be raising more issues on this point going forward because I have run out of time and my colleagues need to get in.</p></speech>

There was time to have proper consultation with stakeholders.  Why did the Minister not consult the Irish fishermen?  Why did he refuse to meet them?  Why did he not consult the Marine Institute to see if the grounds most affected, such as Dundalk Bay, can sustain more fishing boats?  What about the different quotas for razor clams and fish and the difference in the legal size for crab, lobsters and velvet crabs?  Northern Ireland boats can legally take a lot more than we can.  How can this be policed by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority?  These questions need to be answered.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, Irish fishing vessels cannot fish within 12 miles of the Isle of Man and they are excluded from fishing inside a six mile exclusion zone around the entire British coast.  The Minister wants to allow UK vessels to have access to Ireland's six mile fishery zones.  This is not acceptable for the Irish fishing industry.  The Minister also stated that all Irish registered fishing vessels of 80 m and over will be excluded from fishing inside Ireland's six mile fishery limit from 2021 onwards.  Yet, the Minister is attempting to fast track legislation that will allow vessels from Northern Ireland to fish inside Ireland's six mile fishery zone.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, the UK has already stated that it is leaving the London Fisheries Convention, severing the existing arrangements which allow for access to inshore waters between neighbouring states.  Irish fishing organisations and fishermen are totally disgusted with this.  In the Minister's speech, he said there were no questions of other countries' vessels gaining access to Ireland's nought to six mile zone as a result of this Bill.</p><p>Is there anything in the Bill that will prevent a UK or EU citizen resident outside Ireland and Northern Ireland from registering a fishing boat in Northern Ireland or the South, thus gaining permission to fish inside the six-mile zone?  The UK Government has continually alluded to the fact that it intends to take full control of UK waters post Brexit.  It is imperative that the Irish Government hold fast in changing legislation until we know for certain whether Irish registered fishing boats will be allowed to fish in UK waters.  Surely new laws can be introduced in both jurisdictions to take effect on the same date if and when the United Kingdom departs the European Union.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael Collins and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle met him and his family last night.  He has five young children, including two sets of twins, but he is being forced to be idle.  He is a man who wants to work, harvest fish, pay for his vessel and look after his family.  The fishing industry lost out badly in 1973 and ever since has been kicked around the place.  It is the poor relation in the so-called great times in the European Union where it is looking after our farmers and everything else.  We now know what is happening.  The Minister has sold out on the industry, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne.  They want to have a separate Minister in order that Deputy Creed can concentrate on being Minister for agriculture, but he is doing neither this nor that.  He will not tackle the meat factories either or check the machinery used in monitoring the standard of beef.  For him, it is all about big business.  Nothing changes with Fine Gael.  It is the party for the big people.  Forget the daoine beaga; they do not matter.  The landed gentry is all Fine Gael is interested in and the Minister will not listen in this instance either.  It is a shame that the Independents and the Labour Party had to force a debate on this matter today.  It was to go through without debate except that we stood up.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are all in bed together.  Whatever Government comes out at the finish, it will not know what it is doing.</p></speech>

It is about conservation of a very scarce resource.  Looking after fisheries means conserving them to make sure they will be available to fishermen, not just now but also in the future.  It is about ensuring species will continue and still exist in 100 or 1,000 years' time.  I say this with respect to some of the speakers opposite.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins talked about rivers being more polluted than ever.  That is not the case.  They are in a much healthier state than they were many years ago.  The use of industrial pollutants and pollution caused by human and farm waste, sewage and so on are guarded against far more rigorously to conserve and protect water supplies.  That has a significant impact on fish also.  The Deputy says we are not allowed to fish for salmon, but that is not actually true.  The fact is there is a significant number of rivers in which one can catch or catch and release, while there are others in which one cannot fish at all.</p></speech>

Every single salmon begins life in the river comes back to it.  The only way we can make sure there will be salmon into the future - the species is in danger of being overfished - is by conserving stock.</p><p>Wild bass was mentioned.  It is a fantastic species.  Wild bass take a long time - something like 20 years or more - to reach maturity.  If they were allowed to be fished commercially, there would be none left in one year.  That would destroy and despoil the species, perhaps removing them forever from our environment.  It is not true or right to say the Minister, the Government, the European Union and others are out to prevent people from making a decent living.  It is quite the opposite.  They want to make sure they can make a living, that the industry will be sustainable and continue into the future.</p><p>I have only come to this issue in the last week or so.  I hear my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, talking about boats from Northern Ireland as if it was some strange place, rather than County Down being adjoined to County Louth.  We live on an island and, as I understand it, rights are reciprocated, North and South, something with which I do not have an issue.  I do not believe in partition, either on sea or on land.  There should be fair and reasonable access to fisheries, North and South, if we want to have an all-island economy.  However, there are issues with conservation, including with the razor stock in Dundalk Bay.  It is finite and reducing and fishermen are rightly and properly afraid that it will be overfished, including by boats from other counties.  They are saying they were not consulted and have raised questions about the Marine Institute being consulted.  They have referred me to articles carried in the <i>Marine Times</i>.  </p><p>I will always support conservation which is in everybody's interests now and into the future.  However, policy must be wise and applied fairly.  The fishermen in County Louth who spoke to me are concerned that other boats, regardless of from where they come, may have access to a diminishing reserve which just about has the capacity to give them a living.  I do not know if that frames the question in a different way, but that is what they are saying to me.  I reject the partitionist attitude to fisheries of other Deputies.  It is silly.  If we conserve what we have and there are reciprocal rights, North and South, that will be good for everybody.  Conservation must be the key determinant.  If fisheries off the coast of County Louth are under threat because of overfishing, they must be conserved.  Local people should be least affected by conservation measures in terms of access.</p></speech>

That four D&aacute;il Deputies from County Louth and Senator Nash have taken time to address this issue speaks volumes, particularly about the concerns of inshore fishermen along the coastline.  As others said, the short delay in stalling the rushing through of this legislation was welcome to allow consultation with interested stakeholders.  However, it should have happened in the two year period, but the Bill sat on the shelf until suddenly, as I said directly to the Minister recently, the stage managed arrest of two trawlers in Dundalk Bay brought to a head the deliberate intent of the trawler men to drive a coach and four through the scrutiny of and the real issues surrounding the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  I draw the attention of the Minister, as others have, to the lack of representation and audience given to the inshore fishermen, particularly at the meeting in Clonakilty, to which he referred.</p><p> As part of the discussion on this legislation and while recognising that all eventualities cannot be included in the Bill, I want the Minister to give a clear commitment to the House and reassure me and the 70-pIus fishermen we represent in Carlingford, Dundalk Bay, Annagassan and Clogherhead areas, that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Marine Institute will conduct a full appraisal of fish stock with an ecological study of the six-mile zone along the Irish Sea coastline to ascertain if the area can sustain a potential doubling of the number of boats fishing there.  A 2018 evaluation by the Marine Institute of the stock levels in this area conducted by Dr. Oliver Tully verified a stock decline.  Currently, 50 razor boats are fishing a quota of 600 kg.  In addition, 15 southern potting boats are fishing in Dundalk Bay.</p> <p> While many, including Deputy O'Dowd, may accuse me of being partitionist in my approach to this legislation-----</p></speech>

While I do not mind being accused of being partitionist, I make no apologies for being partisan in favour of those fishermen and their families in those communities, particularly in my own.</p><p>On quotas for razor clam and fish, I have been advised by the North East Razor Fishermen's Association that the legal sizes for lobster, crab and velvet crab differ in both jurisdictions.  Will the fishery area be properly policed, especially with the stock being landed in different jurisdictions?  Will the Minister assure me that the Bill will not open a door to opportunist and unscrupulous fishermen to seize the opportunity to register boats in Northern Ireland to avail of the freedom to ravish these waters?  In the interim it might be appropriate that only registered boats, North and South, would be allowed to fish these waters and that their number be capped by agreement until the capacity of these waters in terms of their management and ecology is determined.</p><p>The 1966 <i>voisinage</i>agreement related to mackerel and herring fish in particular.  The need to protect and manage the stock up to six miles from shore is crucial, especially in this area.  There are proposals for wind farms in the area.  I cite in particular the ESB's Oriel wind farm where large swathes of water will be legally no-go areas.</p><p>Much great voluntary work has been done on large-scale conservation of, in particular, egg-bearing female lobsters.  All this work will be in vain when such efforts are not happening in Northern waters.  Having ravaged, pillaged and exhausted their own stocks, they will do the same here unless this is addressed at departmental level North and South to have equality in both waters.  Local communities in our 14 coastal counties depend greatly on inshore fishing.  The sustainability of this industry will be seriously undermined if, when the Bill passes, it is not followed up closely with additional statutory instruments and bilateral agreements that are fair and bring equality.  People talk about <i>voisinage</i>, neighbourliness and reciprocation.  Neighbourliness is about being good neighbours and reciprocation is a two-way process that is balanced and of mutual benefit.</p><p>I continue to believe that this legislation is urgent in view of the court decision.  In the event that the UK decides to leave the London Fisheries Convention, irrespective of whether Brexit occurs, this legislation will be seen to undermine our negotiation strategy.  While I recognise the need to be seen as seeking a backstop on land, we could be seen as not wanting a backstop in our waters.</p><p>All of that said, I am a realist and know that the Whip will be imposed and the legislation will be passed today.  I am expressing the concerns of many people in my community.  I ask the Minister to consider a delay in the commencement order to verify the bona fides of the British in respect of their overall approach to the spirit of <i>voisinage</i>and whether there will be real reciprocation in all European waters.  Such is the concern fishermen have over this that a person is on hunger strike outside the Leinster House today.  From speaking to some of these fishermen I understand they will consider petitioning the President to refer the Bill to the Council of State regardless of what happens here.</p><p>The request that this Bill be parked has fallen on deaf ears despite the Minister's consultation in Clonakilty.  It is clear to me that most Irish fishermen are frustrated and appalled at what is happening.  They are at a loss to understand that the Minister is more interested in satisfying UK citizens while treating our own inshore fishing industry with what they believe is contempt.</p><p>I wish to conclude by reading a section of an email from a constituent this morning which succinctly shows the need for real reciprocation.</p><blockquote>It is with great frustration and regret that I have to sit down and write this email...<br /><br />It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the 2 boats were arrested were in Dundalk Bay.  The good fishing in the bay is direct result of conservation and selective fishing, v-notching and self-policing that has gone on in this area since I began fishing 25 years ago.  These northern boats that have exhausted their own fishing areas by illegally fishing females, harvesting small lobster and crab for export to China are now sitting waiting to rape and pillage these waters that generations of your constituents have left a healthy fishery for us.  I fear there will be nothing left...<br /><br />I started fishing as a 5 year old with my father and grandfather.  8 years ago I got a loan from the credit union and bought a new boat and licence at great expense.  I have to keep the boat and equipment to a certain standard in order to maintain my licence, also at great expense.  My father and myself had to complete 2 different BIM courses to be able to keep fishing, also at great expense.  I had to buy 2 lifejackets ... All of which these northern boats don't need to do.<br /><br />So until they have ... tonnage at the same rate as we do, have the same safety and training standards as we do, then I don't see why this government is fishing through this ill-thought-out legislation.<br /><br />Once again the fishermen are being ridden roughshod over.</blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800034#KK00100"><p>We are dealing with this Bill today and I note from the Minister's contribution he has at least tried refer to some of the issues that have been raised by various members of the fishing community.  As was said by previous speakers, we had a meeting a few weeks ago the outcome of which was that we sought to ensure that the Minister would engage directly with the representatives of the fishermen and the fishing organisations.  I understand that happened last Thursday week for a number of hours.  While the outcome of that was communicated very clearly to us, namely, that the fishing organisations still had many reservations around some of the issues they were concerned about, in general, they felt that this Bill would proceed.  That was the general theme we got back from it.  However, since then there has been a sense of possibly more concerns, particularly about the London Fisheries Convention, which is an issue that has come up clearly.  People are concerned that if this Bill is to pass, it will allow boats from other countries that have signed up to the London Fisheries Convention equal access to Northern Ireland, which is also part of that convention.  The Minister needs to deal with that issue and to spell out clearly the position in respect of that.</p><p>In terms of the broad thrust of the Bill, it is important to remind ourselves that, as many have said, we live on an island and if there are boats off the coast of County Mayo from County Kerry or County Donegal that have travelled to fish there, it is equally right that boats from County Derry or County Antrim would also be able to fish in those waters or <i>vice versa</i>.  As a party that wants to see a united Ireland, which is one of our central objectives, we understand that this has to happen and that everything has to be done to make it happen.  As the Minister mentioned, the Good Friday Agreement is part of that.  We need to progress this forward.  However, there are concerns and it is important to separate and outline those concerns.</p><p>As mentioned by previous speakers, some of the concerns relate to the broad fishing industry and what has happened in many cases where we have seen large boats from other jurisdictions come into our waters and plunder our resources and do all kinds of damage.  In fairness, this legislation provides for restricting the size of boats to under 18 m and allows access within the six-mile limit.  Those provisions address some of the concerns but there needs to be an emphasis on protecting the resource.  </p><p>The main concern is regarding the mussel industry and the protection of the mussel beds.  It appears there has been at least a degree of over-exploitation of those mussel beds in the past that has brought us to this situation.  It is for that reason we tabled amendment No. 8, proposing the implementation of a all-Ireland sustainability and conservation management plan for non-quota species within the six-mile limit.  While it has been ruled out of order, I would appreciate it were the Minister to address that and those issues, because they need to be dealt with.  I note the bottom mussel forum, which is an effort across the two jurisdictions, North and South, to deal with this matter, has been up and running for approximately ten years now.  It is timely to examine that, review what has happened and identify what has been positive and where improvements need to happen.  What has been communicated to all Deputies from many of the fishing organisations is that there is room for major improvement in that respect.</p><p>Many of the other issues mainly relate to the ownership of vessels and to ensure that flags of convenience cannot be flown.  Our amendment No. 3 and amendment No. 4, in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Pringle, are similar and address the same point, namely, that those who own the boat need to be resident on the island of Ireland to guard against boat owners from abroad travelling to our waters and using them as a flag of convenience.  Every effort needs to be made to ensure that does not happen. </p><p>On the issues that have been spelled out in our other amendments, particularly our amendment regarding the London Fisheries Convention, the scenario whereby boats from Belgium or other countries would be able to come under the radar in this regard would be of major concern for everyone.  The Minister needs to assure us that will not be the case.  The best way to do that would be to accept our amendment and its inclusion in the legislation would make it clear to everyone that this could not happen and that the London Fisheries Convention would be outside the terms of this Bill.</p><p>There are problems facing the fishing industry, particularly the inshore sector.  The Minister has acknowledged that by some of the work he has done recently in limiting the size of boats that come into the inshore sector.  That sector feels very much aggrieved by what has happened over decades within the fishing sector.  When issues arise, they see them as another example of them being victimised and losing out to others.  This legislation presents an opportunity for the Minister, the Government and all of us to be a champion for that sector and to make sure that does not happen and that what we are doing here in the context of this Bill will not do that.</p><p>The Minister stated that the fisheries in the zero to six-mile zone will need to have the necessary authorisation from their own fishing administration to avail of UK quota for the species in question.  That brings me to an issue I would like the Minister address. In the context of Brexit, whether there is a deal, no deal or whatever transpires, it is clear that Britain will be outside the Common Fisheries Policy before very long.</p><p>If it is, quota will not apply to boats registered in the North because they will be outside the EU and therefore they will not have an EU quota.  Unless they come up with some quota regime of their own, where will we all be in respect of all of that?  What will that quota regime be?  The current quota is organised and agreed among all the members of the European Union and while we have many issues with that, if Britain intends to independently set its own quota standards and size of quota, it can say it has quota to fish anything they like within the six-mile zone and bring it back to Britain.  It is an issue with which the Minister needs to try to deal.</p><p>The Minister mentioned scaremongering in his contribution and people talking up the problem rather than looking for the solution.  That is always thrown back at people who make representations on behalf of a community that feels aggrieved, left out and put on the back foot but at the same time, the major grievance we have is around the level of authority of the British boats.  When boats from the South go up to the North, do they have a legal standing?  It was challenged here and that is the reason we got into this situation.  Had it been challenged in the North, perhaps there would be no legal standing there either.  It is very vague in respect of that.  The Minister said he asked the Minister in Britain about that recently and that he received assurances from him but I would say his verbal assurances are not worth the paper they are written on.  Unless we have something solid we can see that it is underwritten in British legislation, where then do we stand?</p><p>I want to deal with the amendments before the House.  The first two amendments in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Pringle are on the issue of aquaculture and the mussel seed beds, as is our amendment No. 8, which was ruled out of order.  They are issues with which the Minister needs to get to grips and come up with solutions for people and provide firm reassurances, not like the verbal assurances he got from the Minister in the UK but something that is real and on paper.</p><p>Our other amendments relate to the ownership of the boats, for which I hope we get support.  There are three other amendments sponsored by Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins.  While I understand where they are coming from in proposing them, I have issues with them because they are basically saying that the 26-county State stands on it own, we are not an island any more and that we recognise partition.  We have issues with that and that is why we could not and will not support those amendments. </p><p>Amendment No. 9 regarding the quota or allocation of any species in accordance with the quota on both sides of the Border is a real hole in all of this and it needs to be dealt with appropriately  I hope the Minister can accept it, which would mean we would at least have an assurance in respect of that. </p><p>Other parties have many views in this respect but while I sense this Bill will pass, these amendments need to be inserted in it.  We need to be able to see that we are standing up for the inshore fishermen and fighting their corner.  The man who is protesting outside the gates of Leinster House is an example of that.  Whatever people's views may be of court cases, he is obviously a person of strong commitment who is prepared to make a stand.  We must be prepared to admire people who make such a stand and acknowledge they are worthy of being considered. </p><p>I appeal to the Minister to also speak, if not to the man himself, then to people close to him; for example, his brother is someone the Minister could speak to.  He should have a conversation around these issues and make sure we can make progress.</p></speech>

With few exceptions, the overall direction of travel is one we are in agreement on.  I appreciate the concerns that have been raised and I will try to deal with them as comprehensively as possible now and in the further debate on the amendments.</p><p>The beauty of this legislation is that it is short and succinct.  It seeks only to put back in place that which existed up to the October 2016 Supreme Court ruling.  As it goes to the heart of some of the concerns that have been raised, I will read into the record exactly what we are talking about.  In its essence, the Bill is about keeping people out of our waters.  Deputy Kenny alluded to this fear of the armada from the United Nations arriving into our inshore sector.  In fact, the Bill specifically talks about keeping people out and it being illegal to come in other than by the provisions of the legislation, which is about allowing boats from Northern Ireland.  The Bill states:</p><blockquote>(1) ...a person on board a foreign sea-fishing boat shall not fish or attempt to fish while the boat is within the exclusive fishery limits unless he or she is authorised by law to do so.<br /><br />(2) A person who is on board a sea-fishing boat owned and operated in Northern Ireland may fish or attempt to fish while the boat is within the area between 0 and 6 nautical miles as measured from the baseline...</blockquote><p>In layman's language, my clear understanding of that, and the advice available to me legally and otherwise, is that anybody else, other than from Northern Ireland, in our zero to six nautical miles zone would face the full rigours of the law.</p><p>I appreciate the point has been made by other speakers in the context of the London Fisheries Convention and the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  The<i>voisinage </i>arrangements long predate the London Fisheries Convention.  What the London Fisheries Convention did is acknowledge their existence and facilitated recognition of history and custom up to that point and their continued operation in this State up to October 2016, when the Supreme Court ruled.  In essence, all we are doing is restoring the <i>status quo ante</i>, which I think is the term used by the Taoiseach in the debate.  It is as simple as that.  The legislation in all other respects is about locking people out of our zero to six nautical miles zone.</p><p>There are many nations that are participants or are involved in the London Fisheries Convention but this legislation is specifically about restoring what was the custom and practice up to the Supreme Court ruling.  At that stage, if the London Fisheries Convention had enabled all of that to happen anyway, it did not happen.  The custom and practice was that it was a North-South relationship.  I think this is the right thing to do.  We can get into all the complicated reasons of why it is the right thing to do but I think that, as citizens of the island, it is the right thing to do.  We share this space together historically.  It is a complicated relationship, North-South, and I know those who are closer to the Border are more in tune with the complexity of that.</p><p>I want to come to Deputy Breathnach's point.  I take exception to being accused of being more interested in protecting the rights of UK citizens than of Irish citizens.  My only imperative in this legislation is to do the right thing.  There are many measurements of what that is, whether it is Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement, the troubled history we have had prior to that or the identity politics whereby some people in Northern Ireland look to London and some look to Dublin.  This is a complicated area.  However, I and the Government, and I think most of Deputies who spoke, acknowledge this is about reinstating something that existed.  It is not about prioritising one political tradition or identity over the other.  It is important in the context of that comment to say, in the context of people in Northern Ireland, that there are people-----</p></speech>

Since <i>voisinage </i>has been in place, the whole arrangement in regard to the type of boats and how people are operating on both sides, North and South, has changed dramatically.  I made very clear all of the disadvantages the current boats have, and I even said this to the Minister at the meeting a number of weeks ago.  Although I did not allude to it today, I am talking about the grants that are available.  That is why I have to say there is a favouritism towards the UK, and I stand over that.</p></speech>

This is a complex area and I think we are doing the right thing by reinstating the arrangements.</p>  <p>  The contributions fall into a series of areas which I hope to deal with comprehensively, and I will refer to my individual notes later.  There is a danger we will start to conflate two issues in the debate: one is the principle of access and the other is management issues.  The Bill only deals with the principle of extending or reinstating access that existed up to 2016.  It is not about the idea of how we manage these resources.  I accept management is a really important part of the issue and it is a very complicated piece of work, involving socioeconomic, scientific and environmental issues, stakeholder driven and involving livelihoods in two jurisdictions.  Management is a complex piece of work and it is important that we do not get bogged down in regard to a specific species.  Deputy Gallagher raised this in the context of the Supreme Court ruling.  At paragraph 28, Mr. Justice O'Donnell stated: "In particular I agree that reciprocity is only required at the general level of fishing, and is not required at the level of each species."  There is a danger in this debate that we get captured by one particular sub-sector of the inshore fishing endeavour, which would be unfortunate.  It is about the broader inshore sector.  I was asked by Deputy Martin Kenny or Deputy Ferris whether I met the inshore fisheries forums.  There is no representative group of the fishing industry I have met more in recent times than the inshore fisheries forums, most recently as part of the broader consultation in Clonakilty, which was mentioned by many.</p>  <p>  With regard to consultation generally, the context in which we find ourselves in the House in an effort to get this passed is one people can interpret for themselves in terms of the Bill being introduced originally in the Seanad.  While I do not propose to go into that, people are familiar with the circumstances.  Neither can I accept Deputy Breathnach's comments, which I think are also unfortunate, although I accept we had good engagement bilaterally.  He referred to a stage-managed arrest.  The enforcement authorities of the State do not act at the political direction of the Government or anybody else.  I think-----</p></speech>

We had a particularly intense engagement recently because we launched an inshore fisheries strategy and, for the first time, the potential of the sector is being given due recognition.  I am committed to ensuring that the sector gets the recognition it deserves.  I urge those Members who raised issues of management to look at the Department's website which deals with consultation and management.  There were more than 900 engagements with the Department on the recent management decision taken on boats fishing in our inshore waters.  We have extensive consultations on fisheries management.  I acknowledge the progress that is being made by the regional and national forums in terms of driving conservation agendas on crab, v-notching and so forth.  Anyone who comes in to fish in the six-mile zone will be obliged to operate within the same parameters as our own inshore fishermen in terms of boat size, conservation measures and so forth.  That is an absolute commitment and it is reflected in the law.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace spoke about reciprocity and argued that this Bill does not represent reciprocity and is unbalanced.  However, I have clarified that Northern Ireland boats will only fish here under the same terms and conditions as Irish boats.  It is not the case that they will be able to fish under entirely different circumstances.</p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly said that the Bill is dangerous and made reference to Dutch corporations.  She also said that restrictions must also apply to our own fishermen.  They will only come in under exactly the same terms and conditions as ours.  The different models of ownership are referred to in the High and Supreme Court judgments dealing with this issue.  The courts said that times have moved on from one man and his boat in the 1960s and that our laws and practices must reflect the fact that ownership structures have changed.  As I said in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, corner shops are now limited companies in many instances.  In that context, it is only right and proper to expect that ownership models employed by the fishing industry would also change.  Reference was made to mussel seed and to Dutch corporations.  I do not believe the latter are active except insofar as there may be Dutch ownership interests in the Northern Ireland fleet, as there are in the register in the Republic of Ireland.  Those engaged in the mussel sector must use the mussel seed on the island of Ireland.  It is not that they can pillage the seed and take it elsewhere.  They have to use it on the island of Ireland so it is creating jobs and supporting employment on this island.</p>  <p>  Deputy Pringle asked why we are choosing to put the arrangements on a legislative footing now.  In the context of Articles 2 and 3 and the 1960s, the arrangement was of its time and once those articles were changed, one could argue that it would have been appropriate to put it on a statutory footing.  It was argued that we should not just accept the bona fides of the UK.  Our bona fides were challenged and theirs could also be challenged.  It was suggested that we should not accept their word, but surely their deeds speak for themselves.  To this day, our fishermen still go north and fish in their six-mile zone.  The House of Commons report asked how long the unbalanced approach could be expected to continue.  We are just reinstating a previous arrangement and putting it back in place as it was.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins comes from west Cork.  The sound of doors slamming on our Northern Ireland counterparts would make another west Cork man and the Deputy's namesake spin in his grave.  I have no doubt he would be spinning in his grave in response to that particular contribution.  It was quite shocking in many respects, but so be it.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd alluded to management, and while that is an important issue, it is not the main concern of this legislation.  My Department, in consultation with all stakeholders, is always interested in progressing these issues.  However, I point out to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues that this is made more difficult in the absence of a functioning Assembly in Northern Ireland.  One must ask from whom the Executive takes instruction in terms of an all-island approach to managing a resource.</p></speech>

I note that he was quick to point out that this Bill is concerned with the broader principle, that it is not concerned with the day-to-day management of our sea-fisheries, and that there will be opportunities to talk about such management in the future.  The problem is that there will not be such opportunities.  We will not get another opportunity so we must deal with them in this legislation.  Unfortunately, the only way that this House can deal with these issues is to deal with them now because they will not be dealt with at a later stage.  That is the main problem.</p><p>While this Bill is about putting on a legal footing arrangements that were previously in place, it arises from companies around the coast taking cases to assert their rights.  They fought the Government the whole way along the line to vindicate their rights and practically bankrupted themselves in doing so.  Mr. Gerard Kelly is on hunger strike and is outside Leinster House today protesting against these arrangements.  In the period since this Bill was first introduced in 2017, these issues could have been dealt with and resolved.  This could have been done in a way that would have satisfied everyone and made everybody happy.</p><p>However, the Minister has chosen not to do so but to go down this route, which is fair enough.  The amendments we have brought forward are an attempt to deal with the issue.  I believe they do so and that they should be accepted.</p></speech>

The Deputy will wish to be aware that the Bill intends to amend Part 2 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Therefore, the definitions within that Part of the Act apply to terms or phrases used in the Bill.  Within that Part the definitions already address the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.  I will read the definitions for the information of the House: &ldquo;sea-fishing&rdquo; means fishing for or taking fish or sea fish; &ldquo;sea-fishing boat&rdquo; means any ship, boat or other vessel of whatsoever kind used for sea fishing and includes any vessel or boat used for the treatment of fish or partly or wholly for the transport of fish.  Aquaculture boats are sea fishing boats within the meaning of the Act.  Therefore, the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment can be considered to be tautology as the definitions already encompass the elements it seeks to include.</p><p>Deputy Pringle&rsquo;s amendment has the appearance of seeking to exclude mussel seed from the scope of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I cannot accept the amendment as the Act is the primary legislation used to regulate sea fishing and manage and conserve sea fish resources within the State, including mussels and their seed.  The Act is intended to give national expression to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy that relate to marine biological resources and do not make any distinction such as the Deputy proposes.</p><p>I must stress that the Bill should not be seen as an opportunity to regulate individual fishing activities or manage any particular species.  It is about the principle of access.  The regulation and management of fishing activities are a complicated business, one in which I engage regularly with the fishing industry and experts from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, as I do with other stakeholders.</p><p>I will quote again from Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s judgment in the Supreme Court, as I did earlier in responding to Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher's query:</p><blockquote>In particular I agree that reciprocity is only required at the general level of fishing, and is not required at the level of each species.  I also accept that the arrangement must be a flexible one if it is to permit the fishing now carried out.  The corollary is however that the present fishing is not within the precise terms of the 1965 correspondence.</blockquote><p>Reciprocity at the general level of fishing means that if an Irish sea fishing boat is permitted or restricted in a particular way, the same must apply to a Northern Irish sea fishing boat while fishing under the arrangements and <i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to delete the words &quot;owned and operated&quot; and substitute &ldquo;of which the beneficial owner(s) are person(s) resident&rdquo;.  It is about ensuring the provision is only for people resident on the island of Ireland.  It gets to the point, to which the Minister referred, of keeping others out.  It is not meant in a selfish way, yet in a way it is selfish.  We need to ensure those involved in the inland fisheries sector will feel protected by the Bill as much as they will be accommodated by it.  </p><p>I also commend to the House amendment No. 4 which is very similar and makes the same point.

There is a big difficulty in that it is almost impossible to define accurately what constitutes being "owned and operated" in Northern Ireland.  We cannot be specific about what is a Northern Irish vessel.  As the vessels are registered in the United Kingdom, there is no clear Northern Irish designation.  Leaving aside the issue of Dutch vessels, on which we touched, even without a flag of convenience there is huge scope for the exploitation of Ireland's inshore waters by English, Scottish and Welsh boats, for example.  It is incredibly messy.  It is unhelpful in that sense.  Many of the arguments made by the Minister are actually arguments for why Ireland should not rush this Bill through with haste.  Nobody has given a good reason as to why we need to act with such haste.  The amendments try to tidy up various elements a little.</p>  <p>  My amendment would provide that only boats owned and operated in Northern Ireland by persons resident in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland would be allowed to fish within the six-mile zone.  We have included a proviso in respect of persons resident in the Republic of Ireland who own Northern Irish vessels because we know that this happens on occasion.  The amendment would have the effect of only allowing our neighbours to exploit our inshore resources.  Only those who live on the island would be allowed to fish in our coastal waters.  To me, there would be nothing wrong with this.  It is good and we should be doing it.  It is eminently fair.  If that is the purpose of the Bill, as the Minister sort of says it is, why not do it?  What other European country has opened up its six-mile zone to fishermen from any other country in Europe?  The United Kingdom has not done it; why, therefore, would Ireland do it now?  Why are we considering doing it when our arrangements are totally unclear because of Brexit?  I was sorry earlier, but I am even sorrier now that we are ramming the Bill through, given that Brexit has been delayed.  There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed, on which I have not heard satisfactory answers so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800037#NN01200"><p>I wish to reiterate some of the points made by previous speakers.  The amendment is vitally important and goes to the heart of the matter.  It also shows the mismanagement of the coastline by the Government.  The Minister has said clearly that the matter must be dealt with through regulations and procedures that will be introduced afterwards, but that will not happen.  That is why the issue is being raised and dealt with here.  Nothing will happen afterwards.  This legislation sat on the shelf for two years, during which nothing was done.  All of a sudden it appeared and is being dealt with now.  The Minister thinks he is going to regulate these issues and deal with them now, but he could have been doing so all along.  It is not happening.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of the costs associated with many boats around the coast.  When a person wants to become involved in fishing, perhaps because it has been a tradition in the family, because of the way the capacity licence system has been built in Ireland, he or she has to buy a boat at a cost of &euro;50,000.  A person living in the North can buy a boat on a far more cost effective basis.  This has led to a situation which the Minister and the Department have allowed to develop over time where Northern Ireland registered boats are being operated all along the coastline by local people who are trying to get into a business in which their families may already have been involved.  They are, however, prevented from doing so owing to the costs involved.  The amendment would entitle them to develop their business, as well as keeping others out, which is vitally important.</p><p>Irish fishermen are not allowed to go to the North Sea to fish because they are stopped by Europe, England and everyone else.  They have been restricted in that regard from the day we joined yet we are opening Irish waters to everyone.  We are allowing everything to happen here because that is just the way things go on.  We are such good Europeans that we will do it.  We need to protect the fishermen who have tried genuinely to make a living for themselves as best they can.  It is the inaction of the Department that has allowed this situation to arise.  Fishermen have been caught up in that, which is unfair.</p></speech>

In fairness, I felt the Minister brushed me off and started to talk about management and everything else.  I maintain that the people who know best are the fishermen themselves.  They have asked to meet the Minister on numerous occasions but he has refused to do so.  How many times do we have to ask?  Are there any loopholes?  Are UK and EU citizens going to come in and start to take over the whole area from zero to six nautical miles off Dundalk Bay?</p></speech>

I noted in my contribution that while the Minister keeps talking about management, it would surely be sensible to limit it to currently registered boats owned and operated in both jurisdiction until we have the famous management plan committed to as part of the passing of the legislation.  We will also have the Marine Institute's capacity study as part of this.  I know it cannot be part of the Bill, but it makes sense that we should stick with currently registered boats until such time as we are satisfied that there is additional capacity over and above what is being done, following the necessary ecological and management studies of the stocks.  I can only refer to those I have been dealing with along the coast.</p></speech>

We speak all the time about &quot;owned and operated&quot; but some are referring to &quot;residency&quot;.  If someone is living in Northern Ireland and operating a licensed boat in Coleraine, for example, I worry about residency if the person decides to move to Donegal or Louth.  Are the appropriate words then &quot;owned and operated&quot;?  Is there any reference in the amendment the Minister introduced in the Seanad to &quot;residency&quot;?  I believe it would be discrimination.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800038#OO00500"><p>I thank colleagues.  Deputies have proposed an amendment to impose residency requirements on the owners of Northern Irish sea-fishing boats.  At the time of confirming the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements in the 1960s, reference was also made to the requirement to be permanently resident in the Six Counties.  With the passage of time, however, we must acknowledge the changed realities within which we operate.  Not least of these changes is the fact that citizens of EU member states, including Ireland, have the right to reside in any part of the European Union.  Freedom of movement and residence for persons within the European Union is the cornerstone of Union citizenship established by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992.  The Deputies' proposed amendment is also not compatible with the reality of corporate ownership of sea-fishing boats.  As stipulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and reinforced by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services guarantees mobility for businesses within the European Union.  I cannot accept an amendment which proposes the imposition of illegal provisions.  If we were to exclude corporate ownership as a principle for access to the zero to six nautical mile zone, it would also impact on our own sector, perhaps to a greater extent.  Some of the allegedly foreign owners of Northern flags of convenience could well be Irish investors, an issue I recall one Senator alluding to on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p><p>I will read to the House excerpts from the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Birmingham, which are of direct relevance to this issue.  He said:</p><blockquote>The structure of the fishing industry in Europe and indeed in Ireland has evolved in the half century since the exchange of letters occurred.</blockquote><p>He went on to say:</p><blockquote>It may well have been the case that in 1964 boats were owned and operated by individuals and that it was realistic to think in terms of permanently resident individual fishermen.  However, almost 50 years on, where vessels are larger and more sophisticated, corporate ownership is now the norm, as is illustrated by the fact that the corporate plaintiffs are each the owners of a vessel.  It seems to me that the arrangement entered into is robust enough and flexible enough to deal with the structures of an industry which like other industries can be expected to evolve over time.</blockquote><p>The Supreme Court accepted the High Court's analysis of the arrangement.  The following is a quotation from Mr. Justice O'Donnell's judgment:</p><blockquote>In particular I agree that reciprocity is only required at the general level of fishing, and is not required at the level of each species.  I also accept that the arrangement must be a flexible one if it is to permit the fishing now carried out.</blockquote><p>We must remember that the Bill is about reinstating arrangements under existing neighbourhood relations.  We can still go North and, by virtue of the Supreme Court decision, they cannot come South.  Equally, they have not changed the rules for us when we go North.  No particular restrictions have been imposed on Irish sea-fishing boats for corporate owners or in relation to residency or otherwise.  We are only looking to restore that which existed prior to October 2016.  Regardless of Brexit or anything else in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and in the context of harmonious relationships North and South, it is only right and proper that we would restore that reciprocal arrangement.  &quot;Restore&quot; means just that.  That is what the Bill is for, not any other purpose.</p><p>Deputy Clare Daly raised the point about a Northern Ireland or UK register open to boats from Scotland, Wales or England.  That is not in fact the case.  We have been informed by the Northern Ireland authorities that there is a Northern Ireland register.  When a boat is registered, the owner must indicate a port to which the boat is attached and a region within which it operates.  There is a specific Northern Ireland register, which is important in the context of capacity to enforce and so on.  A point I read out alludes to something Deputy Pringle said.  If we were to accept the amendment he proposes, it would equally adversely impact on our own boats in the context of corporate ownership, apart at all from the fact that it would be illegal to do so in the context of European law.  The judgments reflect the fact that things have moved on substantially from the 1960s and we have different shades of ownership now.  We have interests in both the register we operate and, according to the commentary I have from Members, interests in the Northern Ireland register which, if they were DNA tested, may not be of entirely Irish origin.  That is part of the European family we are in and it involves freedom of movement, freedom to deliver services and freedom of establishment.  To impose a restriction as proposed, in particular when no reciprocal restriction is placed on our boats going North, would be counterproductive.  The cross-ownership point to which Senator Mac Lochlainn referred in the Seanad regarding a boat leaving Donegal and finding that by virtue of that, it could not turn right out of Lough Foyle, brings that home.  There are numerous persons we are aware of who are resident down here and who have registered boats in Northern Ireland.  The law of unintended consequences applies, quite apart from the fact that it is illegal to accept the proposal under EU law.</p></speech>

He indicated that to be registered in Northern Ireland one must be assigned to a port there.  What does that mean for a boat from the Six Counties in terms of its access to British waters or the six mile zone there?  Obviously, the overall number of licences registered in the UK is very high compared with the number registered in the Republic, the North or both.  How easy is it for a British registered boat to simply register in a Northern Ireland port and then have access?  This would mean that there would be capacity for boats with UK licences, not just those in the Six Counties, to also have access to the six-mile zone.  Will the Minister tease that out and explain it a little further?  It is an issue that has been raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800039#PP00200"><p>The issue I wish to raise is company or corporate ownership and corporate residency.  The legislation refers to a person and persons but, as the Minister said, in many cases companies own these vessels.  My understanding is that a company must be resident somewhere and pay tax somewhere.  If it is resident somewhere, that location must be on the island of Ireland and it must pay its taxes on the island of Ireland.  That goes to the core of this matter.  One could then consider the majority ownership of a company.  If six people are the joint owners of a company and four of them live on the island of Ireland and two of them live on the Continent, what would be the position?  We must get to the nub of that because it relates to the issue we are discussing.</p></speech>

What level of detail has the Minister seen from the Northern Ireland register?  This is a fundamental point.  We do not know what we are being asked to open ourselves up to here or what might be the levels of exploitation.  Why are we rushing this legislation through when we do not even know whether there will be a reciprocal arrangement from Britain?  This is bizarre when our relationship with Britain is up in the air.  The Minister must respond with these details.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800039#PP00600"><p>I asked the Minister earlier if Dundalk Bay can sustain more boats.  He indicated that is to do with management and has nothing to do with this legislation.  However, would the Minister not put management in place before the Bill?  There is no point in it if the six-mile zone is not capable of facilitating the boats.  Was nothing done to check this out?  Is the Minister stating that no management is in place to look after who is coming in and so forth?  That makes no sense.  It is like putting the horse before the cart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.468" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800039#PP00700"><p>I am surprised that Deputy Fitzpatrick accuses me of not engaging or consulting.  I have met more delegations of fishermen for the Deputy than for most others during my three years in office.  I should also point out that it is more difficult to have engagement when a group of fishermen puts a solicitor on notice when we are trying to engage with the Regional Inshore Fisheries Forum, RIFF, in that region.  This Bill is about access, not management.  We made efforts to manage and to engage, but it is not made easier when those who wish to conserve do not engage and appoint a solicitor to do so on their behalf.  Engagement is a complex arrangement that takes multiple factors into account and it is not made easier by having solicitors on notice and seeking to have what we have always considered in this State to be a public asset made private.</p><p>Deputy Clare Daly stated that we do not know what reciprocal arrangement we will have with the UK.  If I am not mistaken, the Deputy is conflating two issues.  We have reciprocal access to the UK's zero to six-mile zone at present.  I believe she is referring to Brexit and what access we will have outside the inshore sector.  When we are seeking to get continued access in the Brexit negotiations, it does not help our case if we put up barriers to our inshore sector and state that there can be no boats from Northern Ireland.  We have reciprocal access at present in the context of <i>voisinage</i>, which only deals with the zero to six mile zone.  The broader and bigger picture for the fishing industry is undoubtedly the economic impact of future access in the context of Brexit - what access we may have to those waters in the future and what will be the consequences of that.  Certainly, there is a Brexit context to this debate and we should not put up barriers to the inshore when we are seeking to ensure our continued access to the UK's 200-mile zone.</p><p>Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy McConalogue referred to the Northern Ireland register.  We must look at what the custom and practice have been for more than the last 60 years.  Has there been a headlong rush of boats from Wales, England and Scotland to the Northern Ireland register?  There has not, and there is nothing to suggest that it would happen.  To do so the boats would have to forgo the investment they have made in the regions and industry where they are currently and the species they catch.  What would be the purpose?  There is nothing in the custom and practice of this operation for as long as it has existed, and that is since long before the London Fisheries Convention in the 1960s, to suggest that these people will suddenly drop tools in Grimsby, Yarmouth or the fishing ports of Scotland and head like an armada to our zero to six mile zone.  They did not do it previously and they have not sought to register in great numbers on the Northern Ireland register.</p><p>Regarding who can be on the Northern Ireland register, Deputy McConalogue can look at the profile of the two people who were arrested and tried.  That is what we are talking about, by and large.  It would be the overwhelming majority.  As I said earlier, let us not get bogged down in a species-specific argument.  This is about the inshore sector in all its manifestations.  The register is just a Northern Ireland register that is part of an overall UK register.  One registers one's boat where one operates it, and it is as simple as that.  It is a specific Northern Ireland register.  There is nothing to suggest that there was an influx of people onto that register over the last 60 or 70 years, and there is nothing to suggest that it will happen in the future either.</p><p>Deputy Martin Kenny is asking me to comment on areas of company law.  Obviously, companies register in a location and pay their taxes there.  The Deputy is making a species-specific inquiry.  No company can take mussel seed outside of this jurisdiction or Northern Ireland.  Regardless of what companies are involved in that industry, they must use the seed in mussel farms either in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

If this Bill is not enacted before Brexit, which was due to happen tomorrow and which accounts for the urgency relating to the legislation, what will be the consequences?  Do we lose control?</p></speech>

If the UK leaves and becomes a third country, it is quite feasible that we would lose authority to negotiate a voisinage arrangement with it because that would then be seen as a new engagement with a third country.  While the UK remains a member state, we can have a neighbourhood arrangement with it.  If it is a third country, however, the negotiation is taken out of our hands and could be a function of the European Union under the Common Fisheries Policy.  In the context of being in control of our arrangements with our neighbours, it is preferable that we do it here rather than lose control in a situation where the UK becomes a third country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800041#RR00600"><p>I move amendment No. 5:</p><blockquote>In page 3, line 17, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>The Minister spoke about my namesake from west Cork and stated that he would turn in his grave because I have been shutting doors.  I ask the Minister not to insult the name of General Michael Collins in this D&aacute;il.  The Minister shut the door for two years when he was asleep at the wheel in respect of this Bill.  The Minister had the door shut solid on this and there was no chance of discussion for me or any of my colleagues on this issue.  Do not go there.  It was the Minister who shut the doors, not me.</p><p>I am trying to protect Irish fishermen and their rights.  Maybe I am wrong in some of the issues which are concerning me but we need more time to discuss the issue and that is what I have pleading for all along.  A proper discussion is the least that should happen.  This Bill should be allowed to go through pre-legislative scrutiny where the real facts as to where we are going could be found out.</p><p>When he was asked about legalities on the Northern Irish side in the Seanad, the Minister stated that the Minister of State at the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Robert Goodwill, MP, stated that he is confident that the legal side in the UK is okay.  Confidence is not legally binding to the best of my knowledge.  Mr. Goodwill surely has the resources to give the Minister a clear answer as to whether the situation is 100% legally binding or not.  The Minister is ramming this Bill through on the basis of Mr. Goodwill saying he is confident.  Having watched politics in England over the past two years, I have very little confidence in what is going on there.  The Minister seems to have more confidence than I have.  I ask the Minister to sideline this Bill at least until the Brexit negotiations are over.  That is the most important thing because we do not know what rights we will have.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned Mr. Michael Gove in the Seanad.  In 2017, Mr. Gove brought forward a Bill in the UK that he said created powers to build a sustainable and profitable UK fishing industry with new protections for precious marine environment.  A press release at the time stated that, &quot;For the first time since 1973, the Fisheries Bill will enable the UK to control who may fish in our waters and on what terms.&quot;  I find it very clear where the UK is going although the Minister does not.  Mr. Gove stated, in 2017, that, for the first time in 50 years and due to Brexit, the UK could control its own waters.  At the time, the Minister described that statement on behalf of the UK Government as unwelcome and unhelpful.</p><p>Today, however, the Minister has informed me that I am on the wrong side of the debate.  I ask him to allow the Bill to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny and that we be given the time needed to discuss it properly.  The Bill was sitting in his Department for two years but we have only had it for a couple of weeks.</p> <p> I find it astonishing that Members have stated that the Seanad delayed the Bill - I cannot argue with them on that score - and that Senators asked the Minister to meet fishing groups before they made a decision.  He met groups in west Cork.  It is always important to acknowledge any Minister who meets any groups.  The fishing groups in question greatly appreciated meeting him.  I have heard, however, that other groups did not have the opportunity to meet him.  The meeting with the Minister was held last Thursday but I received notice of it only this morning, despite the debate on the issue being scheduled to take place in the House today.  The Minister must have pre-empted the debate, therefore, or else it must have been decided, behind the scenes and without our knowledge, that there would be an agreement today.  The Bill would not have made it through the Seanad if the fishing groups did not agree and it could not have come here for debate, yet here we are discussing it.  I stand over my concerns and the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800042#SS00200"><p>The amendments would remove the principle of access for sea-fishing boats owned and operated in Northern Ireland to fish in our zero to six-mile zone.  The amendment is utterly perplexing, particularly considering that the authorities in Northern Ireland are continuing to allow access to Irish sea-fishing boats to fish in their equivalent zone.  The Deputy spoke about Mr. Goodwill and his view of politics in the UK, but he should judge those politicians not by their words but by their deeds.  We have access to the UK's six-mile zone but it does not have access to ours.</p><p>On my consultation with the fishing industry, to which the Deputy referred, I asked my office to check how many consultations I have had since I was appointed as Minister and there appear to have been more than 40 occasions.  The matter has been discussed on a number of occasions, most recently last Thursday, as the Deputy noted.  It was conveyed to me that, overall, the industry supports the principle behind the <i>voisinage</i>arrangement and co-operation with our neighbours in Northern Ireland.  The amendment, however, does not support either the principle or the practice.  While there were concerns about the lack of a level playing field, the principle of the arrangements was acceded to.  Let us remember that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  In Justice O&rsquo;Donnell's judgment at the Supreme Court, he stated that, for reasons which it would be necessary to set out at some length, he had concluded that the current practice of fishing or harvesting of mussel seed by Northern Ireland-registered boats in the territorial waters of this State is not lawful as it constitutes the exploitation of a natural resource which must, according to Article 10 of the Constitution, be provided for by means of a law enacted by the Oireachtas.  He went on to state that he concluded there is no such law at present but that it follows from this conclusion that there is no insuperable constitutional objection to making provision by law for such fishing, which is the intention behind the Bill.</p><p>The Bill seeks to address what the Supreme Court identified is required, namely, to give the arrangements a legal footing and cement our ongoing relationship with Northern Ireland.  The <i>voisinage</i>, or neighbourhood, arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland have provided reciprocal fishing access for more than 50 years.  These arrangements have allowed boats from Northern Ireland to fish in our coastal waters.  They have also allowed, and continue to allow, Irish-registered fishing boats access to coastal waters in Northern Ireland.  While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland boats to fish under the terms of the <i>voisinage</i>arrangement, this access is subject to the same conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  The Bill specifies this conditionality of access to give further assurance to the House that there is no question of preferential treatment for Northern Ireland vessels while fishing in our six-mile zone.  While there has been much scaremongering, the access arrangements for Northern Ireland boats will not change from what they were previously.  Northern Ireland boats will simply regain the reciprocal access they have had for decades under the <i>voisinage</i>arrangement in the zero to six-nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State.  They will also continue to be subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.  I ask the House to reject the Deputies' amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800042#SS00300"><p>Inserting the word &quot;not&quot;, to the effect that fishing boats from the North may not fish, effectively guts the entire <i>voisinage</i>agreement and removes it from law.  While Deputy Michael Collins seeks to protect the inshore fishing sector and so on, it should be borne in mind that the inshore fishing sector also operates north of the Border.  The Bill seeks to accommodate fishing everywhere within the six-mile zone all around the island of Ireland and recognise the island as one unit, which is what has been done through a gentleman's agreement that we know can be open to interpretation or even a little bit of stretching, to say the least.  The agreement has nonetheless been in place and has worked for decades.  Whatever abuses may have happened relate to issues of management or mismanagement.  To table an amendment which seeks to set aside the agreement and remove it altogether is utterly inappropriate and wrong.</p><p>While I understand that the Deputy's intention in tabling the amendments is to delay the process and allow for more discussion and debate, as he has indicated, we are at the 11th hour.  Although Brexit may not happen in the next number of days or weeks - we do not know how the matter will develop - we are in an uncertain situation.  A number of months ago, we did not expect to be where are now.  We all thought there would be an agreement and that it would have been resolved.  That has not happened, however, and now we are in a situation where we are a matter of days away from a position where the State will not be able to negotiate this type of arrangement in future if we do not put in place now or very soon.  The amendments are inappropriate and I recommend that they should not be supported.</p></speech>

I am surprised that Deputy Michael Collins, a man from rebel-held west Cork, would be as partitionist as the amendments suggest.  I am also surprised there was a verbal attack from Deputy Mattie McGrath, who stormed out the door and has not even returned to contribute in respect of his amendments.  What kind of carry-on is that?  In fairness, Deputies Clare Daly and Pringle and we were present to move their amendments and argue their point of view.  It is disgraceful that some Deputies put their names to amendments but do not even have the decency or respect to turn up and argue their case.  If they were more acquainted with the situation, they might know that there are decent fishermen in this part of our island who have licences in the Six Counties, and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is very wrong that a person with a licence in the Six Counties and living in Arklow cannot fish in the South.  We are preventing that.  Restoring the <i>voisinage</i>agreement and trying to get everything right, in order that people will be comfortable with the outcome, is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

I strongly believe now is the time to set the course right, set the record straight, and commence a truly independent examination of management and finances which further State funding will be contingent upon.  That means investigating everything from top to bottom, including lease deals, associated companies, boardroom expenses, etc.  It is clear that corporate governance within the FAI is shambolic.</p>  <p>  Six weeks ago, Jonathan Hall Associates was appointed to provide a report on senior management structures and the role of chief executive officer, CEO, as the FAI plans for the launch of a new strategic report.  No terms of reference have been published to date and, indeed, the FAI has not even responded to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport's request for that report.  Incredibly, within six weeks, that report has been produced in its entirety, with no redrafting required and its contents acted upon, via a unanimous vote of the board, culminating in the announcement of a brand new position for John Delaney.  This absolutely stinks.</p>  <p>  I met an expert in sporting governance who is currently undertaking such a review within a sporting body in another jurisdiction.  That review is coming to a conclusion.  It took a year.  How could this review take only six weeks?  Why did the FAI act on it so quickly?  Why can the FAI not supply us with this report, given that is has unanimously acted on an element of it?  Does the Minister believe this is good corporate governance?  Does he believe that taxpayer's money is being deployed effectively?  Does he not believe that now is the time for an independent examination into FAI corporate governance and finances?  It is time we examined where taxpayer's money is going, as there are clear omissions in the information being given.</p>  <p>  On finance, I have spoken with current and former employees of the FAI and am disturbed by what I hear and the documents I saw.  While the committee continues working with these sources and readying itself to ask questions about what has previously happened within the FAI at its meeting on 10 April 2019, we need to act now to safeguard taxpayers' money in the future by taking this course of action.  If the FAI will not clean up its house, we should at least work to protect the taxpayer.</p><p>In the Minister's recent response to a parliamentary question I put to him, he said:</p><blockquote>There is no requirement for the organisation mentioned by the Deputy to submit its financial statements to my Department.  In line with the terms and conditions of grant funding provided to it by Sport Ireland, the organisation is required to submit a copy of its financial statements to Sport Ireland.</blockquote><p>This is a straight question.  Is it time to change that requirement?<br/><br/>We see in the public domain today, once again, that for 2019 the FAI requested an early draw down of State funding from Sport Ireland.  This is not the first time it has happened and no explanations have been forthcoming.  We also saw the revelation of an undeclared director's loan by Mark Tighe in <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  The question has to be asked as to why this was necessary.  Is it the only time it happened?  Why was it not declared?  Has the Minister spoken to Sport Ireland on these important matters?  Does he have any concerns with regard to the undeclared director's loan?  Does he not agree that further taxpayer funding should be contingent on an independent examiner and an independent examination?<br/><br/>The original issue which thrust this story into the public domain was one of borrowed money, but it is quite clear that the board of the FAI is now only existing on borrowed time.  These are important questions, they deserve an answer and they deserve a public answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800045#VV00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter.  As he knows, Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport in Ireland.  This includes responsibility for the allocation of funding across its various programmes and governance oversight of the national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport.  All sporting bodies funded by Sport Ireland are required to comply with standards of good governance, including financial oversight and Sport Ireland periodically reviews governance and oversight in the bodies it supports.</p>  <p>  The recent media reports to which the Deputy referred, regarding a loan provided to the FAI by its CEO, have raised serious questions about governance and financial controls in the FAI.  Sport Ireland is currently engaged with the association to clarify these matters and when the necessary clarifications have been received from the FAI, Sport Ireland will submit a report to me.  In the interests of due process and natural justice, it is important that Sport Ireland's engagement with the FAI would be given the necessary time to ensure that all matters are considered thoroughly.  Therefore, I do not wish to make any comment on any possible outcome from this ongoing process.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland provides funding to the FAI primarily through the field sports grant.  This funding is directed towards participation and games development programmes and is broadly aimed at encouraging and creating more opportunities for young people to participate in soccer.  In 2018, &euro;2.56 million was provided for this purpose.  In 2018, the FAI also received funding of &euro;142,500 through the women in sport programme; &euro;195,000 in support of the women's national team; &euro;22,500 to support the running of Cerebral Palsy Ireland football; and &euro;20,000 in dormant accounts funding.  In total, Sport Ireland provided over &euro;2.9 million in current funding to the FAI in 2018.  The total funding provided in 2017 was over &euro;2.7 million.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has robust arrangements in place in relation to the funding it provides to sporting bodies, including the FAI.  As part of Sport Ireland's normal processes and procedures relating to the annual grant cycle, NGBs in receipt of grant funding are required to submit to Sport Ireland a copy of their financial statements.  This must include a statement from their auditor that each grant was expended in accordance with the approved submission for the grant funding.  Given the amount of funding involved, the FAI, along with the GAA and the IRFU, are generally audited by Sport Ireland's internal auditors every three years.  The most recent audit of the FAI was completed in 2016 and a further audit is due to take place later this year.</p>  <p>  On my Department's sports capital programme, SCP, the FAI has benefitted from some limited funding over the years with a total of &euro;190,000 allocated directly to the organisation since 2015.  A separate grant of &euro;160,000 was allocated in 2015 to AUL-FAI Ltd for the development of a natural playing surface at the Athletic Union League, AUL, complex in Clonshaugh.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing controls in place for all grant payments under the SCP are robust.  As we have seen in the past, failures of governance within sporting bodies unfortunately damage the reputation of Irish sport as a whole.  This is why it is so important that we ensure strong governance across all associations.  Sport Ireland has made it clear that all sporting bodies must take the necessary steps to comply with the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.  I know many sporting bodies are making good progress towards achieving this and I encourage them to continue their efforts.</p></speech>

There was no deviation from the scripted answer and there were no answers to the questions I posed so I may as well ask them again.</p>  <p>  We saw the revelation of an undeclared director's loan.  The question has to be asked: why was this necessary?  Is it the only time it happened?  Why was it not declared?  Has the Minister spoken to Sport Ireland on these important matters?  Does he have any concerns with regard to the undeclared director's loan?  Does he not agree that further taxpayer funding, in his opinion as Minister, should be contingent on an independent examiner going forward?  That is not a matter for Sport Ireland.  That is not a matter to hide behind.  That is a policy decision.  The Minister sets that.  That is a question for the Minister to answer.  How could this review only take six weeks?  Why did the FAI act so quickly?  Does the Minister believe that this is good corporate governance?  That is also an opinion and a point for the Minister to make.  Does the Minister believe that taxpayers' money is being deployed effectively, based on what he has seen?  Does the Minister not believe that now is the time for an independent examination into FAI corporate governance and finances?</p>  <p>  It is time we looked at where taxpayers' money is going as there are clear omissions in the information being given from the FAI to Sport Ireland and to the committee on which I sit.</p></speech>

I will not say anything which would in any way prejudice the clarifications which are being sought by Sport Ireland for me and for me to reveal to the Deputy when they are published.  It is very important that a body such as Sport Ireland is left to do this work, to do this properly and to do it thoroughly.  Everybody must be properly heard and when we get the results, they will be published by me without fear or favour to anybody and they will be open to the Deputy and to the committee to examine, but it would be utterly wrong for me to answer the questions which the Deputy is asking here because they are being asked, on the Deputy's behalf as well, by Sport Ireland at this very moment and it will report at a very early stage.  At that stage, I will make those results open to everybody to discuss and I will be quite happy to comment on them myself.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware that University Hospital Kerry is a level 3 24-7 hospital with an emergency unit.  As of early last year, it has been operating without the services of a full time cardiologist.  This situation was brought about by the resignation of the previous cardiologist.  At the time, there was great concern and I had a Topical Issue matter on it at the time.  I was assured in response to my questions in June 2018, that in conjunction with Cork University Hospital, the South/South West hospital group was to appoint two additional cardiologists, split between the two hospitals, and the ratio was to be 75:25, which would effectively result in one and a half cardiologists for University Hospital Kerry, which would allow it to function as the level 3 hospital that it is.  We are now into April 2019 and as of yet, we do not have those two positions.</p><p>Concern is growing about funding being diverted to the national children's hospital and spending being withheld until we see the downsides of Brexit.  Conspiracy theories are emerging because the action that was promised almost a year ago has still not been delivered.  Coupled with that, the coronary care unit in the hospital, which is a nine-bed room, is stretched to the limit.  There are no facilities for proper consultation among staff or for carers and family members of patients.  That sends out a message that there is no genuine desire to provide the type of cardiology services that are needed for a category 3, 24-7 hospital.  </p> <p> Can the Minister of State confirm that funding for the provision of two cardiologists shared on a 75:25 basis with Cork University Hospital is ring-fenced and that those cardiologists will be in place in a very short time, allowing the hospital to then plan for its future as a category 3 facility?  Without such assurances, I will be extremely concerned about the hospital's ability to function as it needs to.  I remind the Minister of State that such was the concern among the hospital's consultants last year when this issue arose, among many other issues, that every single one of them took the unprecedented step of writing to the South/South West hospital group requesting immediate action on the shortfalls in key positions, including cardiology, respiratory consultancy and emergency room consultancy.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response and hope it gives me the reassurance that I and the hospital need.</p></speech>

The cardiology department in University Hospital Kerry, UHK, performs a variety of testing on the heart such as electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, stress testing, Holter and blood pressure monitoring and pacemaker checks.  It is important to note that, consistent with the recommendations in the national acute medicine clinical programme for model 3 hospitals such as University Hospital Kerry, patients with acute coronary syndrome are transferred to the primary coronary intervention centre in University Hospital Limerick.  Cork University Hospital, CUH, is the tertiary referral centre for more complex cardiology patients.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Deputy's specific query regarding the status of additional cardiologist positions for UHK, in June 2018, the South/South West hospital group advised that it was developing a business case for the appointment of two consultant cardiologist positions split between UHK and CUH.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that both posts are now awaiting approval by the HSE's consultant appointment advisory committee and, once approved, the advertisement of these posts can commence immediately. </p>  <p>  With regard to the wider issue of consultant appointments in general, the Government remains committed to increasing the consultant workforce to support service delivery and to move to a consultant delivered service.  While there are approximately 450 consultant posts that are not filled on a permanent basis and are filled by locums or temporary staff to support the delivery of essential services, the number of consultants has increased by 125 in the 12 months to the end December 2018 and by 540 in the past five years.  At the end of December 2018, there were 3,096 whole-time equivalent consultants working in the public health services, the highest number in the history of the State. </p>  <p>  The HSE is also committed to supporting consultant recruitment and retention, pursuing a number of initiatives, including improvements to the recruitment process, offering contracts to the hospital group rather than individual sites and focusing on family friendly arrangements.  It has established a tripartite working group, including the Medical Council, the forum of postgraduate medical training bodies and the national doctors training and planning unit of the HSE to examine posts where the consultants are not on the specialist register as well as recruitment and retention challenges.</p></speech>

I am knocked for six by the line that the advertisement of these posts can commence immediately.  That is beyond belief.  On 28 June last year, in response to a parliamentary question on the very same issue, I was told the replacement process commenced as soon as the official resignation was received from the previous cardiologist.  The response further stated that UHK was working with the South/South West hospital regional cardiology group to appoint two additional consultant cardiologists split between UHK and CUH.  Here we are ten months later, and I am told that the posts have not even been advertised yet.  It is farcical.  I do not know if the HSE gives us these replies and thinks we will forget about them and not refer back to previous answers when it comes up with this drivel.  It is unacceptable to have told me almost a year ago that two consultants were to be appointed when here we are today and the posts have not been advertised yet.</p>  <p>  I was about to speak about the fact that there is a 25% pay deficit between pre-2012 and current consultant contracts.  If the HSE is looking for 450 posts, how in the name of God is it going to fill them when there is a 25% pay gap between two people who are doing the same job?  I will not go into that now.  The response leaves me beyond words but I will take this issue much further.  The lack of respect and action is totally unacceptable.  This is a 24-7 hospital operating without a cardiologist.  What world are we living in?</p></speech>

I have listened to the Deputy and know he is not happy with the response I have been given.  The reply states that once the HSE consultant appointment advisory committee approves the advertisement of the posts, the process can immediately commence.  I do not see what is wrong with that.  I do not know the reason it has taken as long as it has to come to a point where the consultant advisory committee is still in consultation over the consultant posts.  I do not know the history of that but I will certainly pursue it with the Minister and ask him to respond to the Deputy.  I know the Deputy is not happy with the response but unfortunately I cannot ease his frustration with the reply he has received.</p></speech>

The number of children and adolescents awaiting first-time assessment for occupational therapy nationally as of January 2019 was 16,868, a fairly depressing figure.  However, the response to a parliamentary question I tabled last week reveals serious inconsistencies in the number of children and adolescents on waiting lists in different counties and local health areas.</p>  <p>  The delivery of occupational therapy across the country is deeply unequal.  For example, 1,353 children and adolescents were on the waiting list in Wexford according to the January statistics.  A total of 666 of these children and adolescents had waited for more than a year for an initial assessment.  By contrast, County Clare had only 41 children and adolescents on the list, 39 of whom had been waiting for less than 12 weeks while the remaining two children had been waiting for between 12 and 26 weeks.  The number on the waiting list in Limerick as of January was 95, with only five children in Limerick waiting for more than 26 weeks.  While these wait times are not ideal, most people would agree that the occupational therapy departments and staff in these local health areas are performing well based on these figures.</p>  <p>  However, the national average number of children and adolescents on waiting lists for paediatric occupational therapy in January was 411.  The number of children and adolescents waiting for an assessment in Wexford was more than three times the national average.  The number of children and adolescents on the waiting list in Wexford was 33 times higher than the number on the waiting list in Clare.  Wexford had the second highest number of children on the waiting list according to the data I received.  Only Laois-Offaly had a higher figure.  The numbers on the waiting lists in Wexford, north of the Lee in Cork and Laois-Offaly are total outliers and those lists need to be tackled as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  In its response to me last week, the HSE advised that it could not provide a further breakdown for the number of children and adolescents waiting for more than 52 weeks.  However, a letter from the HSE to the parent of a child awaiting assessment in Wexford shows that the Wexford local health office is currently dealing with occupational therapy referrals from June 2016, with a waiting list of two years and nine months.  The letter goes on to state that resources are limited in Wexford with a 40% reduction in staffing in the past year and that, according to a children mapping process, Wexford requires 35 posts to deal with the demand for this service.  The letter is dated 14 March 2019 and notes that as of that date 1,429 children and young people were on the occupational therapy waiting list in Wexford.  This represents an increase of more than 5% on the figure I received for January.  Things are getting worse and not better.  The tone of the letter is remarkable.  It was sent by the occupational therapy manager in Wexford and, based on the letter, she is clearly exasperated and worn out by the lack of resources available to her and her staff.</p>  <p>  I am still awaiting an answer from the HSE in response to another parliamentary question on the number and locations of paediatric occupational therapist vacancies nationally.  A parent in Wexford has told me that Wexford has three occupational therapy vacancies at the moment.  What steps will the Minister take to recruit occupational therapists in Wexford?  How many occupational therapists currently work in Wexford?  How many occupational therapists is the HSE trying to recruit for Wexford?  When does the HSE hope to appoint these occupational therapists?  Does the Minister believe that occupational therapy services for children and adolescents are adequately funded?</p></speech>

The Government and the HSE are committed to improving access to these important services.  The Minister has been advised by the HSE that in recent years the demand for paediatric occupational therapy services in Wexford has significantly increased.  Along with the increased number of referrals, management in the HSE is reporting that more complex demands are being made on this service.</p>  <p>  With regard to the numbers waiting to access paediatric occupational therapy services in Wexford, the HSE has advised that all applications for these services are prioritised upon receipt on the basis of clinical need.  High-priority referrals are managed by the HSE in accordance with standard operating protocols with children of the highest clinical need being seen first.</p>  <p>  A number of initiatives have been implemented by south east community healthcare, CHO 5, to improve access times to services in Wexford.  These include an expanded occupational therapy service to provide assessment and two treatment sessions for school-age children.  This is an expansion of the existing service.  Additional clinics are also being provided.  Under a new initiative, the Central Remedial Clinic is providing an outreach clinic and increased outpatient clinics are being offered to address the needs of the longest waiting.</p>  <p>  CHO 5 is also increasing the number of group programmes on offer in the school-age service.  A total of 110 children are currently being assessed and provided with group intervention in the first quarter of this year with the aim of providing intervention prior to entering the school-age service.</p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times nationally and improve access to services, the Government has committed to increasing the number of occupational therapists in primary care.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2019 contains the commitment to recruit 170 community and nursing therapy posts, including 40 additional occupational therapist posts.  These additional occupational therapist posts will focus on addressing patients waiting over 52 weeks.  The HSE anticipates that over 350,000 primary care occupational therapy patients will be treated in 2019.</p>  <p>  The development of primary care is central to the Government&rsquo;s objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective healthcare system.  A Programme for a Partnership Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also established service improvement groups to develop new standardised models of service provision to support the delivery of occupational therapy and other therapy services.  The national service plan for 2019 commits to the implementation of the recommendations from these reviews on a phased basis within existing resources, which will help to address difficulties and pressure areas in therapy services.</p></speech>

She is telling me that the HSE intends to recruit 40 occupational therapists nationally when 35 occupational therapist posts are needed to meet the demand in Wexford according to the occupational therapy manager in the county.  This is off the Richter scale.  What kind of impact will 40 make on the problem nationally if 35 are needed in Wexford?  It will not scratch the surface of the problem.  I do not understand that.</p>  <p>  The waiting times are shameful and make a mockery of the idea of early intervention.  The disparity between the different CHO areas beggars belief.  These children are waiting for an initial assessment only.  They would then have to wait again for a further appointment.  The number of children awaiting an assessment in Wexford is more than three times the national average.  I would like an explanation for that.  Somebody - I do not know who - is responsible for that.  The Government has a responsibility to hold somebody to account for that.  There has to be an explanation.  The Minister of State probably does not have it front of her, but the Government should supply it.  People in Wexford and the parents of the children who are waiting for their initial appointment deserve an explanation.</p>  <p>  We know that Wexford is the third most deprived county in the country and in some areas it is the worst.  It is unbelievable.  The HSE letter to the parent of a child awaiting assessment in Wexford has shown that occupational therapy in the Wexford local health office is currently dealing with referrals from June 2016.  This is March 2019.</p><p>Can we get some answers and accountability?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I do not have the statistics in front of me to which he referred.  All I can tell him is that the Government has acknowledged the challenge that exists in providing paediatric occupational therapy services in Wexford.  There is a campaign to recruit people throughout the country and it is more difficult to recruit in some areas than in others.  I am not here to give the Deputy an answer as to why more children would be waiting longer for an assessment in one area compared with another area.  I do not know the reason for that and I cannot understand it, to be honest.</p>  <p>  However, the challenges that face us all are to make sure that intervention is provided for children who need it.  As I stated in my reply, provision has been made for the inclusion of expanded services for school-age children and for additional clinics delivered by the Central Remedial Clinic to address the needs of those who are waiting the longest.  It is significant that there is such intervention in schools and that is becoming more prevalent with speech and language therapy and occupational therapy services.</p>  <p>  I am here to read a statement but also to note the concerns raised by the Deputy and to acknowledge that in his role of representing Wexford, there are needs in this area that must be addressed.  Unfortunately, I cannot address them at the level that he requires.  However, I will, as usual, relay the information to the Minister and ask him to come back to the Deputy personally on some of the statistics, when people will be seen, and when the staff who are required will be recruited into the services in Wexford.  Unfortunately, I do not have any other answer for the Deputy.  I could read a prepared response in conclusion but it would just outline what I stated in my initial reply.</p></speech>

I will paint a picture of the situation for the Minister of State.  If an adult or a child in Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal or west Cavan is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, he or she is sent for an appointment and an assessment to a unit located in a two-room portakabin in a yard at the back of Sligo University Hospital.  They walk through what is literally a building site as a new mental health services unit is being built in the area.  The people who work in that small portakabin have to keep the windows closed because of the dust.  The Minister of State can see the picture.  A family arrives at that portakabin with a child who has been diagnosed with diabetes, and two other people may be waiting to be seen in that small room half the size of the area of the floor of this House.  They get an assessment done on the level of insulin or whatever the child needs, they make further appointments, and each time they come back to that unit.  The staff in the second room in the portakabin have their computers and their phones there.  They monitor people with type 1 diabetes from across the entire north west in respect of whom they receive reports.  It is a cramped and unsuitable unit.  The HSE has an application in for funding the building of a new unit for the past four to five years but nothing has happened.</p>  <p>  There is also the serious matter of people who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes who need an insulin pump, which is a marvellous advance in treatment.  I spoke to a man a number of months ago who was waiting to be fitted with an insulin pump.  He knew it had been ordered.  In fact, it had been purchased and was sitting on a shelf in that unit but he could not get it fitted because he needed to be trained on how to use it.  The specialist nurse who provides the training had been seconded to another part of the hospital and was not available to give him the training.  An 18 year old woman who is in college contacted me in recent weeks who is in the same situation.  She wants to be fitted with an insulin pump and has been told there is nobody available to train her on how to use what is a simple enough piece of equipment.</p>  <p>  There are two issues involved.  One is the facility, the cramped and unsuitable unit, and the staffing of it.  Quite apart from the unavailability of a specialist nurse to provide training on the use of an insulin pump, the staff who work in this small portakabin are totally stressed out, are under pressure and cannot deal with the demand for this service that they are trying to provide and are providing, in fairness, under very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to provide an assurance that any person in the north west who needs to be fitted with an insulin pump and wants to have that done will be able to get it done with all the haste that is required and that the training they need will be available as soon as they apply for it and need it.  Will the Minister of State advise also regarding progress on the building of a new diabetes unit at Sligo University Hospital?</p></speech>

As he will be aware, diabetes is one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st century.  Just like the rest of the world, Ireland is experiencing sustained increases in the number of people with diabetes.  Currently, there are more than 200,000 people with diabetes in Ireland.  People with type 1 diabetes make up 10% of all people with diabetes.  If not well managed, diabetes can lead to debilitating complications, including visual impairment and blindness, lower limb amputations, kidney failure and heart disease.  As a result, the increasing prevalence of diabetes poses a major challenge to our health service, with increasing costs driven primarily by hospitalisation and treating associated complications.  This is also evident in the increase in demand for diabetic care in our acute hospitals and our community healthcare organisations, including in the Deputy's area.</p>  <p>  The diabetes service team at Sligo University Hospital is led by consultant endocrinologists and serves the populations of Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal, north Roscommon and west Cavan.  This adult diabetes service also includes an insulin pump service.  Referrals are also received from Letterkenny University Hospital in this regard.  In addition, there is a pregnancy diabetes service, inpatient ward-based consultation service, and an inpatient and outpatient podiatry service.  There is a well-established integrated multidisciplinary team approach between both the hospital and the community, supported by specialist diabetic nurses and an advanced nurse practitioner as well as a full range of support staff.  In addition to this, there is a paediatric diabetes specialist service that provides a regional insulin pump service for children across the north west.  Both the adult and paediatric pump services have experienced considerable growth in referrals both from new patients commencing treatment as well as repatriation of patients from national tertiary centres.  In addition, a full endocrinology service is provided, which includes dynamic endocrine function testing.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that tender documents for the diabetic day unit at Sligo University Hospital have been finalised and are ready to issue to contractors.  It is intended to proceed to construction in 2019, with the unit expected to be operational in 2020.  The funding of all projects is subject to the availability of capital funding and the progress of other priorities.  The Government is committed to the further development of services for people with diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 was published which will be a fundamental enabler in the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  As part of this action plan, a series of service design and delivery workshops will be held.  These workshops will he focused on chronic disease management, including the management of diabetes.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the inclusion in it to the effect that "tender documents for the diabetic day unit at Sligo University Hospital have been finalised and are ready to issue to contractors" and that it is due "to proceed to construction in 2019".  While that is very welcome news, the next sentence states: "The funding all projects is subject to the availability of capital funding and the progress of other priorities."  There is always a little fear in that respect, particularly in the context of what has happened with the national children's hospital, but I will not go down that road.  The building of this unit would involve a fairly low cost for the major benefit it can create for people with diabetes.  I welcome that it will proceed with all due haste and as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  The other issue I raised is that people are unable to be fitted with an insulin pump because of the absence of specialist nurse to train them on how to use it as that nurse has been seconded to another part of the hospital.</p><p>That is a serious problem.  One lady I spoke to told me of a situation where she was there along with her child, and another child in the hospital had been diagnosed with diabetes and arrived over in their pyjamas to this unit for an assessment, having walked across what was practically a building site.  There are no toilet facilities in the place.  At the end of the assessment, another man came in to inquire what was happening as he had been waiting for the insulin pump for several months and had not got it.  This is a real issue that needs to be dealt with.  While I welcome the proposal that there will be capital funds in place to build this, it needs to happen as quickly as possible.</p> <p> There is also the issue of ensuring adequate staffing.  The Minister of State mentioned that the multidisciplinary team is in place but to my knowledge it is not complete and there are holes in that service that need to be filled.  That should be done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I recognise the reply states there is an intention to proceed with construction in 2019 and it is expected to be operational in 2020, and the reply also states this will be subject to availability of capital funding.  All other projects throughout the country are in the same position.  It is down to funding, and let us be honest about it.</p>  <p>  I am not sure about the status of the multidisciplinary team, which the Deputy said is not complete.  I will have to go back to the Minister on that.  With regard to training for the pumps, how difficult can it be to train somebody to use a diabetic pump?  I know somebody who uses one daily.  I am committed to going back to the Minister to ask that a comprehensive answer be given to the Deputy and that the Minister would contact the hospital to find out why training is not happening when the pumps are already there and waiting to be used.  We all know a diabetic pump can mean so much to people's everyday lives.  I know someone who uses one daily.</p>  <p>  I am sorry I do not have more information for the Deputy.  As always, I will refer back to the Minister, Deputy Harris.  I will do my best to hammer home the concerns that have been raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800049#ZZ00600"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>In 2011, when Fine Gael took office, there were 641 children in emergency accommodation according to the Central Statistics Office.  Yesterday&rsquo;s homeless figures stated there were 3,784 children officially homeless in February, an increase of 490%.  Let that sink in for a minute.  Under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his colleagues, thousands of children have lost years of their young lives to homelessness.  In total, there are 10,264 people officially homeless and 1,707 families sleeping in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, and family hubs.  However, these are just the official figures.  They do not include the 1,600 adults and children wrongly removed, in my view, from the homeless figures last year, nor do they include rough sleepers, women and children in domestic violence shelters, those in hostels not funded by the Government, nor those granted asylum but unable to access private rented accommodation because of the housing crisis and using direct provision as emergency accommodation.  In fact, the Government cannot even tell us the full extent of the homeless crisis because it refuses to count all those without a home.</p><p>Yesterday&rsquo;s figures must mark a line in the sand.  The symbolically significant number of 10,000 has been breached.  This must force the Government to stop and ask what is going wrong.  More importantly, surely Government must now be asking what it can do differently in the weeks and months ahead to stop the flow of adults and children into homelessness.</p><p>How did we get here?  What caused child homelessness to increase by a staggering 490% in eight years?  How is it possible, in a growing economy, with more people in work than ever before, that we have such a deep housing and homelessness crisis?  In part, the blame lies with Fianna F&aacute;il.  Decades of underinvestment in social and affordable housing, coupled with an over-reliance on the private sector to meet housing need, created a fragile housing system.  Economic mismanagement led to recession, which in turn led to a housing crisis.  However, Fine Gael can not lay all the blame at Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin&rsquo;s door.  From 2011 to 2013, Fine Gael slashed capital spending in social housing to its lowest level in decades.  In 2014, when private sector rents started to spiral out of control, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, blocked meaningful rent regulations.  Tens of families started to present as homeless every single week.  By 2016, tens had become hundreds, with family homelessness reaching unprecedented levels.  In response, the then Minister and now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, introduced the rent pressure zones.  At the time, in this Chamber, we warned him they would not work, that they would be impossible to police and that it would lead to a two-tier rental market, but he dismissed our concerns and carried on regardless.  Two years on, and it gives me no pleasure to say this, those of us who raised these concerns have been proven right.  In 2018, as the Minister knows, rents increased by 7% across the State and by 8% in Dublin, which is twice the rent pressure zone cap.  Yet, as late as this morning, the Government claims that its policy is working.</p><p>Today, the single biggest cause of family homelessness is landlords legally evicting their tenants when selling their properties.  As house prices have started to rise, landlords, many of whom had been in mortgage distress, are now exiting the market.  Indeed, since 2017, more than 9,000 rental properties have been lost.  What has Fine Gael done to prevent the loss of these properties?  What has the Minister done to stem the flow of family homelessness?  In my view, the answer is quite simply nothing.  Just as those in Fine Gael sat on their hands when the rental crisis started to spiral in 2014, today they continue to sit on their hands as more and more people lose the roof over their heads.  There is nothing in Rebuilding Ireland to address this specific problem.  In the weeks and months ahead, unless something changes, hundreds more families will be issued with vacant possession notices to quit and will be evicted as banks and funds force accidental landlords to sell their properties.</p><p>The Bill before us is very simple.  It was drafted by Focus Ireland in 2016 and was debated and voted on before in the House.  Put simply, it would prevent buy-to-let landlords who had availed of tax breaks when purchasing their property from evicting tenants into homelessness when selling up.  This would ensure that many of these properties would in turn be purchased by other landlords, keeping the families <i>in situ</i>and preventing them from becoming homeless.  When we proposed it back in 2016, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail contrived to block it.  In doing so, in my view, they condemned hundreds of families to homelessness.  I have no doubt that if we had passed this into law two years ago, many families who subsequently became homeless would have avoided that terrible tragedy.</p><p>While the T&aacute;naiste made it clear this morning that Fine Gael has no intention of supporting the Bill, I would appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to do the right thing.  As always, I am open to constructive amendment on Committee Stage.  Therefore, what I would say to Deputy Casey and his colleagues is that if they support the intention of the Bill, they should not stand in its way and they should work with us to improve it if necessary as it progresses through the House.</p><p>As I said, the T&aacute;naiste made it clear this morning that the Minister, Deputy Murphy, would not be supporting the Bill.  He said it would not work, would drive landlords out of the market, would discourage new investment and would fall foul of the Constitution.  Let me respond to each claim in turn.  In the commercial rental sector, sale of property with tenants <i>in situ</i>is standard and, in fact, is a condition of almost all commercial rental contracts.  If it works there, why can it not work in the private rental sector?  We are already losing a very significant number of rental properties from the market.  According to the latest figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, the figure is 9,000 in the past two years.</p><p>The problem is that the loss of these properties is completely disorganised and chaotic.  Insisting on keeping tenants <i>in situ</i>during a sale would assist in keeping many of these properties in the rental sector.  As for new investment, given the very high rents, which are currently above peak boom-time rates, and generous tax breaks for real estate investment funds and other investment vehicles, it is hard to see how such a simple measure would have any impact on future investment.<br/><br/>On the issue of the Bill's constitutionality, if the Minister has legal advice from the Attorney General he should publish it.  This has happened previously, although not often enough.  All those of us on the Opposition benches can do is refer to previous Supreme Court rulings on related matters.  In its ruling of August 2000 on Part V of the Planning and Development Act, the Supreme Court set out the way in which the Oireachtas could limit property rights and the judgment is worth quoting in some detail:</p><blockquote>In the present case, as a condition of obtaining a planning permission for the development of lands for residential purposes, the owner may be required to cede some part of the enhanced value of the land deriving both from its zoning for residential purposes and the grant of permission in order to meet what is considered by the Oireachtas to be a desirable social objective, namely the provision of affordable housing and housing for persons in the special categories and of integrated housing.  Applying the tests proposed by Costello J. in  Heaney v. Ireland [1994] and subsequently endorsed by this court, the court in the case of the present Bill is satisfied that the scheme passes those tests.  They are rationally connected to an objective of sufficient importance to warrant interference with a constitutionally protected right and, given the serious social problems which they are designed to meet, they undoubtedly relate to concerns which, in a free and democratic society, should be regarded as pressing and substantial.  At the same time, the court is satisfied that they impair those rights as little as possible and their effects on those rights are proportionate to the objectives sought to be attained.</blockquote><p>This Bill will not prevent landlords from selling their property; nor will it impose on them any actual financial loss.  They may, in the words of the judgment be forced to &quot;cede some part of the enhanced value&quot; of the property, but this is being done in accordance with the principles of social justice and in the name of the common good as outlined in the Constitution and to address a matter which this Oireachtas surely believes is a &quot;desirable social objective&quot; which is &quot;of sufficient importance to warrant interference with a constitutionally protected right.&quot;  What could be more pressing and substantial than preventing child homelessness?  Are the marginal gains of landlords selling their properties more important than keeping families in their homes?  Is the Government seriously suggesting that property rights should trump children&rsquo;s rights?<br/><br/>At the heart of the Bill before us tonight is a very simple choice.  Are Deputies on the side of big landlords, vulture funds and real estate investment trusts or are they on the side of the 3,784 children who will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight?  Do we believe that the right of people to safe and secure accommodation is more important than the right of landlords, who previously benefitted from tax breaks, to make an extra 10% or 20% profit on the sale of their property?<br/><br/>This morning the T&aacute;naiste claimed that the forthcoming Residential Tenancies Act will help in reducing the flow of families into homelessness but I do not believe that is true.  While the Act will strengthen tenants&rsquo; rights, which I support, it will not assist those facing legal eviction when their landlord is selling up.  They will remain without adequate protection.  If Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies refuse to support our Bill tonight, they must set out their alternative.  What are they going to do for those families with notices to quit in their hands tonight, who do not know what the future holds?  This Bill is not a silver bullet.  It is a small but important measure that, if passed into law, will make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  <br/><br/>The latest homeless figures confirm, once and for all, that Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  In my view and that of an ever growing number of people, it must be replaced.  As the Oireachtas agreed by a majority on 3 October last, we need to see a doubling of capital investment in social and affordable housing.  We need emergency measures to tackle spiralling rents and reduce homelessness.  We also need to see the right to housing enshrined in the Constitution.  The Raise The Roof campaign has scheduled a massive demonstration in Dublin on 18 May next to support these demands.  All those involved in that campaign, both inside and outside the Oireachtas, are determined, through people power, to force the Government to change its policy or, through people power, to force a change of Government.  In the mean time, while we are fighting to deal with those bigger issues, the families with notices to quit need our support tonight.  Let us stand with them and, by passing this Bill, give them the protection the desperately need and deserve.  We must ensure that in the coming months we see, for the first time in years, a reduction in the number of families entering into homelessness and not, as has been the case with this and the previous Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, a month-on-month increase.</p></speech>

The timing is helpful because of the very distressing numbers that were published this week.  We was an increase in the numbers of people, both families and individuals, entering emergency accommodation in February.  This is very distressing for the people who had to go into emergency accommodation.  It is also very distressing for those who are still in emergency accommodation and for the general public because of the strong social contract that we have in this country.  People do not want to see their fellow citizens in distress; they want to see them in homes.  That is the whole purpose of the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  The aim is to rebuild our broken housing sector and to bring security and safety to people who do not currently have it because of bad decisions that were made in the past.</p>  <p>  I take my responsibilities in this area very seriously and that is why this is so hugely disappointing for me.  What we have seen in different months over the last two years is different things happening in relation to emergency accommodation.  What we saw in December and January, for the first time in recent years, was more families exiting emergency accommodation than entering it for two months in a row.  That was very positive and I said last month that I hoped it was indicative of a trend, given all the house building that we are seeing and the extra protections that we have provided to renters.  I hoped that because those aspects of Rebuilding Ireland were starting to prove themselves, although we still have some way to go, the tide was beginning to turn in terms of the numbers in emergency accommodation.  As we know now, however, that was not the case in February and the numbers have increased.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is an intelligent and capable person, of that there is no doubt but it is beneath him to suggest, as he did yesterday on radio, that there is some conspiracy between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il against people in housing insecurity and those going into emergency accommodation.  It is also beneath him to suggest that I have massaged the figures.  When I brought the mistake by the local authorities to public attention, Deputy &Oacute; Broin accepted at the joint Oireachtas committee that it was a mistake.  I see that the Deputy is shaking his head now but I have it on record that he accepted that it was a mistake.  It is also beneath Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others to offer simple solutions that will not help the situation.  I will explain why they will not help and why they may, in fact, run the risk of making things worse for lots of people.  </p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said that we need to replace Rebuilding Ireland but I am not sure what parts of it he wants to replace.  Would he replace the help to buy scheme-----</p></speech>

Would he replace the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which has helped hundreds of people to buy their first home?  Would he replace the rent pressure zones, which have meant that for the first time in two years, we have seen rents fall?  Would he replace our social housing programme, under which one in every four newly built homes was a social housing home?  It does not matter if it is Dublin City Council or the Iveagh Trust contracting a builder.  Indeed, the latter has been providing social housing for longer than this State, let alone the city council.  We are talking about social housing homes and every single one that is brought into our social housing stock helps a family or an individual out of emergency accommodation.  Would Deputy &Oacute; Broin replace the &euro;2.4 billion that we are spending on housing this year?  This is the highest amount that the State has ever spent in a single year on housing.  Perhaps he would replace the 5,000 individuals and their children who were prevented from entering emergency accommodation last year or who exited from such accommodation.  Would he replace the 27,000 new tenancies that were supported last year through taxpayer support under Rebuilding Ireland?  Would he close all the sites that are currently open across the country, where homes are being built every day?  The Deputy spoke about replacing Rebuilding Ireland or throwing it out but with what would he replace it?</p><p>Which of those elements would Deputy &Oacute; Broin throw away?  They are working to help tens of thousands of people.  We know that the root cause of our crisis at the moment is supply, but it is increasing.  Nothing the Deputy has said, however, would increase supply any quicker.  Doubling the money will not increase the time it takes to get planning, to get procurement and to build a home.  It would not do that and it is wrong to suggest that it would.</p> <p> The Deputy is right to say that as we build these new homes - the Government has said this before - we have to ensure we are protecting people while the supply of new homes to rent or buy increases.  It is good to put forward ideas to debate and interrogate but we must ask ourselves whether this measure that has been put before us would help.  From my view of it, the answer is "No".  I assure the Deputy that we have done a lot of work on this.  Every time a new idea is suggested we look at it thoroughly to see if there is something extra we could be doing because as a Government, of course, we want to help.  If some idea was going to help people out of emergency accommodation, then why would we not implement it?  This Bill, however, would not do that.</p> <p> We do not have large numbers of foreign investors operating in the Irish rental sector.  Even if such investors could be targeted, this Bill targets less than 5% of the market or 1% of transactions in 2017.  Regrettably, we have a report from the UN rapporteur, which I do not believe has yet been published, only in the form of a press release.  We do not know what evidence it has been based on.  Only 5% of the market is controlled or managed by foreign institutional investors.  How can it be extrapolated out to the other 95% which are not even involved in that sector?</p> <p> Some 86% of Ireland's landlords own just one or two properties.  These are not evil, corporate organisations or the demons Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes them out to be.  These are real people, some of whom are accidental landlords due to what happened in the crash.  Some of these people may have made a small investment in another property that could quite possibly still be indebted, as was pointed out, because of the negative equity people found themselves in as a result of the housing crash and the fact the housing sector had not been managed correctly before.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin's Bill is unconstitutional because it is an unjust attack on a sub-group of people for a societal problem that is far more complex than simply someone selling property.  There is a link but it is far more complex than that.  The Deputy's comparison with the commercial sector is wrong.  If a person has a lease in place, even in the residential sector, it cannot be breached with a notice to quit.  Even if the Bill was constitutional and passed that barrier, that provision would not be retrospective.  It would not help anybody renting today but it would drive landlords out.</p> <p> The Deputy has recognised that we are losing landlords from the sector.  We must all recognise that losing landlords increases the numbers of people presenting to emergency accommodation.  One of the unintended consequences, not through in the Bill, however, is that it could make housing insecurity worse for people because the landlords would see further restrictions on their own rights and further challenges to them exercising their own rights, thus driving those landlords out of the market.  Consider a situation where a landlord needed to sell a property, for example, because he or she had gotten into financial difficulties, or because family member had medical bills.  Let us say the Bill's provisions were legal and retrospective, there could be a decrease in the value of the property of between 20% and 30%.  We have evidence of this.</p> <p> What if the landlord's property is in negative equity and he or she is trying to sell the property to pay off a debt?  What then?  What if the landlord is trying to sell the property to meet the needs of a relative who is in distress?  In not being able to realise the market value of a property, which had already been massively devalued over the years, these landlords could struggle to pay their own rent or mortgages and could themselves be at risk of entering emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

One would end up hurting more people and the landlords could still sell, with tenants<i>in situ</i>.  What happens if a young couple buys the house with tenants <i>in situ</i>?  The young couple has the right under section 34 of the Act to serve a notice to quit and to move into that home.  If the tenant says &quot;No&quot; the young couple could end up paying for a very expensive mortgage and rent since they cannot move into their new home.  This couple, who may want to start their own family, would then have to go through a very lengthy procedure because we have very strong protections in place for tenants, and the couple are now landlords when they never wanted to be.  They are now trying to evict people out of a home when they never wanted to do that.  All they wanted to do was buy their first home and start a family.  These are the unintended consequences that risk doing more harm than good in proposed legislation that does not think about the wider potential impacts it could have on the sector.</p><p>It does not mean that we do not do any more or that we do not ask why something has happened in the last month, for example.  When we were discussing the rent Bill over the last year we spoke about using it to make as many improvements as we could.  I really appreciate the support of the House and of the joint Oireachtas committee on the Bill, and their working with me to get it through as quickly as possible but also making sure it has the correct scrutiny, because when it is law, it is the law.  We do not want to miss a trick on this.</p><p>We can extend the notice periods for people, as we are proposing to do, when a notice to quit is served.  This will help because we know that the longer a period people have in which to find new accommodation, the greater chance they have of finding accommodation or of being able to engage with local authority services such as the place finder service to get new accommodation.</p><p>We also know that we can better enforce section 34.  We are giving extra resources to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and we are going to build on those resources again next year as part of a change management programme, so we know we can give greater powers around enforcement to make sure landlords are not evading their responsibilities where they seek to do so.  We can also help the RTB to police the rent caps independently and to take that burden away from tenants who may find themselves in a difficult position if they want to challenge their landlord and fear it may have a negative consequence for the tenant's ability to stay in the property beyond the period that had already been agreed.</p><p>We know we can do all these things and will do them in the rent Bill.  Further amendments will come to the Cabinet on Tuesday, which will then be published and shared with the committee.  We can then debate those and how to help make the improvements.</p><p>Meanwhile, as we seek to ensure greater protections for people who are renting and in housing insecurity, we will continue to build more homes.  One out of every four homes home built last year was a social housing home.  We will continue to increase the stock of social housing by any means possible and not let ideology get in the way.  We will acquire homes, we will do turnkey homes and long-term lease homes.  We will work with our partners in the housing bodies and the NGOs, which are also housing bodies, to bring about new homes.  Please stop vilifying the housing bodies and NGOs which are providing social housing homes.  Those homes count and they count big time to those people who get the keys and move into the homes.  I know this personally because I have met those people.</p><p>We can protect more families and prevent more families from entering emergency accommodation because of the funding we have this year to work with local authorities and NGOs, and we can exit more families from homelessness as we did last year.</p><p>At all times we need to honest about the challenges we face.  Our housing sector was destroyed and is being rebuilt in a way that did not happen before, that is, so that it cannot be broken again.  We are also seeing other things happening in the economy such as increased demand due to people coming home to Ireland.  There is also increased demand because there are good jobs available and people now have money to buy a house.  Thankfully, we are also seeing a depression on rents and on house price increases because of the other measures the Government is taking.  We will continue to work through those challenges, to implement the solutions that are working and to look at new ideas to see if we can take them on board if we believe they will help.  We will, however, always be honest about our choices and will always be responsible in our choices.  We will do everything we can to help people, and especially those who are most hurt in this crisis, the families and the children in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs tonight.</p></speech>

When he thinks of a future career, perhaps it could be as a screenwriter or a novelist because he seems to be imagining a world that we simply cannot see and which absolutely does not exist: a world where the landlord class is facilitating the housing of our people.  The reality is that every weekend - I am sure it is the same for the Ceann Comhairle - Deputies meet many distressed families who have been made homeless simply by landlords who wanted to gouge the highest possible rent out of people.  That is the reality and the Minister knows it is the reality.  If he does not, then he has a wonderful imagination and could have a different career than administering a housing Department.  The rents have led to this desperate crisis.</p>  <p>  Yesterday the Minister and the Government passed a shocking milestone when the official figures for homelessness increased to more than 10,000.  Fr. Peter McVerry said the figures do not include those people who couch surf in the homes of relatives and so on, and that we could, in fact, be talking about 15,000 people being homeless.  It is a terrible legacy for the Minister as the Government approaches what could be its final months.  It is a sadly deserved legacy for the Minister after his years of inaction and the snail-like pace of delivery and misaligned priorities.</p><p>Only this morning, the Minister said we needed more landlords.  Is that to pay more rent subsidies to landlords of up to &euro;1 billion per annum and to keep tenants in insecure accommodation as the Taoiseach refers to it?  When he talks about social housing, he is talking about what Fingal County Council describes as "housing solutions".  Housing solutions are usually not forever homes.  They do not provide stability and comfort to families.  While it will not, of course, happen as long as Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are running the country together, we need large-scale building of mixed tenure local authority housing to provide homes for the majority of people in Ireland.  By the way, we had that system in the past.  It is astonishing to think that 10 or 15 years ago there were way fewer landlords and shorter housing lists.  There were far fewer people in homeless accommodation or on the streets.</p> <p> The fantastic world the Minister described to us simply does not exist.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said this morning, it is a shameful situation.  I was also struck by the Minister's comment that there will always be homeless people.  He said there would always be people unable to find shelter on a given night.  That is a shocking admission by a Minister.</p></speech>

That is the Minister's job but it is one he has not been doing.  Clearly, there will always be homeless citizens and families while Fine Gael remains in power.  We are now entering the ninth year of this miserable austerity Government.  The fundamental reason is the Government's active encouragement and protection of a ruthless landlord class.  From recent freedom of information responses and other information which has come to hand, we know of the relentless meetings between the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who was chief operations officer of the austerity programme, and foreign so-called property investors, namely the vulture funds.</p><p>I commend Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Sinn F&eacute;in warmly tonight.  The Deputy is trying to at long last move the scales back towards a much fairer housing market.  The Bill is intended to complement a suite of other measures to prevent family homelessness.  It is also an amending Bill for which that excellent front-line organisation, Focus Ireland, has called for a number of years and a restatement, of course, of Sinn F&eacute;in's 2016 Bill, which the coalition partners, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, defeated.  Though short, the Bill is important.  It seeks to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to prevent tenants in buy-to-let properties being evicted when a property is being sold.  It seeks to insert a new section 34A to restrict the termination of tenancies in buy-to-let dwellings.  It applies specifically to investment mortgages.  The definition of &quot;investment mortgage&quot; is designed to ensure accidental landlords are not included in the restriction which will apply only when a mortgage is taken out on a residential property which was not intended to serve as the person's principal private residence.</p><p>I agree completely with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that while the Bill may be short, it includes an important measure to move back to a housing market that serves young people, families and citizens who are desperately seeking housing.  Threshold, Focus Ireland and other front-line organisations have provided definitive evidence to show that a majority of those entering family homelessness come from the private rental sector on foot of notices to quit to provide vacant possession.  That has been my experience and I am sure it has been the experience of the Ceann Comhairle.  So many of the families and individuals I have represented over the past number of years have had that experience.  They then go on to be left for two and a half or even three years in hotel rooms, bed and breakfast accommodation or guest houses.</p><p>On 14 February 2019, I brought forward a motion on homelessness, which was co-signed by my colleagues in the Independents 4 Change technical group.  We tried to urge the Minister to declare a housing emergency and embark on a widespread, State-led housing programme to increase supply dramatically.  Based on his own figures, we know the Minister will not achieve the Rebuilding Ireland targets and will be long gone from government when we are still striving to meet them.  We also sought a commitment to rehouse families who had been in emergency housing accommodation, including hubs, for 18 months and more.  I note from replies to questions my colleague, Councillor John Lyons, put to Dublin City Council that families have remained in hubs since the day they were established.  In fact, while the voluntary housing bodies gave a commitment that families would only be in hubs for three or four months, some have now been there for 12 and 15 months.  In the earlier emergency accommodation, we found people going way over two and a half years.  The Minister is right about one thing.  It is very distressing, in particular for the families and children in this situation tonight as we reach this deplorable milestone.</p><p>The Simon Communities have been producing the locked-out-of-the-market report regularly to update us on how few properties are available at certain points in time to those in receipt of housing assistance such as HAP or rent supplement.  The Government may have spent &euro;700 million - it is heading for &euro;1 billion on HAP - but when we meet people week in and week out who are homeless or going to one house and another to stay with relatives or friends, they just cannot access HAP.  Certainly, we still have that situation in the Dublin region.  The Minister mentioned property companies and foreign companies but Deputy Boyd Barrett also referred this morning to the Irish Residential Properties REIT.  It has a massive property portfolio, which is bigger than most housing bodies and county councils as it approaches 3,000 units.  It awarded its chief executive a basic remuneration package of &euro;680,000 with a further &euro;2 million in future shares.  We have had a relentless programme.  Yesterday, the <i>Financial Times</i>reported on what it called the impending buy-to-let boom which it said was a model to transform rental housing into an investable asset class.  This form of investment is spreading across Europe as the rental yield in many countries is significantly higher than the bond market can, for the most part, offer.  Of course, our own country is often highlighted as a particularly attractive proposition for the companies that want to enter that area.</p><p>We need increased supply of good-quality rental accommodation, but it should be linked to affordable and stable rents.  On this side of the House, we have come forward again and again with proposals to freeze rents for two or three years to give us a chance to get some programme, even Rebuilding Ireland, up and running properly.  The Bill before us is a modest attempt to begin to deal with one of the most awful aspects of Irish rental law.  The Minister's defence of the existing situation is based on an untenable fantasy.  It is clear from reporting on other EU member states that we could have a different system and a much fairer rental market.  However, we will never have that while Fine Gael is in power.  The background to this is that many of the ruthless landlords who are continually pushing rents up received all of the tax breaks before the 2014 period.  In its latest budget, the Government gave them a 100% tax break.  The ideological party in this is Fine Gael and the situation will remain hopeless while it is in power.</p></speech>

He said the same thing again here tonight.  He said the value of the property of that owner would fall by 20% to 30%.  I want to examine that claim with him.  Does he have proof that would happen, given the dearth of available housing?  Given the shortage of housing, would selling a house with a tenant in place lead to a 20% to 30% drop in value?  There is an onus on the Minister to show us the economic evidence behind that.  In any event, would it not be a good thing?  We want to bring the price of housing down but it is rising relentlessly.  This is adding to the maintenance of very high prices because it turns housing into a commodity and sustains the entire buy-to-let market.</p><p>The Minister also stated that the Government cannot reduce people's incomes or assets by 20% to 30%.  It can, in fact, and it did so to many other people.  Under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments, it was done to nurses, teachers and public sector workers.  They had pay cuts and pension levies applied to their wages.  What the Minister means is that he will not do it.</p> <p> The Minister indicated that he is exceptionally worried about landlords.  He referred to poor landlords on four or five occasions.  She said very little about the poor families turfed onto the streets as a result of his intransigence.  As has been stated, the main cause of homelessness is eviction from the private rented sector.  There are no measures to protect somebody from being evicted if the landlord is intent on doing so.  If a landlord wishes to get rid of a tenant, and I am not saying every landlord does, all he or she need do is state in an affidavit that he or she will sell the house.  Who will challenge the landlords?  How many cases arise where somebody challenges a landlord?  There was one recently involving a high profile broadcaster and his family who evicted a tenant.  When the tenant returned three months afterwards to collect post, lo and behold, the house was not sold.  The tenant took a case against the landlord but only got &euro;900 in compensation.  That is not even a month's rent.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that is a disincentive for a landlord who wishes to get rid of somebody?  It is not.  The landlord has the balance of protection and the Minister is happy to keep it that way, even though there is a massive housing crisis.</p> <p> The constant catchcry of the Minister, and of his predecessor, is that he cannot do anything because it will drive landlords out of the market.  I wish to examine this.  Driving tenants out is fine, but we cannot drive landlords out.  Where would these landlords go?  Would they leave the country with the houses on their backs?  They would not.  They would have two options, either to leave the house sitting idle and vacant or to sell it.  If the landlord sells it, that is great because there will be another house available for somebody to buy.  We have a shortage of housing.  If landlords leave houses idle and vacant, why does the Minister not consider imposing a tax on such houses?  Of course, doing so during a housing emergency would be criminal and scandalous.  Again, the Minister is extremely worried about landlords all the time and does not give due consideration to people who are suffering under this policy.</p> <p> The Minister stated that he had solved the corrupt practice whereby councils were overestimating the number of people who are homeless.  If only he would put the same detective skills to use with councils that have not built a thing on the land they own in recent years.  It would be great if he went to war with the councils about that, because that is the solution to the crisis in the first instance.  The Minister also mentioned that during December and January, more people left homelessness than entered it.  December is always a quiet month for homelessness.  Generally, people do not get evicted in the run up to Christmas.  It is usually left until the new year so I have a doubt about taking those two months alone.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned the figures for consortia and huge companies buying property and said they were very low.  How does he respond to a report in the news this week that I-RES REIT is going to buy 118 properties from a developer in north Dublin before they are built?  It will buy them and rent them out.  Is the Minister happy with that?  Will he do anything about it?  Deputy Michael Noonan may be out of office but the vultures and consortia are still thriving on this Minister's watch.</p> <p> This is not personal.  It is a little annoying when the Minister reacts extremely personally to everything.  It is an international feature of capitalism that homelessness is escalating and public homes are not being built.  It is not personal; the Minister is following a policy that is being followed in many other countries.  However, the Minister's responses are unbelievable.  He reacts in a plaintive and wounded tone, stating that it is beneath us to say the mildest things to him.  He should see the scale of this, stop the self pity and apply some pity to the people who are suffering, that is, the people who are being made homeless as well as those who are stuck at home with their parents, in overcrowded situations, and who cannot live their own lives because of this situation.</p> <p> Why is this happening?  As already stated, it is an international phenomenon.  It is an international ideology now that rather than invest in housing and things people need, such as health, the market has decided to operate like a casino where the super wealthy will gamble and speculate on commodities.  A UN report in 2017 on a study on property stated that the commodity of choice for corporate finance is property.  It is a safety deposit box for the wealthy.  Real estate worldwide is worth $160 trillion, which is twice the world's total GDP.  That is the reason we have this situation.  Homelessness is increasing everywhere, and our native capitalist class is no different from others.  We have experienced it under Fianna F&aacute;il, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and this Fine Gael Government.  They all took the same route and turned their backs on building public housing.  This Minister has no problem with money being spent on housing.  Consider what he is doing with HAP.  Some &euro;23 billion more will be spent on that over 30 years than will be spent on building houses.  He does not mind money going on housing as long as it is going into the pockets of private landlords and developers.</p> <p> How will we change course and force Governments such as that currently in office to change policy?  We need a similar movement to the movement that was built against the water charges and the one built to repeal the eighth amendment.  They were two successful movements through which Governments were forced to change course.  We need the same now.  I appeal to the trade union movement, in particular, to make this a workers' issue.  Why not take a lead from the school students who went out on strike a couple of weeks ago over climate change?  Why not make this a strike issue?  Workers are suffering massively due to the amount of money they must pay to cover rent and mortgages.</p> <p> There is a great deal of apathy about housing.  This debate is a very pedestrian affair when one considers that the number of homeless has gone above 10,000.  There are four Members in the House debating the issue.  In the past, it would have been considered a far more serious issue.  As homelessness increases, apathy increases in the media and the political establishment.  That will change in the elections, and I would be extremely worried about the Minister, his party and its policies.  People will see this as the most important issue in May.  We need councillors who will fight for public homes on public lands.  There is no need to seek new ideas.  The Minister can return to an old idea that has worked repeatedly when there was a housing crisis.  When public housing was built on a large scale the crisis was resolved.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  The solution is there, as is the public land and the wealth.  Unfortunately, the political will on the part of the Minister is not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-28a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019032800053#DDD00200"><p>Solutions to the housing crisis are needed now more than ever.  The plight of over 10,000 homeless people underlines the pressing need to address the housing crisis.  However, it can only be done with consistent policy, resources and honesty, not through silver bullets or magic beans.  This Government has shown repeatedly that it simply is not facing the seriousness of housing in Ireland.  The constant spinning and playing politics are not what our people expect from a responsible and serious Government.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports, in principle, the removal of sale as a reason for ending a tenancy.  Mike Allen of Focus Ireland argues that eviction for the reason of sale is now the primary source of homelessness.  He estimates that one third of households that are becoming newly homeless are as a result of eviction for this reason.  Fianna F&aacute;il submitted an amendment to the Government&rsquo;s so-called Tyrrelstown amendment in order to reduce the number of units in a single development from 20 to five.</p><p>This, we argue, would offer more secure occupancy to a larger number of tenants without having a detrimental impact on the market by preventing involuntary landlords from selling their properties.  This is key.  We have to balance the interventions that are needed to secure vulnerable tenancies with encouraging landlords not only to remain in the rental sector but to enter it, particularly in key pressure point areas.  The model of ownership of the rental sector needs to change but that transition needs to be such that we do not throw out tenants while we change the system.  That would be irresponsible, wrong and also unnecessary.  However, the Government rejected our amendment and again raised the number of units to ten in a single development, removing an estimated 5,000 potential properties from coverage of the provision.  It did this on the basis of legal advice, arguing that this could be more robustly defended against constitutional challenge.</p> <p> There is also a strong policy argument as to why we need to be careful in how we design new tenant security provisions.  We should not introduce provisions that will unintentionally act as a barrier to persons with distressed buy-to-let mortgages being able to dispose of their properties.  As we all know, over 90% of Irish landlords, covering an estimated 85% of rental properties, own only one or two properties and many of these are involuntary landlords.  They are not the enemy.  They are part of the solution.  We cannot simplify this to out-of-date ideological battles between the extreme left and the hard right.  There is a general consensus that a move towards more institutional large-scale investors in the Irish market is desirable from the perspective of advancing a more professional rental sector.  To abolish sale as a reason for ending a tenancy, as this Bill attempts to do, could stall the turnover of rental properties from smaller landlords, many of whom are involuntary landlords who are not making a profit and are often in negative equity.  Like it or not, removing sale of property as a ground for terminating a tenancy would not be constitutional.  This is a serious flaw, one that cannot be ignored or swept under the carpet.  Left un-amended this Bill would in fact accelerate the exodus of landlords by prompting fire sales by those who could afford to leave the market during a period of legal uncertainty in the courts, thereby further worsening the situation.  A far better approach, one that is consistent with the constitutional protection of property rights and the balance of protecting the common good, would be to remove sale as a reason for ending a tenancy in most circumstances, but not in all circumstances.  Such an approach could be robustly defended against constitutional challenge.  This can be done in a number of ways.  One such way would be to insert a provision that would enable landlords to remove tenants in order to sell their property if they can prove that it significantly affects the market sale price of the property by comparison with vacant possession.  Such a provision would be much more effective in offering greater security to a larger number of tenants without leading to the infringement of constitutional rights and widespread uncertainty in the rental sector, which the current Sinn F&eacute;in proposals would do.  The common good clause of the property rights constitutional provisions would, in my view, enable the Government of the day, given the harm to the common good that the housing crisis presents, to ensure that our people, all of our people, have access to the basic human right of shelter, a home.</p> <p> As Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows, the housing committee has agreed in a proactive and responsible manner to work with the Government's residential tenancies Bill, to strengthen its weaknesses and to reach a general agreed position.  This is the way forward and we in Fianna F&aacute;il will work with all members of the housing committee to provide workable solutions.  Outside of the committee, Fianna F&aacute;il, through the confidence and supply arrangements, has kept this Government under pressure on housing and we have delivered some significant improvements.  We secured increased social housing funding in the last budget.  The overall capital budget for housing increased from &euro;1.065 million in 2018 to &euro;1.34 billion in 2019, a &euro;271 million or 25% increase.  This includes social housing and homeless capital funding.  We have forced the housing capital budget to increase from &euro;430 million in budget 2016 to &euro;1.34 billion today.  This is a &euro;900 million, or 300%, increase.  Fianna F&aacute;il has secured a new affordable housing scheme.</p> <p> Only &euro;20 million was allocated to an affordable housing scheme in 2018 with no units delivered or regulations signed off on.  Fianna F&aacute;il has established a revamped scheme worth over &euro;100 million per annum over the next three years.  This will deliver approximately 7,500 units at an average price of &euro;200,000 for ordinary income workers.  We have forced measures to keep landlords in the market with tax incentives to stabilise rents.  Landlords selling up is removing units from the market and is driving up rents.  Over 4,000 landlords left the sector in the past 12 months.  We established a 100% mortgage interest relief measure to help keep landlords in the market and retain supply in the short term while more homes are built.  Further measures to incentivise long-term leases are in development.</p> <p> We have addressed the serious delays and red tape in the Department and local authorities.  Delays in procurement and the four-step approval process for social housing is crippling delivery.  We tripled the discretion of local authorities to build homes without going through administrative hoops.  Local authorities can now build up to 30 homes through the fast-track process.  More work is needed in this area.  With regard to the crucial area of social housing and homelessness, social housing funding has been ramped up by &euro;270 million.  Homelessness numbers at 10,000 are still unacceptably high.  These figures are disputed by many with claims it could be a high as 12,000.  In reality, 10,000 is far too high for a developed country like Ireland.  Thousands of children&rsquo;s lives are being ruined by homelessness.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il supports landlords and renters.  We need both for a rental market to function.  Budget 2019 was not a landlords' budget.  A rental market needs landlords if it is to work.  It incentivises landlords to stay in the system.  Some 40,000 landlords left the system between 2012 and 2018, including 4,000 in the past 12 months.  We need to retain current landlords otherwise there will be fewer units available to rent and rents will rise.  The mortgage interest relief is targeted at small landlords with two or less units to keep them in the system.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il approves, in principle, of the idea of limiting the right of sale as grounds to terminate a tenancy.  However, it must be constitutional.  There are serious questions as to whether this Bill meets that requirement.  In addition, it may have the unintended consequence of accelerating the exodus of landlords from the rental market while the legal case is fought in the courts.  Fianna F&aacute;il previously secured the restriction of evictions on the ground of sales to ten units in the 2016 Act.  This should be reduced to five, which would protect the vast bulk of landlords in the state while ensuring security of tenure for tenants in institutional landlord owned units.  Ultimately, the key to addressing the homelessness crisis is increasing supply.  This must involve attracting and retaining landlords in the system and not penalising them.  Reducing Government red tape and increasing capital expenditure on the provision of social housing is also essential.</p></speech>

She is right: it is disappointing.  It is also disappointing that she could not wait an additional seven minutes to hear the response to some of the points she raised.  She also asked why I take this personally.  I take this very personally because it is my responsibility to solve these problems.  I do not know if Deputy Coppinger has responsibility for anything but I do take this personally because I want to get this solved and I will work with any Deputy in this House on an idea that I think will help to solve it.  I will not let ideology keep me from working with others, as some Deputies in this House do.</p>  <p>  I am sorry that Deputy Broughan also is not here to hear my reply.  If he cannot see some of the progress that is happening, some of the improvements that are being made and the families that are getting keys to new social housing homes, then I am afraid his own ideology is blinding him to it.  Like Deputy Broughan and all Members of this House, I have constituents hurting because we still have a severe housing shortage, which we are working to correct.  The Deputy either intentionally misquoted me or quoted me out of context, but I said we will always need emergency accommodation, unfortunately, because of the lives that we all lead and through no fault of anyone people will find themselves in difficulty on a night in question needing emergency accommodation.</p><p>It is our responsibility, as a Government, to make sure it is always available.  I did not say there would always be people homeless on the street and that we would not care for them; I said the opposite.  The Deputy is being irresponsible if he thinks people will not find themselves in difficulty in the future and in need of State support.  That was the point I was making.<br/><br/>The Deputy calls us an austerity Government.  Again, his ideology is blinding him to the fact that the housing budget this year is &euro;2.4 billion, which represents an increase on the budget for last year and the highest ever spend on housing in a single year by an Irish Government.  How is that an austerity budget?  The Deputy's ideology is getting in the way.<br/><br/>The Deputy was either not listening or does not want to accept that there are potential risks in the Bill before us.  No one denies the intention and noble motivation behind it.  We all want to prevent families and individuals from entering homelessness, but we also need to be open to each other's points and the potential risks when we have debates.  <br/><br/>The average length of time spent in a family hub is six months.  Of course, some families have been in one for longer, but the average is six months.  The situation is far more positive than previously for families.  Where would Deputy &Oacute; Broin put people if we are not to have family hubs, landlords, the HAP scheme, buy-to-let properties or foreign investors?  Where would people live while we increased the stock of social housing?  He will not answer that question because he cannot do so.<br/><br/>Deputy Coppinger asked about the evidence for a potential decrease of 20% to 30% in the value of a house if tenants had to be <i>in situ</i>when it was sold.  We already have such evidence through an examination under the Tyrrelstown amendment.  She talked about price decreases as being good because house prices are too high.  Of course, for someone who is trying to buy a house, falling house prices are good.  However, if a person who owns a house is in negative equity and the house has to be sold to pay off a debt and if it cannot be sold, the bank might then go after the house in which the person lives.  It is not good if someone who needs financial support from the sale of a house to meet medical bills or something else cannot have that support.  More people end up getting hurt as a result of not thinking through the risk of bankruptcy that might affect them.  We have to think about all of these things.  They cannot only be looked at in isolation.<br/><br/>Deputy Coppinger said I was worried about landlords.  I am not.  I am worried about losing them, as are Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and all of responsible Members in this House.  Landlords are part of the solution and, if Deputy Coppinger had any responsibility here, she would also be worried.<br/><br/>We are going to strengthen section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016.  There is no point in me going to war with councils to increase supply.  We have housing summits to help them to increase supply, recognising that they have been out of that game for a number of years in many areas.  We should not try to be divisive; rather, we should try to look for ways to co-operate.  It is not my style to be divisive.  <br/><br/>In December people were leaving emergency accommodation.  When we talk about exits from emergency accommodation, we do not mean going home or to live with family; rather, we talk about exits to sustainable tenancies.  In December and January more families exited than entered emergency accommodation.  That was a positive development, but, regrettably, it was reversed in the most recent figures.<br/><br/>I worry that people will be taken in by Deputy Coppinger's simplistic and ideological approach to government.  Her approach to it and that of her party has never worked anywhere.  She speaks about campaigns that forced the Government to make a change on the eight amendment to the Constitution, but democracy led to that change.  I have heard contributions from her party colleagues that, at times, are very anti-democratic.  That worries me.<br/><br/>Deputy Casey spoke about transition.  That is important because we are transitioning to a new housing economy.  Public and State land will be used in the public good to provide affordable and cost rental housing.  That will take time and is more challenging, but it is happening.  We have to protect people during that period of transition.  <br/><br/>The Deputy has proposed an amendment to the current proposal which I would like to see in writing because I have said I will consider every idea that is put on the table.  I note that he takes responsibility for all of the positives in the budget.  I again thank him and his party for their support for Rebuilding Ireland.  He again mentioned that the affordability scheme was his party's idea, which is not true.  It would be great if we could see some consistency from Fianna F&aacute;il.  If it isto support the good and positive things that are happening, it has to recognise the challenges we face with things that are not happening in the way we would like.</p></speech>

I will make some brief concluding remarks.</p>  <p>  I am grateful for the Minister's concern for my reputation, but none of what I said yesterday is beneath me and I stand over all of it.  I am firmly of the view that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, through pursuing the wrong policy options on housing, are conspiring to make things worse.  Those remarks apply not just to the Government but also historical ones.  Whether they are doing it knowingly, intentionally or unintentionally is a separate issue, but if the same broad policy consensus is pursued, Government after Government, with the same flawed results, what am I to assume?  The basis of those policies is straightforward.  It is under-investment in public housing to meet a need for social and affordable housing.  That is why the numbers on housing lists go up, with rent supplement, the level of dependence on the housing assistant payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and homelessness.  There has been a decades long over-reliance on the private sector to meet the need for social and affordable housing.  The figures are clear over a lengthy period.</p>  <p>  I also stand over my remarks about the figures.  Ms Eileen Gleeson, the most senior homeless services official in the State; Mr. Eoin O'Sullivan, the Trinity College Dublin academic who helped to design the homeless reporting system, and Mr. Brendan Kenny all told us in committee meetings and on the airwaves that the vast majority of adults and children who had been removed from the homeless figures over the course of 2018 were homeless, accessing homeless services and had priority at the time they were removed.  They should not have been removed from the figures.  There was a small number in County Louth who were wrongly categorised, but according to Mr. Brendan Kenny, Ms Eileen Gleeson and Mr. Eoin O'Sullivan - the record of the D&aacute;il shows this clearly - the vast majority of the 1,606 people were homeless and in homeless services at the time they were removed from the figures.  The Minister can respond afterwards, but he should listen to the point I am making.</p></speech>

He mentioned the help-to-buy scheme.  The difficulty is that the Government's own commissioned report tells us that the majority of people who accessed the help-to-buy tax relief did not need it and that, therefore, it was not an effective use of the funds for the majority of people.</p>  <p>  The Minister knows that I support the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  In fact, local authority mortgages have been available for almost as long as the State has been in existence.  The difficulty, for example, in Dublin where the average loan offer is &euro;200,000, is that the vast majority of people who are being offered the loan cannot buy anything with it, which is why in Dublin the vast majority who have been offered the loan have not drawn it down.</p>  <p>  It would make a difference to the social housing programme if the capital investment in social and affordable housing was doubled because it would double the output.  The Minister is right that unless we tackle the overly bureaucratic approval, tendering and procurement process - Sinn F&eacute;in has made detailed proposals on how it could be done - it will not be speeded up.  We have told him how it could be done.  Local authority managers have come to the housing committee and outlined how it could be done, but the Minister has ignored our advice.</p>  <p>  The rent pressure zones are not working.  Rents have increased by 8% in Dublin in the past year.  It is now &euro;1,400 more expensive per year to rent in Dublin than it was a year ago.  In fact, people effectively are now paying 13 months' rent, instead of 12.  That is not a 4% cap on rental costs; rather, it is an abject failure.  That applies to most counties where there are rent pressure zones.  The alternative, of course, would be a rent freeze.  I do not accept the arguments made by Fine Gael that such a freeze would make things worse.</p>  <p>  My party has never argued that people should not have access to housing benefit, but it is the over-reliance on increasing the numbers entering the private rental sector, subsidised by the State, which is the policy problem.  It is not a short-term issue; it has been an issue since Fianna F&aacute;il's 1997 "Delivering homes, sustaining communities" housing plan.  The aim has been to have a large body of people indefinitely in the private rental sector subsidised by the taxpayer.  It is bad for the people concerned because it is a casualisation of social housing provision, but it is also bad for renters and first-time buyers who are not eligible for social housing support because it crowds them out of the market and pushes up prices.</p><p>The Minister criticised the Bill for its simplicity.  While it is possible he said something I did not understand, the only proposal I heard from him was to give people with notices to quit a little more time.  It is true that a little more time is good but it is an even more simplistic proposal than mine and, in the current market with rents increasing year on year, it will not address the problem.  The one question the Minister did not answer is what he will do differently to stop the flow of families who are being legally evicted by landlords under pressure from banks to sell.  That is the single greatest driver of family homelessness.  If the Minister and Deputy Casey believe our proposal is wrong, the responsibility is on their parties to put in place an alternative.  As neither of them has come to the debate with an alternative, however, the people who have the notices to quit in their hands tonight will receive nothing from us today and will remain faced with the prospect of homelessness in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p> The other large gap in both the Minister's and the Deputy's contributions was what the Government will do about the disorderly exit of properties from the rental market.  The Minister's main argument against my Bill is that it would make matters worse.  More than 9,000 rental properties have left the market in the past year and a half, although we have not received the figures for the end of 2018 and, therefore, the figure is much higher.  There is a disorderly exit of properties but nothing in what either Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il has said today will deal with that.  I propose that we make it more difficult for those property owners to exit.  The Minister is correct that in many cases they are selling as a result of mortgage distress, but now that there is some positive equity, under pressure from the bank or the fund, they are considering leaving.  I want to make it more difficult for them to sell that property to anything other than another landlord as an emergency measure to stop the flow of families becoming homeless.  If the basic choice is to say to the landlord that he or she will lose profit from the sale of the house by 10% or 20%, but if the social benefit to the State is that the family with children in that house will not become homeless, at this point that is a choice that the Oireachtas should make.  If the Minister thinks differently, he should come to us with a proposal.  Notwithstanding all the arguments and criticism, the Minister knows that when he comes to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, often based on Opposition proposals which have been passed by the Oireachtas, we respond and facilitate them.  If he has some new idea to prevent families from becoming homeless that he has kept secret, he should let us know.  If he has some mechanism to stem the disorderly exit of properties from the rental market, which is happening as a consequences of his policies, under his watch and that of his predecessor, he should come and speak to us about it and we will work with him.  Until he has either of such proposals, however, I will continue to propose in the House what I believe are sensible, credible solutions, which is what the Opposition must do.</p> <p> At some point, the Minister will have to accept that the policy he is pursuing is not working.  I do not dispute the figures, which show that the rate of planning permission and home completions has increased, but we are not getting the right types of homes in the right places for those who are in need of social or affordable housing and, in particular, for those who are at risk of imminent homelessness.  Until that core weakness of Rebuilding Ireland is adequately addressed, the crisis will get worse.  At the very best, Rebuilding Ireland at the end of its five years will take us back to where we were in 2006 or 2007, with exceptionally high social housing waiting lists, exceptionally high levels of social welfare dependency in the private rented sector, anaemic outputs of social housing, and affordable housing schemes that trap people into high levels of mortgage repayments and increasing levels of mortgage distress.</p> <p> I make no apologies for making the proposal.  I am deeply disappointed, although not surprised, that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael continue to conspire to prevent adequate solutions being brought forward.  As I stated earlier, if either of the parties who remain in the Chamber has better ways of dealing with the specific problem I have raised, we will work with it.  Today, however, they have not proposed any better ways.  For the families in emergency accommodation tonight, with notices to quit in the private rented sector, the Minister has offered them no comfort, solutions or hope in respect of that specific problem they face, which is deeply disappointing. </p></speech>
