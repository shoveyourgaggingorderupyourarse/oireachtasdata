A dangerous level of unprovoked and gratuitous violence is being perpetrated against people who are socialising in Dublin at night time.  Three weeks ago, a 23 year old man was viciously assaulted on Dame Street after he had been subjected to homophobic abuse.  That young man had his left eye socket fractured.  On the same night, an Italian man was also attacked around in the same vicinity.  Two weeks ago, a 24 year old English man was gratuitously assaulted on D'Olier Street and is now in hospital fighting for his life.</p>  <p>  We need to understand what is happening.  Gangs of youths who believe they are immune to apprehension are prowling Dublin city at night time looking for people to attack.  They are misogynistic towards women, they are homophobic towards gay people and they are particularly seeking to target men in their late teens to their 30s who are on their own or just with one other person.  We need to understand that part of the solution is that Dublin needs to become more like other European cities.  If you go to other European cities you see a good number of policemen policing those city centres at night time.  We do not have enough garda&iacute; on the streets at night time.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for coming here today but I would ask him to get the answer back to the Minister for Justice and, through her, to the Garda Commissioner, that we need to see more garda&iacute; in Dublin city centre at night time.  I do not want to see Garda&iacute; at meetings at night time or stuck in Garda stations.  I want to see them out patrolling the inner city.  I fear that we will not get a strong enough response until regrettably a tourist is killed in this city.  If it is not checked or challenged, Dublin will get a terrible name as a place of violence.  It will damage our tourism industry and will also damage us as a place for foreign direct investment.  We need tougher and stronger policing and stronger sentencing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700003#A00400"><p>It is not only in the city but also the suburbs.  Tallaght Garda Station, the main Garda station in my constituency along with Rathfarnham Garda station, was designed in the 1970s and built in the 1980s.  It is completely outdated.  The Garda in Tallaght now take two floors of the Plaza Hotel, adjacent to Tallaght Garda station in order to be able to fulfil the functions they must fulfil.  It is not just that.  City West, a sprawling suburb which is growing exponentially and really quickly because of strategic housing developments there, has no Garda station.  It needs a station serving that particular area and doing so exclusively because it is quite remote from Tallaght.  There is a lot of anti-social behaviour, particularly in relation to some of the Luas stops, which I will return to.</p>  <p>  I hope that the Minister of State will feed my next point on Garda numbers back to the Minister, and she in turn to the Garda Commissioner.  When compared with towns and cities of similar size such as Limerick, Tallaght simply does not have the proportionate amount of garda&iacute; to serve the area and the surrounding area.  The numbers in Tallaght are significantly below comparative sized cities.  Furthermore, because of duty commitments on the Russian Embassy which is covered by Rathfarnham Garda station, up to ten garda&iacute; per week are committed to surveillance and coverage of the Russian Embassy because of the whole Ukrainian crisis and protests around it.  There are quiet protests which are legitimate.  But these Garda personnel who are committed to this duty, with two per shift at least, as well as other surveillance coverage, I am sure, have not been compensated for in Rathfarnham Garda station.  Therefore every day there are two garda&iacute; over two shifts and, I am sure there are others involved, totally committed to coverage of the Russian embassy who should be on duty, patrolling the streets, and who should be keeping the people of Tallaght and Rathfarnham and all the adjoining areas safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I utterly condemn the deplorable violent attacks that took place in Dublin city centre over Easter and wish the victims of these incidents a healthy recovery.  People should be able to feel safe and be safe, whether they live or work in Dublin, or want to visit and enjoy our capital city.</p>  <p>  I urge anyone who may have witnessed these or any other violent incidents in Dublin city recently, or who may have any information of potential interest to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to contact the Garda.  Reports can also be made through the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that matters of community safety are taken very seriously by the Government and Departments and agencies are continually exploring policy, legislative and operational measures to combat all forms of violence.</p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle public disorder-related issues and anti-social behaviour is reflected in Justice Plan 2022, which the Minister for Justice published recently.  The plan contains a number of actions relating to combatting crime and strengthening community safety, including those relating to the ongoing work of the anti-social behaviour forum, the progression of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill and the continuing implementation of the youth justice strategy 2021-2027.</p> <p>Garda&iacute; continue to implement high-visibility policing plans to address public disorder-related issues and antisocial behaviour in Dublin city centre, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and antisocial behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends.  The Deputies will, of course, appreciate that the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that Garda members and Garda staff in both Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, north central and south central have seen an increase in resources since 2012.  North central had an increase of over 2% for Garda members and 67.5% for Garda staff, and south central had an increase of over 2% for Garda members and 281% for Garda staff.</p> <p> In addition, a range of Garda operations are in place in Dublin city centre to tackle violent and antisocial behaviour in our capital.  Operation Citizen commenced in Dublin city centre in October 2021 and places a particular focus on antisocial behaviour, public order and quality-of-life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations.  Operation Saul, launched in January this year, supports Operation Citizen in targeting antisocial behaviour to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services within the Dublin metropolitan region.  Operation Soteria is also in place to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots.</p> <p> As the Deputies will be aware, north inner-city Dublin is also one of three pilot locations where local community safety partnerships have been established.  These partnerships bring together residents, community representatives, business interests, councillors, local authorities and State services, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the HSE, to devise and implement local community safety plans.  The plans detail how best the community can prevent crime and will reflect community priorities and local safety issues.  The aim of this approach is to make communities safer for families, residents and businesses.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I believe the experience and results of the partnership pilots will inform national roll-out and make a valuable contribution to Dublin city centre as a whole.</p> <p> The Government, and the Department of Justice in particular, are prioritising continued momentum in the vital work to make our communities safer.  Budget 2022 provided significant additional funding to deliver a host of initiatives under the youth justice strategy, and the community safety innovation fund, announced recently by the Minister, will also support community-based initiatives to enhance public safety.</p></speech>

However, the issue is the deployment of those resources because, unfortunately, it does not appear that we are seeing a greater number of garda&iacute; on the streets in the inner city.  That is the solution to this.  How many garda&iacute; are doing roads policing at night time as opposed to patrolling the inner city?  Obviously, we need roads policing but we primarily need more garda&iacute; patrolling the inner city.</p>  <p>  I have recently seen a solution to this.  For the past number of months, the people of Creighton Street and City Quay in my constituency have been subjected to unprovoked violence by rival gangs of youths on the pedestrian bridge over the River Liffey.  They were exposed to this level of violence throughout the day.  The local committee met with the Garda and there has now been a very positive response from the Garda in Pearse Street by allocating more resources there.  Therefore, more resources on the ground can solve this problem or certainly curtail it.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that message back to the Minister for Justice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700004#B00500"><p>Likewise, I acknowledge the increase in Garda numbers, but what people want to see, which is the age-old challenge, is garda&iacute; on the streets.  Be it the area covered by Tallaght Garda station, the area that is in need of a Garda station in Citywest, or Rathfarnham Garda station, which covers Firhouse, Ballycullen, Knocklyon, Rathfarnham and Churchtown, the public never see a garda on the beat anymore.  It instills a huge amount of confidence when they do.  As a result, we have seen an increase, especially in recent times, in assaults as well as significant antisocial behaviour and criminal damage in our parks, for example, in Rathfarnham Castle Park, where there was an incident over a weekend ago, and in Sean Walsh Park, where there was criminal damage caused over the weekend with fires started and assaults carried out.  Parks should be safe spaces for people.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to bring this message back to the Minister and the Garda Commissioner.  We need more garda&iacute; on the beat and in the stations in Tallaght and Rathfarnham.  People in those areas need to see a visible Garda presence which would demonstrate the fact the Government has committed additional resources to these stations.  I work closely, through our policing committee in the constituency, with Chief Superintendent Duff and Superintendent Lackey.  These are top-class police officers.  In terms of surveillance of antisocial behaviour on the Luas red line, the garda&iacute; do incredible work, but Tallaght Garda station, which is the mother-ship Garda station of my constituency, simply does not have the kind of numbers and resources it needs given the population it serves, which is the size of a city.  That needs to be addressed seriously by the Minister and the Commissioner.</p></speech>

I will take their messages back in terms of visibility, resourcing and garda&iacute; on the beat.  The Minister is determined to continue to drive the implementation of the range of community safety policy actions to combat criminal activity and antisocial behaviour.  We are very conscious of the effect these behaviours can have on the quality of life for local communities and those visiting in the community.  Incidents of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable, and fear should never become normalised in our society.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the budget provided by the Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, including funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff.  This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe.  Many of the Garda members to be recruited will be drawn from the Garda recruitment competition that closed in recent weeks, and I very much welcome the fact that more than 10,000 people applied to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this competition.</p>  <p>  Record budget funding is underpinned by the ongoing roll-out of the new Garda operating model to support the redeployment of garda&iacute; from non-core duties to front-line policing throughout the country.  The new model will see larger divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.</p></speech>

Private bus operators are a fundamental part of our public transport service.  In the way it has evolved over the years, they are responsible for 100% of services in many places, particularly in vast swathes of rural Ireland.  They provide scheduled services through the National Transport Authority.  They provide school bus transport services through the Department of Education, under Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus in the city, as well as under other bus companies.  In terms of coach tourism, they provide an important role for incoming tourists.  It is a hugely important service that keeps people moving.</p>  <p>  Operators have had a difficult couple of years because of Covid.  I acknowledge the supports the Government provided during that time.  I point to the fact, as I consistently did during that period, that there were anomalies and discrepancies within those measures, for example, regarding the private school bus operators and the supports that were available.  I welcome the Government measures, and I have said as much to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, such as the introduction of the youth travel card, which is due to be introduced next month, the additional cost-of-living measures, and the 20% reduction in fares.  However, this has a direct impact on private operators in that they cannot avail of these measures.  There is a commitment from the Government that the youth travel card would be introduced at some stage in the future, around which there are technical issues.  That needs to be introduced as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The 20% fare reduction is literally limited to public service obligation, PSO, routes.  That has a real impact on the competitiveness and viability of these services.  I make that point as someone who wants to see an enhancement of uptake on public transport.  There is a question now about viability.  This happens in the context of increasing running costs, the increase in the price of diesel and everything else.  It calls into question the future viability of these services.  I am not convinced that the Government, the Minister or the Department have adequately assessed the potential impact of that.</p> <p> I believe there is a commitment to the expansion of public transport but I am not convinced the approach that has been taken here and the potential impact of the specific exclusion from the 20% reduction has been adequately considered.  There is a real prospect, and we have literally seen the difficulty the school bus transport sector is having at this point spelled out in black and white, that we might lose a number of operators.  In our mission to get more people on to public transport, we might actually lose and forego that opportunity because of the approach and inherent inequity in these measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700005#C00200"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke for raising this important topic, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is with regard to the inclusion of private bus operators in the young adult card and other fare-reduction initiatives.  From the outset, I would like to assure the Deputy that I have been advised that it has always been the intention of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to include commercial bus operators as part of the young adult card initiative.  Licenced bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country that are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licenced commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.  In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to 30 June 2022.  To date, more than &euro;60 million has been provided to support the commercial bus operators during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the young adult card, recognising the importance of incentivising more young people to use public transport, &euro;25 million of funding was secured for the scheme's introduction as part of budget 2022.  This initiative will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services including city, intercity and rural services.  It is expected that the young adult card will be launched on PSO services next month.  It will then be broadened to include commercial operators later this year with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third-level colleges.</p>  <p>  With regard to other public transport fare initiatives, as the Deputy will be aware, a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.  This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the greater Dublin area from 11 April and it is intended to roll out the next stage of the reductions on greater Dublin area services from 9 May.  The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year.</p>  <p>  It is clear that these fare initiatives will be of great benefit to public transport users.  They will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport, with the associated benefit of transport emission savings.  It is important to note, however, that it is technically more challenging to roll out fare initiatives such as the young adult card on the commercial bus network than it is on the Leap-enabled PSO network.  As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to commercial bus operators.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, NTA, is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.  To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the young adult card on commercial bus operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented, with the second meeting of this group taking place this morning.  The invaluable industry experience on the working group will help expedite the process of deploying the young adult card to the wider commercial bus sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700005#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that update.  I welcome the joint working group and the commitment to engagement with regard to the issue of the youth travel card.  That needs to happen as quickly as possible.  I also draw the Minister of State's attention to this matter.  It is important to point out that there needs to be movement regarding the 20% fare reduction on non-PSO routes.  Operators have told me they acknowledge the progress on the youth travel card.  They need movement with regard to the 20% fare reduction.  When they engaged with the Minister in relation to this, he said that not only were there technical issues with the youth travel card but there was no additional funding to move on the 20%.  At the same time, however, or very shortly after, there was movement on the student Leap card for 12 to 19-year-olds, which is separate to the youth travel card.</p>  <p>  I make the point that it is really important there is consistency across the board.  If our objective is to maximise the number of people who will be using public transport in the years ahead, and if we acknowledge that it will be a mixture of PSO, commercial, private bus operators and State operators, then we need to ensure the viability of all the component parts of that.  There is a risk in setting a two-tier approach that this will not happen.</p>  <p>  In my remaining 20 seconds, I ask the Minister of State to relay those points to the Minister but also those in respect of school bus transport.  The Coach Tourism and Transport Council, CTTC, private bus operators said they will not make it to the end of the year.  They have not seen a dime in extra money despite the increasing cost of fuel.  That needs to be resolved as well.</p></speech>

I think the school bus transport issue may go to the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I take the Deputy's point, however.  I would like to reassure him that both the NTA and the Department of Transport have been engaging directly with commercial bus operators to help inform policy decisions with regard to the public transport sector, particularly those related to the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the sector and the various fare initiatives being introduced this year.</p>  <p>  In addition to the working group I referenced earlier, the Department of Transport has been engaging with the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland since May 2020.  To date, 23 meetings have taken place.  More recently, on 25 March, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, met with the CTTC to discuss its concerns and the key issues facing the sector.</p>  <p>  While it is not intended to include the commercial operators as part of the 20% average fare initiative, which is applicable to PSO services and is due to run to the end of 2022, it is intended to include these operators as part of the young adult card initiative.  The NTA is working closely with operators to achieve this shared goal as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy will appreciate, however, in order to roll out the card across the commercial bus sector, time is needed to make and test the necessary changes to the wide array of ticketing systems employed across the network.  The NTA has advised that the intensive technical work to achieve this is on track.</p></speech>

This is black and white.  What I want to raise probably goes back to late June of last year with the closure of the Owenacurra health centre in Midleton and the short-term and long-term respite beds.</p>  <p>  I want to raise the fact that even when that centre was open pre-Covid and we had the short-term beds, on average, approximately 208 people per year used those two separate beds.  That obviously closed with Covid-19.  Since we have come out of the pandemic, however, there is actually a waiting list.  There was an additional waiting list of 26 people looking for those services on those two short-term respite beds.  Obviously, the centre is not taking in any more patients nor is it taking any short-term respite patients.</p>  <p>  The big issue here, of which I am sure the Minister of State is well aware, is that the HSE has repeatedly been spinning news that buildings are not fit for purpose.</p> <p>It says there are only so many residents in the centre and that, once they have gone, it will not be needed.  From my research and work, even in recent weeks, I can see we are going to lose the service for the 200-plus people a year on the short-term respite alone and the services that come with that, such as blood tests, chiropody and dental services.  They are all going to go.</p> <p> I appeal to the Government and the Minister of State to instruct the HSE to revisit the Owenacurra centre.  I had been informed about this issue yesterday morning, but in the evening I received a phone call from a person who had needed that service last Saturday.  When I spoke to that person, it made me both angry and sad.  They had driven their car to the Owenacurra centre last Saturday night and approached the centre.  It is up and running for the 11 residents who are there at the moment but, unfortunately, the centre could not assist the person, who told me they ended up sleeping in their car.  They were awoken by a young garda at 7 o'clock on the Sunday morning.  They went on to tell me they were experiencing so much anxiety that they got sick into a bag and put the bag into the boot of the car.  That is only one incident and, in fairness to the individual, they had the bravery to ring me and tell me I could relay their story because they needed the help.  Families have been affected since this issue broke in late June.  There are now families who have family members in that centre who are not talking any more, whether because of misinformation, coercion or whatever.  Residents have been told another centre is better, even though the family know it is not, and things break down.</p> <p> Having spoken to staff at the centre, I know families are still ringing them and crying down the phone, asking whether they can get one of their family members into the centre.  The centre covers a population of roughly 94,000 people in east Cork.  I accept the HSE has indicated people can go to other centres, but the other centres are in Skibbereen, Kanturk or Sarsfield Court.  I visited Sarsfield Court with the HSE four weeks ago.  Its compliance test received a lower score than the Owenacurra centre, and that was only four weeks ago.  The Owenacurra centre might not be fit for purpose, but the services have to remain in east Cork and the town of Midleton.  I appeal, therefore, to the Minister of State to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Government to revisit the Owenacurra centre and to keep the services in Midleton.</p></speech>

It would show my ignorance if I did not understand what the Owenacurra centre is.  I do understand what it is; it provides respite in respect of mental health supports.  My prepared contribution relates to a totally different matter, so it would be disrespectful of me not to acknowledge the Deputy's questions about the Owenacurra site.  I understand it exactly and everything he has raised.  I do not have a prepared answer to hand, but I will take on board what he said and I will discuss it with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I appreciate the local Deputies have engaged with that Minister of State, but I will convey to her what the Deputy raised.  Nevertheless, I will outline my prepared answer on disability services.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to the provision of respite.  I have seen at first hand the benefit respite can provide to people with disabilities and their families, so I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of respite.  This year, I have allocated funding to provide an additional ten respite homes, including three additional specialist centre-based services to provide 4,032 nights to 90 children, that is, one to be Prader-Willi appropriate and the other two to provide high-support respite for children and young adults with complex support needs.  Sometimes, when we say I support the &ldquo;development&rdquo; of something, that just means we are getting the process going, and when we talk about services being provided for 90 children, that could mean four children over seven nights.  It is about growing and creating that capacity.</p>  <p>  Regarding east Cork, the Cork-Kerry community healthcare organisation, CHO, provides funding to the Cope Foundation to provide adult respite services within the east Cork area.  At present, a four-bedroom respite service is operational in Fermoy and a six-bedroom respite service in Cobh is currently not in operation, unfortunately, due to staffing and recruitment issues.  That is very regrettable and puts a significant strain on families.  Regrettably, due to the Covid crisis, respite services throughout Cork and Kerry were severely impacted and resulted in some services ceasing operations completely or being offered in an alternative way.  Cork-Kerry disability services have informed me they have actively engaged with service providers to plan for the phased resumption of services and the development of alternative models.  Cork-Kerry community healthcare disability services have advised they will implement a standardised process for the management of adult respite services.  The standardisation is something I discussed with the CHO when I visited Cork last summer, whereby one person might get 40 hours while someone else might get only one hour.  There has to be a proper tool whereby what you get will not depend on whom you know.  A person's needs have to be the basis.</p>  <p>  More broadly within the county of Cork, a new respite service for adults is being developed by the Brothers of Charity.  I have been informed the building upgrade is now complete and the service is scheduled to open in quarter 2 of 2022 in Garretstown.  While it is an existing building, the four or five rooms within it will create new capacity in the area.  I have been informed that 10,649 respite overnights were provided in CHO 4, which exceeded the national service plan target by about 1,000 bed nights, while 1,467 day-only respite services days were also provided.  That was lower than the target, but not significantly so.  The HSE has advised that where targets were not met, this was mainly due to necessary precautions to maintain physical distancing.  The need for increased respite facilities for people with disabilities is now well understood, and the Department of Health and the HSE continue to work with me to explore various ways of responding to this need.</p></speech>

As I said, this matter was not intended as a trick question but rather was intended to highlight the lack of respite care and the difficulties for all sectors in east Cork.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State mentioned the Cope Foundation and the services it provides, which are only down the road from me.  In some ways, it is like the council waiting lists for housing, whereby someone might have been approved for a four-bedroom house and be excited and delighted but there may not be any four-bedroom houses available.  As for the services in Cobh, the issue is one of staffing, which is insufficient.  I raised the question in the first instance because this is about the knock-on effect of that.  Some people are capable and willing to travel to other towns in the area to try to get these services, whether in disability or mental health, but we need all these services to work together and complement one another.  If services are splintered, that will not work.  If we lose the Owenacurra centre and all the services there, where will those people go?  The social impact of the demand on families in Mallow, Fermoy, Cobh and possibly even as far down as Kanturk - God forbid if they had to travel to Skibbereen - who are not able to drive puts greater strain on those families.  Moreover, the public transport is poor.</p>  <p>  I reiterate my request.  I do not want to beg, because we should not have to beg in this House, but I have worked with and met these families.  There were more suicides at the weekend in our town, and a HSE entity is saying we do not need mental health services or respite services in the town.  The model of consistency and excellence in this centre, which is totally integrated within the town and local services, should be replicated throughout the country, yet the HSE wants to close it.  I appeal to the Minister of State to urge the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the wider Government to rethink the closure of the Owenacurra centre and to save the services.</p></speech>

As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health respite, this is one of Deputy Butler's priorities, so I will certainly convey the Deputy's points to her.  Respite is also a priority for me within disability services.</p> <p>For me to stand here and tell the Deputy I know of a house that is closed because we cannot staff it is extraordinary.  We have to question why we cannot staff it.  I know there are shortages everywhere else but sometimes we have to look at the wages and what we we pay people who work in these services.  We also need to move away completely from the medical model and towards a more social model.  The team does not always need to be medically-led.  A social care worker with good staff can also deliver and support the respite piece.  Cork is a huge challenge for me, especially with regard to respite and residential care.  That is why I will be going away today and discussing this house that is closed.  I know it is run by the Cope Foundation but I have to wonder why a house would be closed when I have funding to deliver that service.  At the same time, when I get agencies in they are able to recruit staff and service the sites for me, which is why I was able to deliver the ten houses I delivered last year.  I have to wonder about the management of funding and why that cannot be done nationwide.</p></speech>

the regressive carbon tax was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il/Green Party Government in 2010;<br /><br />&mdash; the tax initially applied to liquid and gaseous fuels at the rate of &euro;15 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>);<br /><br />&mdash; the tax was extended to solid fuels in 2013 under the Fine Gael/Labour Party Government;<br /><br />&mdash; there were phased increases of the tax to reach &euro;26 per tonne in 2020;<br /><br />&mdash; Budget 2021 further raised the tax to &euro;33.50 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>on automotive fuels in October 2020, and on all fuels as of May 2021;<br /><br />&mdash; the Finance Act 2020 legislated for annual increases in the rate of carbon tax out to 2030, which will bring the tax rate to &euro;100 per tonne;<br /><br />&mdash; the 2022 hike alone is &euro;7.50, bringing the overall rate of carbon tax to &euro;41 per tonne, with this increase being applied from 13th October, 2021, for diesel and petrol and from 1st May, 2022, for all other fuels;<br /><br />&mdash; the estimated additional yield from the current &euro;7.50 increase in the carbon tax is &euro;108 million in 2022, and &euro;147 million in 2023;<br /><br />&mdash; the carbon tax currently adds &euro;7 to a 60-litre fill of petrol, and this will increase by an additional &euro;1.28 each year to 2030;<br /><br />&mdash; the carbon tax currently adds &euro;8.10 to a 60-litre fill of diesel, and this will increase by &euro;1.48 each year to 2030;<br /><br />&mdash; from 1st May, 2022, the carbon tax: <blockquote> 	&mdash; on a 900-litre fill of home heating oil will increase by &euro;19.40, bringing the total carbon tax applied to &euro;106.07;<br /><br />&mdash; on 11,000 kilowatt-hours of natural gas will jump by &euro;16.95, bringing the total carbon tax to &euro;92.62;<br /><br />&mdash; applied to a bag of coal (40 kilogram (kg)) will increase by 89 cents, bringing the total carbon tax applied to &euro;4.90 per bag; and<br /><br />&mdash; applied to peat briquettes (12.5kg bale) will jump by 20 cents, bringing the carbon tax applied to &euro;1.07 per bale; and </blockquote> </blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the primary purpose of the carbon tax is to act as a disincentive, which can only be effective if members of the public are using more energy than they require and if alternative options are available, however, this is not the case in Ireland as many people across all sectors of the economy are desperately trying to reduce their energy usage and despite this are struggling enormously to pay crippling existing charges;<br /><br />&mdash; the Fuel Allowance is only paid to a relatively small number of households, meaning that the majority of households do not benefit from the modest payment and are therefore not shielded from ongoing drastic energy price increases;<br /><br />&mdash; the carbon tax is a central contributing factor to Ireland's record cost of living increases, with the tax increasing the direct costs of everything from food and fuel to other goods and services;<br /><br />&mdash; the carbon tax does absolutely nothing to address the infrastructure needed for a low carbon economy, infrastructure like a smarter grid or a network of electric vehicle charging stations;<br /><br />&mdash; Ireland's carbon taxes are costing our people an increasing amount of money each year and are clearly not working from a public policy standpoint; and<br /><br />&mdash; inflation is one of the key economic issues facing Irish families, farmers and small businesses and the carbon tax is making these tough times much tougher by making it more expensive to drive to work, run a farm, haulage, transport or any other type of business, or to heat a home or community facility; and </blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; fully acknowledge that the carbon tax is first and foremost a tax plan and not an environmental plan;<br /><br />&mdash; make life much more affordable for all Irish people by scrapping the carbon tax and only reintroducing any form of carbon taxation following the passage of a democratic referendum, supported by a majority of the people;<br /><br />&mdash; commission and publish an independent financial analysis, which would determine the household and sectoral impacts of the carbon tax to Irish society, together with any possible benefits, prior to a referendum; <br /><br />&mdash; recognise that a more effective climate change strategy would harness the full potential of new and emerging technologies, to spur innovations like the ones that have made solar one of the cheapest forms of energy in much of the world and electric cars a viable alternative to petrol and diesel-powered ones; and<br /><br />&mdash; fully accept that this Government's climate policy logic, in which carbon pricing is the central policy response, is deeply flawed. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on behalf of, and with, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.  This matter is most important because it is only now that the carbon tax is hitting home.  Members of the Government might like to say that the war and other issues beyond their reach have caused the large spike in the increase in the cost of living, but what is happening in May shows why my colleagues, including Deputy Mattie McGrath, and I have always been so forceful in our concerns about the carbon tax.</p><p>I am not a climate change denier or someone who says that we should not be taking measures to protect our environment, but it amazes me that there is a simple measure that no one seems to be considering.  How many plastic bottles of milk are going from shops to people's homes today?  The people who were there before us were very smart.  They did not put milk into plastic containers when it started being sold in shops.  It was sold in glass bottles and a levy of a couple of pence was put on them.  They were washed, returned and used again.  If we were to stop using plastic bottles tomorrow morning, imagine the significant saving that would make for our environment.  This would be a meaningful measure.</p><p>When the Green Party entered government, we believed that there would be many sensible ideas.  Instead, all there seems to be is one stupid idea after another.  Some of the ideas are stupider than one could have imagined, for example, the reintroduction of wolves, carpooling and shorter showers.  I could go on forever.  We have a Minister of State in charge of forestry who managed to plant 360 ha of forestry last year instead of the 8,000 ha mentioned in the programme for Government.  What is that, only politicians asleep at the wheel at the head of their Departments?  The forestry sector is in an absolute shambles.  The national chairman of the forestry committee of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has publicly stated such.  No notice whatsoever is being taken of big issues like that when it comes to trying to reduce carbon.  Instead, we are getting nonsensical and stupid suggestions, such as stopping people from going to the bog and saving turf or selling turf to help other people to heat and fuel their homes.</p><p>This is why my colleagues and I are anxious that the carbon taxes should no longer be applied.  A stay should be put on any further such tax.  Sensible measures that would protect our environment and help us to reduce our carbon emissions should be undertaken, but all of these pleas and requests seem to be falling on deaf ears.</p><p>To me, our farmers are the real environmentalists.  It is not someone in the Green Party or someone with a badge on his or her chest who is from an environmental agency or group.  The real environmentalists are our fishermen and farmers and the people who own land.  I use the word &quot;own&quot; in a sparing way because no one actually owns land.  Someone is the custodian of a farm if he or she is lucky enough to be given one, has the wherewithal to borrow money to buy it or has struggled and worked his or her way up.  We only own land while we are on this Earth, and we hope to pass it on to future generations in a better shape than we got it.  The same applies to fishermen.  There are traditional fishermen who have worked hard and had a hard living trying to survive on our waters.  They are the real people who understand the environment.  They are the real people who know what is good for the environment.  They do not do harm to the environment.  They do the exact opposite &ndash; they try to protect, enhance and improve it.  Look at how many farmers have been involved in agri-environmental schemes down the years, be it the various rural environment protection schemes, REPS, or any of the other schemes where they planted hedgerows, put out bird boxes, protected streams by fencing them off and put in more effluent storage facilities.  They operate their farms to the best standard they can.  What thanks do they get for it?  All they get is kicked by the Government and accused of being a part of the problem.  They are not a part of the problem.  They are the solution.  To me, they are the absolute solution.</p><p>That is why this motion is so important.  It is why we want to highlight what is happening and the folly of what is coming out of the Government and the three parties in it.  Between the lot of them, they have done more harm to the environmental movement in Ireland and throughout the rest of the world by making us a laughing stock.  For instance, we desperately need a liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility.  In 2019, Fine Gael appointed a committee to determine what we should do about energy security.  That happened under the then Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The committee said that we should have an LNG facility and that it should be non-commercial.  We have an ideal place for it in north Kerry at the Shannon Estuary in Tarbert and we want to see an LNG facility being provided there, but what the T&aacute;naiste came out with completely contradicted what his own party's committee said we should have.  Talk about mixed messages.  Last week, there was the debacle of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, going on radio to say that he would be banning the sale of turf from 1 September, the T&aacute;naiste saying the following morning that the ban was being delayed and the Minister going on radio again the next day to say that it was not being delayed.  If the Government was a dog with rabies chasing its tail, it would not appear as confused as it actually is.  It is no wonder that people have lost confidence.  I will tell the Minister of State one thing that I know for a fact.  Be it down to the carbon issue or the various workings of the Government over the past number of years &ndash; the Green Party does not come into the equation in rural Ireland &ndash; my strong message for Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il is that they have lost rural Ireland.  I mean that.  No matter what twisting and turning they do tonight with Sinn F&eacute;in's motion-----</p></speech>

My job as a public representative is to represent the people who elected me to represent them in the D&aacute;il.  I will give an example to bring it home for the Minister of State.  Does he know how many briquettes are in a bale?</p> <p>There are 22.  I am reminded of that by people in the area in which I live.  Pensioners are putting aside so many briquettes per day to heat their homes to keep themselves warm.  The fact that people are counting the number of briquettes in a bale shows how serious this issue is.</p> <p> Every rural person would point to the lack of transport infrastructure in their areas due to the failure of this and previous Governments to make such provision.  That is the reason people who live beyond the Red Cow do not have transport provision.  When the Minister of State comes back to Kerry, people in the area will want to know why they cannot buy a trailer load of turf to keep them warm.  How will he face those people and tell them that he is backing the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is for the birds?  I do not mean to be personal but the Minister is not in touch with reality.  The Minister of State is backing somebody in his party.  I want him to ask his Government colleagues to allow a free vote on this motion this evening in order that he can vote in line with the wishes of the people who elected him and put him here to represent them</p> <p>Because people have no alternatives, they buy a car and then pay increased vehicle registration tax, motor tax, a tax on motor fuel and a tax on the servicing of the car.  I am all for the environment but give me alternatives.  The Government has not given people alternatives.  They have no alternatives because all those in government want to do is increase the population in cities like Dublin, put infrastructure in place in Dublin and increase the number of Deputies serving that area where there is a higher percentage of the population in order that they can further take from the representation of rural Ireland.  That is what they are about.  It is a controlling strategy to get the Government parties back into government again.  Every person who lives in the city has family origins in the country.  We ask the people in the cities to help to protect the areas from which they come from this Government, which is out of touch with reality.  It is making its backbenchers vote for a measure with which they do not agree.  If those in government agree with it, they cannot go back and face their electorate, as the Minister of State and his backbench colleagues will have to do.</p> <p> I was interviewed on a radio programme during the week during which I was accused of not knowing what I was talking about when it came to the Government introducing energy grants.  However, when the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who was interviewed on the same programme, was questioned it turned out he did not know what he was talking about because 70% of the people in County Limerick rely on solid fuel and oil for heating but for what energy sources are the grants available?  Gas and electricity.  I called to the house of an elderly couple to sympathise with them on the death of their daughter, God rest her, who is being buried today.  I could not be there today.  They told me they were 100% reliant on oil because they are no longer physically able to bring in coal or blocks of wood to heat their home.  They needed to have their house warm because people were calling that night.  Their concern is that they are completely reliant on oil because they are not able to bring in a few blocks of wood or some coal or turf.</p> <p> A record &euro;7.1 billion in tax revenue was collected in March, which is &euro;2.4 billion, or 52.4%, more than for the same period in 2021.  Those in government have never had as much in the coffers as they have now.  However, who is being penalised all the time?  It is people from the counties.  They have no alternative but to drive a car because they do not have transport provision.  Who pays the most carbon tax?  A person in the county because he or she has no alternative.  That is why the Government is punishing them and has forgotten about them.  It must scrap carbon tax until alternatives have been put in place.  I am all for alternatives but they require investment in the counties, towns and villages in our areas.  That fact that we do not have them is due to the failure of this and previous Governments.  Sewage treatment plants have not been updated in 30 years.  It is even more of an issue now with people arriving from Ukraine and the Government not being able to house them in the counties because there is not the required infrastructure in place, which is a consequence of the failure of this and previous Governments.  I will be watching the way those in government vote on this motion this evening.  I will tell every constituency in their areas to watch what the way they voted this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="10:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700009#G00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the important carbon tax issue.  The Rural Independent Group of which I am part is the only group that has been consistently opposed to the introduction of a carbon tax.  We did not enter into playing any games or calling for a stop to be put to the increase in the tax..  We called for the whole carbon tax to be scrapped because it is an unjust tax that will cripple families.  For instance, this year alone it will cost the average household &euro;500 on top of all the other costs that are increasing.  It will cost farmers &euro;600 this year alone, and this tax will increase.  That is unfair to people who were already struggling to get by.  This imposition of this tax is a serious injustice.  Surely the Government realises that.  Many of those in government are good, strong rural Deputies who represent their constituents very well in their constituencies but there is an injustice with the imposition of this tax.  It could be done much better.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government makes claims about trying to achieve climate action targets, afforestation and planting 8,000 ha a year, and the rolling out of microgeneration schemes.  Farmers are still not able to get onto the grid, which is causing frustration.  The Government is punishing the ordinary Irish people and it is not even achieving its climate action targets, which is unfair.  I do not think it will be accepted.  We need to reconsider what else can be done and I ask the Government to do that.  There is a fairer way to do this.  The extremism coming from the Green Party in its policies shows that the party is very detached.  Having listened to what some Green Party Deputies and some climate action experts have said, it seems to me that they are coming out with all sorts of nonsense.  They would want to educate themselves about rural Ireland.  They do not understand how rural Ireland operates and how these policies impact on people.  This is certainly one policy that will disproportionately impact rural people.  I am part of this group because we stand up for the rural people and try to do our best.  We try to be honest and straight.  We are completely opposed to the carbon tax and we will stay opposed to it.  We will not be doing any U-turns and that is the way it is.  We appeal to the Minister of State and rural Deputies in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to put an end to this.  There is a better way forward whereby all the targets can be achieved in a reasonable manner without punishing people.</p>  <p>  As bad as things are now, unfortunately, there is no hope of improvement, given the provisions of the Finance Act 2020, which legislated for annual increases in the rate of carbon tax out to 2030, which will bring the tax rate to &euro;100 per tonne.  That is simply not sustainable.  It is a smash and grab of people's hard-earned incomes and it needs to be abandoned.  Even the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which is handsomely funded by the Government, recognised in a paper last year that the strategy to implement carbon taxes, which increases the price of carbon-intensive commodities, will lead to many households being worse off in an economic sense, in particular lower income households that spend a large share of their budget on energy and other emission-intensive products.  To offset this in Ireland, the ESRI says that a proportion of carbon tax revenues is used to finance transfers, but this is just needlessly creating a problem only to then go and develop extraordinary measures to solve it.  It makes no sense.</p>  <p>  The Government often asks how we can fill the gap in terms of the proposed loss of carbon tax revenue.  That is very clear and not half as complex or insolvable as the Government would have us believe.  We could save hundreds of millions, if not billions, by radically revising the measures contained in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I have repeatedly highlighted the fact that according to an analysis conducted by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the cost of implementing the Government's Bill will be &euro;20 billion each year until 2030.  This country will be destroyed economically.  It will be ruined and there will be no recovery.   I call on the Government to recognise that as a fact.  </p> <p>That comes from the IMF, not the Rural Independent Group.  All of this is for a Bill that explicitly deprioritises employment.  It is incomprehensible.  It must be rejected before irreparable damage is done and the costs skyrocket.</p> <p> An excellent and detailed series of analysis has been carried out by the Irish Climate Science Forum, which has said that it seeks to bring rationality to the current climate debate.  The forum seeks to ground its projections in less hysteria and in more solid, verifiable evidence of how we should be responding to mitigate whatever climate threats may emerge.  Are Members aware that according to Professor Michael Kelly of Cambridge University, the practical challenges of the UK pursuing its 2050 net zero carbon ambition would exceed &pound;3 trillion?  He said that this target was simply unattainable.  At least they copped on and realised that.  A parallel study for his home country, New Zealand, led to a similar conclusion, as did his recent analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s climate strategy.  According to Professor Kelly, the cost to Ireland out to 2050 of pursuing its zero carbon agenda would comfortably exceed &euro;375 billion, with a workforce required comparable in size with the health sector.  We have people languishing on hospital trolleys and waiting for operations.  That is not right.  That is just not right.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Cabinet with this information. </p></speech>

and substitute the following:  	&quot;notes that: <br /><br />&mdash; the carbon tax is not behind the current spike in energy prices as the annual rate of consumer price inflation, as measured by the European Union's (EU) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, picked up sharply over the course of last year, and stood at 6.9 per cent in March - the highest reading since the series began in 1997; <br /><br />&mdash; the key driver of this increase is increases in wholesale energy prices as a result of the rapid rebound in global demand and, more recently, the war in Ukraine; <br /><br />&mdash; in this context changes to carbon tax rates are having a relatively small impact on current energy prices, with the Budget 2022 carbon tax increase, which came into effect in October last year, adding approximately 2 cents per litre in tax to petrol and diesel; <br /><br />&mdash; the increase in rates for home heating fuels such as kerosene, gas, and solid fuels was delayed until 1st May, 2022, to mitigate against impacts during the winter heating season, and the May 2022 increase will add approximately &euro;21.56 to a 1,000-litre fill of kerosene and 20 cents (VAT inclusive) to a 12.5 kilogram bale of briquettes;<br /><br />&mdash; many of the drivers of current inflationary pressures are global in nature, and therefore Government policy is limited in what it can do to mitigate these trends; <br /><br />&mdash; the Government has nonetheless taken significant action in this regard, Budget 2022 contained a large range of measures to protect households from the rising cost of living including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million and a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million; <br /><br />&mdash; there was an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter and an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the Fuel Allowance in mid-March 2022, with a further &euro;100 again to be paid in April; <br /><br />&mdash; a further package of measures, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10th March, reducing the excise duty on petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively, and these measures are being extended to 12th October, 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO, costing &euro;97 million; <br /><br />&mdash; VAT will be reduced from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October, costing &euro;46 million, and there will also be a reduction in the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy to zero by October 2022; <br /><br />&mdash; from April all residential electricity customers will see the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200 (including Value Added Tax (VAT)) credited to their accounts; and<br /><br />&mdash; these measures more than offset the increased costs associated with the carbon tax increase; and<br /><br />recognises that: <br /><br />&mdash; carbon tax is a key pillar underpinning the Government's Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030, and reach net zero no later than 2050; <br /><br />&mdash; the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future committed to increasing carbon tax and the Finance Act 2020 provides for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 2030; <br /><br />&mdash; a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long-term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels; <br /><br />&mdash; previous analysis undertaken using SWITCH, the Economic &amp;amp; Social Research Institute tax and benefit model, to simulate the impact of the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package has confirmed that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive and households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures;<br /><br />&mdash; in the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them, and we will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; and<br /><br />&mdash; furthermore, recent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance using SWITCH has confirmed that the suite of recently announced measures more than offset the carbon tax increases for all income deciles, with the following measures being included in the analysis: <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	&mdash; the lump-sum increase in the Fuel Allowance of &euro;100; <br /><br />&mdash; a cut in the VAT rate on gas and electricity from 13.5 to 9 per cent; <br /><br />&mdash; a reduction in the PSO levy of &euro;58.57 annually; and<br /><br />&mdash; an extension of the cut in excise duty of 15 cent for diesel and 20 cent for petrol from 31st August, 2022, to the Budget Day in October; and </blockquote> </blockquote>&mdash; overall, in net terms, all households see increases in disposable income, with lower income households seeing the greatest proportional gains, reflecting the progressive nature of the measures.  </blockquote>  <p>On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Private Members' Motion tabled by the Rural Independent Group calling, among other things, on the Government to scrap the carbon tax in its entirety.  The Government proposes to reject this motion.  Carbon tax is a key pillar underpinning the Government's aim under the climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.  A further key component of the Government's carbon taxation policy is the use of revenues raised from these rate increases to fund important just transition measures.  It is important to note that a significant proportion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy-efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also in the long term provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p>The motion calls on the Government to recognise that a climate change strategy should harness the full potential of new and emerging technologies.  This is precisely what the Government is trying to achieve through the use of carbon tax funds particularly in retrofitting and new agricultural policies.  The motion also asks for a financial impact analysis on households and society.  This has already been done.  Analysis undertaken using the ESRI's tax and benefit model, SWITCH, to simulate the impact of the carbon tax increase and the compensatory welfare package has confirmed that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive.  Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all the costs of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures.  This is the financial impact.  In the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them.  We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p>The context for the recent conversations we are having on carbon tax is the pressure being brought about by the global rise in fuel costs.  More recently as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine and Russia's role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen further and these increases will feed into higher inflation over the coming months.  The energy market has been impacted by these global trends across the board.  The fossil fuels we rely on for home heating have been subject to significant price increases.  The final retail price of fuel is determined by a number of factors, including the costs of production, distribution, global market factors, international exchange rates, taxation, wholesale market contracts as well as individual retail pricing policies.  In this context, it should be noted that changes to carbon tax rates are only having a relatively small impact on current energy prices.</p></speech>

The increase in rates for home heating fuels such as kerosene, gas and solid fuels was delayed until 1 May 2022 to mitigate impacts during the winter heating season.  The May 2022 increase will add approximately &euro;21.56 to the cost of 1,000 l of kerosene.  It is clear, therefore, that carbon tax is not the cause of current energy price inflation.  Taxation on energy products is not behind current price increases.  Therefore, removing the carbon tax would serve very little purpose and have little effect in mitigating the cost of energy for consumers.  However, it would undermine the Government's climate strategy.  That is why we cannot support this motion.</p>  <p>  I will turn to the Government's response to the increase in energy prices.  Last month, the Government brought a Financial Resolution into this House providing for excise duty decreases on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.</p></speech>

These measures were VAT inclusive and were set to last until 31 August 2022.  This was estimated to cost &euro;320 million.  Last week it was announced that these measures would be extended and enhanced.  We have taken the decision to extend these reductions until 11 October 2022.  The Government is also providing for a further reduction in the excise rate on MGO, which amounts to a VAT-inclusive reduction of 3 cent effective from 1 May until 11 October.  The excise reduction extension and the further reduction in the rate applied to MGO will cost an estimated additional &euro;97 million.</p>  <p>  The Government is also taking action beyond autofuels.  From 1 May and effective until 31 October we are also providing for a reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9%, resulting in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas bills and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  This will more than offset the 1 May increase in carbon tax.  The VAT reduction will cost an estimated &euro;46 million.  These tax reductions strike the balance between passing a significant benefit to consumers while managing the tax base and respecting the constraints of the energy tax and VAT directives.  </p>  <p>  In terms of revenue impacts, the combined impact of the fuel tax reductions alone is &euro;436 million.  The Government believes that this represents a significant response by it to tackle the unprecedented challenge which we are currently facing.  However, this is not all the Government is doing.  These measures come in addition to the measures in budget 2022 and the February package of measures to alleviate the impact of the increased cost of living on households.</p> <p> In this regard, budget 2022 included a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million for this year alongside a social welfare package of over &euro;550 million, while the February additional package of measures made changes to the value of over &euro;500 million.  This package included an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200, including VAT, which is estimated to impact just over 2 million households; a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on fuel allowance, which was paid in early March to 390,000 recipients, and an additional &euro;100 payment announced in April; a temporary reduction in fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year to reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and people using public transport, which will impact approximately 800,000 daily users; a further reduction in the drug payment scheme threshold to &euro;80, which will benefit just over 70,000 families; the bringing forward of the working family payment budget increase announced on budget day from 1 June to 1 April; reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children; and a reduction in the public service obligation, PSO, levy to zero by October 2022.</p> <p> As mentioned, the evidence confirms that the measures taken by the Government to date are progressive.  In this regard, recent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance using SWITCH has confirmed that the suite of recently announced measures more than offset the carbon tax increases for all income deciles.  The lump sum increase in the fuel allowance of &euro;100, a cut in the VAT rate on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9%, a reduction in the PSO levy of &euro;58.57 annually and an extension of the cut in excise duty of 15 cent for diesel and 20 cent for petrol from 31 August to budget day in October were included in the analysis.</p> <p> Additionally, the Government continues to drive public investment in energy efficiency with an overall investment of &euro;267 million this year, &euro;118 million of which is allocated to making homes of those at risk of energy poverty warmer, healthier and cheaper to heat.  In response to increasing energy costs, new grant rates have been introduced that will cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of attic and wall insulation.  These are very cost-effective upgrade measures that can be deployed rapidly and at scale this year.  The typical cost savings from cavity wall insulation is &euro;300 per year on a home heating bill.</p> <p> Cumulatively, the Government has spent approximately &euro;2 billion on additional cost of living and welfare supports since budget 2022.</p> <p> The Government is very conscious of the negative impact that the rapid rise in consumer prices is having on society.  We know things are difficult for many.  This is why the financial measures I have outlined have been introduced in budget 2022 and in the months since.</p> <p> The Government remains committed to its current policy of carbon taxation.  The carbon tax is critical to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring a just transition to a decarbonised society.  We therefore cannot support a proposal to scrap carbon tax.  Doing so would not make a significant impact in the context of the current rise in prices and instead would leave those who rely on the welfare support measures that are funded by the carbon tax worse off.  It would also jeopardise the suite of measures that are central to our emissions reduction goals.  The Government believes that this House should reject this Private Members' motion on the removal of the carbon tax and instead support the Government's countermotion on this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister wants to carry on his crusade of increasing the carbon tax and penalise many sectors and people all over the country, especially in rural Ireland.  Sadly, I believe he is not doing any good, only harm, in Government.  I was brought up being told that if you cannot do any good for people, please do not hurt or harm them.</p>  <p>  The understanding was, in the first place, that the carbon tax on diesel, petrol and kerosene was a measure by the Government to coax people away from those fuels and types of vehicles to electric vehicles and to use electric heating in their homes.  However, the Government does not have the infrastructure in place for electric cars and it certainly does not have the facility to generate extra electricity.  The Minister has to realise that the savage global increase in the cost of fuels in the past six months makes fuel already more expensive than people can bear or afford.  This carbon tax has not one iota of an effect on reducing emissions.  The Government must realise that enough is enough and there is a place called stop.  It has to forget about another increase in the carbon tax.</p>  <p>  This carbon tax increase will mean that car users will pay more than &euro;10 more to fill their tanks.  Lorry drivers will pay &euro;80 or &euro;100 in carbon tax to fill their tanks on top of excise and VAT.  I fear the haulage industry will grind to a halt.  Farmers and agricultural contractors are now being asked to pay &euro;50 to &euro;70 per day in carbon tax alone to keep their tractors going and do the vital seasonal work that has to be done to ensure a fodder supply for our animals and that crops are sown and reaped to have food for all the people of our country.</p>  <p>  From 1 May, the carbon tax increase on top of the current carbon tax will mean people will have to pay &euro;106.07 more in carbon tax on a 900 l tank of home heating oil.  The Minister of State said the Government is giving money back to the people.  What is it giving back to the people in respect of rural public roads?  It gave money for 12 schemes out of 676 schemes that are on a list below in Kerry.  People are banging in and out of potholes and ruts in roads with tractors and cars.  That is what the Government gave them back out of all the tax they are paying.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said the Government is giving more out in fuel allowance, but people on benefit payments do not qualify for any fuel allowance.  People on jobseeker&rsquo;s, illness, enhanced illness, occupational injuries, maternity or disabled benefits, or a pensioner living with a cancer patient on illness benefit, will not qualify for the fuel allowance.  Yet the Government wants to cripple these people further by increasing the carbon tax for heating their homes and driving their cars.  Shame on the Minister.</p>  <p>  This Government has made no attempt in providing alternative energy since it started.  It has closed down Bord na M&oacute;na.  The cost of electricity has gone up every day and there is no real alternative, only drawing coal from Russia to keep Moneypoint going.  There are incentives in place for private sources to supply energy to the grid.  There are several options that could be explored, such as solar panels, and people could be exempted from tax on those.  I ask the Minister to ensure that, if he opens up that scheme, he will not raid people&rsquo;s properties that are supplying carbon tax.</p>  <p>  The Minister crossed the line with turf.  He went far beyond the line when he suggested that people should stop cutting and selling turf.  It is all the same because when you mention turf in rural Ireland, you are hurting everyone in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  We had a vote on the carbon tax a couple of weeks ago.

Everything the Rural Independent Group said when it was introduced has come true.  We said it would price car fuel and home heating oil through the roof, and it did.  We said electricity bills would go through the roof, and they have.  There is so more - I could go on for the day.</p>  <p>  What saddens me is that it was a Green Party dream to grab this money from the rural people for their little pet projects, mainly in our capital.  They were aided and abetted by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and a few nod-and-wink independents.  Even then we were making it very clear that this would hurt hard-working people, mainly in rural areas but also urban areas.  One cock-up after another has been announced by the Green Party as it dishes out the carbon tax money on its pet projects, such as &euro;2.4 million on three electric buses in the capital, while rural areas are seeing poorer public transport delivery as Connecting Ireland is turning out to be disconnecting Ireland.  Some 20% delivery and a proposed 50% decrease in public transport cost for our youth is now only being delivered in the capital, as rural commercial operators cannot deliver it outside the capital.  It is another farce and kick in the teeth to those who within their parties support the carbon tax.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies come into the D&aacute;il day after day shouting against any carbon tax increases.  However, they wrapped their arms around the Green Party the first day and voted for the increase.  They should stop running with the hare and chasing with the hound.  They cannot have everything.  Sinn F&eacute;in is either for carbon tax or against it.  When it supports it, it must accept that it will inflict huge pain on the ordinary people of this country.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies should now come out and accept their errors by supporting the Rural Independent Group.</p>  <p>  People are suffering severely because of the Government's decisions.  They are in their homes, unable to turn on their heating because they cannot afford to do so.</p> <p>Our elderly, our youth and the sick will all perish with the cold in their homes this winter thanks to the Government supporting this shocking tax, which has been disguised in the name of so-called climate change.  You cannot buy a bag of coal with the price of it in this country.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, aided and abetted by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, will not allow us to buy a bag of turf now.  Next, it will be a bit of timber.</p> <p> All I am listening to on the radio and in the D&aacute;il is waffle.  Last Saturday morning, RT&Eacute; had an expert on who was more like a comedian.  He said that burning wet turf was bad for the environment.  What in God's name is wrong with the man?  No one in rural Ireland ever burned wet turf.  In God's name, why do the television stations not have people on who know what they are talking about?  I could not believe my ears last night when I heard a Deputy say we should be mining turf.  If he was in a Popeye comedy sketch, he would not come up with that kind of comment.  Another Deputy from the same party falls over herself at every opportunity to shout down fossil fuels.  I see her driving a diesel-guzzling van every day coming and going from the D&aacute;il.  It is the same with so many other Deputies.  They say one thing and do another.  They expect that people will not see and think they will get away with it.</p> <p> The Rural Independent Group is the only group the public can rely on.  In a recent poll I carried out in the constituency of Cork South-West, I asked my constituents if carbon tax should continue.  An emphatic 85% said "No way".  It was a straight "Yes" or "No" poll, but many went on to vent their anger and the reasons this cruel and hurtful tax should be stopped.  I promise that 85% of the people of west Cork that I will fight tooth and nail to get rid of the carbon tax, lock, stock and barrel.  Imagine the promise that was made in the D&aacute;il for its introduction.  Now we see carbon tax raking in &euro;652 million in 2021.  Only &euro;130 million of that was ring-fenced.  The rest went into the big black hole that is our Government.  We want to know where the rest of this money is and why it has it not gone to the climate action Government Deputies are shouting about, rather than wind projects in their constituencies so they can get themselves across the line in the next election.  You will not succeed because the people are waiting out there for you, lads.</p> <p> Imagine our Taoiseach went to Europe a few weeks ago to get a so-called VAT reduction on fuel only for the other European leaders to hear that he came back here and proposed an increase in the carbon tax on fuel so the Government can grab more tax again from the most vulnerable in our society.  Look at the haulage companies, farmers, contractors and boat owners.  There all see that the most valuable machines they have on their properties are the tractor, lorry or boat that is parked up.</p> <p> For some time, I have been saying that the Government has been grinding this great country to a halt as it has destroyed our great economy.  Some farm contractors are facing wipeout.  One of them, in west Cork, told me that his costs have increased by &euro;140,000 this year.  No one can sustain these hikes in costs.</p></speech>

I was very interested to listen to the Minister of State's response.  It was useful also to be able to read it and the justification for the carbon tax.  The term &quot;behavioural change&quot; is not used once.  When the carbon tax was introduced behavioural change was the entire premise on which it was sold.  It has now switched from being a behavioural change mechanism because it clearly does not work.  If simply increasing the prices of carbon-based products and forcing people to change worked, there would have been a huge shift in the past six months.  Instead, it has been turned into a revenue-raising argument by the defenders of the carbon tax.  That does a huge disservice to climate action and is inherently unfair.</p><p>The Green Party principle, which has been adopted by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il and was articulated by other Members of the Opposition last night, has equated climate action with punitive measures on ordinary workers and families.  There is a suggestion, as Members of the Government have told us in D&aacute;il debates and in TV and radio studios, that if we oppose penalising workers and families through measures like the carbon tax, we are opposed to climate action.  There are others in the Opposition who grasp on to that argument and very cynically equate carbon taxes with climate action.  We heard the argument that anyone who supports climate action targets <i>ipso facto</i>supports carbon taxes.  That argument has been repeated this morning but it is not the case.  I will say again that my fundamental and very strongly held belief is that it is possible to reach our carbon targets without giving people who have no alternative a kicking every single time.</p><p>To deal with the big issues of the day, be it housing, health or climate action, we must agree what needs to be done and set that out.  We know what needs to be done in terms of renewables, retrofitting and transitioning away from fossil fuels.  One then sets out how it is funded.  What the Government has done, however, is turn that on its head.  It has said we will charge people who do not have alternatives for using their cars to travel to work or for burning home heating oil and, at some point in the future, we will let people know how people will be allowed to transition.  Fundamentally, what is wrong with this is that by those actions the Government is undermining the potential for us to reach our climate action targets because it is undermining support for the very concept of climate action among those who want to be partners.</p><p>This is what is happening.  Next week, in the middle of a cost-of-living emergency, the Government plans to increase the cost of home heating oil.  People who are at the pin of their collars will be expected to pay more to heat their homes.  They do not have any alternatives.  That is not climate action and it will do nothing for the environment.  All it will do is to penalise those who use home heating oil, in the same way that increasing the cost of motor fuel does nothing for somebody who has to drive to work and who cannot afford a new car.  The only thing that increasing the cost of fuel does is make their lives more difficult.  Again, that is unfair.  To my mind, and to paraphrase the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, there is a better, fairer and more credible way of achieving our climate action goals.  This Government and the cheerleaders of carbon taxes have consistently undermined the very objective to which they say they are committed.</p></speech>

The figure is probably higher in County Donegal.  Someone looking to fill a tank with 1,000 l of oil would have paid about &euro;600 just over a year ago.  Today, that person will pay more than double that.  The tank must be filled a number of times every year.  When households are already struggling to get by I do not need to explain the impact this is having on families in the rural west and north west.  I can speak with absolute clarity about what is happening in Donegal.</p>  <p>  What has the Government done to assist with that huge burden?  Absolutely nothing.  We asked it to reduce excise duty on home heating oil but it would not do it.  The Government is now insisting on increasing the carbon tax in the next week.  That is the context and there is anger in rural Ireland.  There has been a significant increase in the price of coal, on which nothing has been done for working families.  The final straw has been the issue of turf.  This affects 4% of homes, which is a small number.  The people affected are often older and living in isolated areas and do not have much money.  Turf is the one source of fuel that has not significantly increased in cost, yet now is the time the Government has chosen to go after them.  This is after doing nothing for rural families when it came to increases in the prices of home heating oil and, to a lesser albeit significant extent, coal.</p>  <p>  This is how people heat their homes.  The Government has done nothing to give people proper financial assistance to change or engage in retrofitting.  There has been nothing in the years since the carbon tax was introduced.  The carbon tax was supposed to penalise people who have not changed direction.  How can people change direction when they cannot afford to and the infrastructure to do so is not there?  Every time, people are given the stick and never the carrot in order to achieve objectives that people agree we need to move towards for the future.  That is the problem.  It is the cause of the anger in rural Ireland and in counties such as Donegal.  The issue of turf, as I say, is the straw that is going to break the camel's back.  The Government is going to have to back down on the issue.  It will have to reconsider its approach with respect to home heating oil and the imposition of carbon tax increases at the worst possible time.</p></speech>

Considerable efforts must be made.  However, everybody must be supported to help make those changes and the regressive carbon tax falls short in that regard.  I thank the Rural Independent Group for giving us the time to discuss this issue.</p>  <p>  Is the carbon tax designed to take into account energy poverty?  The answer is a simple "No".  Yet the people who suffer from energy poverty are the very ones who are paying disproportionate amounts of their incomes on carbon tax when compared with those who actually emit the most carbon.  The carbon footprint of the top 10% is eight times greater than that of the bottom 10% but there is no sense of proportion in the carbon tax.  That is one of the reasons I said during Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on rising fuel costs and the prohibition on the sale of turf yesterday, and I do so again, that this Government is undermining the climate action message with a fixation on punitive measures.  Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers claim they are waiting for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come up with new proposals.  That is their way of not supporting Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.  They are using that claim as an excuse and as political cover to kick it into the future.</p>  <p>  There is also the manner in which the measures are presented.  The amendments tabled by the Minister for Finance are prime examples.  One point made by the Minister is that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long term, provide support against the fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  This is misleading.  It does not represent climate action but climate mitigation.  This is how the Government's focus on penalising households rather than supporting them to make the change will result in the money being spent on fossil fuels.  What about our carers who take so much pressure off the health service but many of whom cannot get the fuel allowance?  What does that say about not leaving behind anyone in energy poverty?  For the Minister to say this is part of the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society is disingenuous at best.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in would establish an expert group on energy poverty to identify those living in energy poverty, whether on the fuel allowance or not, and develop policies to support them in a just transition and lift people out of fuel poverty.  In line with this, we have proposed an increase of &euro;125 million for retrofitting in 2022, which would be funded via other tax increases and not carbon tax increases.  A targeted scheme should have been introduced.  That amount is &euro;44 million more than the Government has committed.  The punitive approach by the Government to climate action undermines climate action measures.</p></speech>

It is truly hard to fathom why the Government remains so wedded to this idea.  We were told originally that this tax was a revenue-raising measure and intended to provide an incentive for people to move away from fossil fuels but incentives only work where alternatives are in place.  This argument has been dropped since energy costs began to spiral.  We are now told that revenue is needed for environmental measures.  People across the State and in rural Ireland know we must tackle climate change and biodiversity loss.  They have played, and will continue to play, their parts.  Our approach needs to be fair, equitable and capable of delivering the change we need.  To tax petrol when people have no alternative transport and to tax home heating oil when it is the only option for many people is absolutely not the answer.</p>  <p>  This Government is out of touch with what is happening in rural Ireland and Government Deputies know that to be the case.  That is why they are racing around Mayo and telling people they do not believe in the carbon tax increase.  Those Deputies are either in government or not.  They have an opportunity to vote against this tax.  What they are doing to people in rural Ireland is outrageous and they need to stop.  It is not that people in rural Ireland do not play their part in climate action.  In fact, since 1997 and even before that, people in rural Ireland have more than played their part.  They do it in designations.  They were promised compensation by Government after Government but never got it.  They do not trust Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party.  The idea that the Green Party made the Government take these steps does not wash in rural Ireland any more.  The Government needs to be called out and I am doing that.  Government Deputies must show which side they are on.  They are either in government or not.</p></speech>

Rising prices of petrol and diesel have wiped away families' disposable income in an instant, condemning lower income households to a meagre existence.  For months now, Sinn F&eacute;in has been warning the Government about how working families are being snowed under by financial strains.  Rents, the cost of childcare and energy costs are skyrocketing and becoming the dearest in Europe.  What does the Government do?  It decides to increase carbon tax in May and ban the sale and commercial use of turf.</p>  <p>  This Government is failing to see that rural Ireland operates on a completely different plateau than large urban areas and cities.  The carbon tax, the Government argues, is supposed to encourage people to use alternatives but in reality, no alternatives are available.  The Government is, as the saying goes, putting the cart before the horse.  Let us take transport as an example.  Does the Minister realise that public transport is non-existent in most rural communities, including my constituency in County Wexford where almost 75% of people live in rural settings?  The closure of rural post offices, Garda stations, local shops, credit unions and rural banks is evidence enough that our country way of life is being undermined by these thoughtless policies that have not been rural-proofed.  What do we say to families who are already struggling to make ends meet at the end of their working week?  How can we tell them to use life-changing alternatives without a fair transition or supporting plan?  On top of that, purchasing an electric vehicle is dearer than a monthly rent or mortgage repayment.  It is way out of reach of most ordinary families, particularly in Wexford.</p>  <p>  The climate crisis is real.  The science is there.  However, we must progress our climate protection measures on the principle of a just transition and transparent and rural-proofed supporting policies.  We cannot leave low-income families, pensioners and vulnerable members of our communities behind.  The motion before us makes a valid point about fuel allowance and fuel poverty.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have outlined several ways to tackle these issues.  Take the latest turf ban fiasco.  The Government should have identified those who are dependent on turf and at risk of fuel poverty and supported them in transition.  This is the very definition of a just transition and just one option the Government has ignored.</p>  <p>  I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion and giving us an opportunity to speak on these important issues.</p></speech>

It should not take five minutes to point out the fact that everybody accepts what needs to happen in opposition to climate change.  We can all see the failures involved.  If carbon tax is intended as a means of changing behaviour, it has not succeeded.  That narrative has stopped.  We are being told about how much is being ring-fenced from the carbon tax.  I heard that for every &euro;100 raised through the carbon tax, approximately &euro;14 is ring-fenced.  We have all seen, on some level, a supercharged carbon tax in the context of the inflation with which we are dealing.  There were already supply chain issues before the start of the criminal war by Russia in Ukraine.  However, the fact is that we keep using terms such as "just transition" without getting down to the brass tacks.  We are talking here about people who are struggling to pay for home heating oil.  There are people who remain reliant on turf.  We have not put the pieces in place to carry out any element of a transition, just or otherwise.</p>  <p>  These difficulties are common across Europe.  People see that climate change is being associated with putting pressure on individuals through additional payments.  Those pressures are falling on those who cannot afford to pay.  If opposing climate change is going to be associated extra taxation and more pressure on those who are in poverty, it is destined to fail.</p>  <p>  We all know where the game-changing pieces are.  We know the change needs to be done at governmental level.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We know the Government has to do the heavy lifting.  The one thing we learned during the pandemic is that the State is necessary and is sometimes the only institution that can step in and do the necessary business.  It will be states that will have to step up to the plate to carry out these sorts of actions, no more than to deal with the humanitarian crisis caused by this war.  I accept that it is not going to be easy but we need to look after people properly and to put in place infrastructure that is fit for purpose.  Carbon taxes will not do the business.  Behavioural change is not happening because people do not have the alternatives they need.</p> <p> We really need to get the wind energy piece in place.  All of us, or at least a considerable number of us, get that we have the opportunity to become a superpower with regard to renewables and wind energy.  On some days, you only have to put your head out the window to realise that.  We are an island and have certain advantages, including our capacity for offshore generation, but we are not where we need to be.  We know the difficulties we have with regard to planning.  I accept that there are now frameworks in place and that some of what is necessary to develop this sector will finally be in place by the end of this year but the fact is that we still have major clogs and difficulties with regard to planning across the board.  The Attorney General is looking at some of these issues.  There are issues with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and judicial reviews.  Regardless of the rights and wrongs of these operations and anything that needs to be changed, it is obvious that we need to provide resources as these bodies are part of the necessary infrastructure.  We need to ensure we can deliver upon our plans.  </p> <p> People have spoken about the difficulties we have in respect of home heating oil, particularly in my constituency where it is used by a considerable number of people.  However, there are also other issues that need to be looked at.  Carlinn Hall in Dundalk has a gas-powered communal heating system.  This was meant to be powered by biofuels.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and others on this matter.  They are to follow up with officials because this system has been utterly inefficient.  In the long term, it will need to be changed and improved but, at this point in time, there are people who are suffering as a result of gas prices.  There are no protections for them as domestic users.  Beyond that, they are suffering because of the inefficiency of this system.  We need rules and regulations that ensure there will not be further cases of this kind but we also need to give protection to the people affected at this point in time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700014#M00200"><p>On two occasions in the last few days, I have witnessed very disturbing sights while I have been in checkout queues in supermarkets.  I have experienced people simply not having enough money to pay for all of the shopping in their trolleys.  I have seen this with my own two eyes.  It is disturbing.  There is no dignity in this.  It saddens and shames us as a society.  I have witnessed people having to put shopping back and having those difficult conversations with checkout staff.  That is the sad reality for far too many people in this country this very day and week.  It is an experience that is recounted to me continuously in my constituency clinics and constituency office.  It is sadly all too reminiscent of experiences many of us had in our families in the 1980s and early 1990s before the Irish economy took off.</p>  <p>  We know we are experiencing an almost once-in-a-generation spike in inflation and rise in the cost of living and that these are not impacting on everybody equally.  The Government will say that it has done all it can to mitigate the impact of the rising cost of living on those experiencing it most adversely but the truth is - and this is not just a clich&eacute; or trope that is usually trotted out by the Opposition as the Government routinely claims - that there is more the Government can do.  We know that many aspects of the cost-of-living crisis are beyond the control of the Government.  That is the truth and we all accept that.  However, the Government has not used every tool available to it to address the rising cost of living and the adverse impact this is having on those who are on low incomes, those who live in rural areas and those who are not sufficiently covered by the social protection system.  The signature measure of &euro;200 off energy bills is a case in point.  The bulk of this money was directed at those who, it can be argued, do not need it most and have not felt the pinch in the way that those who most need support have.  This is what the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said, so the Minister of State does not need to trust me on that point.  The additional measures the Government needs to be planning ahead of budget 2023 need to be properly targeted to ensure that those who need the most support get the most support from this State and Government.</p>  <p>  In truth, Ireland needs a pay rise.  We are a low-pay economy.  Some 23% of all Irish workers are considered to be on low pay.  Those in the teeth of this cost-of-living crisis are the low-paid and older citizens.  We should use pay policy and the tools at the disposal of the Government to help people to make their income go further.  What do I mean by that?  I mean the Government using the resources available to it cleverly to, for example, reduce health costs by introducing free GP care for all children.  This has been promised for a long time but it will only be delivered for the under-sevens in the coming months.  I also mean investing in something for which my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has been calling for many years, that is, &euro;20 million a year to ensure that schoolbooks are free for all children going to primary school and &euro;20 million to ensure that schoolbooks are free for children going to secondary school.  The Government has made some announcements with regard to access to public transport but more needs to be done and many of the announced initiatives have been delayed.  One of the key things we need to do is to expand eligibility for the fuel allowance.  In the context of the cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing today, it is criminal that so many people are outside of the fuel allowance threshold.  As everybody in this House knows, that means they are also outside of the eligibility criteria for the warmer homes schemes.</p>  <p>  We should not pretend that the motion before us today is motivated by a deep-seated concern for the working class, child poverty or the elimination and obliteration of fuel poverty or by a passion for making Ireland a country that is much fairer and more equal.  We know that the Rural Independent Group opposes carbon tax and carbon pricing.  It always has and has made no secret of it.  In a way, that is fair enough.  It is honest and upfront about that.  There are other groups - the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, for example - which want to have it every way.  They want to have it both ways, at the very least.  If it was poverty that was keeping members of the Rural Independent Group awake at night, they would be arguing for the redistribution of wealth in this deeply unequal society, day in and day out, in this Chamber and elsewhere.  They would not, as they routinely do, oppose increases in the national minimum wage to increase the incomes of the lowest paid people in this country.  Indeed, some of the signatories of this particular motion even argued, in the context of debate on last year's Finance Act, that the universal social charge should be dramatically reduced, if not abolished.  That would have been an assault on lower paid people in this country who depend on the public services the USC supports day in and day out.</p></speech>

We are in the midst of an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis, with inflation running at nearly 7%, the highest it has been for more than 20 years.  The carbon tax is not the predominant cause of this inflationary spike.  We must be clear about that, but carbon tax adds an additional cost to energy prices.  The coming increase next week will add approximately &euro;17 to annual gas bills and it will add an extra &euro;20 to a fill of home heating oil.  It will not add further costs to petrol or diesel prices.  These additional costs will not be felt by everybody in society equally.  There are many well-paid people in the country who will not notice these increases at all.  However, those who are desperately trying to get by and who strictly account for every single cent in their weekly or monthly budgets will feel this increase and they will wonder where the money to pay it will come from.</p>  <p>  This includes people like renters, who have already seen their rents skyrocket wildly.  This morning we learned from Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, that the cost of new tenancies increased by 9% nationally in the last quarter of 2021.  Based on these figures, renters in Dublin today will pay &euro;12,000 more in rent per annum than they did in 2011.  That is &euro;12,000, which is just the annual increase.  The average annual amount they will spend on rent in Dublin is nearly &euro;24,000.  For context, workers on the minimum wage &ndash; a paltry &euro;10.50 per hour &ndash; earn just &euro;21,840 in a year.  How are workers on the minimum wage, and there are plenty of them, supposed to survive when average rental costs now exceed their annual gross pay?  Rents are unsustainable, not just in Dublin but throughout the country.  According to the RTB, rents in Roscommon increased by a whopping 25% in the fourth quarter of last year, rents in Waterford were up 24%, rents in Longford were up 20%, rents in Westmeath were up 18%, rents in Donegal were up 17%, and rents in Clare were up 16%.  I could go on.  There were double digit rental increases in 14 counties in the final quarter of last year.</p>  <p>  It is not just renters who are being relentlessly squeezed.  Families are struggling to pay childcare costs that are equivalent to their monthly mortgage or rent payments.  Increases in the price of food are set to add an average of an additional &euro;780 to bills over the next 12 months.  Transport costs have risen by nearly 20% in the past year and energy prices have increased by unprecedented amounts, with some providers seeking increases of nearly 50% in recent weeks.  These latest energy price increases are coming less than six months after most providers increased bills by up to 30% last year.  The cost of home heating oil, in particular, has risen hugely.  Home heating oil is up by nearly 130% in the past year alone.  In just one month, February, prices increased by nearly 60%.  This is not sustainable.</p>  <p>  There is a regional dimension to this.  The impact of this inflationary spiral in energy costs is uneven across the country.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in the Border region, 66% of households use home heating oil, and in the west of the country, 58% of households use home heating oil.  However, just 8% of homes in Dublin use home heating oil because most people are connected to gas networks.  This must be acknowledged by the Government and to date it has not been.  Prices throughout the country are soaring and it is the job of the Government to mitigate those price increases for those who can least afford to bear them, those on low and middle incomes.</p>  <p>  Those on low pay spend a disproportionate amount of their incomes on necessities like food and fuel costs and they must be insulated from price increases they cannot sustain.  To date, regrettably, the Government has not done this.  It has been slow to act, and when it finally did, the measures it adopted were insufficient and not adequately targeted.  It failed to broaden the eligibility for the fuel allowance.  This means, for instance, families in receipt of the working family payment have no entitlement to the payment, nor do carers.  It failed to increase core social welfare rates despite the fact core rates have increased by just a miserly &euro;5 in three years.  People on fixed incomes, like elderly people on pensions, are particularly vulnerable to price shocks, and it bears repeating that the Government has seen fit to increase their core payment by just &euro;5 in three years.  Workers on low and middle incomes are also struggling to get by as prices rocket.  The Government could have put &euro;300 back into the pockets of individual workers earning less than &euro;50,000 using a refundable tax credit.  This was suggested by the Social Democrats but the Government refused to listen.  It preferred to give households a &euro;200 universal electricity credit, which many people still have not received, by the way, so that millionaires got the same benefit as those on low incomes.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, or whoever is stepping in for him, will likely tell us all about the retrofitting programme and what a difference that will make.  The reality of that programme is delays of two years and more for the warmer homes scheme.  That is the initiative that is supposed to be targeted at those who need it most, low-income households at risk of fuel poverty.  How can the Minister continue to crow about the programme's success when it is failing those who need it most?  He and the Government need to get real.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats are aware we are facing a climate emergency that not only threatens our lives but the sustainability of life on this planet.  We have just eight years to halve our emissions, but under this Government, emissions are going up, not decreasing.  That is not my opinion; it is according to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Government must take radical action to reduce emissions.  What is happening instead?  Three huge data centres on the east coast and midlands have received planning permission in recent days alone.  Meanwhile, the Government failed to support a Social Democrats motion calling for a moratorium on new data centres last year.  It cannot continue to talk out of both sides of its mouth on climate change.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats believe, given the impending climate catastrophe, that the carbon tax is necessary but the money raised must be ring-fenced and used for those who can least withstand soaring energy prices.  The Government has yet to publish a detailed breakdown of how the carbon tax collected every year is spent and where the money is going.  It must do that as a matter of urgency in the interests of transparency.  It cannot simply impose a carbon tax and use its existence as evidence that it is taking the climate emergency seriously.  That is not fooling anyone.  All of the Government&rsquo;s policies, in every Department, need to be climate-proofed and that is not happening.  The evidence is our consistent failure to meet our climate targets.</p>  <p>  Time is running out for us, for our children, for our grandchildren and for the planet.  Enough of the sermonising and the platitudes from the Government benches, please.  Reaching our climate targets will not be easy and no politician should claim it will be.  There will have to be widespread changes in the way all of us live and that will not be easy, but it is the job of the Government to ensure that, as we make this transition, the most vulnerable in our society are protected to the greatest extent possible.  It is failing at that job and that is being felt in the homes of people throughout the country, be it in rural or city environments.  That failure cannot continue.</p></speech>

I always do this because any debate or conversation about climate change and climate policies has to start by recognising the stark facts that are constantly being put in front of us by the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and the conference of the parties, COP.</p> <p>However, we seem to be able as an economy and society to ignore them and continue on our merry way.  The amendment states:</p><blockquote>	- recent extreme weather events are a warning that climate change is accelerating, its impacts worsening, and its consequences are increasingly disastrous for large parts of the earth, its human population and all life there on;<br /><br />- these ... [extremes] include, record temperature extremes ... unprecedented temperature anomalies at both poles [So that is both Antarctica and the Arctic] and ongoing droughts, floods and storms affecting millions of people;<br /><br />- current polices, based on market mechanisms, private corporations investment decisions, and carbon taxes on individual consumption are failing and will continue to fail to limit fossil fuel related emissions; and<br /><br />- attempts to defer action on the premise of future technological advances are fatally flawed [All we ever hear is the phrase &quot;future technological advances&quot;.  We do not have them yet but we are completely dependent on having them in the future] and have been warned against by eminent academic and climate experts, and further run the risk of delaying real action until catastrophic warming becomes irreversible. </blockquote> <p>That is the beginning of our amendment.<br/><br/>There has been a pretty large and, by some standards, quite successful campaign by the Green Party, not just here but internationally, and others to say that if you are serious about tackling climate change, then you have to support carbon taxes on ordinary people's consumption, to say the academic debate is settled, to present carbon taxes and their impact as a success and a fact, and to dismiss any alternative.  When I say this has been a successful campaign, I mean it has been successful among academics, policy advisers and most political parties in this House, but in working-class areas, which are the type of area I represent, and in rural Ireland, the campaign is far from accepted or successful.<br/><br/>We in People before Profit are serious about climate change and doing the right things to tackle it, but we oppose carbon taxes.  In fact, in terms of the climate action plan of 2018, People before Profit issued a minority report on it and went into some detail as to why we do not believe carbon taxes on ordinary people will reduce emissions and, therefore, cannot be the only tool in the box of measures that attempt to deal with climate change.  Carbon tax is based on a fallacy and a neoclassical understanding of economics.  It seems to be acceptable to the fossil fuel industrialists.  Some of the biggest oil companies in the world think carbon tax is great because it does not affect them, just ordinary people.  It also puts the most polluting firms in the world first and before the needs of ordinary people.  It offers the illusion of action to reduce emissions while permitting business as usual for the entire corporate sector.  What it does not do is reduce emissions on the scale needed and in the time we have left to save the planet from being uninhabitable.<br/><br/>Despite reams of academic texts suggesting or hinting otherwise, particularly in terms of where most studies have been done, such as in Norway or Canada, specifically British Columbia, where emissions in any jurisdiction have been reduced, there have been attempts to claim this as proof of the success of carbon taxes whereas there have been other reasons behind the reduction.  For example, in one of the studies that was done in British Columbia the reduction in emissions occurred in the middle of a recession.  Other reasons included an alternative source of energy or fuel being brought in, or offshoring of the industry to another country, or offsetting, which is never really accounted for when people put forward these arguments as proof in other jurisdictions.  A carbon tax sows the illusion that what is needed is a change in the personal behaviour of individuals, but that pushes responsibility away from the biggest polluters on the planet - the fossil fuel industry and the plastics and related industries.<br/><br/>Carbon tax has shifted the policy debate and that is why we constantly debate the matter in this House.  The focus and the plans to deal with climate change are away from a systemic approach or any analysis of the underlying reasons CO<sub>2</sub>emissions are increasing globally.  Since Kyoto, we have pumped 60% more CO<sub>2</sub>into the atmosphere.  That happened not because we did not impose high enough carbon taxes on ordinary people but because the major fossil fuel corporations continued to explore, mine and burn fossil fuels while amassing vast fortunes and profits.  It happened because no one challenged the logic of the capitalist system and its endless drive to expand, accumulate profits and create new markets, an incessant drive to expand that was fuelled by the fossil fuel industry.<br/><br/>Now, as we look into the abyss and at the latest IPCC report, which tells us that the window to avoid climate catastrophe is rapidly closing, we are again offered increases in carbon taxes as a solution, a tough decision and a mature political policy.  It is a fraud; it does not work.  If the Green Party and the other Government parties do not understand that, ordinary people do instinctively.  In my life I have found ordinary people are often way ahead of leaders and political advisers.  They know it is a con.  They know it is to hike up energy and fuel prices for them while at the same time there is no problem with planning to locate a liquefied natural gas, LNG, operation in Shannon or elsewhere.<br/><br/>In France, the yellow vest movement exploded not because they were climate deniers or because of Russian machinations but because they knew this was a con to drive up fuel prices while at the same time shutting down and reducing rail services people needed and forcing the retirement age up to 68.  There are always economic reasons governments decide to pass on the responsibility to ordinary people and not look at what is happening at the top.  As I always say in this Chamber, the fish rots from the head.  If we do not look at what happens at the top of society, then we will not deal with how things need to change at the bottom.  I believe things need to change.  We need to be all honest with each other.  Whether we drive diesel vans or are some of the biggest corporate landlords in this House, we need to be honest with each other.  While doing so, we need not to deny the facts of climate change but to demand support for those of us who say we need to reduce consumption and that giving permission to more data centres or LNG operations to locate off our coast is much more damaging to our environment and possibilities for the future than arguing against the increases in carbon taxes, which, by the way, I remind everybody, although everybody knows this, are coming at a point in time when the cost-of-living increases are crucifying ordinary people.  If the carbon taxes increase on 1 May, that will just embitter and embolden people who want to fight back and say they are not taking this any more.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope we see, and I will help to advocate and plan for, feet on the streets in response to the rise in the cost of living in the same way we saw feet on the streets in response to the attempt to introduce water charges or, indeed, to force women to live in the dark ages.  These are things ordinary people can change, but they can only do it together in big numbers.  Us standing here in the House is not going to make all that much difference except that we can point out the contradiction between going after the ordinary people while allowing corporations and fossil fuel industries completely off the hook.</p></speech>

There is increased resistance to the idea of imposing a carbon tax on people who are not seeing the benefit and will not see a benefit for the foreseeable future.  I am very concerned this plan to transition us away from fossil fuels to green energy and the elimination of the fossil fuels is in tatters.  I say that because there is no joined-up thinking and there is no plan where we can see the annual targets that may be achieved.  We have something that will be achieved in the next ten to 15 years but we do not know how we are going to get there.  There is no step-by-step approach.</p>  <p>  The deep retrofit scheme is still not in place and will not be in place until the end of this year.  We all know that, as part of the warmer homes schemes, people must wait up to two years to get a survey done on their house, and these are the most vulnerable people who get the fuel allowance.  In my own constituency, that the ESB is decommissioning a 49.9 MW wind farm at Derrybrien, which has generated green electricity to serve 44,000 homes since 2006, is something we need to examine very closely.  I ask the Government to intercede and bring in emergency legislation to keep that vital green energy going.  We have made a mess of it between planning and substitute consents.  We need emergency planning to get that right.  We need to hold on to what we have.  At the same time while we are losing that green energy, we want to tax people in the constituency of Galway East for the fact they have no alternative.</p>  <p>  I will give another fine example of how the plan is not working.  A large number of people in this country have invested in installing microgeneration in their homes.</p> <p>They did so on the premise and the promise from Government that they would receive payment for any excess electricity that went back into the grid.  They were supposed to get paid since 1 July 2021.  To date, free electricity has gone to the grid and consumers are charged an enormous price for it.  The poor people who invested in microgeneration get nothing for it.  They do not know how much is going out.  It is not metered and there is no action to do so.  This is making a mockery of the microgeneration scheme.  When asked how it is working, people in my constituency say not to touch this with a 40 ft. pole, because it is all about putting in money to give something back, and getting no return for it.</p> <p> Under the warmer homes scheme, the SEAI is continuing to install fossil fuel heating systems in houses for people in receipt of fuel allowance.  They will then be charged the carbon tax for the fuel that they will use.  I cannot believe that we are still doing that and putting public money into it in this day and age.  As recently as the last six months, I saw a fine new oil-fired Firebird boiler on a footpath outside a house where the warmer homes scheme has just been completed.  The house has been tested and passed everything, yet we are still using a fossil fuel.  This is a farce.  In a constituency with no public transport, very few facilities to charge electric vehicles, and a ban on the sale of turf, it is time for a wake-up call and to make sure that we do something for what is called a just transition.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies from the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion.  We are in extremely difficult times and face many challenges following the many restrictions imposed on us by Covid and with the rapidly rising cost of living, which is affecting everybody.  I fully believe that climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed.  It cannot be ignored anymore and we need to act now.  We need to put in place necessary measures to reduce or eliminate climate change.  Carbon tax is, unfortunately, one of the main tools in the Government's effort to reduce climate change.</p>  <p>  In the Private Member's motion, the Rural Independent Group highlights how the carbon tax was introduced and summarises how it affects oil, gas and solid fuels.  There is no doubt that this is having a real effect on the cost of living for many, especially people in fuel poverty.  As I said, we are just coming out of a pandemic and there is the Russian onslaught on Ukraine, which is causing great problems for the Ukrainian people.  With all of this happening, I feel the Government should consider a temporary pause in the increase in carbon tax which is due to happen.  I feel that people have had enough.  Every day, we hear of price increases and to add further to this with an increase in carbon tax is wrong.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that renewable energy is the future, but we cannot increase taxes on other forms of energy if we cannot offer an alternative renewable source.  The Government has published its plans for the retrofitting scheme, but it will not be solved in the immediate future.  The Government has indicated that heat pump technology is the way forward, which I agree with, but retrofitting houses which have oil or gas boilers with heat pumps will require a significant effort and injection of capital funding.  People dealing with fuel poverty will not be able to afford the costs of insulation or heat pumps.  The Government needs real and workable solutions if this is to happen.</p>  <p>  Another issue is the fact that heat pumps use so much electricity.  I know there will be a serious shortage of electricity.  We face many challenges with the national grid.  How can we manage it if every house in the country is using electricity as the primary source of energy?</p>  <p>  It is important that we start using commonsense.  I know, and I am sure the Minister of State knows, that people are not putting their heat on because they cannot afford to and they are feeding their families.  I was reading an article which stated that the three main causes of fuel poverty are low income in a house, fuel costs and the energy efficiency of the house.  It is frightening when one realises how bad it is.  There are thousands of households with children who are in fuel poverty.  They just cannot afford to heat the house.  People cannot afford to buy a house in the first place, then most rented houses are of poor quality.  It is frightening to see the actual prices.</p>  <p>  I keep saying that we should start using commonsense.  It is the wrong time to introduce taxes.  We hear about how there could be a general election because of issues with the Green Party.  There is a coalition Government, which is doing a pretty good job.  It is doing a good job from a European perspective too, taking in so many Ukrainians.  If the Government sat down to think about this, it could find a solution to help people.  While I do not agree with scrapping the carbon tax, I call on the Government to delay temporarily the increase in the tax.  I ask the Government to sit down and use commonsense.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="11:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700017#P00300"><p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling this motion.  We have had several motions on the rising cost of energy and fuel and the huge impact that has on the cost of living for ordinary people.  It drives some people into energy poverty.  Energy poverty means that people cannot afford to heat their homes or to turn on the hot water for their shower.  It means they live in fear of rising energy costs and money that might be set aside for school books, urgent home maintenance or whatever else is eaten up day by day as people try to keep themselves and their families warm.  While I do not fully agree with all of the proposals in this motion, I fully support its thrust and intent, which is to lower taxation on fuel, home heating oil, gas and energy in general so that rising energy costs do not drive people into fuel poverty.  It would mean that people can go to work and bring their children to school, and haulage companies, taxis, buses and the travel industry can continue to operate.</p>  <p>  Everything has a context.  As I said, this is not the first or second time that we have discussed the escalation in the cost of living or the spike in inflation.  Much of this is driven by the increasing cost of fuel.  While it is not our first or second time, I want to say to the Rural Independent Group that the timing of this motion is most opportune.  Just overnight, I heard one report that Gazprom has cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, while another report stated it is still flowing.  We know what is happening and we know the direction of travel.  We do not buy Russian gas in Ireland.  We buy on the international markets, but we know that the squeeze in supply will hit all of us.  Last night, in response to the threat by Gazprom, there was a 17% rise in gas prices.  Norway tells us it is exporting at full capacity.  Countries such as Poland and Bulgaria will now enter a shrinking market.  They will look to countries like Germany to help them with their gas supply.  That will mean an increase in fuel prices.  Ireland, like many other countries, will be hit by these increases.  That is why this motion is timely and opportune.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Government has little or no control over the actions of Gazprom and Russia, but it has control of the taxation on fuel and energy.</p> <p>I am not saying it has full control.  I recognise the fact VAT rates are not fully at our discretion but other levies and taxes are.  Simply removing carbon tax will not solve the problem, though it would certainly ease it.  Excise and VAT are where the Government can really make a difference.</p> <p> I recognise the Government has made efforts on the fuel allowance and that is welcome for the approximately 500,000 people who receive it.  However, there are many other families who are struggling and do not receive fuel allowance.  Time and time again I have raised the issue that carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Just two weeks ago I was happy to facilitate the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and Family Carers Ireland when they launched a report on the cost of caring in Ireland.  It is one of many but the cost of caring is exacerbated by increases in the cost of transport and heating and it would make a huge difference to families who care if carer's allowance was made a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.</p> <p> We also have the &euro;200 energy credit and while I have heard many people speak about all the millionaires getting it most of the people I know who receive it will be glad to.  However, most of those people also agree these type of payments need to be better targeted and not just to those who are happy to get it.  We need more targeted payments.  We need to ensure carer's allowance is a qualifying payment for fuel allowance and crucially, as this motion asks, we need a decrease in tax and duties on fuel.</p> <p> As a final point, no debate on fuel poverty and the cost of energy, certainly in my view, would be complete without reference to the ongoing debacle on the sale of turf.  The most recent proposal I have heard is if you live in a community of 500 or more people you cannot burn turf but you can if you live in a community of fewer.  I do not know about the Minister of State's constituency but I have looked at my own.  I looked at two towns in north Sligo that are 9 km apart.  In Cliffony you can burn turf but if you are 9 km away in Grange, which has just a few more people, you cannot.  In Leitrim, if you live in Drumsna you can burn turf but if you live in Drumod, which is fewer than 10 km away up the road, you cannot.  It is nonsense, it unenforceable and it makes a mockery of any legislation or regulation we might propose.  I therefore ask that proposal be set aside.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, spoke about consultation.  I do not know if he understands people are cutting turf now.  That turf will be sold in September or October.  It is too late for consultation.  There are possible solutions and the Independents will be bringing forward a motion next week around such solutions relating to the levels of moisture in turf.  Maybe if we look at the science we can find solutions here.  We need a just transition for the 4% to 5% of households that burn turf, not a half-baked announcement without proper planning, proper research and without any impact assessment.  It is not good government.  I look forward to hearing proposals that are reasonable, that will guarantee a just transition and will work.</p></speech>

I have listened carefully to the comments of many of the Deputies and I understand what they are saying.  While I might not agree with some of what has been said I understand the full sentiment behind it.  Members will be aware of the important actions this Government has taken in the space of climate action and meeting emissions reduction targets.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act enshrined carbon budgets and our targets for emissions reductions into law.  The Act identifies the specific mechanisms, plans and strategies that will be used by Government to achieve the national climate objective.  These objectives include a series of national carbon budgets.  Under the system of carbon budgeting established in the Act, the carbon budget represents the total amount of greenhouse gases that may be emitted in the State during a five-year period measured in tons of carbon dioxin equivalent.  The first two carbon budgets in the programme provide for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the State by 2030 relative to 2018, as set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  Carbon tax offers an effective, cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed necessary to effect meaningful change.  It is therefore very necessary to us achieving these emissions reductions and doing our part to prevent climate disaster by 2050.  This explains the Government's being opposed to any motion to scrap the carbon tax.  Deputies calling this morning for the Government to review carbon pricing are reminded we have done it in a progressive way.  The various analyses show those in most poverty benefit most from all the measures that have been introduced.  The excise reductions, VAT and PSO cuts, the &euro;200 utility bill credit and enhancements to the fuel allowance will mitigate the price increase across energy products and assist those who need it most.</p>  <p>  In summary, it is necessary we respond to the current energy price dynamics and the Government has outlined what it has been doing to date.  The Government remains committed to its current policy of carbon taxation.  The carbon tax is critical to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring a just transition to a decarbonised society.  We therefore cannot support the proposal to scrap carbon tax.  It would also jeopardise the Government's legally-binding commitments to reduce emissions by 2030 and 2050.  The carbon tax is therefore linked with complementary expenditure measures that are critical to a just transition to a decarbonised society.  A removal of carbon tax would not only undermine emissions reduction targets but also the welfare supports and initiatives that support the most vulnerable people.</p>  <p>  For the benefit of everyone present, I state the carbon tax raised &euro;652 million last year.  If Members want to scrap that they must be honest and tell the people that &euro;652 million cannot be spent on the areas on which it is being spent currently.  The number of households that benefit from the fuel allowance is 390,000.  Those people need it most.  Everybody knows that due to the extended period we provided for in the budget, the increases we gave and the extra one-off payments in that sector, people in receipt of the allowance get an actual cash benefit over an extended period of time of over &euro;1,000 per person.  The benefit to those 390,000 people who get that costs &euro;390 million.  If Members want to abolish carbon tax, they should tell the people they are going to abolish the fund that raises the &euro;390 million that pays for the fuel allowance.  They should tell the people who are involved in agricultural environment schemes the money for them is gone because we have abolished the carbon tax.  They should tell the people who want to retrofit their houses, even the smallest job of insulating the walls and ceiling, that they need not do it anymore if they expect money from the Government because some Members want to abolish the carbon tax.  Society works by people paying tax and the Government spending it.  The Government cannot spend it on those schemes if it does not raise it.  We would all love to be in a situation where we did not have to pay carbon tax but most honest people would prefer to pay some tax to ensure the 390,000 people who are most vulnerable are getting &euro;1,000 at minimum each, which every one of them needs and deserves to heat their homes.  We should be going further with our retrofitting schemes and we need funding to do that.  If Members are against all these schemes they should just say so and people will judge who is being fair and reasonable.  The issue with being in government-----</p></speech>

God, their Members will all be here in ten minutes' time.  I am sorry for invoking the name of God, but I cannot believe it.  We then have some people telling us we should mine turf.  I, or any of us, do not profess to know everything, but we know that turf is not mined.  We get lectures from people in white vans about what we should do regarding liquefied natural gas and everything else.  That is fair enough, but I say to the Minister of State that this appalling vista has a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>for me and for him.  He is a member of a proud party and was in the same fine room as me, on the fifth floor, full of Deputies, Ministers and Senators, with the then Minister for the environment, John Gormley, and then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen.  I think Deputy Byrne chaired this meeting where we spent two hours discussing - excuse the language - when a breeding bitch would be a breeding bitch.  That is the <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  That was the last time I walked out of that parliamentary room because I knew the whole thing was gone loo-lah.  We are back there again.</p><p>I know there is awful trouble in the Minister of State's party.  There is worse trouble in Fine Gael.  The T&aacute;naiste likes to be flippant and tell them all that taking turf off the people is like taking wine off the people.  It is a sexy kind of talk.  It is nice and emotive and everything else.  The Ceann Comhairle said to ask him about it when he comes back to the Chamber.  We will ask him, but when we left the Chamber two weeks ago there was only a rumpus about turf.  However, members of the Government are all forgetting one thing.  This measure from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is in the big book, the leabhar.  It is in the programme for Government.  Members of the Government stuck to it, they are welded to it and they have to honour it.  The Taoiseach said, in Geneva or someplace - it was not in Cork, Kerry or a bog and I suggested he was lost in a fog in a deep bog - that this would all be smoothed over and he would do whatever.  There are rumours he is now doing a secret deal with the Green Party and forgetting Fine Gael.</p><p>Deputy Berry is in the Chair so I cannot comment on him, but I cannot forget the Regional Independents who consistently vote in this Chamber.  They are not Independents.  They are Fine Gael backbenchers who consistently vote for every measure, but the measures today are hurting the people.  The Minister of State knows this more than anyone.  He is from the midlands, which is the place he talked about in respect of just transition.  It is the most unjust transition and imposition that was ever dreamed of.  It must be some of the 36,000 NGOs the Government has now, costing &euro;5 billion a year, that come up with these lovely acronyms and lovely names, such as &quot;just transition&quot;.  It is the most unjust, regressive, punitive legislation.  Why?  There are no alternatives.  People are frozen in their homes because they cannot go to the bog.</p><p>Easter Sunday was the day, and Easter was late this year, to be anxious about it.  People headed for the bog on Easter Monday morning.  They always observed the Sabbath as most in rural Ireland still do.  They went off to the bog with their flask of tea and, my God, they would have a sore back and would be sore in many places after cutting the turf for the day with the sle&aacute;n and throwing it on the bank.  Thankfully, machines can come in, cut it and leave it out for them without people having to go out to turn it.  It was a family event that was part of our heritage, our d&uacute;chas, our beliefs and what we lived for.  It also sustained us and we had the meitheal spirit to help each other.  I remember there were often ten men with a tractor and trailer who went to Monaincha Bog.  There were also women.  It was equal opportunities.  They loaded the turf in bags and double trailers, brought it home, had a fine feed of bacon and cabbage, a drop for the road, maybe a bag or two of turf for the driver of the tractor, and they gave stuff to their neighbours.  It is more important to the people of rural Ireland than wine, which is an elite drink.  The Taoiseach waxed lyrical recently about wine being like the berries.  I do not know what he said, but he then said that whiskey tasted more like bog.  You would know he never stood in a turf-cutting position with a sle&aacute;n, or took turf in a wheelbarrow out across the bog, or he would know well the taste of the cold tea he would have had and the sandwiches that might have gone stale.  He would have had that and earned it.</p><p>A trip back to the bog is what the members of the Government all need now and a trip back to rural Ireland, which they profess to represent.  They need a trip to the feirmeacha beaga, the small farms, and the small industries.  The microgeneration industry was mentioned by the Deputy across the floor of the House.  People and families in good faith put up mini-turbines and solar panels.  They are supporting the ESB by selling back to the grid but it has been robbed from them because they are not getting paid for it.  There is no sign of legislation that will deal with this.  What kind of bad taste and bad incentive is that?</p><p>There are so many other things I could say but the NGOs have plundered this country and the Government is talking about bringing in a carbon tax.  I have the figure for last year, which was &euro;670 million, of which &euro;126 million was spent on climate actions.  Where is the other &euro;500 million-odd going?  It is a con job.  It is a three-card trick.  The ducking and diving backbenchers are doing is such that the Garda sub-aqua team could recruit a pile of them.  They go down so deep so fast and come up again while consistently stating they are all against the carbon tax and the rising price of diesel.  If they do not make the Garda sub-aqua team, for other reasons they should go in for Olympic deep diving and swimming, because I never saw the like of it.  There is a huge sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>- I can sense it - where the Government at the time imploded with the Green Party.  I said at the front gates of Leinster House - I was stopped going out one evening because I was kind of angsty - that the next thing it would try to stop is the cat chasing the mouse.  It is coming to that.  It is utter folly.  Members of the Government should not go away for two weeks' break because the Minister, Deputy Ryan, gets these ideas.  I have personal respect for the man and have had good conversations with him, but he comes up with these utopian ideas and it is only driving a wedge among the people.  N&iacute; neart go chur le ch&eacute;ile.  I want to bring people with us.  It is not all a big bata or stick such as the old schoolmasters had.  The Government must bring the people with it using a carrot and stick.</p><p>We need to get real and we need to get support.  The Rural Independent Group is consistent.  Other Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la will come in and out of the Chamber and say they are for it and everything else, but they have all been indoctrinated by the army of NGOs we have now.  It is said we have no army and we have not; we have an army of NGOs.  There are some very good people but there are 36,000 NGOs, costing &euro;5 billion annually.  We always had NGOs.  When I was a buachaill &oacute;g, women and men in the missions went all over the world and did work in Third World countries, bringing water schemes to water parts of Africa and God knows where, including Biafra which was sold out to the Middle East.  All the different magazines state there were cynical aims to those missions, but they did not cost &euro;5 billion.  They got nothing but dedicated their lives to that work.</p><p>All the Irish people want now is to live out their lives in a modicum of peace, not be perished in their houses, and not be frightened about the turf police that will come along.  Most of the police I know do not have squat because they do not have the numbers in the Garda.  We are picking things out of our heads so that we might have this or that.  We will now have a limit on the population, so we will not be able to move from one village to the next village because a population of under 500 will be needed to burn the turf.  Did you ever hear the like of it?  The lunatics are definitely running the asylum when we hear these kinds of statements.  It is not a plan; it is regulations with new consultation.</p><p>The people of Tipperary, west Waterford, and into north Tipperary and such places are in the bog already cutting the turf for this winter.  The Minister of State knows that; he is close enough to see them.  They are hoping to go out to turn it out in two weeks' time, and to turn it again two weeks after that to dry it.  An expert stated on an RT&Eacute; programme last week that we are all burning wet turf.  I can tell the Minister of State that a gallon of petrol would not burn one sod of wet turf.  What will the Fianna F&aacute;il leader do when he goes back to his parishes?  Previously, people all went back with pitchforks and the lighted sod of turf.  I know what to do with that sod of turf.  It will not be up on pitchforks but someplace else.  The Government is scorching the people, they are really hurting and they are sick and tired of it.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am do scoitheadh an Rialtas sin.  It is time to call an election.</p></speech>

In fact, it makes for fairly devastating reading, particularly for those in housing need and for those who now have their lives defined by this never-ending housing crisis.  The report tells us that rents have doubled since 2011 - in a decade.  We saw another big hike in new rents across the State for the last three months of last year and the average new rent in Dublin now stands at nearly &euro;2,000.  That is off the wall.  I have said it so many times in this Chamber and I say it again - this is a social catastrophe.  The rent crisis is hammering a generation today and robbing them of their aspirations for tomorrow, for their future.  This is no way to live.  It is deeply, deeply unfair.  In fact, it is a horrible situation for anyone.</p>  <p>  Of course, this is not simply an urban crisis.  Rural Ireland fares no better.  Counties like Donegal, Longford, Roscommon and Leitrim have all experienced massive jumps.  In fact, in many towns and villages now there are no homes available to rent at all.  Where are people supposed to live?  How can they hope to put a roof over their heads, build a decent life or raise a family, if that is what they wish to do?  How can ordinary people, families and workers be expected to pay these rip-off rents and somehow still find money to pay soaring energy bills, big childcare fees and to put food on the table?</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, house prices go up and up and many have given up on the dream of ever owning their own home.  The number of properties to rent continues to fall right across the State and this does not just push up the cost of renting; it is also forcing many families into homelessness.  Since the Government launched its housing plan, the scourge of homelessness has escalated once more.  We are now close to breaking the pre-Covid peak of 10,000 homeless people.  That, by the way, is just the official figure.</p>  <p>  The facts speak for themselves.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have failed spectacularly to get a grip on this crisis.  The fact is that their housing plan is not fit for purpose because it is underpinned by the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place.  Theip ar pholasa&iacute; tith&iacute;ochta an Taoisigh.  Teasta&iacute;onn freagairt &eacute;igeand&aacute;la uainn a oibr&iacute;onn do gach duine a bhfuil riachtanas tith&iacute;ochta acu.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin c&iacute;osanna a ghearradh, cosc a chur ar mh&eacute;aduithe c&iacute;osa ar feadh tr&iacute; bliana agus plean &oacute;n Rialtas a chuireann an m&eacute;id tithe s&oacute;isialta agus tithe ar phraghas r&eacute;as&uacute;nta at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il ar f&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Housing can be fixed.  Extortionate rents can be tackled.  This generation can have the opportunity of a good life but it is not going to happen by chance.  It requires a big change in direction and ambition from Government.  Those caught up in this crisis need a real plan that leaves no person or family behind.  There are things the Government can do now that will make a big difference.  It can cut rents by putting &euro;1,500 back into renters' pockets through a tax rebate and it can ban rent increases for three years.  I have asked the Taoiseach countless times for this and I am asking again today.  The Government can change its housing plan and ramp it up for social and affordable housing.</p></speech>

T&aacute; fianaise ann go bhfuil polasa&iacute; an Rialtais ag obair.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; tith&iacute;ochta &aacute; cruth&uacute; againn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin soil&eacute;ir &oacute; na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; againn maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tith&iacute;ochta.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is not correct in saying that the Housing for All strategy, launched last September, is not working.  It is working.  There has been a rebound in construction activity since we emerged from Covid.  Covid did cause difficulties.  It closed down construction for a substantial period in 2020 and 2021 and the impacts of that are still being felt.  Notwithstanding that, 35,000 homes were commenced in the year to March 2022.  That is the highest rolling 12-month average since 2008.  That is a significant figure - 35,000 new commencements.  There were 31,000 homes commenced in 2021, the highest since 2008.  There were 24,000 apartments commenced, while the number of apartments completed increased by over 30% year on year.  There were 43,000 planning permissions granted in 2021, a fourfold increase on 2011 but we still need more supply.  Housing for All is a substantive suite of policies that is designed to increase supply.  That is fundamental.</p>  <p>  The RTB index relates to new tenancies.  The ESRI is saying that if it was not for the rent pressure zones, RPZs, and the restriction of increases to 2% that rents would be far higher in existing tenancies.  The RPZs are having an impact but in terms of new tenancies, the increases are very worrying.  They are not satisfactory but they are related to the supply issue.  There is an onus on everybody to facilitate the supply of housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in objects to build-to-rent developments here in the Republic.  Deputy McDonald keeps opposing it and her party opposes it in terms of planning applications and so on, on a consistent basis, and yet in Belfast there is no difficulty.  Her party supports 800 apartments in Belfast in a big development there of build-to-rent units.  It is a different policy in the North that her party engages in, which is in complete contrast to how it operates in the Republic in terms of its opposition to a whole series of developments.</p>  <p>  The cost-rental initiative within Housing for All is very important.  The first cost-rental tenancies are now in place in Balbriggan and Leixlip, with rental prices at least 40% below comparable market levels.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage opened 50 further cost-rental homes in Stepaside last April.  We have targeted 9,000 new-build social homes in 2022 but Sinn F&eacute;in has never explained how you can double that in one year.  The party just threw that figure out there, with no substance.  It is top-of-the-head stuff.  Working with people in the field and in the Department, we have said that we want to target 9,000 new builds in social housing for 2022, between approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the local authorities and we will continue to do that.  Since the Government came into office, because of a new emphasis on voids, we have brought back close to 6,000 local authority voids for reallocation to those on the social housing list.  A further 2,000 will be brought back in 2022.</p>  <p>  A range of initiatives is being taken to increase supply significantly and as I said, that has happened.  In Dublin, for example, we are 78% up on the number of units commenced in the year to March 2022 as against March 2021.  Outside of Dublin, we are up by 139%.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach does not dispute the facts in the report from the RTB as presented this morning.  I am assuming he does not contest the fact that rents are out of control right across this State, that people are struggling to make these rents, that house prices continue to climb and climb or that homelessness is again at crisis proportions.  All of these facts indicate that the policy the Government is pursuing is getting it wrong.  The Government is getting it wrong.</p> <p>I asked the Taoiseach about two specific measures where the Government can get it right.  I asked him about a tax credit and tax rebate for the hundreds of thousands of renters caught in the grip of a cost of living crisis.  Will he introduce a tax rebate that puts a month's rent back into renters' pockets?  Will he finally move to instigate a rent freeze for three years?  I ask him to answer these questions for me directly.</p></speech>

A tax credit would only add to the price of those rents.  It would be inflationary.  There is no guarantee it would result in a reduction of increasing rents for new tenancies, none whatsoever.  The Deputy is wrong in saying the Housing for All policies are not working.  By definition, 35,000 commencements to March is the highest rolling 12-month average since 2008.  There is a lot of activity in the construction sector.  A lot of houses are being built in the private sector and through social housing, cost rental and a number of other schemes.  Through the shared equity scheme and various other schemes we have introduced, we will help those buying new houses.  The Deputy opposed the help to buy scheme.  She was against it.  That was designed to help thousands of young people to buy their homes.  I do not know why she opposed it but she did.</p></speech>

Almost 1 million Ulster Bank customers will need to find a new bank and the same will apply to 130,000 KBC customers.  Two weeks ago, the Governor of the Central Bank told me that banks are not ready to deal with the biggest transfer of bank accounts the State has ever experienced.  The potential for catastrophe is obvious, but the Department of Finance is completely oblivious to this.  It has taken a vow of silence.  It is a bystander.  In fact, it is not even a commentator on it.  This is part of a wider hands-off <i>laissez-faire</i>policy when it comes to banks.  There is nothing if not consistency from the Department of Finance.  Yesterday the Minister issued a statement thanking the outgoing head of Bank of Ireland for her work over the years but we are still waiting for the banking division in the Department to say anything about the fate of almost 1 million ordinary bank customers in the coming months.</p><p>Ulster Bank will give its customers six months to switch their accounts to a new bank or to open a new account elsewhere.  In the case of KBC it will be three months.  Even in ordinary times, &quot;banks&quot; and &quot;good customer service&quot; are words we rarely hear in the same sentence.  The fact that branches have been closed and good bank jobs have been sacrificed has not helped.  Staff are under huge pressure as it stands.  The recent Central Bank assessment suggests that 50% of customers waiting on the phone line have to hang up because it takes so long to get a simple query answered.  This is an historical analysis.</p><p>How can we have any confidence the big switch will go well for customers?  The switching code is ancient.  It predates GDPR laws.  I can see GDPR rules being quoted as the omni-excuse over the coming weeks and months for the poor performance of banks.  Direct debit receivers and originators of recurring payments are not covered by the switching code.  The banks themselves have said this.  Direct debit originators will not always take an instruction from a bank.  This leaves the customer with an awful lot of work to do.  People who want to open a new joint account with AIB or Permanent TSB have to show up at the branch.  This is if they can get an appointment over the next period of time.</p><p>More than 1 million accounts are in play here.  There are tens of millions of direct debits, standing orders and overdrafts.  People have enough to worry about at present, as I hope the Taoiseach will admit, without being kept awake at night with the fear of a bounced direct debit payment on their mortgage.  This would kill their clean credit record through no fault of their own.  Does the Taoiseach agree with what the Governor of the Central Bank told me two weeks ago, that the exiting and receiving banks are not ready to meet the scale of this switching challenge?  What does the Government plan to do to hold Ulster Bank and KBC to account?  Does the Taoiseach agree the receiving banks left on the market should significantly staff up to meet the demands that will be placed on them in the coming weeks and months?  Should the Central Bank use its powers to delay the departure timetables of the exiting banks if the process is not working for their customers?  What will the Government do to ensure customers have a real banking choice in this economy?</p></speech>

I am unclear as to what the Deputy thinks the Government should do.  He has not really specified that.  He spoke about a <i>laissez-faire</i>approach.  I am not clear on what he is saying the Government should do specifically.  What should the Department of Finance do?  We have a structure and the Deputy knows this.  The Central Bank is the key structure.  It is separate.  There is a separation between the Government and the Central Bank in terms of the management of the commercial banks.</p><p>It is regrettable that Ulster Bank and KBC are leaving the Irish market.  It is not something the Government wanted to see happening but we know the reasons and rationale for it.  The Government does not have a role in the commercial decisions of banks and of those banks in particular.  Yes, every effort has to be made that the banks would withdraw in an orderly manner.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials are engaging with the banks that have indicated their intentions to leave the market to emphasise the importance of an orderly withdrawal and the need to engage in a timely manner with their customers in advance of any exit.  The Minister and the officials are doing this.  They are also engaging with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland to ensure the remaining banks are prepared to accept applications from customers who are switching from closing banks.  The Department will also be monitoring closely the number of accounts that close and switch in the coming months.  It will continue to engage with all stakeholders to ensure the impact on consumers is minimised.  I understand the Central Bank's supervision of any bank that withdraws from the market will be focused on ensuring its customers are treated fairly and it remains in place to support customers when switching current accounts to ensure it is easy and straightforward.</p><p>All banks, payment institutions and e-money institutions that offer payment accounts in Ireland must comply with the switching code.  As per the code, all banks must provide a switching pack to their customers.  Provision 10 of the code requires that the switch is completed within ten days of the switching date.  In terms of supports for vulnerable customers, the Central Bank's consumer protection framework is designed to ensure that customers' best interests are protected.  It requires banks to consider specifically the impact of their decisions on vulnerable customers and provide the assistance necessary to reasonably mitigate those impacts and retain access to basic financial services.  There is an obligation on the exiting banks and the existing banks to do everything they possibly can to facilitate their customers.  The Department of Finance is engaging with them on this and will continue to do so.  The Central Bank has to engage on this also.</p></speech>

The Government has a Minister of State with responsibility for financial services.  What kind of message does his answer send to the 1 million consumers who have to switch accounts?  Tens of millions of direct debits and standing orders could be in disarray over the next few months because of the disorganised way that all banks are approaching this.  What is the purpose of the banking division in the Department of Finance?  It was established in the teeth of the financial crisis.  It seems that the only time the Government gets involved in banking is when it divests itself of the shares that Irish taxpayers bought during the financial crisis.  This is the only policy coming from the Department of Finance on banking.  It is scandalous.  There is no doubt that if a new bank entered the market here the Department of Finance would be all over it claiming credit for it.  It will not take any responsibility when banks are exiting.  It takes no responsibility for the poor experience that I anticipate consumers will have in the coming weeks and months.  One thing the Government could do to protect consumers is to reintroduce the legislation that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, introduced when he was in the Opposition in the previous D&aacute;il to fix variable mortgage interest rates.  We anticipate an increase in interest rates from the European Central Bank over the next period of time.  This would send a strong signal that the Government is backing consumers in this country and backing the customers of banks.</p></speech>

I would like him to try to explain that to three people in the Gallery.  They are Tony, Radoslaw and Se&aacute;n, who are three of the five remaining tenants in the St. Helen's Court complex in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  This Friday they will be at the Four Courts, where a vulture fund will seek an enforcement order to evict them from their homes.  They have never done anything wrong and have always paid their rent.  Once upon a time they were part of a community of 20 tenants who all lived there.  It was a fabulous community, which has been destroyed by the greed of two successive vulture funds.  It is fair to say their lives have been ruined for four years by the greed and ruthlessness of vulture funds and the failure of this and previous Governments to address the causes of the persecution they have suffered at the hands of vulture funds.</p>  <p>  Their story is not just a story of their persecution but, to be honest, it tells the story of tens of thousands of people who are victims of the housing crisis and the failure of this and successive Governments to deal with the matter.  Why do I say this?  This vulture fund has no reason to evict these people but it is allowed to evict them.  Legally, the vulture fund is allowed to just throw these people out on the street.  They have paid their rent and never done anything wrong but they can be thrown out on the street.</p>  <p>  These tenants receive the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Se&aacute;n and Radoslaw are both working and Tony, who is now retired, was a healthcare worker.  He has had a stroke as a result of the stress he suffered over the past four years at the hands of these vulture funds.  They are HAP recipients, so in other words they are meant to be socially housed, although they are not.  They are being thrown out on the street and the council has no obligation to rehouse such people.  They may well end up in homeless accommodation.</p>  <p>  This would not be such a problem if there was social housing but there are 5,000 families on the housing list waiting ten to 20 years to get a house.  These people are included in that list.  The tenants get &euro;960, the homeless HAP rate, to find alternative accommodation but the problem is that rents are more than &euro;2,000 per month in our area.  What is really shocking is that not only will they end up on the street unless the Government intervenes but there are now only five tenants where there used to be 20.  For two years, 15 fully refurbished apartments that could have housed people on the housing list have been sitting empty because a greedy vulture fund can make more profit by sitting on empty properties and evicting other tenants than renting them to people who need them.</p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach going to do about that for them and others facing similar persecution by vulture funds and the failure of Governments to deal with the housing crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700022#U00900"><p>Everything must be done to protect tenants and we are doing that through a variety of legislation and so forth.  The Deputy asked about St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and landlords issuing notices to vacate to five HAP tenants at that location.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to ensure the five remaining households - three singles and two families - do not fall into homelessness as a result of their tenancies ending at St. Helen's Court.  Viewings of available homes have been facilitated by the placefinder services and eligible households have been provided with access to the choice-based letting systems.  Two of the five families have recently been offered or are due to be offered alternative accommodation imminently.  The Department has advised that recent court procedures taken by the property owner to repossess the properties was adjourned.  That is the existing position.</p><p>The Deputy knows the HAP programme is State assistance to provide for social housing.  Since the Government came to office two years ago we have ramped up and will continue to ramp up the provision of social housing through direct builds.  We want to create a much larger stock of social housing in the country, with a target this year of 9,000 social housing units between approved social housing bodies and the local authorities.  That is key to rebalancing the number of tenants on HAP compared with those in local authority housing.  We want more people in approved social housing body rentals and local authorities and in cost rental units, which will be well below market levels.</p><p>Housing for All was launched last September and very significant progress has been made with 35,000 new commencements, as I said the largest number since 2008.  A number of measures have also been introduced under the Residential Tenancies Act with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants.  For example, the Tyrrelstown amendment provides that where a landlord proposes to sell ten or more units in a single development at the same time, the sale would be subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ</i>other than in exceptional circumstances.  That aims to strike a balance between landlords' constitutionally protected rights to sell their property and achieve a fair return on investment with a tenant's right to security of tenure.  It provides security of tenure in the interests of the common social good.</p><p>The Housing Commission that is now established is examining matters such as tenure, standards, sustainability and quality-of-life issues in the provision of housing.  It is also examining wording for amendments to the Constitution with regard to the Government's commitment to hold a referendum on housing, which will be important in establishing a balance between security of tenure and the constitutional protection that currently exists.</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach guarantee that Tony, Radoslaw, Se&aacute;n and the other two households remaining in St. Helen's Court will not be thrown into emergency accommodation after Friday's court proceedings?  That is what they want to hear.  That is the commitment they need.  Beyond that, why are the vulture funds allowed to do this for nothing other than greed?  Why are they allowed to evict people who have done nothing wrong and sit for two years on 15 empty properties when there are people crying out for accommodation?  It is even worse now.  There are 5,000 people on the housing list and Ukrainian people are fleeing a desperate situation of war but this vulture fund is allowed to sit on empty properties and evict tenants who have done nothing wrong.</p>  <p>  The State should step in, buy that block and force its purchase.  The Government must also change the law because they got around the Tyrrelstown amendment.  They tried to evict more than ten households.  The Tyrrelstown amendment protected those people, so they evicted seven households.  Give these people that guarantee and do something to prevent vulture funds treating people like this.</p></speech>

I have raised it with him and his colleagues in the Government many times and to be honest, it seems we are only paying lip service at this stage.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.</p> <p>We hear from the Government about the many thousands of new homes that will be built every year but we are still are no better off when it comes to the number of people requiring houses or homes.</p> <p> The war in Ukraine has had a devastating effect on the people of Ukraine and Ireland has once more risen to the challenge and taken in refugees in a time of need.  Great effort continues to be made in housing, and also with the many thousands of refugees coming to our country from Ukraine.  I completely support all the efforts that have been made to find accommodation for refugees from Ukraine.  Why is the same effort is not being made to tackle the housing crisis here in Ireland?  I have lost count of the number of times I have raised this issue in the House.  Vacant properties are there and we are not availing of them.  The biggest issue I deal with in my constituency office in Dundalk is housing.  On a daily basis, new cases of homelessness are presented to me.  The Government is failing on the issue.</p> <p> I have called on the Government many times to look at the potential that vacant properties have in addressing the housing crisis.  Only this week, I had to deal with a local constituent in the Carlingford area.  She is a mother of four children who has been on the housing list for over eight years.  She identified a property which is vacant and approached the council.  She was subsequently told that the council does not have money or resources to refurbish the property.  This is wrong.  We are throwing money at every other problem, yet when it comes to refurbishing vacant properties, the council is saying it does not have the funding or resources.  It is important that councils are supported in this.  If it is the case that they are not being supported, they must be made accountable.  </p> <p> The price of rental property is going through the roof and those looking to buy property find it cannot be done.  I have people coming to my constituency office who have been told by their landlord that they must vacate the property in three months' time.  When they go to the council they are told to come back a week before they are evicted from their home.  That is not right.  These families have children.  If they move to another area, they will have no access to transport.  It is causing chaos.  I am asking that we do the same for Irish people as we are doing for Ukrainians.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the same effort in providing badly-needed accommodation for Ukrainian refugees will also be made to fund and support local councils to refurbish and bring back into stock the many thousands of vacant properties that currently exist around the country.</p></speech>

I do not know the specifics about the house but that is not on.  Very significant capital funding has been given to local authorities to repair housing and vacant properties.  Due to a very strong initiative taken by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities have brought back 6,000 vacant local authority housing units for people on the social housing list in the nearly two years since the Government came in.  That is a fact.  There will be a further 2,000 this year.  Some 35,000 houses were commenced between March 2021 and March 2022.  That shows that the emphasis on housing is working.  Covid-19 hit us in 2020 and 2021.  We were shut down completely for nearly four months in 2021 and four months in 2020.  That slowed us down.  There is &euro;4 billion allocated for housing per annum.</p>  <p>  It is wrong to juxtapose the Ukrainian situation with the housing situation.  Some 25,000 Ukrainians have come here because there is an unprecedented war.  It is unprecedented since 1942.  I saw on television the other night that a man lost his wife and three-month-old baby.  He went out to the shop, came back and they were dead.  That is what people are fleeing.  The UN has said that it is the biggest humanitarian crisis we have witnessed since the Second World War.  Close to 5 million refugees have flowed into Europe.  Some 16,000 have been accommodated in Ireland, with 25,000 in total.  Some are in private accommodation with Ukrainian families.  The vast bulk are in hotels and various other types of accommodation.  Thousands of Irish people have pledged homes.  The pledges are being processed right now.  The vast bulk of refugees have been accommodated in hotels and other types of accommodation.  That is the truth of the matter.  We have to be very clear about it.  It is not a case of one or the other, nor should anybody in the House try to present it as one or the other.  I do not think that is fair.  It is not the right approach because those are not the facts.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of the Irish people want to do the best in the terrible wartime situation we are in because of an extraordinarily cynical, barbaric strategy pursued by Vladimir Putin.  He is not just attacking people.  He is deliberately creating a migration crisis by terrorising neighbourhoods and bombing residential areas to terrorise people into leaving.  He is creating a food crisis as well and he has created an energy crisis as part of his war effort.  We have to be strong and stand up to that.  We are not a military power.  The one great strength we have is humanitarian capacity.  That is what that is about.  On the housing front, I assure the Deputy that will do everything we can to bring more vacant properties back.  If the Deputy has other examples, I ask him to bring them to me.</p></speech>

That is not the problem.  The problem I am talking about is with the local authorities.  The vacant house to which I referred was left in perfect condition last October.  It is now six or seven months later.  A year ago, if I had asked the council what the problem was, it would have said it had no money.  Now it is saying the problem is resources.  Personally, I think the local authorities are not able to do this work.  Perhaps somebody who knows something about business, like Michael O'Leary of Ryanair, should be put in there.  I cannot understand it.  Years ago, the councils had their own plumbers, electricians and everything else.  They are doing absolutely nothing.  The biggest problem is accountability.  Where is the accountability for them?  There is nothing.  Council staff are civil servants who can fob people off.  I know of a person whose mother and father threw them out of the house last week.  The person was homeless.  They were told by the council to go back and make up with their mother and father.  When marriages break up, the husband and wife have to vacate the house.  They go to the council to get put on the list.  They are told that they cannot go on the list because they have accommodation or their name is already down.  Excuse after excuse is being made.   I am asking for solutions.  The Government is doing a fantastic job with the Ukrainian refugees.  I have no problem whatsoever with that.  I have mothers coming to my office, with their children roaring and crying, who are looking for accommodation.  We have to look after Irish and Ukrainian people.  If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform could find &euro;3 billion last week to help out-----</p></speech>

Fortunately, this year we have put &euro;4 billion into a contingency fund in the budget for Covid for 2022.  Some of that is now being used for Ukraine.  The figure the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform used last week was an estimate of what it could be in 2023.  We hope it is not and that the war will end.  I accept the Deputy's bona fides and the merits of what he is saying in terms of vacant properties.  I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to meet the Deputy to discuss vacant properties in his area.  We would like to find them, particularly local authority vacant properties.  I assure the Deputy that we will do everything we can to get them repaired.  I do not want any vacant properties hanging around the place.  They should not be hanging around the place.  That is why we had a special voids programme two years ago to get voids brought back into use for social housing, in particular.  There is also the repair and lease scheme.  On Tuesday, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage brought a package to us that deals with repair and lease for non-local authority housing to get them brought back, and to do more on the voids in terms of the social housing list.  We are also seeking to extend notice to quit periods, for example, to give greater time to tenants.  The Deputy mentioned the case of people being evicted.  We want to delay eviction as long as we possibly legally can.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I will ask the Minister to engage with him in terms of those vacant properties.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has indicated that it is his intention to vote against the motion.  He will do this despite the frustration felt right across rural communities.  He will do it despite the fact that he could not even convince his own backbenchers of the merits of the plan.  He will do it despite the fact that people in rural Ireland, particularly older people and people on lower incomes with no alternative, will struggle badly.</p> <p>I want to ask the Taoiseach again not to proceed with this and for good sense, for common sense, to prevail.  This ban is the wrong move at the wrong time.  It is unfair, it alienates communities and it will be unworkable.  I ask the Taoiseach to do what he has not done thus far and to give an assurance that he will ditch this plan.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Government seems determined to go back in time through its deeply flawed remote work legislation, which will essentially give employers a right to refuse requests for flexible work.  The reality, as the Taoiseach knows, is that both unions and employers, for different reasons, have said the Government's plans are not worth the paper they are written on, and we agree with them.  There is a right way out of this.  The way out of this is to fast-track and adopt the Labour Party's right to flexible work Bill drafted by my colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, which would enshrine a real right for workers to have flexible and secure work.</p>  <p>  We believe workers have proven their ability to successfully work remotely during the pandemic and they must have the right to maintain flexible work arrangements into the future.  Will the Taoiseach dispense with the flawed legislation that is currently before the Houses, adopt the Labour Party Bill, go back to the drawing board and ensure workers have a real right to request and have flexible work?</p></speech>

I was struck by a recent survey that illustrated that it has worked very well in Ireland during Covid-19, even without any legislative framework, and we should acknowledge that.  The experience for people who benefited from remote working is that they had higher satisfaction levels, quality of life and so on.</p>  <p>  On the legislation, the T&aacute;naiste has engaged with employers and unions in respect of this.  Obviously, both have different perspectives and want improvements.  In my view, we should continue to work with the social partners in respect of this.  The purpose of the pre-legislative scrutiny was to scrutinise and strengthen the draft legislation.  I do not think we need to go into another Bill.  We have a legislative framework to provide clarity to all concerned.  This is an evolving situation that has worked well so far without any legislation.  With the legislative template now, I think we will get a better outcome.</p></speech>

To quote from a document shared with parents from that school, teachers do not cover topics such as contraception and same-sex friendships, and children who ask questions in class on content outside the designated curriculum are encouraged to discuss the issue with their parents.  Last week's INTO conference heard that LGBTQI+ teachers continue to live in fear of being themselves in Catholic schools.  A recent survey conducted by that organisation found that fewer than one in five LGBTQI+ teachers are "out" to staff, parents and pupils at their school.</p>  <p>  In a modern republic, we must have relationships and sexuality education that is informed by best practice, science and healthcare, not religious dogma.  We brought legislation through last year and the Taoiseach said it will come back for a Second Reading in nine months.  Is that still on track or will the Government bring forward its own legislation to tackle this issue?</p></speech>

Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students.  I do not want to single out any particular school and I do not have the full details in regard to it.  From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, we are updating relationships and sexuality education and the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum for primary, junior cycle and senior cycle.  They are being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  A revised junior cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, followed by updated senior cycle and primary specifications.  On 19 April, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced her intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching social, personal and health education and relationships and sexuality education.  In essence, the updating and modernisation of the curriculum is the key essential there, as is the provision of continued professional development to the teachers to deliver this.</p></speech>

An issue of far greater concern to my constituents is the price of rent.  There was no surprise this morning when we learned the new figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with rent up 9% year on year.  We do not see Ministers coming to blows on this issue.  We do not see Government backbenchers raising the spectre of the fall of the Government on this issue.  Why not?  Perhaps it is not so surprising.  There are so many landlords on the Government benches, on the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael benches, that the satisfaction levels on this issue must be quite high on the Taoiseach's side of the House.</p>  <p>  I am beyond asking the Taoiseach to freeze rents.  Freezing would maintain them at an unjust level.  I am asking the Taoiseach whether he is prepared to consider legislation to cut rents and then to freeze them at reduced levels.</p></speech>

Supply is the key.  What is very important is that we really get supply up, which we are doing now, with 35,000 houses from March 2021 to March this year on all streams &ndash; social, private and cost rental.  That is the key to this and we are going to continue to work on getting that supply up.</p>  <p>  I would really appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s co-operation in making sure that if developments come along, we do not oppose them all of the time, that people do not oppose them and that we allow development to happen.

Organ donation and transplants were significantly reduced worldwide due to the pandemic and Ireland recorded one the most significant fall-offs in donors.  Part of the reason is that the clinical staff were redeployed to help with the influx of Covid patients.  Lung transplantation was the worst impacted, followed by heart and liver transplants.  Kidney transplants from both living and deceased donors also fell.  Lives that could have been saved were lost.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has spoken in this House about switching consent for organ donation from the current opt-in system to an opt-out system.  This means that people would have to indicate they do not wish to become donors following their deaths.  Otherwise, if suitable, their organs could be harvested.  The key factor in implementing such a system would be having trained organ donation staff in every intensive care unit, ICU.  In addition, the organ donation card is outdated and needs to be reviewed and revamped.</p></speech>

He is correct in saying that we experienced a higher decline in transplant rates compared with many European countries, due in part to the reallocation of staff and resources from the donation and transplantation system to intensive care units to aid the Covid-19 response.  An additional &euro;2.25 million has now been provided for organ donation and transplant services since 2020.  That includes funding for a total of 30 whole-time equivalent staff and included in that are seven organ donation nurse managers, five advanced nurse practitioners, five theatre nurses, associate registrars, two senior house officers, two consultants and a specialist perfusionist.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes legislating for an opt-out system of organ donation.</p> <p>This legislation is a priority for Government and work on the drafting of the Bill is progressing in collaboration with the Office of the Attorney General and Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication as soon as possible.  The aim of that Bill is to make organ donation the norm in Ireland and that in situations where the opportunity arises, consent will be deemed unless the person has, while alive, registered a wish not to become an organ donor.</p></speech>

There are families outside the gate today.  One woman's husband is in his 80s, her adult son is paraplegic and they are down to &euro;7 of the award they got a long time ago, fad&oacute; fad&oacute;, in the courts.  It is an inadequate system which does not work.  The Minister for Justice needs to deal with it.  We got information on the figures through the committee.  There are some very tragic cases.

I know it is a prospecting licence and not a mining licence but it is a foot in the door for Flintridge Resources, a subsidiary of the Canadian gold mining company, Galantas Gold.  We will be told, of course, that it is mining for base metals but it is a gold-mining company and it will mine for gold.  We do not need it.  We already have a supply of more than 500 years of gold mined globally.  Can we look at the possibility of banning gold mining in Ireland?  It is unnecessary, as well as being an energy-intensive, carbon-heavy process.  As Coillte owns much of the 25% of land already planted in Leitrim, what will its stance be?  Will it go against the local communities and allow access to its lands?</p></speech>

As we are halfway through our budgetary year cycle, I ask that in the autumn the Government consider providing that when someone has a cancer diagnosis he or she will automatically qualify for a medical card.  There must be no ifs or buts.  I often have to ask individuals who are already distraught and stressed to the gills to get for additional information.  They are suffering enough with cancer.  It should be a bottom-line requirement that they need a medical card and that the Government would have the goodwill to give them one.</p></speech>

One concern in terms of taking a one-disease approach is the question of what about other chronic diseases.  A number of Deputies have articulated on behalf of cancer patients.  The Minister for Health will examine that prior to the next budget but there is then an issue in terms of parity with other chronic diseases from which people suffer.  In health, there are many complexities around issues such as this.</p></speech>

What review of policy will be undertaken to ensure we have an adequate number of hospital beds over the coming years?  What progress is being made with regard to the elective hospital in Cork?  The report on this has gone to the Minister for Health.  My understanding is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also has to sign off on it.  Here we are, still without a site identified or a timescale.  Even if it was announced in the morning, the Taoiseach must accept that it will take us three years at least before a sod will be turned, unless we make a decision on this matter.

It is not just since Covid.  It has been happening for years.  There has been carryover year on year.  In County Louth alone, 711 outstanding applications have been waiting for years to be dealt with, including elderly people.  It is so bad that only some people in category A, the most severe cases, are being dealt with.  The Government says it wants elderly people to live independently but to do that, it has to back that up with sufficient funding and deal with the backlog.  Every single application, whether it is somebody who cannot access stairs or needs a wet room downstairs, represents a person with mobility and health issues.  Having to wait years to get this simple adjustment to allow someone to live independently is quite shameful.  What plans does the Government have?  I am not talking about the funding the Government currently gives.</p></speech>

It is a great opportunity for my friends from Cork in the industry to visit the venue.  That got the Taoiseach's attention.  One of the issues the confederation has been pressing is the requirement for the 9% VAT rate to be retained beyond September.  As the Taoiseach knows, the plan is to return to the 13.5% rate from September onwards.  The inflationary impact of that will be highly detrimental to Irish tourism and hospitality.  It will certainly be very difficult for many enterprises, especially in the current climate of uncertainty.  I ask the Government to urgently review the situation with a view to retaining the 9% rate beyond September.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that barely scratched the surface of the littering scourge affecting beaches around Ireland.  Littering is also not the only issue.  A major issue is the lack of provision of toilet facilities at beaches.  The Taoiseach is very familiar with the beaches of west Cork, such as Long Strand and Barleycove, which are some of the more popular beaches and do not have toilet facilities.  Furthermore, there is going to be a chronic issue with parking facilities.  The days are lengthening, the sun is shining and, thankfully, people are shortly going to be flocking to the beaches of west Cork.  The provision of services is lacking, however, and I would love to see a larger fund being provided to tackle issues such as the lack of parking, littering and the provision of toilet facilities.  By the way, the solution to the parking issue is not necessarily the provision of extra parking spaces.  It could involve directing active travel funding towards greenways and pedestrian access to beaches.</p></speech>

The walk and swim are part of the one solid continuum, if the Deputy understands what I mean.  It is much better for you.  Regarding littering, some good initiatives have been undertaken voluntarily as well.  I see volunteer groups around the country that gather litter on beaches.  Human behaviour is the key to this issue, but we will look at the funding issue as well.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about parking and connecting that aspect with active travel so that investment of that type would be put in at and near beaches such as Rosscarbery, Inchydoney etc. We should put funding behind such initiatives that would encourage people to park perhaps miles back and then walk to the beach, where that is practical and feasible.  I am sure Deputy Michael Healy-Rae would agree with that.</p></speech>

I refer to the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs.  In one area, for example, which serves Edenderry and Mountmellick, one of the teams has seven full-time vacancies.  Another team has four vacancies at Riverside in Tullamore, while the highest level of full-time vacancies is in the Spraoi Centre in Portlaoise.  I gather these are vacancies that have existed for some time.  Children are being failed and they are not getting access to vital therapies, such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  I ask the Taoiseach if he could please intervene urgently in this matter.  I recognise that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing everything in her power, but the HSE is not collaborating.  That seems to be a big issue.  I appeal to the Taoiseach please to intervene as quickly as possible because children are being failed.  I ask the Taoiseach please to take action to ensure we get to the bottom of this.</p></speech>

An additional &euro;65 million was provided in 2022 for disability services, so we must now get delivery on that.

This is a circus, as one newspaper put it, but where is the ringmaster?  This is similar to the situation in housing, where it is necessary for people in Kerry to wait for 15 years for a one- or two-bedroom house.  It is also similar to the situation in health, where there are now no consultants dealing with adult psychiatric services and we are having teleconferences from Croatia.</p>  <p>  The Government has failed to plan and failed even to have a medium-term plan.  The retrofitting scheme is a joke.  In the west, two thirds of households rely on home heating oil, but the Government has failed to tackle its rising cost.  It has also failed to consult with the turf cutters, and those who rely on turf, before announcing the death of their livelihoods.  To paraphrase a Billy Bragg song regarding another fuel, which side is the Taoiseach on and which side are his Government backbenchers on?

This issue was brought to light in a case taken to the Workplace Relations Committee, WRC, by a former personal trainer with FLYEfit.  Another personal trainer, who works for Ben Dunne, contacted me.  The situation was the same in both cases.  Personal trainers have to pay about &euro;2,500 to qualify as a personal trainer.  After that, they must do 12 hours a week of free labour, which involves either cleaning duties or providing free training classes.  That free labour is supposedly to make up the rent to allow people to work as personal trainers out of the gym.  Therefore, these personal trainers pay for their qualifications and then they must provide free labour for the gyms to enable them to work in them.  Will the Government take steps to ensure that the minimum wage legislation is applied in this area and that no free labour is expected of these personal trainers?</p></speech>

Regarding the Passport Office website, it states that first-time applications will take 35 working days to process, which is seven weeks.  I have continuously found, however, that passports can take much longer than this to process.  Nothing is wrong with those applications and no further information is requested.  The staff working on the urgent TD line are absolutely brilliant.  I compliment them and thank them for their work.</p></speech>

In recent days I had a lady who needed her passport for a work trip but was told they could not do anything to help her.  It was a paper form standard renewal, not a first-time application.  The Department needs to highlight that first-time passport applications are taking 35 days and a lot longer.  Will the Taoiseach please try to do something with the Passport Office and resource it more?  They are very excellent people; this is not critical of them.</p></speech>

There are 111 patients on trolleys this morning and there were 113 yesterday.  I urge him to expedite a proactive measure.  The Taoiseach is aware that a block for 96 acute beds is in the capital plan for University Hospital Limerick.  UHL estates has gone to tender at this time.  It is with HSE corporate, seeking approval to allow it to appoint a contractor to commence the building.  It is an 18-month build.  I ask the Government to support this approval by the HSE being expedited.  We need to have shovels on the ground and we need to have that hospital in place.  If they commence building on it straight away, we can have that block up and running by the end of 2023.</p></speech>

Passport service staff numbers have increased by more than 300 since June 2021.  There is a competition under way at the moment which, when completed, will see staffing numbers of 900.  That is a doubling of staff numbers since last summer.  It is engaging in intensive training and so on.  In excess of 400,000 passports have been issued since 1 January.  That is compared with a total of 634,000 passports issued in the entire 12 months of 2021.  It is experiencing a very high volume of applications.  Last week the passport service reduced the processing time for first-time applications from 35 working days to 30 working days.  That follows an initial reduction from 40 working days.  Progress is being made but I will take what the Deputy said back to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We are very concerned about it and conscious of it.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Donnell, the Minister for Health is engaging with the HSE in respect of the challenges at University Hospital Limerick.  We will do everything we can to progress the capital works at the hospital and in health generally.</p></speech>

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle herself and Deputy Canney for co-signing the Bill.</p><p>We know that more than 2,500 people died of Covid-19 in nursing homes since the start of the Covid crisis.  We also know that the majority of people who died in this State caught Covid either in a nursing home or in a hospital.  That is an incredible thing.  It means people under the protection of institutions either owned or regulated by the State were the most vulnerable in this crisis and the most exposed in what happened.  I cannot think of another occasion in this history of the State when so many people died in an institution in such a short time.</p><p>I also believe very serious mistakes were made when it came to the management of nursing homes during the Covid crisis.  For example, on 10 March 2020, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, said that restrictions around visitation in nursing homes were not necessary.  This had the effect of an instruction to nursing homes to reopen their doors.  Another issue was brought to light by Deputy Donnelly, who was as Opposition Deputy at the time.  He said the HSE intercepted supplies of oxygen and staff that were designated for nursing homes.  A large bundle of documents has been released to Aont&uacute; under freedom of information.  They reveal how Paul Reid did not reply to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for a full month when she raised concerns around a staffing crisis in nursing homes.  The documents from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, also show there was a concerted and large-scale discharge of patients from hospitals into nursing homes at the start of the pandemic.  The HSE cannot confirm to me whether these patients were tested for Covid before they were transferred.  We see in correspondence between the Minister and the CEO of HIQA that some of the outbreaks in nursing homes can be linked to hospital transfers.  When he was Minister for Health, Deputy Harris repeatedly ignored requests for meetings by the CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, Mr. Tadhg Daly.  Nursing homes were going on social media pleading for help with staff.</p><p>I also want to raise the case of the whistleblower from St. Mary's facility in the Phoenix Park.  That individual made a protected disclosure, an investigation was triggered, a report was generated by a consulting company on behalf of the HSE and the report is written.  However, the HSE has instructed that company not to disclose the report to the whistleblower.  Given that the whistleblower has gone to serious personal cost to herself to expose the issues that triggered the investigation, I do not understand why a third party cannot see the report.</p><p>If passed, this Aont&uacute; Bill would ensure these issues would be examined properly by the commission.  It would ensure we look at every single thing that has happened around those tragic losses of life in nursing homes in this State.  It would focus on the decision-making process.  It would also include all the decision makers.  It would be done to find out what went wrong in those situations.  Most importantly, it would be done to make sure those mistakes never happen again.  The problem I have is that, right up until October 2021, six months ago, we were seeing the same mistakes in the fourth wave of Covid being repeated again in those nursing homes.  The serious lessons that happened were not learned by the Government.</p><p>The Government has proposed its own look back and analysis on this situation.  It does not do it in the form of a commission of investigation.  No structure seems to have been developed in respect of this.  The Government has also excluded many of the key decision makers from being looked back on in this investigation.  The Chief Medical Officer, for example, and the head of the HSE are not to be included in the Government's look back.  I believe this is a really serious issue and everybody who makes decisions must be investigated and their decisions understood.  The families of those who died in nursing homes deserve answers.  They deserve complete transparency.  They are not getting it at the moment.  If we proceed with the Government's plan, that transparency will never happen.  I urge all parties in this Chamber to support the Bill and make sure it has a speedy transit through the D&aacute;il so that those families, those victims and survivors, can get to the truth.</p></speech>

The Secretary General will be taking up his new position shortly.  Can the Taoiseach confirm the status of the investigation, if it has been completed and if he intends to publish its findings and recommendations?  It will be important for the Taoiseach to communicate the report's outcomes and recommendations to survivors and their families in the first instance.  The leaking of the report was deeply hurtful, disrespectful and wholly inappropriate.  In effect, the leaker put headlines ahead of people's dignity and rights.  Survivors and their families are entitled to a formal conclusion to this sorry episode.</p>  <p>  I want to record my party's disappointment over the Government's decision to retain the deeply offensive mandatory information section in the birth information and tracing legislation.  Over the Easter break, the Irish Association of Social Workers added its voice to the call to remove this regressive provision from the legislation.  It has described it as a discriminatory and unnecessary measure that will cause further harm to those affected by forced family separation.  There is still time for the Government to act.  In that spirit, I urge the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues to support the Opposition's amendments to remove the provision from the legislation.</p></speech>

The Government did not oppose it.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government supports the objective of this Bill.  I assure the Deputy that my officials and I will work with him to determine the best approach to achieve these objectives. </blockquote>  <p>He also said officials from the Health and Safety Authority and his Department would like the opportunity to meet me before Committee Stage and that he would call me that afternoon.  I am still waiting for the phone call and the meeting.</p><p>We do not need to pass the Bill because the Government could do what is desired by regulation.  We would be happy for it to use regulations to establish standards for clean air quality.  Short of regulations and in terms of information, why is the Government not promoting ventilation and filtration among businesses, schools and colleges?  Covid is still with us and killing people.  We need to do everything we can to be as safe as possible and to have as little disruption to society as possible.  The most obvious and scientifically clear things to do are wearing masks and having ventilation and filtration.  Why is there no Government messaging around these key issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700028#AA01100"><p>On information from the Government, the latest figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, show rents have increased by an average of 9% across the country.  The increase is much higher in some areas.  The average rent in Dublin is now almost &euro;2,000 per month, or almost &euro;24,000 per year.  As the Taoiseach knows, a significant number of people renting are in low-paid or minimum-wage jobs.  Annual rents in Dublin are now in excess of the gross annual earnings of people in minimum-wage jobs.  They are utterly unaffordable.  The number of people becoming homeless is increasing month after month.  This is mainly a result of unaffordable rents in the private rental sector.  The Government was not even remotely close to meeting the targets it set for the delivery of social, affordable and cost-rental homes last year.  Does the Taoiseach honestly think people will be able to continue to afford these unaffordable rents, let alone the hefty rent increases?  What action is the Government going to take to stop these rent increases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700028#AA01200"><p>On Deputy Mac Lochlainn's question, the inquiry is not completed.  We have to await the recommendations that flow from it.</p>  <p>  On the mandatory provision in the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, the Deputy has to accept that the Bill represents a dramatic advancement on previous Bills circulated in previous D&aacute;ileanna regarding this issue.  It represents a transformative approach to giving everyone full access to their records.  The legal advice is that it was necessary to include the provision, even though it is light enough compared to what was in previous Bills.  In my view, the legislation is very progressive and gives the access required in terms of people's right to their birth information.  In fairness to the Minister, great progress has been made by way of the Information and Tracing Bill, the burials legislation, the payments scheme legislation and the new centre for archiving, memorialisation and research in respect of all institutional abuse, but also in terms of the revitalisation of the inner city.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Paul Murphy's point, we have appointed Professor John Wenger to the Covid oversight group with a view to giving a higher profile to ventilation in meeting the ongoing challenge of Covid-19.  I accept Covid-19 has not gone away.  We need to take this opportunity now to determine the optimal way, in the business sector but also in schools and public State facilities, to use ventilation to combat Covid-19 and, perhaps, other infectious diseases.  I will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, about the legislation Deputy Paul Murphy has produced.  The idea behind the Covid oversight group we have established is to give a more multidisciplinary approach to the next phase of Covid-19.  One of our challenges might be next autumn and winter.  Coronaviruses tend to become worse during the winter because we are more indoors.  I am very anxious that the new oversight group consider this and come back to the Government with recommendations regarding it.  That is one additional element we can perhaps do better on in the next phase, although the expertise will be particularly important.  The Deputy will recall that HEPA filters were identified as the holy grail for what could be done in schools but others say they are not necessarily as effective as we might have thought.  Therefore, we need more expertise on ventilation in public facilities and schools.  I will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, in that regard.  I am not sure but within existing health and safety regulations there should be provisions for regulations.  I will consider this in terms of Deputy Paul Murphy's legislation.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point on rents and the RTB index, the index relates to new tenancies in the first instance, but the figures are very worrying.  I accept that rents are too high in the country.  Particularly for younger people coming into the market, the burden is extremely onerous.  As far as I am concerned, housing represents the single greatest social crisis facing the country.  Covid-19 did not help in that we closed down construction fully in 2020 for three to four months and again in 2021 because of the Alpha variant.  That said, there has been a significant rebound in housing activity.</p> <p>There were 35,000 commencements between March 2021 and March 2022.  I believe we need to be at 35,000 per annum annually.  In addition to that, we have to bring in other forms of housing.  The Minister is introducing the shared equity scheme to help people purchase houses.  Cost rental is coming on stream.  I would argue that the cost rental initiative could perhaps be over time the most significant intervention we could make to enable people to have access to rental accommodation at an affordable level at scale.  At the moment it is not at scale.  A critical mass of cost rental housing is not available at the moment.  The Minister has identified it in Housing for All and is very clear it will be a significant part of the rental situation into the future.  That will be important.</p> <p> On the supply side, there is cost rental, social housing and private housing.  We have to look at the private housing side as well as private investment.  People will, at varying times, criticise landlords and institutional investors.  We need all strands of housing to work to deal with this issue.  There has to be room for private institutional investment.  Landlords are leaving the market at the moment.  If we compare the numbers this year with last year, they have gone down again.  We need far more social housing.  We want to deliver 9,000 social housing units this year.  That will be done through approved housing bodies and local authorities.</p> <p> The only constraint we have at the moment will be the increase in the cost of building materials and inflation in the housing sector.  That is coming back to us.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is examining the public tender situation in terms of existing tenders and people tendering for various projects to make sure they are flexible enough to accommodate the extraordinary surge in pricing and the shortage of materials arising from the imbalance between supply and demand due to Covid-19 and the war on Ukraine, which will have an impact on us from now until the end of the year.  That would be my biggest concern in respect of the housing situation, namely, inflationary pressures and the impact on the supply of building materials throughout the country.  That could have an impact in respect of housing supply.  We are very determined to get to the 9,000 social housing figure in 2022.</p> <p> In terms of private housing development, I am determined we will see more pick-up in the sector.  The skills have come back.  Apprenticeships in construction trades have increased significantly.  We need to maintain that momentum.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has done good work in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the skills side and has worked with further education, including SOLAS and the technological universities, on the provision of apprenticeships for construction.</p> <p> A figure of 35,000 commencements illustrates a significant momentum beginning to build.  The only possible constraint on that will be inflationary pressures arising from the war on Ukraine and the imbalance between supply and demand arising as economies emerge from Covid.</p> <p> On homelessness, we need a deeper analysis.  The Deputy has a particular interest in homelessness.  We need a deeper analysis of the components that make up homelessness in the modern era.  There are challenges in terms of new arrivals and so on that will put pressure on emergency housing.  It would be worth having the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage look more deeply at the situation because it is now a factor in the increasing levels of homelessness.  There are different component elements to the homelessness figures.  The initiatives that have been taken and the interaction between the Minister and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, involved in homelessness is bearing fruit, in terms of Housing First policies, which are having a significant impact and are the way to go into the future in respect of the homelessness issue.  We need to understand what we are talking about when we talk about homelessness.  It has many more different facets in the modern area than it would have had in previous times.  That will continue.  That is the way it is within the European Union.  We have to accept those realities.  We have to make sure we get families out of homelessness as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

How on earth can we justify the approach of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, referring to European Union directives in asking the masters of fishing vessels to turn blue whiting for human consumption in markets not just in west Africa but also Ukraine, into fishmeal to feed salmon?  This is an affordable form of protein and nutrition and it is processed in factories in Killybegs, which creates jobs.  The Taoiseach is aware of this.  Deputy Doherty has brought this to his attention, yet it still goes on.  In recent days, 100,000 tonnes were turned into fishmeal.  I ask the Taoiseach, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, to intervene urgently with the European authorities to get this sorted out.  This is not a European issue; it is an Irish issue.</p></speech>

I heard the answer the Taoiseach gave to Deputy Richmond yesterday, when he said he would prefer not to comment at this time as the campaigning for the assembly election is taking place.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask instead about the ongoing horrific situation in Ukraine, specifically the issue of war crimes.  It is abundantly clear to everyone at this stage that Russia is using illegal methods to defeat the Ukrainian population.  Civilians, including children, are being targeted and killed.  Illegal bombs are being deployed.  Schools, medical facilities and train stations are being blown up.  President Zelenskyy has said that genocide is taking place in his country.  This needs to be investigated by the International Criminal Court, its investigators and others on the ground in Ukraine.  The European Union needs to address this particular matter and assist and support efforts to prove that war crimes have taken place and to bring about prosecutions of those responsible for these actions.  I hope that is something the Taoiseach could call for at the next European Council meeting in June.</p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach be prepared to say something at this stage about the decision of the Russian authorities to stop gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and the efforts of the EU to reduce dependency on Russian gas?</p></speech>

Sadly, since the end of February, we have witnessed daily on our television screens the horrors being inflicted on an independent and sovereign country by an evil regime in Russia.</p> <p>Sadly, we have seen suffering and loss of life and millions of people displaced.  I was glad that at the most recent meeting of the European Council there was a very strong and firm commitment by the European Union expressing its unity of purpose, along with partners such as Britain, the United States and other members of the international community.  It is important that sanctions are imposed and that they have a major adverse impact on Russia.  It is also important that the European Union continues to show solidarity with the refugees.  I compliment the people of this country on their support for people fleeing war and horror and victims of an evil regime.  Despite those challenges and the situation currently faced by the European Union and the international community, it is still important that the European Union progresses and accelerates the candidacy of Ukraine for membership of the European Union, as the Taoiseach stated, and, similarly, speeds up the membership applications of Georgia and Moldova.  Like Deputy Haughey, I recognise that energy costs and supplies are having a significant impact on households and businesses and we need further measures at European Union level.</p></speech>

France is a nuclear power and the second most powerful nation in the European Union.  There needs to be debate and reflection as to why this was the case.  France is often portrayed as a society with a strong tradition of revolution and left-wing politics but it is also a country with a history of imperialism, the racism that goes with that, and right-wing traditions.  Le Pen, like her father before her, taps into those traditions.  The cost of living was a significant issue in the campaign.  In France, as in Ireland, the crisis has been addressed at Government level merely by piecemeal measures that have failed to seriously relieve the suffering of the people.  The failure of the self-described extreme centrist, Macron, left an opening for both the far right and the radical left.  Another factor was how Le Pen's opponent was widely, and in my view correctly, seen as a president of the rich or the 1%.  Malcolm X once stated, "You cannot have capitalism without racism."  The far right cannot be seriously combated by a more moderate right which upholds that system which funnels wealth upwards and leaves the majority to scrap among themselves for a limited number of services, houses and jobs.  To really fight the radical right, one needs a radical left that is prepared to challenge that system and unite all of the oppressed in fighting for change.  That is the key lesson of the French presidential election.  What is the view of the Taoiseach in that regard?</p></speech>

This is a very serious scandal in the Spanish state involving a significant number of Catalan politicians and activists, including the Catalan President, legislators and every Catalan MEP who supported independence for Catalonia, being targeted with mercenary spyware.  This happened either directly or through suspected off-centre targeting that involves spouses, siblings, staff or parents.  The fact that the targeting coincided with political events, namely, the referendum, raises clear suspicions in respect of who would benefit from it and suggests that it was being done by the Spanish state.  At least 65 individuals were targeted.  The office of the Spanish Prime Minister has claimed it was not aware of the operation but according to the group that produced the spyware programme, known as Pegasus, it is sold exclusively to governments.  That, among other reasons, implies the Spanish state was responsible.  Does the Taoiseach agree this would represent a very serious infringement of the democratic rights of people to campaign for Catalan independence?  Does he agree there should be an official inquiry to determine who authorised the hacking?</p></speech>

A no-deal Brexit would have been ruinous and had appalling consequences for our fishing industry.  Brexit has led to a reduction, particularly in terms of the pelagic fleet, because of decommissioning and so on but, in fairness to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, he has worked with the industry and the Department to try to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of the allocation of funding to the industry in respect of that and also the other issues that continue to arise in respect of regulatory frameworks governing the weighing of fish, for example, and all of that.  There have been challenges and Commission investigations.  We want to work with the fishing industry to develop a stronger relationship with the European Commission in the fullness of time and to have the proper regulatory frameworks in place and be in a position to develop the industry because it is a very important industry in our coastal communities.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, regarding the specific issues the Deputy has raised.  I know he is working on them.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised the issues of the Northern protocol and the horrific situation in Ukraine.  As I stated yesterday, it is important that all Governments adhere to international agreements and work with like-minded Governments on any issues of concern.  I am conscious of the electoral cycle at the moment.  There is an upcoming election to the Assembly and the Executive and I would prefer to hold back comments on those general issues until after the election.</p>  <p>  As regards Ukraine and the International Criminal Court, we have allocated &euro;3 million in additional funding to strengthen the resources of the court.  We believe war crimes have been committed in Ukraine - there is no question about that - and the people responsible need to be brought to account.  I met the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Shannon last Wednesday and assured him of our strongest possible support for Ukraine, including providing supports for those who have arrived in Ireland having had to flee their homes. I also made clear my support for Ukraine's application to join the European Union and for the further sixth round of sanctions against Russia.  We have joined 40 countries in referring what is happening in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court and we will look at other ways that we can get accountability for these heinous crimes.</p>  <p>  The European Union has provided &euro;1.5 billion of a package of European peace facility support for the Ukrainian armed forces.  Ireland is contributing its full share of &euro;33 million, which will go towards non-lethal elements.  Discussions on further sanctions continue, particularly with regard to banning imports of oil from Russia.  We will continue to support the widest possible sanctions.  Ireland has frozen more than &euro;1.2 billion of Russian assets as of 22 April and the European Union amended existing sanctions to better facilitate humanitarian access and work in Ukraine, including by the International Committee of the Red Cross, UN agencies and certain humanitarian organisations.  The Government has provided &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid through the UN and NGO partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  A deep and dedicated Ukraine civil society fund of &euro;2 million will specifically support Irish NGOs responding to the crisis.  Deputy Brendan Smith also raised issues relating to this.</p>  <p>  The Russian invasion is also now putting immense pressure on global food and nutrition security, driving up prices for essential food and agricultural commodities.  The worst impact will be felt by the poorest counties as well as those that are reliant on imports for their food security.  As I stated earlier in the House, energy, food and a migration crisis are part of the war effort of the Russian Federation and that is designed to put pressure on European member states or, in other words, to take the pressure off the Russian Federation ultimately, but that will not happen.  I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith that we need to accelerate the application by Ukraine for membership of the European Union and I have articulated that, as well as for other countries in the neighbourhood, such as Georgia and Moldova.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Barry, I would maybe argue a bit differently - that what we witnessed in the French election was the triumph of the centre.  I think President Macron stuck to his principles and values.  I do not see him as a right-wing leader at all, which Deputy Barry more or less asserted that he is.  I communicated my strongest and warmest congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his decisive victory in the French presidential election.  I think he has been a strong leader of France and within the European Union as well.  I think it was important for the European Union that he was elected because he is a committed and passionate upholder of the values of the Union.  He is, in my view, genuinely a principled leader.  That is something I would have to say.  There are challenges, including the whole area of misinformation and disinformation and the growth of right-wing politics across Europe and the world.  There are many factors responsible for that and I take the Deputy's point about cost of living and so on being a dominant element of the election.  The radical left also did reasonably well in the first round of voting.</p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the Catalangate issue.  The Spanish Government has made clear it was not involved.  The Pegasus software has been used widely across the world.  It is a matter for the Spanish authorities and political system to deal with.  I will seek to be briefed further on the matter but that is the current situation in regard to it.</p></speech>

He met with a cross-party delegation of councillors from Donegal, Derry and Strabane.  At that meeting, the issue of the funding of City of Derry Airport was put to him.  It was welcomed by those present that he said he would look at the shared island initiative as a potential source of funding.  Why is this so essential?  A total of 40% of the passengers who use City of Derry Airport are from Donegal.  It has connections to London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow and a number of other locations in Europe.  It services a population of half a million.  As the Taoiseach knows, the geography of Donegal means that people in Inishowen, Letterkenny and Finn Valley use City of Derry Airport and those in the rest of the county would use the airport in west Donegal.  We have not seen the delivery of the A5 project.  It has been a heartbreaker that the whole project just has not come through.  We do not have a rail connection from the fourth largest city, with half a million people, to our capital city of Dublin.  There is no motorway, no rail connection and, for the past ten years, no air connection.</p>  <p>  This project is essential and I appeal to the Taoiseach to work with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to whom, as well as to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I spoke in this Chamber last night.  I made the same appeal to them that they work together with the Taoiseach, through the shared island initiative, to deliver funding to the airport.  That would mean we can get this region of half a million people to connect to Dublin Airport and the rest of the world.  It is not just about commuting to Dublin.  It is about connecting to the rest of the world and ensuring tourists and the rest of the world can connect, through Dublin, on to Derry and into the north west.  It is vital.  It is about equality of access.  I know the Taoiseach understands this but we really need the issue to be tackled once and for all.  It has been ten years of delays and we need it sorted out.</p></speech>

Minutes from a meeting of the board show that, on 9 March, the deputy chairman of the board presided over a three-person board meeting that rejected a strategic housing development planning application.  Both the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and The Ditch website have reported that this member of the board failed to declare a conflict of interest, as shown in the minutes, even though he has a 25% stake in the company that owns a site just 50 m from the site of the planning application.  Given these serious allegations, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, at the very least, should make a comment on them and respond to them.  Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has had nothing at all to say about this?  Will he call on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to respond to these allegations and make a comment?</p></speech>

A public meeting in Cork on this issue was recently told by a primary school principal that 60 therapists have been cut from Cork schools since the introduction of the State's seemingly misnamed progressing disability services scheme.  The meeting also was told many heartbreaking tales of children who had to wait and wait for assessments of needs, those whose parents were forced to pay, and pay big, to go private and those who have been left behind because their parents simply cannot afford to pay.  In recent days, the Minister for Health has intervened in a row between the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, Deputy Rabbitte, and the HSE on the issue of her right to meet directly with district managers of these services.  The parents and children who will march on Friday week will care far more about service delivery and results than about who is meeting whom at senior level.  What hope can the Taoiseach offer these parents today as they polish up their marching boots and prepare to take to the streets in just nine days' time, which is something they should never even have to consider given the pressures on them?</p></speech>

Energia began consulting with planning officials in February 2021, with Deputy Bruton having been Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment up to the previous June.  Energia made &euro;45 million in profit last year and, last month, it announced price increases of 15%.  Recently, Deputy Bruton dismissed any suggestions that energy companies should absorb higher costs to protect households from higher energy costs.  On 19 October 2021, Deputy Bruton asked the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, when a price for selling back solar energy to the grid will be put in place.  That was eight months after Energia's consultations with planning officials had begun, but Deputy Bruton did not declare any interest in the potential solar farm development taking place on his land.  It is not in the register of Members' interests and he did not declare it orally at any stage.  Does the Taoiseach agree there is an issue with the declaration of interest and that Deputy Bruton should make such a declaration of interest, if the story is accurate, so that people understand this?</p></speech>

I think it is a very progressive group that leaves politics outside the door and its members do a lot of good work in terms of the economic and social development of the north west.  We had a very good meeting in respect of commitments North and South and, in particular, how the shared island unit can be of assistance in the development of the region.  We announced at that meeting a &euro;5 million allocation to local authorities North and South to prepare feasibility studies and bring proof of concept to many projects that potentially could become a pipeline of projects.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The specific issue of City of Derry Airport was raised by the group.  I will engage further with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the matter.  We would be interested in working on it with the aviation authorities and airlines to get a service going.  It would be a good idea to get a service going between Derry and Dublin because there is the issue of connectivity generally around the north west.  The Minister has commissioned, and the shared island unit is funding, an all-island railway feasibility study.  We are prepared to fund the A5 but it seems bogged down in planning issues.  I take Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point about the connectivity issue, that if you can get a flight to Dublin, you can get flights across Europe and the world more generally.  I would be anxious to work with all concerned to see if we can advance that.  I am very struck by the cohesion within the north-west region.  The group was chaired by the DUP, and all political parties were represented.  The group has been working for quite a long time on economic and social issues, health, education and so forth.  I had a very good visit to Altnagelvin Hospital.  Previous governments have put &euro;19 million into the cancer treatment centre in Altnagelvin.  I saw the cardiac cath labs there, which are available to people in the north west, Donegal in particular.  It just makes a lot of sense to try to support such groups, and the shared island unit stands ready to do that.<br/><br/>In respect of the issue Deputy Cian O'Callaghan raised about An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will examine that.  There may be issues there that need to be examined further or clarified.  I think it would be in everybody's interest if the situation were clarified.  I will ask the Minister again about the issue Deputy O'Callaghan has raised.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Barry, there was a meeting between the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the principals of the schools and Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan a number of weeks ago.  There has also been a meeting between the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the principals of Cork schools, I understand, in recent days on this issue.  I have long been of the view, even before I became Taoiseach, that progressing disability services should not dilute resources in special schools in respect of therapists.  My understanding is that following a recent meeting between the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the principals, or a representative of the principals, and the disability managers, work will now progress between the principals and the disability manager in respect of posts that were lost as a result of the application of the progressing disability services model as to what number of posts there were prior to the application of that model.  My view is that they should be restored.  I also intend to convene meetings with the HSE more generally and the Minister of State in respect of disability policy and the retention of therapists within special schools.<br/><br/>Progressing disability services was promoted a long time ago, many years ago, probably due to absences of resources.  It has taken a long time to progress, but the model the HSE has put forward is the idea that there is a central assessment and treatment centre and that one provides as broad a range of services to the broadest range of people possible.  One of the challenges with that is that, historically, special schools had multidisciplinary teams.  They had therapists, teachers and so on.  I have always been consistently of the view that progressing disability services should not dilute what the special schools had.  There is a pilot project in primary schools, which was brought in over two or three years ago, for which I advocated strongly, whereby schools hire therapists within primary schools with a view to having that multidisciplinary team <i>in situ</i>.  That is a model we should explore further.  We need to stand back and reflect on these initiatives and these policies because the parents concerned are understandably angry about the loss of access to therapists, as are the schools.  Equally, however, in respect of the provision of disability services more generally, we need to examine other issues with the delivery of services through the section 38 and section 39 bodies.  There needs to be a broader examination of that.<br/><br/>My understanding is that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has now initiated a process with the schools in Cork and the disability manager in the HSE with a view to trying to rectify the situation in the best interests of the schools and the principals.  I will ask the Minister of State about the matter again.  I will come back to the House on that, and I know that the Minister of State is anxious to progress it.  I am not clear that the number of therapists is 60, but we will work on the numbers.  The idea will be to try to restore things back to the situation pre-application of the model.<br/><br/>Deputy Paul Murphy raised issues regarding Deputy Bruton.  I am not familiar with the full details Deputy Murphy has articulated, and I believe these are matters for the House more generally to consider in respect of Members registering their interests.  I have always found Deputy Bruton to be a public representative of the highest integrity.  Again, I am not familiar with the specifics of what Deputy Murphy has asserted in the House this morning.  I believe there are mechanisms within the Oireachtas itself to deal with issues of that kind.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700033#LL00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am delighted to open the debate and the deliberations of the House on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022.  The proposals I am presenting in the Bill are transformative and I believe they will provide for deep and wide-ranging reform.</p>  <p>  The reformed appointments system will be seen to clearly emphasise the principles of meritocracy and independence.  It is designed to meet both our own constitutional standards and the standards set by the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, regarding independence and the rule of law in judicial appointments.  The overarching change is that all appointments to any court in the State will be based on recommendations from the new commission.  The Government discretion to appoint will be from a limited choice of three candidates.  This will be for every judicial office in the State, right up through the courts system to the office of the Chief Justice.  Every judge wishing to be considered for appointment to a higher judicial office must apply to the commission.  They cannot be appointed by the Government without a recommendation by the commission.  Indeed, no one can be appointed a judge without applying to the commission and being recommended.  In an important adjustment to the general scheme of the Bill, the Bill incorporates into the commission's remit recommendations for nominations by the Government to courts outside of the State and this includes the CJEU and the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.</p>  <p>  We should not take our strong record for judicial excellence and independence for granted.  We are very well served by the Judiciary and we are fortunate in that regard.  However, it is time to underpin that with a strengthened appointments system.   Deputies will know how important it is to review and to strengthen the structure and organisation we have around the entire justice area.  I am committed to that.  This is just as much as the case when it comes to the central part played by our judges in every court in the State and where we are involved outside of the State.  The approach that is being proposed by the Government will require interviews to be carried out and will make training and continuous professional development mandatory for those seeking to be appointed.   This represents a significant limiting of the discretion that the Government will have.  The Bill will also ensure that we will continue to have a strong, independent Judiciary in this country, which is a cornerstone of any liberal democracy.</p>  <p>  We have moved on from the 2017 Bill, on which I believe this Bill is an improvement, on the basis of reforms which are required in the area of judicial appointments.  Today's Bill, like previous Bills, is about setting up a new commission to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, as well as to recommend persons for appointment as judges by the President on the advice of the Government under the Constitution.  Unlike the earlier Bill, the 2022 Bill provides for a smaller nine-person commission, which I believe would be more effective than the earlier proposal of a 17-person commission.  The remit of the commission is now wider, and the new process is substantially different from what had been planned previously, with the make-up of the commission very different.  I will explain how I believe the outcome will be an improvement on the approach that had been previously envisaged.  </p> <p>As I set out the overall view of the Bill, I will focus on the adaptation of the general scheme where that is relevant.  <br/><br/>Part 1 deals with interpretation, including some key definitions and other standard introductory matters.  Part 2 is about the commission itself.  Deputies will be aware that previous legislation, or certainly the debate on it, seemed at times to be very focused on the membership of the commission including, in particular, the balance of lay and judicial membership and the chairing arrangements.  The programme for Government commitment to bring forward this reform was very clear.  The new commission is to be chaired by the Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice has chaired the JAAB for in the region of 25 years.  I take this opportunity to thank the Chief Justice and his predecessors and all of their JAAB colleagues for all of their work over that period.  One of the first requests I made, in looking at the older legislation, was that my Department look again at the composition of equivalent bodies internationally and consider what the European Commission and the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe were saying on this subject.  Canada and its different provinces, for example, appear to me to be strong on representing particular lay interests and the Northern Ireland model provides guidance on the balance of lay and judicial involvement.  Our 1995 Act provides for three lay members out of a total membership of ten and later, three out of 11 in total when the President of the Court of Appeal was added.  Enhanced outside expertise, which can be provided through lay involvement, will be an important addition to the commission.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that an equivalent of judicial and lay members is best, with one of the judicial members being the Chief Justice, as chairperson, with the requirements for lay membership being as practical and flexible as needs be, as section 13 demonstrates.  Court presidents, as required, should be members when the relevant recommendations are being made, with the President of the Court of Appeal being a permanent member.  I note that the Oireachtas Committee stated that section 9(1) would operate as follows.  When, for example, recommendations for appointment to the High Court are subject to the commission's deliberations, the President of the High Court will become a member of the commission instead, temporarily, of the President of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose.  This is a common-sense approach.<br/><br/>Section 12 will provide for the nomination of two judicial members by the Judicial Council.  The Bill provides for one male and one female judge.  One of these judges will be a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or High Court and one will be a judge of the Circuit or District Court.  Of the two judges, one shall have been a practising barrister and one shall have been a practising solicitor at the time of their appointment as judges.  The latter aspect will bring the understanding, knowledge and background of the relevant legal professions to the task of making informed recommendations when those judges are nominated by the council and appointed by the Minister to the commission.  The Attorney General will be a non-voting member, bringing the total membership of the commission to nine.  <br/><br/>On composition and gender balance, other than <i>ex officio</i>members, I have provided for a male and female nominee of the Judicial Council and section 13 provides that the selection criteria shall have regard to the need that recommendations for appointment by the Minister of the four lay members comprise an equal number of men and women as well as also reflecting the diversity of the population as a whole.<br/><br/>Under Part 2, I want to ensure that the commission has a particular obligation to set out its strategy for the achievement of the diversity objectives set out in section 39.  In an addition to the general scheme, section 28 provides that the commission will publish a diversity statement not later than two years after the coming into operation of that section and thereafter at least once in every four-year period or less.  The diversity statement shall include the procedures put in place to achieve the diversity objective, including how they will assist to remove barriers faced by persons who are under-represented in judicial office.  I carefully considered the outcome of pre-legislative scrutiny in this matter.  These sections of the Bill complement the commitments I have set out in Justice Plan 2022, which commits to bringing forward proposals to drive reform of legal education.  These will include removing barriers to entering the legal profession, increasing diversity and introducing independent oversight of professional legal education for the first time.<br/><br/>Part 3 provides for a small supporting resource for the new commission - a director to be appointed by the Minister and staff.  The director shall be responsible to the commission for the performance of his or her functions.<br/><br/>Part 4 in many ways is the pivotal set of provisions.  The desired values we already associate with our Judiciary will only be reinforced under section 39.  It provides that the decision by the commission to recommend a person must be based on merit.  The recommendations made by the commission must have regard to essential requirements set out in the Bill.  The most obvious ones, covered in section 40, concern basic eligibility concerning practice of the law and for appointments outside of the State, the criteria and requirements of the relevant institutions, conventions and available guidance.  The recommended person must also have satisfied the commission that he or she possesses the relevant knowledge, skills and attributes set out in a judicial selection statement under Part 5.  Critically too, subject to the merit stipulation in section 39, the commission must have regard to the objectives of having equal numbers of men and women judges in all courts, having a Judiciary reflective of the diversity of the people in our country and of meeting the need for the conduct of court proceedings in the Irish language.<br/><br/>Staying with Part 4, Deputies will know that currently - and historically - when an appointment of a serving judge to higher judicial office is made, it will not have come through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The remit of the board under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended, is restricted to persons seeking appointment for the first time as a judge.  To illustrate, a judge appointed to the High Court some time in the past on a recommendation of the JAAB, were he or she interested in further appointment now to the Court of Appeal, would not be applying to JAAB, and that board would have no part in that further appointment.  A real strength of the new process under the Bill and the commission is that there will be a single application stream for all applicants.  To be clear, all those wishing to be considered for appointment to judicial office must make an application to the commission under section 43 and a recommendation can only be made to the Minister arising directly from such an application.  An important element of section 43 is that an application can only be made pursuant to an invitation to make applications issued by the commission by way of advertisement under section 42.<br/><br/>We are also moving toward a more structured approach to appointments in another area.  In a change from the general scheme, I am including in the remit of the commission the making of recommendations to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs of persons for nomination by the Government for appointment or election to judicial offices outside the State.  The Bill will give the task of selecting and recommending persons for these roles in the Court of Justice and the General Court of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court to the new commission.  I refer Deputies to sections 42(2) and section 48 which give the Minister for Foreign Affairs direct involvement in this.  I want to acknowledge the very positive contributions to this part of the Bill made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and his Department.<br/><br/>Part 4 also contains another fundamental reform.  The position to date is that the appointment of judges, on advice to the President, is an executive function under the Constitution.  That does not change, of course, but in section 51, I am providing for the first time in law that only recommended persons, that is, persons recommended by the commission, may be appointed to judicial office in the State.  The same applies under section 52 to nominations to judicial office outside the State such as to the European Court of Human Rights and so on.  The 1995 Act requires the Government to first consider recommendations made by the JAAB and it is an important change that Government may only appoint recommended persons.  Since the foundation of the State, we have had a strong and independent Judiciary and by providing that only recommended persons can be appointed to judicial office, we will ensure that this continues to be the case while meeting our constitutional requirements.<br/><br/>This Bill proposes a change to the current JAAB procedure regarding the number of recommendations that the commission will make.  I refer Deputies to sections 47 and 48.  The Bill provides for three recommendations across all of the different judicial offices, all of those in the State as well as the Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights and the other international courts.  Under the 1995 procedure, the JAAB process, which, as I said, is confined to only new appointments and only judicial offices in the State, it is a minimum of seven recommendations although in many instances, far more would be received.  I am now proposing in this Bill to significantly limit the discretion which the Government of the day has in relation to selection and appointment of judges.  Under the Bill the names of three persons will be recommended with an additional two for each additional vacancy in a court.  If, for example, there are three appointments to be made to the High Court, we can expect seven names in total to be recommended.  However, the Commission may recommend fewer than three persons in some circumstances, for example, where less than three eligible persons apply or where the commission cannot recommend three or cannot recommend the additional numbers for more than one vacancy.<br/><br/>The Minister will be informed of the names of all of those persons who have applied to the commission.  The Government will not be able to appoint from a list of persons where there is no recommendation but I believe the Minister for Justice should have a clear picture of the interest there may be in a given role and an understanding of the diversity of persons making applications.  Having reviewed the matter, I have decided that there is no necessity for a special top-level committee to advise the Government on the Chief Justice or any other of the highest ranking judicial positions.  The commission will deal with all recommendations for all posts here or abroad, from the District Court right up to the top of the judicial system.  This is the best approach.<br/><br/>There is an important commission function stipulated under Part 5, that of preparing and publishing a judicial selection statement.  That statement will bring together both the selection procedures that the commission will use to select and recommend persons and the requisite skills, attributes and knowledge that the commission will adopt in determining those persons who are most suitable for appointment as judges.<br/><br/>The Bill makes particular provision to strengthen how courts are positioned to deal with the needs of those wishing to conduct their business in the Irish language.  Under section 56, the commission shall consult the Courts Service about the needs of users of the courts with respect to proceedings being conducted in the Irish language and may request the Courts Service to produce a report in the matter.</p>  <p>The judicial selection statement must, in setting out the knowledge and skills required for judicial office, specify how these take account of the needs of such users of the courts.</p> <p> Section 61 is a key provision.  It requires the commission to monitor and review, among other things, the effectiveness of the procedures set out to achieve the objectives of gender balance and diversity among the Judiciary and Irish language needs in court proceedings, and to report to the Minister in the matter.</p> <p> Other key reforms include that no person should be recommended without being interviewed, and section 46 provides accordingly.  The Bill also sets out a requirement that those seeking appointment must have undergone continuing professional development education and training programmes.  These are important changes.</p> <p> Part 6, in section 63, expands eligibility for appointment so that for the first time service as a judge of the District Court will reckon as qualifying service for appointment as a judge of the High Court.  For the first time, legal academics working in specified educational institutions will become eligible for appointment as a judge of any court, as will barristers in employment, that is, practising barristers as now to be defined for this purpose in line with the definition contained in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The Bill also streamlines the process for assignments of District Court and Circuit Court judges in Part 6.</p> <p> This reform is comprehensive and positive.  I see it as a key element of overall judicial reforms, complementing what has been achieved under the Judicial Council Act 2019 and contributing to the modernisation of the courts system.  It is, in fact, a complete overhaul of the system put in place in the law all of 27 years ago.  The joint committee pre-legislative scrutiny deliberations and outcome were very helpful and constructive.  I thank colleagues for this, including Deputy Lawless, the committee and other contributors.</p> <p> Ongoing implementation of civil justice reforms, such as the work of the Judicial Council, an enhanced family justice court system and work being done in the area of judicial planning, will improve the efficiency and outcomes of the administration of justice in our courts in the time ahead of us.  We are moving to introduce independent oversight of professional legal education for the first time, with a commitment to remove the barriers that exist for people who want to become solicitors and barristers.  I will also shortly bring to Government an action plan to implement the 90 recommendations set out by the review group chaired Mr. Justice Peter Kelly to improve the civil justice system.  The Government's action plan will commit to reform in all areas of civil justice, including litigation costs, case delays and access to services and legal aid, with our objective being to make the civil justice system more efficient and, most important, easier for people to access.  Bringing the judicial appointment process up to date as part of these overall reforms and ensuring it is fit for purpose will make a real difference.  I am looking forward to the contributions of colleagues in the course of our debate and will be very happy to deal with any aspect of this reform that Deputies wish to address today and subsequently in later debates.  I commend the Bill to the House</p></speech>

This is an area that requires reform and we all understand and accept that.  The Bill certainly goes in that direction.  It is welcome.  It is a vast improvement on where we have been up to now.  The perception has been that it has been a closed shop.  People with obvious connections got into positions that perhaps they would not have got into had they not had such connections.  This is what is at the heart of this.  It is to come up with a reform process that can deliver a very fair and exact way in which we can appoint our judges and stand over it.  There is recognition that while the JAAB process has served us to some extent it has had failings and shortcomings.  It is recognition of this that brings us to the Bill today.</p>  <p>  The new judicial appointments commission having an equal number of lay and judicial members is a vast improvement.  We were looking for balance in the past.  A former Member, Shane Ross, had a long battle when he wanted to see a majority of laypeople in the positions.  This had merit and it is something that perhaps we can revisit again as the debate continues.  Having a lay chair and a majority of lay members of a board, commission and selection committee would be useful.  It would certainly remove that perception of bias or the well connected being looked after.  It is something that has to be considered further.</p>  <p>  I understand the Chief Justice will chair the commission.  There are opportunities and the Minister mentioned the deliberations we had at the committee.  One of the recommendations made was that the president of the court to which the appointment is being made would be on the commission, for example, the President of the District Court.  This recommendation was worthy and useful.  At one point there was a request not to have pre-legislative scrutiny.  The pre-legislative scrutiny has paid dividends and has worked well.  The Minister will accept this.  During Covid we have seen applications for pre-legislative scrutiny to be set aside to rush through Bills.  It is a very bad way to do business.  It is a means of assessing legislation, making recommendations and teasing out issues at an early stage so improvements can be made that do not then have to be debated and worked out later.  It is useful that we had pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  Three judges will be nominated to go forward for one position.  It would be useful if they were ranked as first, second and third choice.  It would also be very useful for everyone concerned that if, for whatever reason, and there may be valid reasons, the first choice was not acceptable, the Minister would set out the reasons for it.  These are the key issues that could be improved upon in the legislation before us.</p>  <p>  We have a lot of work to do to create the diversity the Minister spoke about and which we require to reflect general society in our Judiciary and the legal profession.  There has often been a family tradition among solicitors and family law.  Naturally enough, people end up following on in succession into the legal profession.  This has meant it has been more difficult for people who do not have these connections to become lawyers, solicitors or barristers.  This is something that needs to be re-examined.  In her speech the Minister made reference to this.  We need to work harder to find a way to be more inclusive and to embrace the diversity that, thankfully, exists in our society today.</p>  <p>  I understand there are now larger numbers of women taking up the law profession and the Minister is a law graduate herself.  This is healthy and good.  There are diverse backgrounds among the people throughout the country.  We have thousands of people from eastern Europe living in Ireland.  We have people from Africa and all over the world living here.  There needs to be a huge emphasis on trying to ensure that not only do they get in at the bottom end of various professions, be it medical or heath professions or other professions, but that they can climb.  There should be opportunities to advance for people from whatever background they may come.  There should be equity built into this to ensure we can progress in a way that will reflect the diversity of our society.  We have not had this.  While the Bill deals with it to some extent, a lot more needs to be done in this context.</p>  <p>  Various organisations have welcomed the Bill and have moved it forward.  I understand the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has welcomed it.  It has made a number of recommendations where it feels more work needs to be done. The Bill proposes the Chief Justice be the chair of the judicial appointments commission.  It recommends the judge sitting on the commission should be elected by his or her peers, as in international standards.  In other words, the chair should be elected by his or her peers rather than appointed by the Minister.  This would be appropriate and it is something that could be examined.</p> <p> It is welcome that this process includes the international courts and will look at such courts, particularly the European Court of Justice, etc.  We will make nominations to that through this process.  It is also useful to have a system that not only appoints judges coming from the various legal professions but which would also seek to be the conduit with which people would get promotion from the lower to higher courts.  Currently the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no role in this and it is a big failing.</p> <p> It is certainly one of the big impressions people have that people advance through the ranks because of the connections they have.  Sometimes it is insinuated because of the political connections those people have or had in the past.  That may well have been the case at a time but this legislation must put an end to such a practice very clearly.  I know we have had our battles over the appointments of former Attorneys General to very senior judicial positions.  I certainly feel it is inappropriate for them to move across in that manner and it is something that must be addressed.  The Attorney General should not be appointed to the Judiciary automatically or immediately on retirement from the position of Attorney General.  There should be a cooling-off period, at least, before that could happen.  It should probably be an even stronger provision than that.</p> <p> The use of the Attorney General in the judicial appointments commission is also problematic.  It means the Attorney General is involved in the process of selection of who is to be nominated and is also very close to the people who make the nomination.  It is an issue that must be dealt with.  It is not appropriate that the Attorney General, as a political appointee, be involved.  Again, it creates more of the impression that it is about being well connected, who you know and the circles in which you move.  It is a mistake to have it there and the Attorney General should be removed from the process.  There is an abundance of legal expertise that could be brought to bear on the process without having the Attorney General as part of it.  That will be one of the key improvements that could be made to the legislation brought before us.</p> <p> In the round we support the direction of the Bill.  There will be amendments that we will bring forward on Committee Stage and probably on Report Stage as well, depending on how things go.  The Bill is welcome but it is probably 20 years since talk started of changes or improvements being made in the area.  We have been slow getting to this stage.  The legislation is nonetheless welcome and I certainly hope it moves through the process in the House not at great speed but with judicious examination of all the consequences from it.  We must be very careful with this and do it right.  It must be right for the future so everyone can have confidence in the Judiciary and move forward.</p></speech>

I seem to be in here just for that.  Everyone, and particularly the Minister, will be glad I did not have the full ten minutes.</p>  <p>  In fairness, I will not reiterate everything Deputy Kenny has said, although I may reiterate one or two of his points.  We all welcome this legislation as necessary, particularly as the reality of the world is that people think others get on better with connections.  That may not always be the case but with the Judiciary we must ensure not only that there is absolute transparency but that all due diligence is done on best practices in delivering the best Judiciary we can.  In addition, that must be seen to be the case and we should leave no room for anyone to question beyond that.</p>  <p>  The proposals mentioned by Deputy Kenny must be considered, particularly those relating to the Attorney General.  It should be possible to separate that political appointment from this process and it might be necessary.  Beyond that we must look at injecting, for want of a better term, more lay people into the board.  Everyone could see the straightforward advantages in that, and it furthers the idea of being seen to operate in a transparent and accountable way.</p>  <p>  Many people might say that to some degree we are dealing with legacy matters and sometimes it might be seen that it is the people who are connected who get these positions.  After saying I would not reiterate much of what Deputy Kenny has said, I suppose I will now do it.  There may be family connections and history in the law, for example, and this clearly leads to a state of play where a large number of people with connections get these positions.  From a societal perspective, we have wider work to do to ensure there can be more of a flow of other people into these positions.</p>  <p>  We are talking about a completely changed society and it is certainly not the same Ireland in which I grew up.  I was going to say the surnames of many of the friends of my son are very difficult to pronounce but many people in Dundalk might say that about my name.  Many of the names are different from what we had in the 1970s, 1980s and long before that.  A Judiciary should be like every other body in the State and it should reflect the people who make up our society.  There is a wide piece of work we need to do on that.  There is a large number of people at the periphery and we have fundamental work to do on the early interventions that could bridge the gap so as to allow people to get on the right path, whether that is into education, apprenticeships or anything else.  I know this is a tangent, to some degree, and I have a tendency to go on those, but there is wider work to be done right across society.</p>  <p>  It is very difficult to speak about the Judiciary and the criminal justice system without speaking about how we need the sector to be resourced properly.  At the transport committee now we are dealing with questions of planning.  We know there will be a review by the Attorney General but we must ensure the entire infrastructure is resourced, including the judicial element.  Beyond planning we know the issue arising from backlogs in our courts.  There is the idea that justice should be public and it should be swift, and that goes across the board.  It needs to be the case.</p>  <p>  We welcome what has happened with the Kinahan cartel.  I am aware of particular cases in my constituency outstanding for a significant period and some of them involve serious criminal or violent activity or gang activity.  We just need to ensure we put all the required parts in play.  There is also the wider question of a citizens' assembly on drugs.  We are running against ourselves at this point and we need a better solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700036#OO00300"><p>I have five minutes in which to speak but I probably spent in excess of five hours speaking to the previous legislation that sought to resolve these matters.  There are differences in the detail of the Bill but there is a consensus that the process for appointing judges must be radically transformed.  It is a matter that has been debated in these Houses for approximately 20 years.</p>  <p>  The appointment of judges carries enormous weight and consequences and we must only consider the intensely political nature of the appointment of judges in the United States to understand the significance and weight of the decisions, particularly for superior courts.  It is not a good model by any manner of means.  The process has major implications for individuals and their liberty, as well as victims and their families.  It also has significant implications for how the laws we pass and the Constitution are interpreted, the philosophy that is taken and any other amount of factors.  It is vital that we get the appointment of judges right.</p>  <p>  Our Constitution gives power to the Government alone to appoint judges.  There is a bit of a contradiction in that there is a political consensus, at least rhetorically, that we want our Judiciary to be as independent as possible.  We also want the process of appointing those judges to be as independent as possible.</p> <p>The best we can do, and what various pieces of legislation that have not ultimately come to fruition have attempted to do over the course of the years, is to try to tighten the frame in which Government can make those appointments, not to, I suppose, create a specific obligation on the Government to a particular judge but to try to constrain the space that exists.  I recognise this legislation attempts to do that.  There are areas in which we would like to see improvement.  It is still my view a lay majority and a lay chair are best.  I am absolutely of the view that we cannot stand still on this.  We cannot allow this debate to continue perpetually.  I would say the process in place currently is probably one of the weakest in Europe at this time.  It is undoubtedly the case that appointments to the superior courts have been, at the very least, perceived to have been political.  It is important we remove that perception and ensure the process is seen to be as objective as possible.</p> <p> I welcome that we are moving in the right direction.  Deputy Kenny has talked about amendments we will be tabling.  It remains my view a lay majority would be much more preferable.  On the nature of the laypeople, it is important they come from a diverse set of backgrounds to ensure the people feeding into this process are as representative as possible, because it will have huge implications for us all.  I also want to touch on the fact this was a large area of discussion during the course of the previous Government.  The whole area of judicial reform is not only limited to appointments.  I welcome the passage of the Judicial Council Bill in recent years.  Certainly, it was a majority priority for us.  The Government at the time was relying on our support.  We were keen to ensure we proceeded with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, but we also needed to proceed with the Judicial Council Bill.  It needed to be given high priority.</p> <p> A significant part of that was ensuring our sentencing law was reformed.  It was on the back of engagement between me and the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, that for the first time, a sentencing guidelines committee was to be established within the judicial council.  That is a very significant step, the implications of which we will see over the course of the coming years as sentencing is created for all manner of offences, and rightly so.  As I impressed upon the then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, we saw that when sentencing guidelines were introduced in Britain, adherence to those guidelines was very strong indeed.  Consistency improved significantly.  It is the case there is sentencing in this State that is inconsistent, inadequate and sometimes, frankly, inappropriate and not fitting to the kinds of crimes committed.  I know the sentencing committee is in the course of being established and initial steps have been taken.  I look forward, over the course of the coming time, to the Judicial Council and the committee addressing those issues with sentencing to ensure we have fair and consistent sentencing for crime in this State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700037#PP00200"><p>In introducing the lapsed Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 into this House on the 27 June 2017, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, said &quot;it has been a long journey to this point&quot;.  I do not think the then Minister envisaged how long the subsequent journey was about to be, although there are those who would say he was among the first Ministers ever to filibuster his own Bill.  The passage of that Bill was long and never achieved fulfilment.</p><p>It is a fact that, on occasions, the appointment of senior judges and, indeed, the mechanism for appointment itself has caused both political and public concern and disquiet.  The current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, system is, in essence, as the Minister will know, the outworking of the agreed system for judicial appointments after the major disagreements that occurred between the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government in the mid-1990s on the appointment then of Harry Whelehan, Attorney General, to the presidency of the High Court.  The Minister will be aware I, as a member of that Government, have some detailed knowledge of those events.  In fact, I was one of two Labour Party Ministers, the other being the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and two Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers - the Minister of State, Noel Dempsey, and the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Brian Cowen - who were appointed to come up with a new appointments system.  We drafted and agreed a structure, which we brought to Government, was put into legislative form within a week and was published within two weeks as the Courts and Court Officers Bill 1994.  As the Minister can imagine, it was a Bill that was done with a great deal of haste.  Some would argue there was a political imperative about that rush.  That Bill lapsed a few short weeks later, when that Government collapsed.  A revised Courts and Court Officers Bill was introduced a year later, in 1995, which in essence is the structure we have used for the appointment of judges from then.</p><p>It has been argued the original 1994 Bill was required for political expediency, as I have said.  I can attest that a political difficulty did give the Labour Party the opportunity to put forward a very significant reform agenda for a judicial appointments system, for which, I have to say, there was no great political appetite at the time.  On the basis of the adage, &quot;never waste a good opportunity&quot;, we thought we could actually bring about significant reform of judicial appointments.  That is what we had envisaged in the 1994 Bill that was produced.</p><p>Having been a Member of both the 1994 and 1995 governments that proposed both the 1994 and 1995 Bills, I can say the pressure that was available to us in drafting the 1994 Bill to bring about reform with Fianna F&aacute;il after the Harry Whelehan affair had to be rebuilt with the new Government partners, notwithstanding the agreement that was written into the new programme for Government to review the 1994 legislation and the backlog of cases that then, as now, existed in the courts system.  I will leave it to others to determine which of the systems - the one set out in the 1994 Bill or the one set out in the 1995 Bill - was the better.  The changes between the two were the result of inputs from our new Government partners, one of which was the Minister's own party.  At its core, both Bills proposed the establishment of an independent screening board to recommend to Government suitable candidates for judicial office.  The Government would exercise its constitutional role of selecting a person from those recommended by that selection board, the JAAB.  The recommendations would go to Government and it would then recommend to the President the person or persons to be appointed to the Judiciary.  The actual functioning of the judicial appointments system is covered with both expertise and clarity in Deputy Carroll MacNeill's excellent book, <i>The Politics of Judicial Selection in Ireland</i>, which is worth a read in the context of the evolution that has gone on on this subject for the past 20 years.</p><p>There are issues that are fundamental to our democracy at play here, namely, the right of a democratically elected Government to exercise its constitutional prerogative, and to do that in an accountable manner; the basic necessity in a functioning democracy to have a strong but clearly independent Judiciary that is capable of making decisions that annoy Government and can run counter to populist or even popular opinion; and to ensure as far as is possible the best people are actually appointed to the vacant positions.  The politicisation of the Judiciary, despite many comments about it, has, I believe, thankfully, not been an issue in this State very much.</p> <p>If we look to other democracies, the same cannot be said.  A previous speaker referenced the US Supreme Court, which is entirely politicised now, and much hangs on the political complexion of individual members appointed to that court in the United States.  Constitutional rights and fundamental laws that have been determined by the Supreme Court in the past are potentially now to be overturned.  These are not small matters by any stretch of the imagination, and the concerns do not end at the borders of the United States.  Concern about judicial appointments in some of our EU colleague countries are equally of great concern, and there was a debate yesterday in the European Parliament on the rule of law, focused on the Polish Prime Minister, who was present in the Parliament at the time.  There are real concerns about the basic values of an independent judiciary being an underpinning value of the European Union, even within the European family of nations.</p> <p> These are very important issues to get right and this is a most important issue.  The normal argument that &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not broke, don't fix it&rdquo; cannot be the approach we adopt here.  We have been fortunate to date in having excellent men and women serve in judicial office and they have served this country extraordinarily well.  However, we need to be mindful that simply because we have been fortunate to date does not mean the system will always produce that sort of excellent result, and I think the sort of changes we are now addressing are completely warranted.  We need a clear legal underpinning in an open and transparent manner for one of the most essential and important functions that is ascribed to the State.</p> <p> This Bill proposes the establishment of a judicial appointments commission - yet again - whose function is to select and recommend persons for appointment to judicial office, both to the domestic courts here in Ireland and to the international courts where Irish judges are appointed.  From previous experience, the two fundamental questions that need to be addressed are, first, the membership of the proposed commission and who is actually going to make those recommendations and, second, the level of discretion which will remain with the Government in making the final choice.  In my judgment, they are the two criteria we need to look at in the context of this legislation.  The Government proposes to have a nine-member commission chaired by the Chief Justice and to include the President of the Court of Appeal or, as the Minister has outlined in her Second Stage contribution, an alternative court president from the court to which the vacancy is to be filled; two members of the Judicial Council, one a barrister and one a solicitor; four lay members, three selected by the Public Appointments Service through open competition and one nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; and the ninth-----</p></speech>

It is four members selected by the Public Appointments Service.  The ninth member is to be the Attorney General in a non-voting capacity, and I take it that is still the Minister's position.</p>  <p>  I listened with care to the debate and argument in regard to the inclusion of the Attorney General.  There is understandable concern that, if we like, the Attorney General gets two bites of the cherry or is at two phases of the selection process.  He is in attendance, although not in a voting position, at the commission that will actually make the nomination and then he is the chief legal adviser and, in fact, from my experience of having sat in three different Cabinets, will have enormous weight in terms of judicial appointments at the Cabinet table itself.  I think it is not the best solution that somebody who is at the level of recommendation is also at the level of decision-making.  I would agree with the notion that the role of the Attorney General is to advise the Government.  I would be much more comfortable with the decision simply that he or she would advise the Government on the recommended names that come to the Government from the commission.</p>  <p>  I looked at the suggestion by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and others, and repeated earlier by Deputy Martin Kenny, that there should be a ranking.  I am not sure it is a good idea that there would be a ranking of names.  I think some discretion should be left to the Government in terms of the degree of knowledge a Government will have of individuals, and I am not sure about a ranking system.  As long as every name that comes before the Government is certified appropriate and fit to serve, then it is a matter for the Government to make that decision.  I am not sure a ranking system would help that and, in fact, I think it would diminish the independence of the Government in making its own final decision.</p>  <p>  By and large, I believe this commission structure proposal is a good and robust proposal which meets the tests of competency and transparency.  The commission is to be assisted in its work by a judicial appointments office with a director and staffing.  I say this as an aside because I am in an agreement that this sort of support is required, but I remember the pressure I was under and the great fanfare that was made by the Minister's party about the burning of the quangos.  I understand we have created more non-governmental and support organisations in recent years than we had undone in the great burning of the quangos that was suggested.  However, that is an aside.</p>  <p>  My first question as to who makes the recommendation and selection is, I believe, well met in the proposals we have before us.  Except for the caveat that I have entered in regard to the inclusion of the Attorney General, I think that commission proposal is not too large but is adequately large to be competent, functioning and representative, all of which are good things.</p>  <p>  The specific requirement that the commission must address the objective that membership of the Judiciary should reflect the diversity of the whole Irish population is particularly welcome and especially important.  It is a requirement, in a very changed population base, that that is reflected in all aspects of our Administration.  I have to say that, before we start giving lectures to the Judiciary and everybody else, we have to look around here and see how reflective this House is of a very changed Ireland, and that is something to which we, as politicians, have to give some regard as well.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the requirement for judicial training and continuing professional development.  These are very important and welcome developments.</p>  <p>  A most reasonable point has been made again by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that the legal professions too must address the diversity issue.  In truth, it is very hard for a new commission to select qualified people to be appointed, or be recommended to be appointed, as judges if the profession from which those nominations come are so overwhelming drawn from one sphere or aspect of our population.  Therefore, the legal professions too must seek to mirror the communities they serve, as we should here in this House too and in the other House.</p>  <p>  That largely deals with the first question I pose and I have less than four minutes of speaking time to deal with the second question, which concerns the discretion that remains legally available to Cabinet to make the final decision.  Again, very significant progress has been made in the right direction in this proposal that is before the House.  Under these proposals, as I understand it, the Government can select from a shortlist of three coming from the commission in regard to a single vacancy, or a shortlist of five in the case of two vacancies, or seven in the case of three vacancies.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I listened to the Minister's opening statement.  She also said that a lesser number could be recommended in the event that either there were not enough qualified persons determined by the commission or, as the Minister said, &quot;the commission may recommend fewer than three persons in some circumstances where less than three eligible persons apply...or where the commission cannot recommend three.&quot;  I have concerns about that because at the end of the day the Government must have some discretion.  If a commission is so minded to say it will make the decision to send on only one name and say that as far as it is concerned there is only one qualified person, there is no discretion which the Constitution says is the prerogative of the Government.  I ask the Minister to reflect again on that.<br/><br/>It would be extraordinary for any position that there would not be three suitable people that could be recommended to Government.  We need to have some discretion left with Government in exercising that because, ultimately, the Government is democratically accountable.  The commission, no matter how august the personages on it will be, will not be accountable or questionable with regard to its decision-making but the Minister will be, both in this House and to the electorate.  I would give that minimum of discretion legally to the Government.<br/><br/>The unfettered right of appointment of judges remains with the Government although Article 35 says:</p><blockquote>	The judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other Courts established in pursuance of Article 34 shall be appointed by the President. </blockquote> <p>Article 13.9 says that:</p><blockquote>	The powers and functions conferred on the President...shall be exercisable and performable by him only on the advice of the Government. </blockquote> <p>The Constitution gives an exclusive right to the Government to make these decisions.  Up to 1995, that was a complete <i>carte blanche </i>to make those decisions.  By and large, Governments did not make outrageous decisions up to now.<br/><br/>However, we need the sort of reform that is there now.  We need to ensure that the powers and functions that we have are exercised in light of different times and that we have a mechanism that is transparent and robust.  The proposals put before us meet those criteria.  I will look to make one or two amendments on Committee Stage but this is a good day's work and we need to get this Bill enacted.  It is timely and appropriate to make these very fundamental and significant changes to the appointment system for our judges.</p></speech>

It is also very hard to overstate it because it is absolutely fundamental to a functioning democracy.  We can argue about the separation between the executive branch and the legislative branch another day but at least we have had a strong tradition of judicial impartiality and a strong independent Judiciary.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Howlin said, we do not have to look very far to see the consequences for justice when that is impacted and undermined.  It is easy to talk about concepts such as justice but it is a fundamental thing that is felt every day by people standing in the courts in front of a judge.  Knowing they are getting the best judge, arbiter and decision-maker to stand in front of is of fundamental importance and is absolutely important to get right.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill and our improvements and reforms to ensure we and the Government make the right decisions and that our courts remain apolitical, independent and unafraid of Government in order to make those strong decisions that are needed in the name of justice and the basic rights that we give ourselves in our Constitution.  They are the protectors of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  One of the things I truly welcome in this Bill is the onus on diversity within our Judiciary.  It is incredibly important that the Judiciary looks like modern Ireland and represents every voice.  If somebody is standing in a courtroom wondering whether he or she will get justice, knowing that the Judiciary reflects him or her and modern Ireland is an assurance to that person that he or she will and can in fact get justice.  That is fundamentally important.</p>  <p>  Equally I welcome the requirement and improvements with regard to judicial training and continuing professional development.  Like others in this House, I have sat in a witness box in a professional capacity.  I have stood in front of a judge in a professional capacity.  Let me just say the variety of experience judges have and the variety of wisdom they can bring to a case is interesting.  It is also incredibly important.</p>  <p>  When I was a social worker we were working in Dolphin House.  We often talked about theoretical or professional concepts from social work such as attachment, parenting capacity and such.  A barrister who has spent most of his or her time dealing with a commercial list and is appointed a judge may have no idea what I am talking about.  It is a huge step forward to ensure that those things are happening in terms of training and continuing professional development.  Suitability to make the important calls as they sit on the bench is not just judged at the moment that they are appointed.  It continues throughout their career.</p>  <p>  There is a movement to more specialised courts and with that comes more specialised barristers.  I spoke to one friend who used to do a mix of criminal and tort work.  Since the opening of the new courts of justice, he has dropped his tort cases because he just cannot move between the two buildings sufficiently.  As we open new family law courts and buildings that will happen again.  We are producing more specialised barristers.  That is not necessarily a problem but these people become judges and end up judging something that is criminal when they have never been a criminal practitioner or judging family law while all they have ever done is company law.</p>  <p>  We need to be cognisant of over-specialisation and the impact that my have.  That is a very nebulous concept but it is important to raise.  Continuing professional development and judicial training is an important break on that.  That is not to cast aspersions on any of our current Judiciary but it is an unintended consequence that we need to be aware of into the future.</p>  <p>  It is not just about the quality.  It is also important to talk about the quantity of judges.  This is especially important in terms of access to justice.  We could talk about legal aid but with one minute and 20 seconds left, I am not sure I have enough time for that.  Former Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke, recently chaired a conference on access to justice and talked about how Ireland languishes at the bottom of various international tables in terms of our spending on justice.  We have 3.3 judges here per 100,000 of population compared to a European average of 21 per 100,000.</p>  <p>  I was speaking to one barrister, the same barrister as earlier, who in January was getting a trial date for someone he was defending in March 2024.  These are significant waits.  When we talk about the sea change for victims of sexual violence, dragging cases out for two or three years is part of that.</p> <p>It is not just the High Court but also the District and Circuit Courts where there are huge waiting lists.  We must tackle this backlog of cases by appointing more judges and by appointing judges who are not necessarily bound to one district or circuit but who can move to wherever there is the demand and need.  It is not just about the quality of judges but about the quantity of judges.  I welcome this Bill, which addresses issues of ensuring we have the same quality of judges in future as we have had so far, but we must also address the issue of quantity.</p></speech>

In keeping with the controversies mentioned by other speakers, my primary concern is that we get the best and most capable judges possible through any process.  Political patronage does not necessarily promote those who are incapable of doing the job, but it certainly does exclude from consideration those who are as capable if not more so.  I do not know if it still exists, but there was a culture in the law of some individuals joining political parties with the intent of keeping an option open as to whether they might get an appointment to the Bench.  I remember being at a Law Society dinner once, where a late colleague came to the table and asked whether the six of us were ready for the Fianna F&aacute;il church gate collection on Sunday morning.  To my surprise, I discovered when I checked that I was the only one who was not a card-carrying member.</p></speech>

In any event, it is not right and proper.  There must be some transparency.  Accountability is important and independence must be safeguarded.  I must add that some of the people at that table, by the way, would have made fine judges.  I might be relying on them for a vote at another time.</p>  <p>  Turning to the process of how people come to be judges and how they are promoted and elevated when they are on the Bench, it is important that some of the lay members of the commission have experience in consumer protection, perhaps trade union activity and-or the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The judges being appointed should, as was mentioned by Deputy Costello, have some experience in the courts.  If not, they should be trained up.  It is also not really appropriate for the Attorney General to be involved in the process.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, I look forward to fuller engagement with the Minister regarding this legislation at a later stage.  I welcome section 39.  It is important to have equal numbers of men and women.  Much work has been done on this aspect.  It is also important to have a Judiciary reflective of the diversity of the people in the country.  Equally, it is important that Irish speakers can access the courts through their native language.</p>  <p>  On a broader issue, I raise the issue of judicial processes on the island.  I met Paula Rainey recently.  She is the daughter of a Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, man who was killed in 1977.  Her father was Joe Campbell, who was shot dead as he closed Cushendall station in County Antrim.  His family believe he had uncovered collusion by members of the police with paramilitaries.  Information was withheld from him regarding a specific threat.  The RUC was, at least, negligent and failed to act to prevent one of its own being killed.  Mr. Campbell was not even warned.  In a subsequent investigation, the Chief Constable could not remember the incident.  The investigation was inadequate.  The Ombudsman's office investigated it and said it was damaging to the family and to policing.  His widow is now 87 years old.  The members of the family have waited since 1977 for truth and justice.  I ask the Government not to consent to the amnesty legislation and to ensure the inquest is not delayed any more.  It is also necessary to ensure the terms of reference for the inquest state the British State will be compelled to undertake a transparent process and not be able to hide behind any false national security claims.</p></speech>

Problems with the current process have been pointed out time and again by people in this Chamber, the media, the public and legal professionals and international bodies.  As it stands, the judicial appointments system is wide open to cronyism and political interference.  It is an unaccountable system controlled by a small group of Cabinet members and their advisers.  Cabinet confidentiality, which I do not dispute is required, leaves the process entirely opaque.</p>  <p>  A Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was set up in 1996 with the stated aim of introducing some measures of independence to the process, but it fell far short of real reform.  The problems inherent in the board were well known from the get-go because the lack of transparency and a vulnerability to political interference, a very good example of which we have just heard, was purposely built in.  Over 25 years, successive governments have refused to reform the system because of an unwillingness to let go of the political influence they have held.  I commend the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on bringing forward this Bill.  It goes a long way towards instituting the reforms sorely needed.  Critically, the practice of barristers and solicitors getting the tap on the shoulder from JAAB or the Minister will be gone.  Applicants will no longer be able to be invited to make applications but will have to do so of their own accord.</p>  <p>  Formalising the application process and selection criteria will introduce some badly needed transparency for applications and for the public.  Undoubtedly, it will strengthen public trust in the Judiciary.  I welcome the improvements made in the legislation since the general scheme was published.  It is good to see some of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Justice and by various groups have been accepted.  These include the decrease in the number of names being recommended from five to three, only those recommended by the commission being nominated to Government, the need for judges seeking promotion to go through the same process, and the commission being required to improve diversity in the Judiciary.  These are welcome changes that have considerably strengthened the Bill.  I do not doubt there will be further amendments and I hope the Minister will be open to accepting some of them.</p>  <p>  Significant recommendations made during pre-legislative scrutiny were not accepted by the Minister.  First and foremost was a recommendation-----</p></speech>

They amend the upper-case first letter of "Superintendent" to lower case to align this section with the Firearms Act 1925 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  Amendment No. 3 substitutes "firearm certificate", which is the term used in section 5 of the Firearms Act 1925, for "firearms certificate".  Amendment No. 6 is a change to reflect the fact that, under the Firearms Act 1925, a decision can be deemed to have been made by a superintendent.  Amendments Nos. 10, 12, 15, 17, 22 and 24 are consequent on the amendments being made later in the draft.  Amendment No. 10 replaces the phrase &ldquo;the said section 4(5)&rdquo; with &ldquo;section 4(5) of that Act&rdquo;.  This is because there will no longer be an earlier reference to section 4(5).  Amendments Nos. 12, 15, 17, 22 and 24 make similar changes in respect of similar references.  Amendment No. 25 amends line 5 on page 20 to delete "Garda division" and substitute it with "Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division".  This is because the term "Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division" is defined in the Bill, whereas the term "Garda division" is not.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputies can see these are quite technical amendments.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage I undertook to examine the issue of the retrospective application of the Bill.  I am signalling that I will be raising amendments in the Seanad.  We will be coming back to the D&aacute;il following, I hope, the acceptance of amendments in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I am just flagging that issue to the House.  I have a note which I can put on the record.  In essence it is about that issue.  The most significant outstanding issue that remains is the question of retrospective application of the protections in the legislation to persons who report wrongdoing prior to the enactment of the Bill.  I wish to provide an update to the House on the progress we are making in this area.</p>  <p>  I am committed to applying the enhanced protections provided for in the Bill to such persons to the greatest extent possible within the boundaries of the Constitution.  My officials and I are working with the Attorney General in this regard.  I am advised that it will be possible to provide protections for persons who have reported prior to enactment but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  I have instructed the Attorney General to draft amendments to the Bill to this effect.  This will implement the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, in its prelegislative scrutiny report on the draft general scheme of the Bill.  I am also advised that it is possible to go further and provide protection to persons who are already within the personal scope of the 2014 Act and have reported and suffered retaliation prior to enactment but have yet to initiate proceedings against their employer at the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts.  Again I have asked the Attorney General to draft amendments to the Bill in this regard.  Any retrospective application that goes beyond this, that is, where proceedings have been initiated or completed, would run into constitutional difficulties.  In particular, Article 15.1.1&deg; of the Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements on the law which were not so at the date of their commission.  We must accept and respect the limits that are placed on us by Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Where a person is in this situation, there is nothing to stop them from making a new protected disclosure in respect of any new or outstanding matters and the full protections of this legislation will apply.  Similarly where a person in this situation is subjected to a new act of penalisation after the Bill is enacted, the retrospective provisions when introduced will give them protection.  I had hoped to bring these amendments to the House today for consideration.  I regret to say that this was not possible.</p> <p>While drafting is at a very advanced stage, several substantial issues concerning the application of the protections from civil and criminal proceedings, the right to confidentiality and data protection have arisen.  The Attorney General has informed me he needs more time to get to the bottom of them.  To ensure the provisions are properly and correctly drafted, I have agreed with the Attorney General to defer their introduction until the Bill reaches Committee Stage in the Seanad.  I apologise to the House for the disappointment I know this will cause, but I am sure Members will agree the most important thing is that we get the drafting right.  The House will, of course, have a chance to consider these proposals, which concern the retrospective application of the Bill, when it returns to the Seanad.</p></speech>

Any member of the finance committee would surely attest that we all worked very constructively together during pre-legislative scrutiny and again on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Our concern, which, to be fair, probably arose for everyone in seeking to transpose the directive, related to how we could improve the functioning of our whistleblowing arrangements for those who have the courage to make a protected disclosure.  Hardly a day goes by when we do not hear some horror story about actions revealed by some really courageous person.  Being able to reveal them is fundamental.  When discussing the Bill on every Stage, we were aware of how whistleblowers are treated in this country.  Unfortunately, really damning evidence has emerged of things that have happened.  During Committee Stage, we heard about people who felt their lives were destroyed when acting in the public interest.  We know those people acted in the public interest; they did not do it for personal gain.  They did it to make society better for as many people as possible.  They were not seeking financial gain, as we know, or any kind of celebrity status.  They really did what they did because they wanted to reveal wrongdoing.  Unfortunately, this has often meant financial ruin and the devastation of one's physical and mental health.</p>  <p>  I said in the Chamber before that I credit the Minister for the measures in his Bill that will help to improve circumstances for those making protected disclosures.  I have acknowledged those areas where the amended Bill is in line with recommendations made by me and others.  I am happy to say I believe the legislation is good, or that it definitely has good aspects.  I have concerns, however, and that is why I had tabled my amendments.  They related, in particular, to the stepped procedure.  This could be even seen as a retrograde step, as some experts feel.  Transparency International Ireland spells out how it believes the procedure could violate the non-regression clause of the EU directive.  There is concern that the new stepped procedure will place another barrier in the way of public-service whistleblowers.  The restrictive criteria for going straight to the relevant Minister mean there could be a lowering of the standards by comparison with what is provided for in the existing Act.  Since this Bill is so positive, we need to ensure everything we do assists in making arrangements better for people.  There is concern that the stepped procedure will weaken them.</p>  <p>  In general, the Bill is quite good.  We will have another chance to talk about it.  The best thing about it is that we have all been happy about it and able to work together.  There were amendments ruled out of order.  Owing to the nature of the Bill, some of the measures I would have liked to include would have imposed a cost on the Exchequer, so there are issues in that regard.  On the whole, however, it is good to see us all working together.  I really do feel it is a good Bill in general.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.</p></speech>

This set of amendments deals with the issue of terminology used in the Bill, in particular the use of the term &quot;illegal birth registration&quot;.  In all of my communications and discussion of these issues I have always sought to very clearly understand the significance of illegal birth registrations and place the proper emphasis on it.</p><p>I am pleased to bring forward these very important amendments to the Succession Act.  As the House knows, in the context of addressing the issue of illegal birth registrations my Department engaged significantly with a group of people who were impacted by illegal birth registrations in St. Patrick's Guild.  One of the key issues was whether they could succeed to the estates of their parents, namely the people they had grown up with, knowing them as their parents all of their lives, but who were not their biological parents.  People wondered whether they could succeed to those estates.  When people discovered they had been subject to an illegal birth registration, it was an issue of very real and significant personal and legal concern for those affected.</p><p>We have worked closely on this issue.  I thank the Minister for Justice and her team because the Succession Act is something addressed under the Department of Justice.  We have worked very hard to address the issue.  I am pleased to bring forward an amendment to the Succession Act 1965.  The amendment provides that, subject to section 27A of that Act for the purposes of succession, the relationship between an affected person and his or her social father and mother, that is, the person he or she has grown up understanding is his or her father or mother, will be deemed retrospectively to be the same as the relationship between the affected person and his or her birth father and mother.  In addition, it provides that all other relationships shall be deemed accordingly.</p><p>The effect of this is that affected persons will have the same rights of inheritance <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their social family as they have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their birth family.  This amendment also provides definitions for the purposes of succession, transition arrangements, assurances in regard to distributions received by affected persons, the shares of birth and social parents in the event an affected person dies intestate without a spouse, civil partner or issue and the distribution of shares on intestacy where a person may stand to inherit based on the social family relationship with the deceased and the birth family relationship with the deceased.</p><p>A significant number of important changes are being made that will provide real legal assurance to people who were subject to illegal birth registration in terms of their right of succession into the future.  This will also legally copper-fasten any succession they have received from their social parents up to this point.  This is something I flagged on Committee Stage that I would bring forward.  It required significant engagement with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General, but it is an important element and one of the key legal questions that those subject to illegal birth registrations have raised since the fact of their illegal birth registrations was first revealed to them.  I hope this amendment can receive the support of the House.</p></speech>

This amendment specifically ensures that we have the greatest possible clarity in terms of the definition of an &quot;adopted person&quot;.  I am bringing forward this amendment to ensure absolute clarity that any child born in Ireland and adopted abroad is included in the Bill.  While this was always the intention, I understand that, in some cases, private arrangements were made without the involvement of an accredited body or an adoption authority.  I want to ensure that, in all cases, a child born in Ireland who was sent for adoption abroad is included.</p><p>Therefore, I propose the definition of an &quot;adopted person&quot; be amended to include a person removed from the State by any other person for the purposes of effecting his or her adoption outside of the State and whose adoption was effected outside the State.  The amendment seeks to recognise the many informal types of arrangements that may subsequently have been formalised and may not have been operated through a body like the Adoption Authority of Ireland, or An Bord Ucht&aacute;la, as it was then, and other agencies.  I am trying to keep the definitions broad so that as many people as possible may use the Bill.  The broader we keep the definitions, the more people who can use the provisions of the Bill and subsequently get the various types of information provided for in it.</p></speech>

I want to speak to this amendment because we had this discussion on Committee Stage.  I welcome that this has been included.  An important point was made about different arrangements.

It was an issue that arose on Committee Stage and I committed to working with my officials to determine whether we have the definition right.  I am pleased to be able to bring forward an amendment which further expands the definition of &quot;care arrangement&quot; to include former foster care by a relative.  Records related to a relevant person foster care placement have always been included in the definition.  This amendment will ensure that where a relevant person was fostered by a relative, the records relating to that placement will also fall to be released.  </p> <p>The amendment slightly broadens the definition, recognising that foster care arrangements, while predominantly with non-relatives, on occasion did happen with relatives and it is right that those relationships should be encompassed within the definitions.

As I stated, there have been many different situations, examples and stories from the time of the mother and baby institutions and it is really important that we have as wide a reach as possible for people to be able to access this legislation.

Collectively, this grouping of amendments removes the time limitation placed on early life information and care information.  When first published, the Bill provided that the definitions of early life information and care information were subject to a limited time period that was deemed to end, in the case of an adopted person, at the date of his or her adoption, or, in the case of a person subject to an illegal birth registration, the date on which his or her social parents assumed their role as parents.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 remove the reference to early life and care definitions being subject to subsection 2(2), while amendment No. 17 deletes subsection 2(2) completely, thus removing that limitation.  I know that Deputies brought forward similar amendments on Committee Stage and, in response, I stated that I would seek to have this timeline removed, subject to consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Following that consultation, I am happy to be in a position to remove subsection 2(2), which means the definition of early life and care information for all relevant persons will now extend all the way up to the age of 18.  Deputies Bacik and Funchion both raised this on Committee Stage.  We did say we would go back and look at it.  I listened to the arguments made and we are making this change on foot of that.</p></speech>

It is good to see it.  A later amendment that I tabled can now be withdrawn on the basis of this amendment.  We will see when we get there.  It is good.  I am glad the Minister has tabled the amendment because one of the things about which we were anxious was that there would not be any limitations.  The amendment is welcome.</p></speech>

This is an amendment to the definitions to include specific reference to photographs within the materials that can be released.  We felt, and still do, that the definitions we provided would have included photographs.  This relates to the items that can be left for people but, importantly, can be protected as well.  Within the Bill, there are the release provisions and there are the protection provisions.  At times during the debate on Committee Stage, those two elements got conflated.  We want to ensure documents can be released, such that a person seeking his or her photograph can get it released, but we also want to make it clear that if a photograph is in a file and no one has asked for that file, the photograph is still protected, along with all the other information.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 provides for the inclusion of a photograph in the early life category of information and amendment No. 16 includes a new text in the definition of a relevant record to ensure clarity that photographs and images are to be safeguarded and protected where they exist within files.  I signalled to Deputies on Committee Stage that I would review this definition to see if it required any expansion and I am happy that the amendment will now provide further clarity and certainty for information sources to safeguard such images.  In addition, relevant bodies will be clear that such images should be released to a relevant person.  Photographs can now, without any question, be released and they will be protected.  There will be an obligation in that regard.</p></speech>

They are all related, so the same argument applies.  I take on board the point that the argument for not using the word "illegal" is that the person has to prove it was illegal and there might be difficulties in that regard, so I am a bit conflicted on it.  However, does amendment No. 2, to which the House has agreed, make any changes to the whole issue in respect of the use of "incorrect" or "illegal"?  Many people feel strongly about this, and rightly so.  When we are discussing this, we all reference it as being illegal; nobody goes around saying it is incorrect.  It is an important point for people who are affected by it that it is called out for exactly what it is.  I do understand, however, that it may cause difficulties.  I am not sure whether amendment No. 2 relates to this issue.  It would be interesting to hear the views of the Minister on that.</p></speech>

Indeed, we submitted an amendment to make a distinction between falsely or otherwise incorrectly.  The Minister took that point on board.  I, too, would welcome clarification on how amendment No. 2, tabled by the Minister, as well as his later amendments which I am delighted to see he has brought forward in respect of a review of incorrect or apparently incorrect birth registration, affect the point we made.  We wanted to ensure there was a distinction between inadvertent false information and deliberately falsifying the information.  It is that distinction between deliberate and inadvertent that we were trying to capture in our amendments.  I know Deputy Funchion has tabled amendments on this.  To some extent, the Minister stated on Committee Stage that he had brought forward an amendment similar to the one I tabled that addressed the issue.</p>  <p>  What Deputy Funchion and I welcome is that the Government amendments, taken together, would recognise the basic illegality of what has occurred.  I did not submit my previous amendments on this point because I think that if all the Government amendments on this issue are accepted, the legislation will address this point.  If I may look ahead to amendment No. 70, it provides that the Minister can authorise the agency and authority to conduct a review or trace, particularly in order to investigate whether there is evidence that a person has been the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  It seems that some of the issues we raised have been addressed but we are seeking confirmation of that.</p></speech>

I made the point that in my communications and those of the Government, in which we have engaged extensively with groups of people who have been subject to illegal birth registrations, we have always used that language of "illegal birth registrations".  I also made the point that we want to ensure people who were subject to illegal birth registrations can use this legislation and that they are defined within the category of those to whom it applies.  We want to make sure people who believe they were subject to illegal birth registration are included.  Tusla identified 141 such persons from St. Patrick's Guild but we know there are others who have very good reasons to believe they also were subject to an illegal birth registration.  We want to ensure as many people as possible can fit within the criteria and definitions of people who can use the provisions of the Bill, including both the existing provisions and some new ones I am introducing via Committee Stage amendment today, particularly the tracing amendment to which Deputy Bacik referred.</p>  <p>  As we have said throughout this debate, the concern is that putting the phrase "illegal birth registrations" in the legislation creates a very high bar to reach.  It would require someone to demonstrate that he or she was the subject of such an illegal registration.  That is why we use the word "incorrect", which is a broader term.  I know this has caused concern and, in my communications on it, I always have tried to show that the sole reason for this is to ensure the definition is wide in order that as many people as possible can fall within the provisions of the Bill and be able potentially to use them to identify finally and conclusively whether they were the subject of an illegal birth registration.  One of the provisions we are bringing in today, as referenced by the Deputy, will strengthen the ability of an individual to look back and see whether he or she was subject to an illegal birth registration and also will enable the Minister to direct Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland to undertake such a trace-back.  That is really important and it is a significant change both for individuals and for the Minister.</p>  <p>  Deputy Funchion spoke about amendment No. 2.  The amendment does not change a specific definition, to be upfront on that, but by bringing in this very substantial change to the Succession Act 1965, there is, I hope, a further demonstration by the Government of our recognition of what was done to people who were subject to illegal birth registration and of the need to make extensive and novel legal changes to address their very difficult situation.  It goes beyond the absolutely traumatic emotional impact of the revelation to which they have been subject, encompassing the very difficult legal situation in which people subject to illegal birth registration have been put.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, recognising there was concern about the use solely of the word "incorrect", which might somehow be seen as a diminution or a glossing over of what happened in terms of illegal birth registrations, we brought forward an amendment, which was similar enough to an amendment brought forward by Deputy Bacik and others.  The proposed section 54, as per our amendment No. 77, provides that the 1965 Act will be amended to state that, "[for] the purposes of this Act, a person is an affected person" where there has been the "giving of information that was false or misleading" in respect of the naming of the mother.  We have added the term "false or misleading" to the definition of the people who are affected, thereby recognising that there was falsity and, in many cases, a deliberate effort to misrepresent the relationships involved.</p>  <p>  We looked at the issue again since Committee Stage and I asked my officials to examine whether any of the changes Deputies are bringing forward today could be made.  The response from the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel was that the proposals put forward would act to undermine the clarity and inclusivity of the Bill.  Much as I would like to take these amendments, we believe they would undermine the clarity and inclusivity of the Bill.  I want the Bill to be accessible to as many people as possible who have questions on their identity.  We want the wrongness of what happened to people to be recognised.  I believe we have gone a significant way to do that in the amendments I brought forward on Committee Stage.  I accept that some people who have been subject to this treatment do not agree, but I have looked at this and have gone as far as I believe can go to address the language used while, at the same time, in every thing I have said and everything the Government has done, we have recognised the illegality of what happened.</p></speech>

Currently, it does not feature the term "illegal adoption", which erases the realities and experiences of many adopted people.  The Minister talks about illegal adoptions, to which reference is made in the explanatory memorandum, but the Bill itself does not contain this vital term.</p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, the Minister outlined that "illegal birth registration" cannot be used in place of "incorrect birth registrations" as it may create a barrier in terms of proving illegality.  That argument was accepted.  However, in response then and now, my amendments and those of others, including amendment No. 13, seek purposely to retain the broader category of incorrect birth registration and allow acknowledgment of what people went through and its lasting impact on their lives.  I was disappointed on Committee Stage that the Minister refused to accept those amendments as the addition of wording around false or misleading information was seen as sufficient.  Affected people do not refer to their adoptions, or the legislation governing them, as being false or misleading; they rightly call them illegal.  The Bill needs to respect their experience.</p>  <p>  The Minister has assured us the Bill is technically correct on this matter, but it is not morally right.  It is incredibly important that the terms "illegal adoptions" and "illegal birth registrations" feature alongside reference to "incorrect registrations".  I fail to see why the Minister and his Department refuse to include a reference to illegality in the Bill.  It not only would be accurate but it would provide an acknowledgement for survivors of some of the worst abuse in the State's history.</p></speech>

It would mean that a requirement or threshold of illegality would need to be met in order for people to be able to use its provisions.  This is something neither I nor any Deputy wants to see.  I have been very clear on my recognition of people's experience, as has the Government in terms of the range of measures we are taking both in this and other legislation to address what was done to people who were subject to an illegal birth registration.</p> <p>There are a number of additional amendments coming forward today.  These are the succession amendments we spoke about earlier and those tracing amendments that specifically address issues raised by the special rapporteur in his detailed piece of work on this legislation.</p></speech>

It is not fair to say that that would limit this to illegal adoptions.  We are asking for illegal adoptions to be included alongside the other forms of adoption.  Just pretending we have not said that every time is frustrating to the people watching this as well as to the Deputies who have made time to table amendments.  The Minister should at least say the Government does not want to include illegal adoptions alongside the other forms and explain why that is, rather than just saying that this would limit it.  We all know it would not.  It is frustrating to hear that over and over again.  If the Minister could explain why he will not include illegal adoption alongside the other definitions of adoptions, that would be incredibly helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="16:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700046#YY00600"><p>I think all of us share that frustration about the language.  We will have an opportunity, I think, to debate this issue further when we come to the later group of amendments concerning the new mechanism for the Minister to authorise the agency or authority to conduct a review or trace where a person believes he or she has been the subject of an incorrect birth registration.  I hope we can revisit that point then.  I think the concern we have is that, without being clear as to what is meant by incorrect birth registration, it may not capture the full experience of somebody who believes there has been a deliberate falsification of records.  Our concern, in a nutshell, is to ensure that that experience can be captured, while appreciating, as the Minister says, that we do not want to set the bar too high and inadvertently exclude persons from the scope of the legislation.  It is a matter of finding that balance of ensuring that people's real experiences are reflected in the legislation without creating any problems for the coverage that the legislation can afford to individuals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="16:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700046#YY00700"><p>In response to Deputy Cairns, we looked at whether we could include definitions of both.  I specifically went to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and inquired on that point because I know it is an issue people feel strongly about.  The concern was that the definition of illegal adoption that was proposed in some of the amendments would not sit with the existing definition of relevant person or the existing definition of adopted persons, that the two definitions, as proposed, sitting together would clash and that that would create a difficulty with the use of the legislation.  I asked about that, we looked to see what we could do and we were not able to resolve that concern.  I would have liked to have been in a position to do so.  As we have seen already this afternoon, I have made a number of amendments on foot of relevant and valid points that were raised on Committee Stage, where I felt that by doing so we would leave the legislation strengthened.  In this case, we did not feel we could do so.</p>  <p>  As to what Deputy Bacik said and the point about the importance of capturing the experience of people, she is right.  I think there was a concern that just using the term "incorrect information" would not perhaps cover that.  That is why, like the Deputy, the Department uses the term "false and misleading".  That term has been placed in the legislation now, so somebody who has an incorrect birth registration due to false or misleading information being provided is provided for in the legislation now.  I therefore think we have addressed that to the extent that we can, working with the advice we have received and ensuring that definitions are inclusive and that nothing we do interferes with the wider actions of provisions within this legislation.</p></speech>

I think amendment No. 29 is the one to which I was referring earlier that we can withdraw now on the basis that the restrictive timeframe has been removed.  Amendment No. 14 is exactly as it says.  It aims to capture the wider range by the use of the word &quot;records&quot; rather than the word &quot;information&quot;.  I suppose we all know - it was discussed on all Stages, on this Stage but particularly on Second Stage and Committee Stage - that there is distrust, understandably so, on the part of people who have survived these institutions.

Some of the amendments I have tabled that are in this grouping are technical amendments that would be consequent on the passage of my amendment No. 59, which would insert a new provision on effectively replacing the mandatory information session with a provision requiring the sending of a prepaid registered post or recorded delivery statement to a person seeking information.

I will speak to amendment No. 58 now then.  The amendment states: &quot;When a relevant person applies under <i>sections 11</i>and <i>12</i>for information and/or when a relevant person applies for their personal data, the relevant body or the Authority will make available all medical records to the relevant person regardless of whether they have explicitly requested those items.&quot;  This amendment is important to ensure that all medical records are made available to the relevant person.</p> <p>A key theme of the pre-legislative scrutiny was that relevant people would be empowered to access as much of their information as possible.  As currently worded, the Bill may be interpreted by the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Tusla or other bodies to provide only information that has been explicitly sought rather than all information, which, in the case of medical records, may have incredibly important details for the person's health.  Given the draconian approach of State bodies and other entities to releasing information, it is necessary the Bill includes this type of explicit obligation.  There is a well-founded distrust of the State on these matters and, in particular, of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla.  As legislators, we need to guarantee that no one will be denied access to their information and that information will not be merely withheld without being denied.</p> <p> When discussing this on Committee Stage, the Minister presented the spurious argument that this amendment seeks to force medical detail on people who have not requested it.  Nowhere, at any stage, did any group or stakeholder even raise the prospect that they would ever be concerned by receiving too much information.  Each and every affected person is continuing to fight for access to information.  This amendment provides some assurances regarding their medical information.</p></speech>

Apologies, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In the context of amendment No. 14, which was tabled by Deputy Funchion, this issue was raised on Committee Stage.  We acknowledge that the assurance about the release not just of the information but of the documents that was repeated in other parts of the legislation had not been continued on there.  We recognise that was an error in the drafting.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 14 seeks to amend the definition of medical information to read medical records.  The intention of this amendment is similar to the intention of my own amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 63 in that it seeks to ensure the release of medical records to a relevant person as opposed to the information contained within a record.  My own amendments No. 56, 57 and 63 seek to remedy an oversight in the originally published Bill, which provided for the medical information of a relevant person but not for the record itself to be released directly to that person.  I know this was an issue of concern on Committee Stage, and I signalled I would table this amendment.  The Government amendment will ensure it is the record containing medical information that will be released to a relevant person.  I therefore think I am addressing Deputy Funchion&rsquo;s amendment No. 14 in the context of those three amendments.  I will speak to her other amendments a little later.</p>  <p>  In terms of the amendment that was tabled by Deputy Cairns, we debated extensively about whether relevant persons and people who are seeking this legislation should be given all information, irrespective of whether they apply for it, or whether they should have a choice about information when making an application.  As we have made very clear, a person will be able to tick a box and apply for all information.  We have also made it clear that people can select which types of information they wish to receive.  I think it is a good thing we give people agency over their determination about what information they can receive.  There may be reasons - and I do not know what those reasons are - people do not wish to receive medical information.  There may be something about their history they do not want to know.  If they wish to make that choice, that is a choice they should make, and the legislation should not constrain or compel them to receive information that they may not wish to receive.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns is right this issue did not arise in pre-legislative scrutiny.  However, we have to recognise there are a substantial number of survivors in this area.  Different survivors, as we all know from our engagements, have different views.  Therefore, leaving the legislation as it is and giving people choice on that matter is the best way to proceed.</p></speech>

These categories of information are open to a range of different interpretations.  Given the experience people have had to date in trying to access information, there is a fear and distrust, as has been mentioned already, that personal data might be held back.  The process is also likely to be extremely confusing for applicants.  Instead of requiring data controllers to provide data subjects with a full schedule of records held, several sections of the Bill state the relevant body may provide the relevant person with a statement, setting out the information that is contained in the records it holds.  However, this is not equivalent to what must be provided to a data subject who makes a subject access request.  We had a discussion about some of those subject access requests, which have been quite successful.  A similar process would be welcome.</p></speech>

This comes back to guaranteeing beyond a shadow of a doubt that adopted people and their relatives will be entitled to access information.  Given the manner in which this access has been denied and continues to be, as well as the levels of distrust in how this Bill will be interpreted by State bodies, I think we are obliged to include extensive and explicit definitions of information relating to adopting and care arrangements.  There cannot be any ambiguity at this time.  State bodies, institutions and the church need to have no room whatsoever to continue to deny people access to their information.</p>  <p>  The Minister referenced in the discussion on amendment No. 14 how a person could request all information or some of the information.  If that is to make sense, then when somebody ticks that box to choose all information pertaining to him or her, we need to go as far as we possibly can in this legislation to ensure all of that information is provided to that person.  There reason I tabled the other amendment is because, for example, if you requested information about your parents, and that was the only thing you were setting out to look for, if there was potentially information there about you relating to, for example, an illegal vaccine trial carried out on you or anything like that, you could find that out without knowing to ask for it.  If we are to accept that, as discussed in amendment No. 14, a person has to pick either just the information requested or all information, we have to ensure that when that person says he or she wants all information, that person absolutely gets all of that information.</p></speech>

This was probably one of the most important issues that we raised on Committee Stage.  Again, all information was crucial here.  That is the one issue we were all firm on, as the Minister was himself.  He has given that commitment, that people who access their information can get all their information or, as the Minister said, if they tick a box to choose whatever information they want, they can to get it.   This is good.  I know the Minister has listened to us.  It is about inclusiveness and making sure people get their information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="16:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700047#ZZ01000"><p>I do not for a minute question any Deputy&rsquo;s view about the spirit of what we are trying to achieve here.  We all are trying to achieve, as Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor just said, the full access to and the full release of all information.  However, I do not believe the change being proposed in this amendment furthers that goal.  I think it actually restricts that goal.</p> <p>Deputy Funchion spoke about the broadest definition of personal data but here we are providing a definition of personal data.  It is a lengthy one and I will talk about its length in a moment, but the amendment is providing a definition that will be in this legislation and the only way that definition can be changed is if this legislation is amended.  What the legislation currently does is include a definition of personal data which is defined as the EU defines it, as the European Court of Justice cases evolve the definition of personal data.  We are referring to the use of personal data in the GDPR and that is interpreted by the European Court of Justice.  If that court changes the definition through its case law, the definition of personal data that we use changes as well.  What this amendment seeks to do is to provide a definition of personal data for this legislation and while it is lengthy, it is conclusive and the only way of changing it is to bring forward amending legislation.  This means that the definition of personal data in this legislation may start to diverge from the most up-to-date interpretation of personal data as per decisions of the European Court of Justice.  I do not think that is a position we want to be in.  We do not want to see Irish law start to diverge from European Court of Justice jurisprudence, particularly when it comes to a definition of personal data that is central to what the GDPR is all about.  That is why I am opposing this amendment.  I do not believe this particular change should be made.</p> <p> As I said, the definition in the amendment is lengthy, with 46 different sections but the majority of these are already covered by the definitions contained in the legislation.  The definitions of birth, early life, care, medical information and provided items cover the majority of those 46 listed types of personal information proposed in the amendment.  However, the list of 46 also contains items of information that do not pertain to the relevant person.  As Deputy Cairns said, this is all about ensuring that information pertaining to the relevant person is available to them but some of those points are not pertaining to the relevant person.  They are pertaining to others and that is not something we can include in the definition of personal data.  </p> <p> We want our definition, the definition we use in this legislation, to be able to expand as the definition from the European Court of Justice expands as well but this amendment would restrict that.  I do not think that is something any of us wants to do and on that basis, I will be opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

Personal data in relation to a relevant person, includes but is not limited to" and so on.  The Minister has said that we are better off sticking with the definitions that are most up to date and in line with the European Court of Justice and the GDPR.  The problem is that this Government and previous governments have form in terms of not having the most open interpretation of the GDPR.  The reason for this amendment is to ensure that information can be accessed.  The aim is to strengthen the approach the Minister is talking about in relation to the most up to date interpretation of the GDPR.  That is not the way Ireland has interpreted it so far and the whole purpose of this amendment is to ensure that finally that actually happens.</p></speech>

That is now a legislative obligation that was never on them previously.  We also have in this legislation the power to draw up ministerial guidelines on the implementation of those interpretations.  If it is seen that a body is seeking to implement them in a restrictive way, a Minister can issue guidelines that make it very clear that is not the way to do it and indicate the direction in which to implement.  Finally, we have our implementation group whereby officials in my Department are engaged directly with Tusla and the AAI in making that culture change that we all recognise is necessary in these institutions.</p>  <p>  We are using the most up to date definition of personal data, linked to the GDPR and as it is defined by the European Court of Justice.  We have the very extensive categories of information that relevant bodies must release.  We have the ability to write and clarify guidelines as we go ahead and we have the ability to engage directly with the agencies through the implementation body.  These four measures will enable us to ensure the spirit of openness, the spirit of release that we spoke about at the start of this section is maintained.</p></speech>

We all know the history of that not really happening and of bodies trying to keep it hidden under the carpet.  The Minister then said that his Department will be tasked with trying to change that culture not only within the Department itself but within organisations like Tusla and the AAI.  I do not know on what planet it makes sense to task the very organisation that has potentially created that culture with trying to change it.  It is not a practical approach to effecting the kind of change about which the Minister is talking.  The very institution that has created a culture is bound to have an inherent aversion to changing it and it is really important to note that.  If we need a change in culture, we should not ask the institutions that have that culture problem to implement that change.</p></speech>

I have seen and I believe there is a culture change beginning in those organisations.  If the Deputy does not accept my view she should, as a committee member, invite Mr. Bernard Gloster, the chief executive of the AAI and engage with him.  I am extremely confident that those bodies are changing and that they see the need for change.  I believe they will see themselves as being empowered by this legislation to change their approach to the release of information to people who were adopted and people who were the subject of illegal birth registrations.  Change has to begin somewhere and I believe we are beginning it in our Department.  When one looks at my Department's approach to subject access requests, for example, more than 500 people have received information from the archive of the Commission of Investigation following on from subject access requests.  An issue came up about the release of medical information and we looked for a work-around.  We brought in amending regulations that have addressed that issue.  Now there is no question of going to a GP.  We brought in regulations to do that.  We could have held off because that is dealt with in this legislation but the principle of the barrier the statutory instrument from 1989 caused was offensive, it had to go, and we did change it.  There is a culture change that is exhibited in Government and which is feeding through the agencies involved but it will be up to all of us, in Government and in Opposition, to police that and make sure it is being delivered on.</p></speech>

I see some very positive changes that have been made since Committee Stage but this remains.  This is the make-or-break section.  If somebody registers a no-contact preference and the person seeking information does not adhere to attending this meeting, he or she will not get his or her information.  I cannot look past this.  It is so wrong.  It means we cannot say that everybody has access, guaranteed access or a right of access.  It does not matter if it affects only one or two people.  Sometimes the argument is used that it is envisaged it will affect a small number of people.  The number of people affected does not matter.  It is the principle of it.  People feel very exercised about it.  They feel really strongly.  On Second Stage a number of Government representatives shared this view and asked that it be looked at.</p><p>When the committee looked at this, we worked very well together.  We came up with the alternative of a letter by registered post.  This has since been dismissed by the Government.  We discussed it for a long time.  With the exception of the Minister, all of us here are members of the committee.  I do not want to speak for anyone but we agreed it was a good alternative.  One reason it is such a good alternative is that it protects the State because there is a record that a letter went to a specific person and nobody can dispute it.  We will be going into &quot;he said, she said&quot; scenarios if we have this type of meeting, whether it is on Zoom or Teams, in a phone call or in person.  People will misinterpret information.  This would protect everybody.  There has been huge progress on the Bill and I acknowledge this.  I was very critical on Second Stage.  I like to acknowledge progress where I see it and to be welcoming of that which we can welcome.  This will be the issue that ultimately will see us unable to support the Bill and I am sorry to say this.  We feel this strongly about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="16:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700049#BBB00300"><p>I have tabled a number of amendments in this grouping.  Most of them are technical.  My substantive amendment is No. 59, which deals with the issue of the mandatory information session.  This is the big sticking point for us with the Bill.  I am very disappointed we did not see progress made on it on Committee Stage.  We had a full debate with the Minister and I acknowledge how much progress was made on other issues on Committee Stage and since then.  We all appreciate the improvements that have been made to the Bill.</p>  <p>  This is still a difficult point for us and for those seeking information.  It means access to birth information remains conditional in certain cases on the holding of this information session.  We all accept, as the Minister said on Committee and Second Stages, the need to balance information rights and privacy rights.  For us the retention of the mandatory information session means privacy rights continue to trump identity rights.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny the committee put forward a unanimous recommendation that an alternative to a mandatory information session as a safeguard to ensure the balance of rights would be sending an appropriate statement by registered post.  In amendment No. 59 I have crafted a mechanism whereby such a statement could be sent by the authority, setting out the relevant matters in writing to a person seeking information.  In my view this would be a sufficient safeguard, along with the other safeguards in the legislation such as the information campaign, the contact preference register and the age limit, to ensure these constitutional rights are balanced.  It would be a more practical mechanism because it would ensure there could be no dispute as to what was said and whether a Zoom call or a meeting had in fact taken place.  It would also show trust in the people seeking information that they would receive this statement and it would be sufficient.</p>  <p>  Since Committee Stage I looked again at section 17 to see what the Government proposes as a safeguard.  The information session need not be in one place but it does require that each participant is able, directly or by means of electronic communications technology, to speak to and be heard by the other participants.  It sets out in subsection (2) the relevant information about which the designated person is to inform the adopted person seeking the information.  Why can this information not simply be set out in a written statement and sent by registered post so there is proof that it has been received?  This is particularly so when section 17(4) requires the designated person, on completion of the information session, to confirm it has taken place and to provide notification.  There is already in the Government's proposal a mechanism for a written statement.  Why not bypass the mandatory information session and bypass this condition on access to information and, as the committee recommended as an ending of a rather paternalistic approach requiring an information session, simply send a statement by registered post?  It is what we do with court summons and other important legal documents.  We think this would be a far preferable method of informing somebody.  It would mean there could be no condition on access.</p>  <p>  I asked the following on Committee Stage and still do not have a response.  What if the adopted persons will not take the Zoom call or meet the designated person?  It would mean they would not get access to the information, as I understand it.  It is a condition upon access to information.  This is against the spirit of the Bill, the otherwise inclusive text in the Bill and the great improvement the Bill makes to the very dated and patriarchal culture we all want to see changed.  It has changed so much in so many other provisions of the Bill.  It is most regrettable we have not seen movement on the information session.  Amendment No. 59 in particular seeks to make this change and put into effect what the committee unanimously recommended during pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was unambiguous in recommending that the mandatory information session should be removed from the legislation and that alternative appropriate safeguards should instead be provided for, such as the sending of correspondence by registered post.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission stated the information session presented an obstacle and potentially a complete barrier to individuals accessing long-sought information.  The Council of Irish Adoption Agencies described it as contradictory to the spirit of the Bill.  Others classified it as insulting, discriminatory and restrictive.  That it is still in the Bill in its current form is deeply concerning.  It is ignoring the wishes of people affected and human rights experts.  If we accept the Minister's argument that some mechanism is necessary to address balancing the rights to accessing information and privacy, then the registered post option should be pursued rather than the paternalistic and insulting requirement for an adopted person having to sit down with a State agent who explains what the person already knows.  Adopted people are already very knowledgeable about access to information and privacy.  They have been forced to be so by this and previous governments.</p>  <p>  The Minister's position fails to acknowledge that the secrecy was imposed by State agencies and religious orders on adopted people and parents.  There was a systematic and highly organised process to arrange illegal adoptions, falsify records and cover up the whole thing.  The refusal to allow people access their personal information was always about this system protecting itself.  Unfortunately, the ongoing restrictions with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the most conservative possible interpretations by State bodies continues.  If the Minister insists on retaining this barrier, then in line with the discussions of the committee on children, Deputy Bacik's amendment would ensure that at least it is non-invasive and considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="16:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700050#CCC00100"><p>The information session is about the balancing of two sets of fundamental rights.  There is the fundamental right to identity information of adopted people, and it is a right we all know has been denied for so long.  There is also the fundamental right to privacy of a parent.  The information session would apply in a very small number of circumstances because it will only apply where a parent has proactively indicated on the contact preference register a "no contact" preference.  There is an existing national contact preference register and we have discussed before the very small number of parents who have indicated such a choice.  It is in double figures.  Nevertheless, that small number of people have indicated a clearly demonstrated expression of their wish to exercise a right to privacy or anonymity.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns spoke with great elegance about the system of secrecy that was developed here and she is right in all she says.  It is not for me or any of us if a parent wishes to register a "no contact" preference to question that or dispute their desire.  I do not dispute that anyway, although others may do so.  If those parents, for whatever reason, believe they need some barrier to contact, it is not for the Oireachtas to dispute that view.</p>  <p>  The question is then how to balance their desire to exercise their fundamental right to privacy with the desire for information.  We have established in this legislation a system or process whereby in every case the adopted person will get the full right of access to information.  In every case following this process, full information would be provided.  Sometimes we forget what a sea change that is and the scale of the change this legislation is bringing compared with the current position, where the working assumption is one of restriction rather than release, and keeping the information hidden.  That is because of constitutional reasons arising from the court case in the late 1990s.  I know there have been disputes around its interpretation but that Supreme Court decision has had that restrictive effect.  That court case indicates there are individuals who will go all the way to the Supreme Court because of their concern about their privacy rights.  I do not question that judgment call but it is why so many of the attempts to legislate in this area have floundered.  There is a worry about the constitutional balancing test.</p>  <p>  In engaging with the Attorney General and in particular since the introduction of the GDPR, which is a much stronger recognition within EU law of privacy rights, we have been able to find a mechanism that seeks to balance those two sets of rights.  It is a mechanism we did not invent and it has been brought forward before.  It has been proposed by academics and advocacy groups in previous draft legislation.  People can disagree with it but when it is described as insulting or degrading to people, I will make the point again that this mechanism has been proposed for use as a balancing of that incredibly difficult set of rights that are so fundamental to different individuals.</p>  <p>  We have changed how we set about this balancing process, despite it being said that nothing has been done here.  We brought forward a significant amendment on Committee Stage recognising that some of the language relating to the explanation of privacy rights - the language used in original drafts - was not okay and we should not talk about that.  Now the information session, to be used in a very small number of cases, is to be purely factual.  The relevant person - an adopted person or person subject to an illegal birth registration - would be told the parent has exercised an entitlement under section 38(11) of the Bill to state he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person and the making of that statement by the parent constitutes an exercise by him or her of a right to privacy.  After that has been conveyed, the full information would then be released.</p>  <p>  We believe this must happen to ensure this legislation is constitutionally sound and protected.  I strongly believe that at some point the legislation will be challenged.  There is a very high likelihood that will happen.  It is legitimate for someone to do that.  We have waited 20 years for this legislation and seen four, five or six attempts at drafts of legislation not getting through this House because of an inability to resolve this matter.  I do not want a result where the legislation, on which all of us in the House have worked very hard to get broad definitions and processes that are working well, would be at risk of constitutional challenge.</p>  <p>  We went into the proposal of a registered letter.  Notwithstanding the possibility of somebody signing to indicate receipt of the letter, there is the question of whether the point would be conveyed.  The indication has been that the method set out here is the greatest restriction of the privacy rights of parents that we are prepared to bring forward as constitutionally valid.  We have a duty to ensure this legislation is valid so the right to full information release provided can be delivered to adopted people.</p></speech>

That is absolutely the spirit in which I bring forward this amendment, supported by my colleagues.</p>  <p>  The Minister indicates this will only apply to a small number of persons but that is precisely the point.  It will apply to those adopted persons who seek their birth information and whose birth parent has entered a "no contact" preference, as is their right.  In such a case an adopted person who does not participate in this mandatory information session will not have access to the birth information, so it places a condition on access and it is discriminatory against a small number of adopted persons.</p>  <p>  I look again to what was said when the Bill had pre-legislative scrutiny.  We said then that adopted people whose parent registers a "no contact" preference would under the Government proposal be singled out for differential treatment in a targeted warning about privacy rights.  We also said that the mandatory information session was seen by some witnesses as compounding misguided fears about adopted people and perpetuating the injustice they have suffered for years, and that an alternative should be sought.</p>  <p>  It is clearly not for us to dispute or undermine a birth parent's right to enter a "no contact" preference but that entry should not then lead to a scenario where those adopted persons are singled out for particular treatment.  My amendment seeks to give effect to our alternative safeguard proposal of a registered post letter and to apply it to all adopted persons.  It would set out whether the birth parent's desire was to have contact, so it would not be discriminatory, but it would supply the information.  It would supply it in a way that could be proven to have been received.  For us this is about trust in adopted persons and trusting that an adopted person informed that the birth parent has entered a "no contact" preference will not seek to contact that parent.</p>  <p>  The reality is that under the Government's proposal an adopted person in such a case who participates in an information session will receive the information.  There is no block on the information and the process does not safeguard the birth parent's privacy to that extent.  We are all agreed on that.</p>  <p>  As the Minister has said, we have moved on.  I proposed a somewhat similar version of this some years ago when working with the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Katherine Zappone, to try to achieve workable legislation that would finally give effect to adopted persons' identity rights.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>At that point, the Attorney General advised that even that was not possible, and that a statutory declaration would have to be signed by an adopted person, because there was so little trust in adopted persons.  The Minister is right in saying we have moved on from that.  Our culture of "restrict, do not release" has happily changed.  However, section 17 of this Bill remains a last vestige of that outdated culture and lack of trust.  I know the Minister has tried to move it on.  We tried to move it on on Committee Stage.  We believed we had achieved a compromise that would provide a safeguard for respecting privacy rights and a proven mechanism for saying the information was received by the adopted person, without singling out adopted persons whose birth parents had entered a particular no-contact preference.  We have all moved on.  We believe the registered post option is now the best option, and should be acceptable in our new culture in which we know a lot more about identity rights, in which EU law has moved on, and in which we are better achieving mechanisms for the balancing of rights.  It is in that vein I say I still have no response to my question.  What if an adopted person in this small category, whose birth parents entered a no-contact preference, does not wish to participate in an information session?  They will not have access to birth information, and that is unfair.  </p></speech>

I must say at the outset, for clarity, that nobody has any issue with a birth parent who wants to register a no-contact preference.  It is the parent's right to do so.  Everybody would respect that.  Some of us believe this mandatory information session, the information session or whatever people want to call it, is not actually necessary.  It was in the spirit of accepting that it is necessary that we looked at alternatives.  We are not saying we should get rid of it and have nothing.  We are willing to state that there is an issue or difficulty in the balancing of the privacy rights and people's right to their information and identity. I cannot understand how the suggestion of the registered post option is not acceptable.  I cannot get my head around it.  I think it is the perfect alternative.  In fact, as I said earlier, I think it gives greater protection to the State, because there is clearly a record.  If that is what we are trying to achieve, with the registered post option there would be a very clear record.  I do not see why the option cannot be looked at.  I think it is much more respectful for people.  Again, I do not think it matters if there is only one person who is affected by this.  We are still potentially leaving out one person.  I feel very strongly about it, as I know others do.  In fairness, at the start of this debate, we welcomed all of the improvements and changes.  I do not think anybody here is being critical just for the sake of it.  There has been good progress made.  However, this remains a serious sticking point.  As I said, I do not think I can support the legislation if it is not changed.  I really hope that Deputy Bacik's amendment, in particular, is supported.  We cannot have a situation where people are being called into these information sessions.  We have gone way past that.  We have improved in so many areas in relation to the whole mother and baby situation. We need to have the registered post option.</p></speech>

That is evident in the fact that we are not debating amendments to remove the no-contact preference.  We are debating amendments on removing a mandatory information session for adopted people.  The Minister bringing that into it is evidence of the non-existence of legitimate argument in keeping a mandatory information session.  If we accept the Minister's argument that some mechanism is necessary to address the balancing of rights of accessing information and privacy, then the registered post option should be pursued rather than the paternalistic and insulting requirement for an adopted person to have to sit down with a State agent who explains to them what they already know.  As I said previously, adopted people are already very knowledgeable about access to information and privacy.  They have been forced to be knowledgeable about it by this Government and previous Governments.  They do not need a mandatory information session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="17:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700051#DDD00400"><p>I thank Deputy Bacik, in particular, for tabling amendment No. 59.  It is certainly a key issue for me, and a breaking point.  First of all, I acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by the committee and the Minister.  However, all of that work was done on the backs of the suffering of women.  We have to acknowledge that.  All of these changes were forced, every step of the way in the whole process.  I think the Minister would acknowledge that.  I could pick any one of a number of examples, including the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, the discovery of the Tuam site, the delays, leaks, misinformation, and the case of the Northern Irish woman who asked for her name to be removed.  I could go on, but I will not, because it is out of context, except to say that trust is of the utmost importance when we are discussing this Bill.  The absence of trust did not come proactively from the Minister.  It is no reflection on him; he has done tremendous work.  It did not come proactively from the Government or from the committee, that has worked very hard on this legislation, as most committees do.  It is important to reiterate the point that it has come from scandal after scandal, leak after leak and tremendous suffering.  The absence of trust with people on the ground in relation to the system is palpable.  The Minister will recall when there was a webinar and people were not given copies of the report, even though it was reported in every news bulletin that they would be briefed beforehand.  We are back to this legislation to provide for a right to records about one's identity.  We are in the 21st century and the year 2022, and we have to bring forward legislation on this issue.  We can imagine what women, and children who are now grown up, have gone through in relation to it.</p>  <p>  What is happening under section 17 of the Bill is perfunctory.  It sounds very serious when we say we have to balance the rights of the parents who do not want any contact.  If the exercise in relation to the balancing of rights is necessary, it would be much more effective and in keeping with that obligation, if that obligation exists, to do what Deputy Bacik's amendment is proposing, namely, to send a registered letter to everyone.  Without a doubt, what the Government is doing here is, once again, infantilising women.  I note the Minister is shaking his head.  However, that is exactly what the Government is doing.  In his contribution, the Minister talked about the sea change that has come about, and the movement away from the working assumption that documents should not be released to the assumption that they should be released.  That is nothing to do with a proactive system.  I can think of people, straight off, as all Deputies can, who today are still struggling through the courts to get basic information.  I can think of a person who has gone to practically every length to make it public, much and all as he did not want to.  I know, on every level, professionally and personally, of the struggle and the difficulties that people have on the ground.  We are continuing here, as if this balancing of rights is something positive, after much struggle and debate, when it is perfunctory in the extreme.  It can happen on Zoom or it can happen on a partly connected phone call, given the way that our phones are interrupted on a constant basis.  It is simply perfunctory, insulting and unacceptable.  For me, it is key that this requirement is dropped from the Bill.  Unfortunately, my name is not on the amendment.  Otherwise, I would certainly be pushing it to a vote.  I cannot accept this.  It has been pointed out by those who will suffer the most, and who have suffered the most.  It has also been pointed out by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other human rights organisations.  This is not a proper balancing of rights, if that is what needs to be done.  We cannot set up the fundamental right to know one's identity against privacy in this manner. Deputy Bacik's amendment has gone a long way to balancing that right, within the Government's framework, which I do not accept.  I accept it for the sake of the argument.  I fully support this amendment.  I hope it is pushed the whole way.</p></speech>

That is why in every situation where this Bill is used, the full information will be provided to a woman, or any adopted person, or any person subjected to an illegal birth registration.  All of the information about their parent, their mother, will be released to them.  That is why this legislation is so significant.  That is why this legislation represents such a change.  We trust people so we issue them the information in every situation under the process set out within this legislation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik asked a question and I believe I answered it on Committee Stage.  If someone decides not to use the process set out in this legislation, they may use the GDPR process.  They have the right to do that.  GDPR will probably give them much of what is here, maybe all of what is here, whereas this legislation gives them the absolute right in every circumstance to the full information.  GDPR brings us back to the place where we do not want to be, where the data controller in each individual situation weighs the rights of the parent with the rights of the adopted person and makes a judgment call in every situation.  That is what we want to move away from; and that is what we move away from with this legislation.  Using this legislation, everyone in every circumstance will get full access to their information.</p>  <p>  Again, sometimes I think there is no recognition of the stakes here.  What we are doing is a very significant restriction of the privacy rights of the parent in these situations.  It is right that we do it.  We need to do it to vindicate the right to identity.  However, like it or not, we have a system in this country where, when the Oireachtas restricts the fundamental rights of certain citizens, the courts have a right to adjudicate whether that restriction was done correctly and whether it was done proportionately.  We know from the history of this area that it is an area that is litigated, and people feel so strongly about their desire not to be revealed that they have taken litigation before.  We have gone with the alternative to the Attorney General and we have discussed that.  The legal advice I have received is that the mechanism proposed here is the greatest restriction on the privacy rights that we can allow for without a risk of unconstitutionality.</p></speech>

I want to clarify again that nobody is saying that people should not have a right to register a no-contact preference.  It is very important that point is clarified.  What we are arguing is how that information then has an impact on the adopted person getting their information.  That has been said with regard to people having the right.  We fully accept that people have the right to register a no-contact preference and that is not the issue here.  I want to make that point very clear.  It is how that information is communicated.  Some people will argue there is no need for any sort of an information session.  What we are saying is that if there is a need, it should be done by registered letter.  I still have not been convinced as to why that is not the case.</p></speech>

They address the introduction of timelines for an application in the form of maximum statutory timeframes for the release of information under this legislation, reflecting recommendations made during the joint committee's pre-legislative scrutiny process.  No amendments were tabled regarding this point on Committee Stage.  I noted, however, that I would seek to bring forward a proposal on this Stage.</p><p>These amendments are important and will provide clarity for people applying for their information under this legislation.  The proposed maximum timeframes mirror those used in the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  We are using the GDPR timeframes as a model for the timeframes within which the various authorities and agencies will have to respond to applicants with the relevant information.  Provision is made for the information to be released within one month of receipt of an application made under this legislation.  In the exceptional circumstances of a particularly complex application, an additional two months is provided for the release of information.  Stringent and tight timelines are provided for.  This recognises the importance of getting this information.  It also recognises that a concern raised during the joint committee's deliberations in respect of ensuring that people do not have their applications put on the long finger when seeking their information.</p> <p>I hope this amendment can be supported.</p></speech>

Deputy Bacik referred to them earlier.  They provide for further services for persons who believe that their birth was illegally registered.  These are services that are recommended by the special rapporteur for child protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, in the report which he submitted to me last October and which I published in March of this year.  The special rapporteur set out 17 recommendations in his report.  These amendments give effect to recommendations 8 to 12, which were to create a specialist tracing service to undertake a review and a full trace of files where Tusla had previously found suspicious markers.  The recommendations also seek an expedited review for persons who hold reasonable suspicions that they may have been the subject of an illegal birth registration in order to ascertain whether their birth was illegally registered.</p><p>To give full effect to these recommendations, amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, amend section 32 to include a new type of trace for persons who have reasonable grounds for suspecting that their birth is illegally registered.  This is for that category of people and many of us have met them.  They are not part of the St. Patrick's Guild group but they may have been told by a family member that their parent was not their birth parent.  They may have stumbled across a piece of information.  There are various reasons people may have a very real and meaningful suspicion that they may be the subject of an illegal birth registration.  With these provisions, not only are they allowed to use the legislation to find information but the tracing service allows them to get clarity on the fact as to whether they were the subject of an illegal birth registration.  The proposed new subsection will empower a person to request that Tusla or the authority use its tracing powers to ascertain whether the person's birth was illegally registered.  This will mean a thorough review and inquiry can happen for those people who have reason to believe their birth was illegally registered.  I hope this will finally give answer and closure to people in that situation.</p><p>Separately, amendments are proposed to section 33, with amendments Nos. 69 to 72, inclusive, being consequential amendments.  They provide for a similar but slightly separate measure.  They ensure that the Minister can direct Tusla or the authority to undertake a review of files or to trace a person in situations where it is to be established whether an illegal birth registration has taken place.  Where this is established, they further empower the Minister to direct Tusla or the authority to trace the person in order to inform them that they are the subject of an illegal birth registration.  Tusla and the authority will have the power to share information with each other and to seek information from the bodies listed in section 34(6) in order to establish whether an illegal birth registration occurred.  This was a key recommendation from Professor O'Mahony.  It is quite a significant power but it gives the power, too, where there is a very strong suspicion discovered not by an individual but by Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland that someone has been the subject of an illegal birth registration.  It allows a trace to be undertaken to confirm that and it allows the individual to be informed.  It is about validating the key right to identity that has been denied to people who have been subject to illegal birth registrations.  It is an important recommendation of Professor O'Mahony and one we are happy to be able to put into legislation here and put into operation through our additional resourcing of Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.</p><p>To summarise, these amendments provide for three key matters.  First, they empower a person to apply for an inquiry to be undertaken to ascertain whether their birth was illegally registered where that is the person's wish.  Second, they provide that review of files can take place where this is in the public interest.  Third, they ensure that a person can be traced to inform them that their birth was illegally registered.</p></speech>

I referred to them previously, as the Minister said.  They provide for important new mechanisms for a person who has reasonable grounds for suspecting they are the subject of an incorrect birth registration to initiate the conduct of inquiries by the agency or authority.  They also empower the Minister to conduct a review.  I acknowledge the work of the special rapporteur, Dr. Conor O'Mahony, and those very brave individuals who themselves were the subject of illegal adoptions and who went public with their experiences in such a powerful way to expose this awful practice that had gone on for far too long.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister's move on this and indeed his change in light of the amendment I put in to reflect the point on "false or misleading" in respect of birth registration.  I welcome that this change was made on Committee Stage, as we said earlier.  These amendments really will provide additional supports and comfort to those who have been the subject of illegal birth registrations, which is very welcome.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed, however, that we have not seen any similar movement on the mandatory information session.  I know we have debated the matter and I also called a vote on it.  Deputies Funchion, Cairns and I have acknowledged the movement and improvement that has been made to the legislation through the course of the legislative process.  I am conscious that the Bill still has to go to the Seanad.  I wonder if it would be possible for the mandatory information session to be reviewed again by the Minister, his colleagues and the Attorney General in light of the strong views expressed not just by me as the proposer of amendment No. 59 on the replacement of the mandatory information session but indeed by other colleagues too.  I wonder if it could just be looked again to see if there is any other appropriate mechanism that could be inserted.  We have seen a very sweeping, welcome change made, particularly in amendment No. 70, which I agree is really significant, empowering the Minister to authorise the agency and authority to conduct a review in this scenario to establish whether a person has been the subject of an illegal birth registration.  This is a big change to the law and a very welcome one.  Is it possible to see a way to making a similar change to the mandatory information session in section 17 between now and the conclusion of the Bill through the legislative process in the Seanad?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work that has been done, particularly around the working in amendment No. 70.  It is really significant and quite strong.  It shows what can be done and achieved when there is not just consultation but, as Deputy Bacik has said, all the various discussions throughout the Stages.  I support what Deputy Bacik has said about the mandatory information session.  We are down to the one key sticking point now but it is very significant.  Is there anything that could be done to address that before the conclusion of the legislation?</p></speech>

Is there any chance of that last change being made in respect of the mandatory information session?  If we accept the Minister's argument that it has to be there, a really good compromise would be if the way it was carried could be achieved through Deputy Bacik's amendment.  There would be a lot more support for the Bill if that was reconsidered in the Seanad, as Deputy Bacik has said.</p></speech>

Based on all our meetings and from listening to Professor Conor O'Mahony, these amendments are very important.  They are amendments we had looked for and I welcome them.  It is important for people to know that the Minister is going to make provision for a tracing inquiry to be launched.</p> <p>The timeframe is another huge issue that the Minister is addressing.  The committee has worked so hard on this.  These amendments are really welcome and will have a huge impact on adoptees.</p></speech>

The first is a technical amendment to section 32(3)(c) as it refers erroneously to the authority instead of the agency.  This section relates to an application for tracing.  It is the agency that is the lead in tracing, and the applications will be made to it.  Therefore, it should be it that specifies the manner of the application.  There is also a technical amendment to section 38(6), which refers erroneously to the agency instead of the authority.  This section empowers the Minister to issue directions to the authority and therefore the wording needs to be amended.  It is the authority, rather than the agency, that shall comply with the direction.</p></speech>

It is particularly significant in cases where there are parents who do not reveal themselves and for whom there is a barrier to any contact with an adopted person, even if it is just about information.  The amendment seeks to expand the categories of persons eligible to apply to the contact preference register to include a close friend of a parent who is now deceased.  I am happy to propose this additional category.  It is a positive step that reflects and recognises the close relationships a parent may have had with a friend who may have valuable information for the relevant adoptee &mdash; the person subject to an illegal birth registration &mdash; who is seeking information.  We know from our consultations with the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which currently facilitates the national adoption contact preference register and that will hold the new contact preference register being established under this legislation, that friends of a parent may have important and meaningful information to share with relevant persons about a parent's time with his or her child or life after an adoption took place.  The amendment will enable the sharing of this information.</p><p>The amendment is also in response to amendments brought forward by several Deputies on Committee Stage.  I agreed with the spirit of those amendments and indicated I would seek to introduce amendments with the same effect on Report Stage.  I refer to where a parent gave a child up for adoption and discussed it with a friend but kept it from her family.  Where that parent dies without having had contact with the adopted child, the adopted child may be able to use this legislation to get the birth certificate and relevant information.  The colour, the real-life experiences, are denied to the adoptee because the parent is dead but the legislation allows a friend of the parent to place their name on the contact preference register so the adopted person can, on searching the register, find someone who knew their parents and who may be able to describe who they were and their lives, and perhaps provide some important birth information that cannot be filled in with all the information about the early life.  It will never make up for the fact that the adopted person will not be able to meet their parent but it can give substantial information through an engagement and, perhaps, build up a whole new relationship.  I acknowledge that Deputies opposite proposed this idea.  We sought to see how it could be implemented and we made provision for it in the Bill.  This is another positive step and I hope Deputies will support it.</p></speech>

Maybe it was Deputy Bacik who made the proposal on Committee Stage.  It was a really good suggestion and I am glad to see it in the legislation.  For me, it shows that so much progress can be made.  This goes back to the point that if we could just make progress on the one outstanding issue, it would make the difference between our supporting the legislation and our not doing so.  The amendment is a really important one.  It was really well thought out.  In fairness to the officials and the Minister, it is really significant that it has been included.</p></speech>

It provides for a more inclusive approach, which is very welcome.  So much of the Bill is welcome, and so many of the amendments are welcome.  We have welcomed all the Minister's amendments, I believe.  There is just the one sticking point left, namely, the provision in section 17.  It is a very significant difficulty for us.  This is a Bill that my party and I really want to support.  Undoubtedly, it will result in considerable progress regarding the rights of adopted persons to know their own identity and access the sort of birth information that is routinely available to the adopted persons in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Our concern, mentioned in our pre-legislative scrutiny report, is that Ireland will remain an outlier if, through what section 17 proposes, we continue to place a condition on access to birth information, even for a small category of adopted persons.  If there could be some movement on this between now and the passage of the Bill in the Seanad, it would be really welcome.  I do not want to have to oppose the Bill at all because it is so welcome.  I commend the Minister and his officials on the enormous progress made.  As I said earlier and on Committee Stage, I am so aware of the enormous difficulties we have had in trying to get to this stage with the legislation.  There have been many iterations of the Attorney Generals' advice on this over the years.  There is just this one final hurdle; so many others have been cleared.  While there has been so much goodwill and meeting of minds on changes that improved the Bill greatly, and while so many have had an input, including all the witnesses who gave evidence to the joint committee, particularly Professor Conor O'Mahony, and the Minster's officials and the Attorney General, there is just the one remaining sticking point.  It is really a vestige of a dated culture.  As the Minister put it himself, there was a "restrict, not release" culture that always saw privacy rights trumping identity rights and that saw distrust of women and children.  We all know that culture should be long gone and we do not want to see any more vestiges of it in our legislation.</p>  <p>  For us, the sticking point concerning the mandatory information session still remains.  It retains too much of the past culture in the Bill.  It does not fit.  Given the many improvements to the Bill since we began debating it, including amendment No. 73 and those ministerial amendments we have just agreed to, section 17 will come to be seen as an outlier.  Indeed, it could well form the basis of litigation by those adopted persons in that small category to which I have referred, whose birth parents, as was their right, indicated a no-contact preference.  An adopted person in that scenario who does not engage in the mandatory information session will not then have access under this legislation to his or her birth information.  Therefore, such adoptees may well see it as discriminatory against them.  That discrimination is built into the Bill, and that is what we are objecting to.  I realise we have had an opportunity to debate it; however, in light of the other significantly progressive and welcome amendments, it stands out as an obstacle to supporting the Bill in its entirety.</p></speech>

We are an outlier now, and this Bill brings us into compliance with where Europe is in terms of the release of birth information and puts us far in advance of a number of European countries.  A number of European countries had equally restrictive practices to the ones we are casting to history through the introduction of this legislation.  It will, in every circumstance, allow for the full release of information.  I wanted to make that point.

The section obliges a secondary information source to retain and maintain relevant records held.  The amendment seeks to ensure clarity that the obligation on a secondary source to retain and maintain records should not interfere with any transfer or records anticipated under action 8 of the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions or in accordance with that body's obligations under the National Archives Act 1986.  This amendment is necessary to ensure accurate information sources are clear, and even though they are to retain records, this should not stop the transfer of records in line with other obligations.</p><p>As we know, we are developing this Bill as the fastest way to deliver full access to information for adopted people, those who were boarded out and those who were subject to illegal birth registrations.  We have also made it clear we want to provide for a changed landscape in terms of the collation and availability of records generally.  As we know, this was set out in the action plan in terms of the idea of a national records and memorial centre.  That is the long-term goal, namely, for records to be available in a place where historians can inspect relevant records and individuals can inspect their own records and we have a space where we can memorialise and learn what happened in these institutions.</p><p>As Deputies know, since our discussions on Committee Stage we brought forward an additional announcement in terms of a national records and memorial centre.  We have selected the site on Sean McDermott Street.  We will also consider ways in which to make this more widely available online and, potentially, to support work elsewhere.  The amendment recognises the two processes that are being put in place.  We are allowing for immediate access to all information now, wherever that information is held, be it in Tusla, the Adoption Authority of Ireland or somewhere else.  We have a long-term goal of collation.  That speaks to an issue raised by Deputies in respect of concerns about Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland implementing this process.  I have heard those concerns.</p><p>What we decide now does not bind us in the future.  We know the fastest way to get access to information for persons who are elderly or who have waited a long time for information is to ensure they can get access to information through the sources that hold that information now.  This is what the Bill provides for.</p></speech>

They illustrate the complexity of the situation and the history that lies behind the Bill.  They show why so much thought needs to be put into transferring records and the sources for records and information, given the very piecemeal history of adoption legislation and practices in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I want to refer to the Minister's comment on my use of the term "outlier".  That word was used in our pre-legislative scrutiny report.  When we spoke about the mandatory information session, the committee said that in the international context, Ireland will remain an outlier with the conditional access proposed in the Bill.  That was a term used in the report and that is why I used it today.  It is unfortunate we could not move further, given where we are now and how much movement there has been on so much more, including in amendments Nos. 75 and 76.  The fact that section 17 remains in its current form is, as I have said, out of keeping with the general spirit and tone elsewhere in the Bill and the amendments the Minister has put forward, which we have all welcomed and which have made such improvements to the Bill.</p></speech>

As Deputies know, most Bills now have a review clause whereby they will be reviewed in terms of their actions within a specific period of time.  Under the initial legislation, the proposal was for a review within four years.</p><p>Deputy Funchion brought forward an amendment proposing the period be one year.  I said that I did not think one year was enough time to examine the overall operation of the legislation.  Therefore, I am bringing forward what I hope will be an agreeable compromise to review the legislation at the two-year point.  This will give sufficient time for it to be implemented and qualitative and quantitative data to be collected to make sure the review can be meaningful.  It will take time for the process to scale up.  There is a risk that in doing a review too early, potential issues and flaws would not yet have materialised.  Two years is a good timeframe at which to carry out a review.  That is the nature of this amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-04-27a.725" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="18:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042700059#MMM00700"><p>The first financial resolution provides for a temporary reduction in VAT on gas and electricity.  At present, gas and electricity have a 13.5% VAT rate applied.  This will be reduced to a 9% VAT rate from 1 May to 31 October 2022.</p>  <p>  The second financial resolution provides for an extension and enhancement of the excise duty decreases on mineral oil taxes the Government provided for in March.  The VAT-inclusive 20 cent reduction in the mineral oil tax rate for petrol and the 15 cent reduction on auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction for marked gas oil, MGO, also known as green diesel, were due to last until 31 August 2022.  The cost of this measure was &euro;320 million.  The purpose of this financial resolution is to extend these temporary reductions until budget day, with effect from 1 May.  The estimated cost of this change is &euro;80 million.  In addition, the financial resolution provides for a further VAT-inclusive reduction in mineral oil tax of 3 cent per litre on MGO, with effect from 1 May until budget day.  The estimated cost of this change is &euro;17 million.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the impacts of the current energy crisis and understands how it has contributed to a rise in the cost of living.  While the energy crisis is driven primarily by global factors, the Government has taken the decision to reduce VAT on gas and electricity to alleviate some of these impacts and to extend the temporary reduction in mineral oil tax.</p>  <p>  Regarding VAT, Ireland has maintained a historical derogation in respect of the VAT rate on gas and electricity since 1991.  This has allowed us to apply a reduced rate of 13.5% but also prevented us from lowering the VAT rate below 12%.  Following lengthy negotiations, amendments to the VAT directive were provisionally agreed in December 2021, with final sign-off on the amended text taking place at an ECOFIN meeting in April 2022.  The new agreement came into effect on 5 April 2022.  Under this agreement, annexe III of the VAT directive has been expanded to include gas and electricity.  This means Ireland can apply a reduced rate of 9% to these products in line with other goods and services to which a reduced rate applies.  The Government has made a decision to avail of this flexibility from 1 May, which is the start of the next VAT returns period.  The VAT reduction from 1 May and the extension of the reduction in mineral oil tax will add to the already substantial support provided by the Government to help with the cost of living.  In terms of revenue impacts, the six-month decrease in VAT is estimated to cost &euro;46 million.</p>  <p>  I turn now to the amendments to Financial Resolution No. 1 tabled by Deputy Doherty of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I note that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are contingent on amendment No. 3.  I therefore propose to address all three together.  The purpose of these amendments is to give effect to a VAT reduction on kerosene, bringing it from 13.5% to 9%.  Deputy Doherty provides in amendment No. 3 that the amendments will only go ahead if the European Commission confirms that such a change would not impact on Ireland's historical derogation.  As he will be aware, amendments to the VAT directive came into effect on 5 April 2022.  While annexe III was expanded to include gas and electricity, it does not include any mention of home heating oil.</p>  <p>However, this new agreement on VAT rates also preserved Ireland's historical derogations in respect of fuel and oil despite them not being included in annexe III.  It is on that basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel and oil for domestic and commercial purposes.  The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a parked rate and cannot be reduced below 12%.  It should be noted that other member states must apply their standard rate of VAT to this product.</p> <p> The first issue that arises with Deputy Doherty's approach is that lowering the VAT rate on kerosene under 12% would be a breach of the EU VAT directive.  The Deputy may be aware that Commissioner Gentiloni issued a letter to all EU finance ministers about the energy crisis, responding to points the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his European counterparts have raised seeking greater flexibility.  The Commissioner highlighted the current flexibility provided by EU directives, including the newly agreed amendment to VAT rates.  The Commissioner indicated that the Commission does not envisage any further revisions of the EU taxation framework to respond to the current crisis.  In circumstances in which the Commissioner has been clear that he does not envision further flexibility in respect of VAT being adopted, a deliberate breach of the VAT directive would lead to infringement proceedings.</p> <p> The second issue arising from the Deputy's approach is the suggestion that clarity would be sought from the Commission on the retention of Ireland's historical derogation on kerosene into the future.  There are conditions attached to all historical derogations when it comes to VAT.  One of those conditions is that if it is no longer being applied, it is deemed to be removed and cannot be returned.  Another condition is that the historical derogation cannot be lower than 12%.  Therefore, in addition to being a breach leading to an infringement, the move of kerosene to 9% by definition would remove it from the historical derogation we currently apply.</p> <p> The fourth amendment from the Deputy proposes various further rate reductions from 1 May until budget day.  The Deputy is seeking to reduce the mineral oil tax rates on petrol and diesel to the minimum rates as prescribed in the energy tax directive and to reduce further the rate on marked gas oil by 2 cent.  The amendment also seeks to remove the carbon component on kerosene, reducing the overall rate to zero.  The proposed mineral oil tax rate for diesel would not be compliant with the minimum rates set out in the energy tax directive.  The combined effect of the measures the Government has already provided means that the current mineral oil tax rate for diesel, in addition to the diesel rebate scheme, is effectively at the minimum allowable under the energy tax directive.  Any further excise reduction, as the Deputy proposes, would bring the effective rate below the minimum permissible rate.  To apply a mineral oil tax rate of 33 cent per litre would mean that the Government would have to scrap the diesel rebate scheme, which is a targeted support for hauliers and public transport operators.</p> <p> Mineral oil tax on kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of &euro;0.  The carbon component is currently &euro;84.84 per 1,000 l.  The Deputy proposes removing completely this carbon tax element, thus reducing mineral oil tax to zero.  Similarly, the reductions we are providing for this evening to the rate of mineral oil tax on marked gas oil mean that the non-carbon component will also be &euro;0 from 1 May.  This means that the further reductions to mineral oil tax Deputy Doherty is proposing would also involve reducing the carbon component on this fuel.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware that the 2020 programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO2 emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030.  The Government followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in the Finance Act 2020 to provide for a ten-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO2 by 2030.  This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government's climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero no later than 2050.</p> <p> A further component of the Government's carbon tax policy is the hypothecation of revenues raised from these rate increases to fund important just transition measures.  It is important to note that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  We raised &euro;652 million in carbon tax last year.  To seek to reduce that to zero in certain circumstances would undermine this entire proposal.  The Sinn F&eacute;in pre-budget submission for 2022 included the figure of &euro;650 million to be collected in 2022 as part of its submission.  I am therefore interested to hear if the Deputy is now choosing to scrap his own party's pre-budget submission with his move to reduce carbon tax here.  If he proposes to do that, it does mean he is not accepting or standing by his own party's pre-budget submission, which it put to us before the most recent budget.  We cannot have budget submissions that contain elements of collecting carbon tax and then have the same party coming in here proposing to remove carbon taxes as if there were no consequences to that.</p> <p> These measures will help people with the cost of electricity and gas and are one part of the Government's response to the energy crisis.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

It is embarrassing when he goes off script.  Sinn F&eacute;in's pre-budget submission did not include the tax increase the Government plans for Sunday for one third of households right across the State that use home heating oil.  Also, our pre-budget submission did not include the additional taxes on petrol and diesel the Government plans for October, which will push up costs again for motorists.  That is the reality.  That is what the Government plans to do.  That is what these votes are about.  There are options for people in this House to stop speaking out of both sides of their mouths, pretending they are concerned about people out there who are suffering because of the cost-of-living crisis while at the same coming in here and doing further damage to people in my community, two thirds of whom use home heating oil to heat their homes.  The Government's plan is to increase that cost further.  That is the reality and those are the facts.  I invite the Minister of State, if he wishes to dispute that, to say differently.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these financial resolutions.  The resolutions come on foot of measures announced by the Government with respect to rising energy costs on 13 April.  The resolutions, this evening's debate and the votes that will come later concern the rising cost of living and the fall in household incomes that is causing huge anxiety right across this State, in every single community.</p><p>I acknowledge that the illegal war in Ukraine has contributed to the high levels of inflation we are experiencing.  Furthermore, I acknowledge that not every person can be insulated from every price increase.  I and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in are well aware of the realities, but we must also acknowledge that households have been dealing with high inflation as far back as last year and the beginning of this year, before the war in Ukraine.  We must also acknowledge that where the Government can do more to protect workers and families, it has a duty to do so.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent about a comprehensive package of measures that are needed through an emergency budget to support households, to support workers and to support families.  We have been consistent in the measures we have called on the Government to implement.  It should be noted that the Government announced the measures provided for in these resolutions after the Minister for Finance ruled out any further measures until October.  That climbdown is welcome, but what really matters is the measures themselves.</p><p>The fact that the Government has not got to grips with the cost-of-living crisis is a fact.  It has lost control.  Workers and families know it.  They feel it in their pockets and see it in their monthly bills.  The measures provided for in these financial resolutions come with a stated purpose of offsetting carbon tax increases.  It is worth reflecting on how absurd that policy is and just what it means.  We have the highest levels of inflation, the highest price rises, in decades, and instead of introducing measures to respond to inflation and the price rises, what the Government is doing tonight and what it is asking us to vote on is a series of measures that respond to its own tax increases.  You could not get more out of touch than what the Government is talking about tonight.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has a solution that is quite straightforward.  What about this?</p> <p>Instead of offsetting the carbon tax hikes that the Government is planning next week, do not increase carbon tax.  Instead, it should introduce a suite of measures that actually responds to inflation.  That is what families and workers need.  </p> <p> I want to turn my attention to what is absent from these resolutions, to which Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled amendments.  The first financial resolution pertains to VAT as it applies to gas and electricity for domestic use.  This resolution secures a VAT reduction of 4.5% from 13.5% to 9% until the end of October.  While I welcome that some action has been taken, belatedly, on VAT, which will provide relief to households, it would be remiss of me not to remind the Minister of State, Government and this House that Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for the Government to engage with the Commission to secure a VAT reduction in domestic energy bills as far back as November of last year.  That was six months ago.  Those calls were met with derision.  Those calls were met with opposition from the Taoiseach and other members of the Government including the Minister of State who is sitting across the floor here.  Predictably, the Government changed tack and adopted my party's position, but it did so far too slowly.  </p> <p> I was disappointed to learn that the Government only began formal communications with the Commission to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills in March of this year.  That was four months after my party called for action to be taken.  I would note that VAT reductions provided for in this financial resolution do not arise from those engagements that happened in March, but from the changes to the VAT directive right across Europe, which took place in December of last year.  The Minister of State mentioned that in his opening contribution.  It is disappointing and it is unacceptable that in their communications with the Commission, the Government did not seek flexibility for a VAT reduction on home heating oil, at a time when those who use it have seen its cost more than double in the past year.  </p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, would provide for a VAT reduction on home heating oil, pending communication with the Commission, because that is what a real Government does.  A real Government says: &ldquo;Our people are under pressure and we need the Commission to act.&rdquo;  They should go in and negotiate.  They did not even ask for permission.  That is how disgraceful and out of touch this Government is. </p> <p> I would ask the Government to accept this amendment and get to work, resume talks with the Commission and try to secure flexibility with respect to VAT on home heating oil and reduce it accordingly.  Households that are struggling with home heating oil deserve a Government that cares.  Workers and families are under massive financial strain, whether it is the cost of renting, the price of childcare, soaring energy and rising food prices.  For those who, due to lack of public transport initiatives or alternatives, rely on their car to get to work, to visit the family, to pick up their children or to carry out caring duties, transport costs are high.  Petrol prices have gone up 35% in the last year.  Diesel prices have gone up by 46%.</p> <p> While legislation that is currently progressing through the D&aacute;il provides for excise duty reductions on petrol and diesel, there is scope for further reduction under the excise directive.  On reducing the price of petrol by 13 cent per litre and diesel by 9 cent, the Minister of State did not say it could not be done but that it could only be done with the suspension of the diesel rebate scheme, which should happen because hauliers still get the benefit of it plus more.  Others would also benefit from the 9 cent reduction.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to Financial Resolution No. 2 propose exactly that.  They reduce petrol by 13 cent per litre and reduce diesel by 9 cent per litre, which would also be applicable to the hauliers.</p> <p> Again, I ask that the Government accept these amendments to provide modest relief to hard-pressed households at this time.  The single largest increase experienced by households in the past year is home heating oil, which has gone up by 127% in the last 12 months.  That figure is more than double.  In March it cost &euro;1,700 to fill a tank with home heating oil.  Many households right across the State simply cannot afford this.  They have been struggling to deal with it and it is fair to say that is being forgotten by this Government.  More than one third of households across the State use home heating oil as their main heating fuel.  In counties such as Donegal, it is two thirds.  These households received no relief.  There are no VAT reductions.  There are no excise reductions.  Indeed, the only thing Government is giving them is a price rise.</p> <p> There is a deep regional inequality in this regard.  Some 69% of households in Dublin use gas as their main heating source.  Only 4% of households in the Border counties do so.  While 8% of households in Dublin use oil as their main heating source, 66% of households in Border counties do so.  Yet, there is no levy and there is no reduction in tax, VAT or excise on home heating oil.  Indeed, the Government is putting the prices up.  The question has to be asked, what does this Government have against households that are heating their homes with home heating oil?  Many families are facing difficult choices.  These are choices they should never, ever have to make between heating and eating. </p> <p> The Government could reduce and can reduce the cost of home heating oil, effectively from Sunday, by supporting my amendment.  This is the time for the Government to put its money where its mouth is. This is the time to walk the walk.  Government Members should stop telling their constituents they have their interests at heart, when in fact they can actually do something about it, but plan to do the opposite.  Instead, the Government plans to increase the price in May through a further carbon tax increase.</p> <p> Last month, Government Ministers, Deputies, and Senators spread disinformation and misled the D&aacute;il by claiming that there was no excise duty on home heating oil.  That was fake news, and it was spread to distract the public from the Government&rsquo;s inaction.  There is excise duty on home heating oil, and we can reduce it this Sunday, but only if the Government and Deputies in this House support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  If they do not, what will happen?  The price of home heating oil will go up on Sunday.  That is the reality.  It will be a further carbon tax increase.  We have listened to Government Deputies attempt to justify their inaction through various comments made with respect to carbon tax, but Government Deputies and this Minister of State should get real.  </p> <p> In the past number of months, the Government has reduced tax on petrol, diesel, gas and electricity, all processed from fossil fuels.  To criticise Sinn F&eacute;in for calling for a temporary reduction in excise duty is the height of hypocrisy.  The Government claimed that such a reduction would deprive the Government of the money that funds social welfare payments.  It is simply dishonest.  The taxpayer knows that there is no tax in this State that is hypothecated, despite the opening statement of that Minister of State-----</p></speech>

Like Deputy Doherty and his party, the Labour Party and I have been arguing for the application of VAT reductions on energy bills for some time now.  We see this is an opportunity to help to drive down the ever-rising cost of living for hard-pressed families across the country.  This is just one tool or weapon in the armoury of Government to address this unprecedented problem, the extent of which we have not experienced for a long number of years.</p>  <p>  To say that there was a sluggishness about the Government's response and the case made to the European Union on VAT reductions is being diplomatic in the extreme.  It took an extraordinary amount of time for the Government to take the advice of Opposition partners and to take that case to the European Commission to ensure that we could have some kind of relief on VAT.  That is now being applied many months after that initial call was made.  The Minister of State has said clearly that there will be a cost to the Exchequer, in terms of VAT and excise reductions that are being applied, and that will be applied going forward at least for the next few months.  There is no doubt about it though that a much more comprehensive package of targeted measures - and I the term &ldquo;targeted measures&rdquo; deliberately - need to be applied over the next few months and certainly in the context of October&rsquo;s budget, if we are to properly assist and resource the families who are at the sharp end of this ever-escalating cost-of-living crisis.  We know, and this been repeated time and time again in this Chamber, that the experience of the cost of living crisis is not felt equally across this country.  It is predominantly most adversely impacting on those who are on low incomes, on those who are rural dwellers and on those citizens who are older.</p>  <p>  While, of course, we welcome elements of the Government&rsquo;s response to this, it can and should go further.  That is not just a clich&eacute;d response to Government.  In our own cost proposals, we have proposed, for example, additional changes to the fuel allowance system.  Day in and day out - and I know that the Minister of State will be dealing with these cases himself in his own constituency - we are dealing with people who are &euro;5, 10 and &euro;15 outside the fuel allowance threshold.  Many of them are, as Deputy Doherty described, relying on home heating oil to heat their homes.  </p> <p>We would love to be in a position to see the VAT cut that has been proposed by Deputy Doherty applied to home heating oil.  The Minister of State goes into some detail in his script in relation to the restrictions that appear to be applied to this in the context of the European VAT directive, for example, and that is something that we need to consider.  Unfortunately and regrettably, Commissioner Gentiloni has said that he does not envisage any additional relaxation or flexibility being applied to the VAT directive and other relevant European Union directives over the next period to better insulate households against the ever-rising cost of living.  That is a serious own goal from the Commissioner and the European Commission more generally.  We do not know where this is going to land.  We do not know how protracted the conflict in Ukraine is going to be.  We cannot forecast the future, even with the best will in the world.  Experts have applied their considerable brains to this matter but we cannot anticipate where this is going to land.  The European Commission must be open to change and the Government must be open to making the case at the EU for further concessions, if they can be described thus, to help to insulate the less well off against the impact of this crisis.</p> <p> The European Commission might not be entertaining or envisaging additional relaxation of directives and so on but this Government has to make the case for same.  It is also obliged, as the Government in this sovereign State, to do everything it can and use every weapon in its armoury to insulate as best it can those who are feeling the worst impacts of this phenomenon that we are experiencing at the moment.  Much more can be done through the social welfare and taxation systems, but especially through the social welfare system and the Government's own pay policy.</p></speech>

The Minister justified that move but has now recognised that farmers and farm contractors in Ireland would rightly refuse to accept such a pittance.  While there has been some movement with regard to agri-diesel tonight, it is simply not enough.</p><p>I urge Government members to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motions in the House tonight to reduce the cost of home heating oil rather than increasing it on 1 May, as is currently planned, and to give those hard-pressed workers who have no option but to drive to work a bit of support by reducing the cost of diesel and petrol.  </p><p>Today I was tweeted by one of the many Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael backbenchers who have been running around their constituencies pretending that they were aghast at the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan's proposal to ban the sale of turf.  They have managed to find a way to refuse to support Sinn F&eacute;in's motion tonight.  Deputy Cowen told me that carbon tax revenue delivers &euro;160 million in just transition funds to Offaly and the midlands, &euro;300 million per annum for retrofitting and &euro;120 million per annum for agri-environmental schemes.  Of course, he does not say that the &euro;120 million for agri-environmental schemes represents a reduction because of the terrible budget that his Government negotiated<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the funding that is available.  What sort of a threat is it to the people of Laois-Offaly, or anywhere else in rural Ireland, to say that if they do not stomach an increase next week in the price of the only source of heating they have, the Government will deny them retrofitting and agri-environmental schemes and just transition funds?  Under this Government, Exchequer funding across all areas has increased by over &euro;6 billion in comparison to what was estimated at the time of the budget.  In that context, the Government cannot tell me that hard-pressed workers and families of this State have to endure an additional cost in home heating oil next week or that they cannot be given a break on expenses incurred in travelling to work.  This is absolutely a facade put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies in order to justify their disgraceful position of coming in here tonight and voting against a motion that would give their constituents the break they are asking for, ensure the suspension of the flawed proposal in respect of the carbon tax increase, temporarily remove excise on home heating oil and scrap, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan's ill-thought-out, ill-conceived and frankly unworkable proposition on turf.  </p></speech>

Given the struggles that so many families are encountering at the moment in relation to energy prices, one has to ask why the Government cannot go any further.  Over the last few months the Government has been saying consistently that it could do nothing about VAT but then there was something it could do.  We must ask whether it is possible for the Government to go any further than it is going currently.  If not, what is the Government doing about that at European level?  What case is being made by the Government?  Who is actually leading on that?  It seems that an opting out approach has been taken by the Government.  We were hearing for many weeks from the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and others that their hands were tied and there was nothing they could do but that turned out not to be the case at all.</p>  <p>  There is something shocking, if not immoral, about the fact that the Government has been profiteering from the soaring energy prices.  The more prices went up, the more the Government took in through VAT but that should not have been tolerated.  At the very minimum, it should have reinvested the additional receipts from VAT into direct supports for families but it chose not to do that.  I accept that circumstances in recent weeks and months have been beyond the control of the Government in terms of the impact on energy prices of what is happening in Ukraine.  However, by the middle of last year the trend was quite clear in relation to energy prices, the kind of pressure they were putting on people and the fact that they were the main driver in the overall increase in the cost of living.  The Government had opportunities in the budget in to take measures to alleviate that pressure on low-income families but it chose not to do that.  The Government was advised by the ESRI and the Central Bank that in the very difficult circumstances which the country is going through at the moment, any expenditure or investment should be targeted but the Government chose not to target the bulk of the funding that it made available.  The electricity subsidy illustrates the Government's scatter-gun approach, with &euro;200 or more going to lots of people who did not need it and who did not even notice that additional money going into their bank accounts.  The Government missed an opportunity to do something of consequence for those people that were hardest hit and the same can be said for a number of other measures taken in the budget, including the &euro;5 increase in social welfare payments.  People in receipt of social welfare needed a minimum of &euro;10 just to stand still, not to mind what has been happening since then.  On the fuel allowance, nothing was done in the budget or since then to assist low-income working families, those in receipt of the working family payment.  The Government could have easily targeted money in that direction.  It could have been done very simply.  It was not complex at all and could have been done urgently and been targeted at those families most in need.  </p>  <p>  The situation in relation to the high cost of living and particularly energy costs has highlighted a particular structural problem in the Irish economy.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>This is the problem of low incomes, whether people are on welfare or working on low pay.  This has been exposed very starkly as a result of the events in recent months.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to do something to address this problem where it is most acutely felt among families on low incomes but he has chosen not to do so and to take a typical Fine Gael approach of spreading it all very thinly.  It is a missed opportunity.  It is regrettable that these measures on VAT are happening at this point.  It is far too little too late.  The Government could have acted sooner.  Unfortunately, many thousands of families are taking the brunt of it now.  They are suffering very deeply as a result of this inaction.</p></speech>

Then we discovered it could do so, as we had said.  Europe was happy to move heaven and earth in some respects in response to the war in Ukraine but not in other respects, particularly in respect of trying to protect working people from the economic and financial impacts of the war in Ukraine.  By the way, as a little aside, not only did the EU state it would give a little bit of flexibility but not much with a small VAT reduction, which the Minister of State had said we could not get, but it does not want to give any further flexibility.  Even for the people of Ukraine it does not want to lessen the economic impact for them.  We tabled a question asking whether the Government would consider unilateral cancellation of Ukrainian debt.  We got an answer from the Minister that we could not possibly do this because it would impact on the international financial system.  This is how much we care about the Ukrainians faced with war.  We cannot cancel their debt.  We cannot protect ordinary people here against the impact of this inflationary spiral.</p>  <p>  Of course the war in Ukraine is having some impact on this.  It would be foolish to suggest otherwise.  This is not the primary reason for the inflationary spiral and the cost-of-living increases we are seeing.  The main reason is a thing called profiteering.  Now we can add to this war profiteering.  There was profiteering going on before the Ukrainian crisis and now we have war profiteering going on by the energy companies, including oil and gas companies, that have seen their profits go through the roof.  This is the elephant in the room.  The Government is profiteering through VAT.  It is being very slightly reduced but it is not really a full give-back of the huge VAT bonanza the Government has enjoyed as a result of rising energy prices.  There is a small reduction in the level of profiteering by the Government via VAT but it will not touch the profits of the energy companies, which have gone through the roof.  This is the elephant in the room.</p>  <p>  There should be a windfall tax on the super profits being enjoyed by these companies as a result of the inflation crisis affecting so many and which is literally killing people.  Let us be straight about this.  We had more than 2,000 winter excess deaths.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul states that last year 42% of those with illness and disability reduced their heating and electricity use because of the inflationary spiral.  This stuff kills the vulnerable unless we do something serious about it.  This is not going anywhere near enough to compensate for the increase of at least &euro;700 or &euro;800 in energy prices alone as well as all of the other costs of living that are rising.  The inflation rate is now running at 6.7% and is possibly set to go higher.  It means an average worker has lost more than &euro;2,000 as a result of the inflationary crisis.  This is what is happening to people.  The Government's measures are not going anywhere near it because it does not want to control the profiteering or impose windfall taxes on energy companies.  It does not want to control rents that are spiralling through the roof yet again this month, leading directly to people being driven into homelessness.  It does not want to touch the profits of people making money from the inflationary spiral.</p>  <p>  Let us also remind ourselves about the deregulation and privatisation of the energy market and the decision to take the ESB out of a not-for-profit basis.  I was reading the commentary at the time in 2011 when the ESB was starting to engage in price competition.  The prediction was that it would be a win-win situation for suppliers and consumers and that it should drive down prices.  That did not happen, did it?  The exact opposite happened.  We had some of the lowest energy prices in Europe prior to deregulation and privatisation; we now have some of the highest.  That is profiteering.</p> <p>It is in the Government's control to act but it is not willing to do anything about it.  We could control or tax those windfall profits.</p></speech>

At the same time, backbenchers who cannot stand the heat are leaking reports of conversations in order to cover themselves locally.  As with everything else, this Government has been reactive rather than proactive.  We have the highest rate of inflation in years but the Government's answer has been to increase tax.</p>  <p>  The first attempt at a solution was to reduce the VAT rate to 9%.  We asked for this last year and the Government criticised us for it before changing its mind.  The Government is firefighting instead of implementing a just transition.  We asked the Government to cut the duty on fuel and the Government also changed its mind in that respect.  We asked for a reduction in duty or excise on home heating oil but we are waiting for the Government's reaction.  Not only is this Government out of touch, it is more interested in criticising the Opposition than operating a just transition.</p>  <p>  Others have been calling for a commitment on a permanent basis to the large-scale commercial sale of turf when they know it is not an idea grounded in reality.  People need to get real.  Many people rely on turf in my constituency and it has not been subject to price hikes.  Many who rely on this fuel are those who struggle most with the cost of living crisis and they will need to choose between freezing or going hungry, driving to college or eating.  These are areas with no public transport.</p>  <p>  Government policy for years has been to inflict extra costs on workers and families, including bin charges and property taxes.  It has sought to outsource services and reduce public services at the same time.  We have seen reports that a large corporation in Limerick is allowed to burn tyres as a fuel yet nothing is being done to move costs to those who can afford it.  That company is burning tyres but small households will not be able to burn turf.  How is that fair?  We need a just transition and this is not it.</p>  <p>  There is a better way, especially through retrofitting and ensuring policy is informed by an understanding of energy poverty.  Grants must be directed towards retrofitting and away from processes that enable the rich to buy electric cars.  The neoliberal approach must be rejected and Government Deputies must reflect on shifting the burden to those most able to pay.</p></speech>

One in five children in this country suffer from asthma and one in 14 adults in the country suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Before Covid-19, COPD was responsible for 10% of all hospital admissions.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has handled this matter terribly but peat has been in the cross hairs in the air quality debate for more than five years, and nobody should be surprised by that.  The current Taoiseach, when on the Opposition benches, called for action in the area.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the practice of burning turf is dying a natural death and the current approach will only lead to a reversal of its natural rate of decline.  If we are serious about taking turf out of the system, we must fast-track the retrofitting of homes.  That was started back in 2018 and then the brakes were put on; it will only recommence in earnest next year or five years after the retrofitting of those houses commenced.  That is where the Government focus and priority should be if it wants to deal with air quality issues in provincial towns and rural areas.</p>  <p>  I will focus on the question of carbon taxes.  These are supposed to be an environmentally focused tax to drive behavioural change in the use of fossil fuels.  In such circumstances, the most effective tax is the one bringing in little revenue because it is doing what it should, which is to drive behavioural change.  The focus of an environmentally focused tax should never be on revenue but rather on motivating that behavioural change.  The current carbon tax model is flawed in this regard because, I am sad to say, the goal is to bring in more revenue rather than trying to drive behavioural change.  Instead, the focus is on replacing existing spending lines across government.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about moving away from our dependence on fossil fuels, we need a model of carbon tax that is fluid.  Last month there were media reports that the Government was looking at introducing a swing mechanism on fossil fuel taxes to address oil price volatility.  It now seems, however, that the Government has shelved that proposal and nobody is prepared to explain why it has been taken off the table.  The reality is we need a taxation model that takes into consideration the ever-changing cost of a barrel of oil.  Carbon taxes should vary with the cost of a barrel of oil because even if carbon taxes increase significantly but the price of oil collapses, the type of step change we require will not be realised.</p>  <p>  For example, over a decade ago it was believed the carbon taxes that were then introduced would drive the type of change needed to decarbonise our economies.  That was based on a projected increase in the price of a barrel of oil before shale fracking technology and other factors distorted the market.  The price of Brent crude oil went from $114 per barrel in June 2014 to just $20 per barrel in January 2016, which undermined that entire policy tool.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, when the price of a barrel of oil increases sharply, there is a direct impact on the cost of living for families, as well as having a devastating impact on a small, open economy like ours.  We are seeing that impact today because Ireland is more exposed than most EU countries to oil price volatility.</p>  <p>  I have raised this specific matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on numerous occasions.  His response on the introduction of a more flexible approach to carbon taxes was that the model would undermine the revenue generated from carbon taxes, and the revenue is used to fund the type of retrofitting proposals I have already mentioned.  The reality is that families now have to decide whether to put food on the table or buy fuel to heat their homes because of this approach to Government taxation, which is about taxing the vulnerable and poor to pay for the retrofitting of homes across this country.  The solution is to ring-fence the additional unplanned VAT revenue generated from the inflated fuel prices to replace the lost revenue from carbon tax income.  It would ensure people would not have to pay excessive carbon taxes when the price of fossil fuels increases.  At the same time it would secure revenue to carry out the retrofitting of homes.</p>  <p>  This would be a similar approach to what happens with the public service obligation, PSO, in the electricity generation sector, which moves up and down and varies with the price of electricity on an annual basis.  The only difficulty is the Government is introducing a three-card trick with the PSO.  It announced with great fanfare that the PSO would be reduced to zero from October but it failed to say that people are now paying a PSO levy that is no longer required but must wait until next October to get the money back.  The PSO should be stopped today.</p></speech>

We have asked for it day after day here.  What the Government is offering this evening is very minimal.  The Government is saying that this is what is being provided and that it had to get permission from Europe to be allowed to reduce the VAT rate.  In all my time, I never heard that we had to ask Europe to increase it in the first place.  That is a fact.  I know I am right.  I never heard that the Government had to get permission to increase it in the first place.  Reducing VAT on gas and electricity to 13.5% and 9% only is of no use to the people who are on the road with four wheels under them, whatever type of vehicle it is.  That is not enough.  These people are hard-pressed and their backs are to the wall.  What is being offered is very minimal and it is not enough.  The carbon tax on a 900 litre fill of home heating oil is &euro;106.07.  That is massive.  As I said earlier today, people are under savage pressure, especially those who are working and who on their own.  Farmers are hard-pressed with the savage cost of fuel.  The Government is hurting people very badly.  People in Kerry, the county that I am proud to represent, are being hit by the suggestion that they cannot buy turf.  Is it because there is no VAT in turf?  What set did the Government against turf all of a sudden?  There is so much else to be sorted out in the world.  We see what is happening in other countries.  We are all under the one sky.  Look at what they are doing in America.  Look at the size of the vehicles that they are driving.  Russia and China are using coal-burning power stations to generate electricity.  The Government trying to stop poor people who have traditionally cut and sold turf to their neighbours.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications said that grannies would not be criminalised.  God almighty, these people are the people who brought our country to where it is today.  They worked flat on their backs when there was nothing at all in this country.  They cut the turf and kept themselves warm.  It is absolutely ridiculous to think that at the end of their days, some Minister in power would try to stop them from buying a few bags of turf, a rail of turf or a butt of turf, as it was known.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  Our family unit would have disintegrated back in the early 1930s and 1940s if it was not for turf.  All my grandmother, grandfather and father had was four cows.  They sold a few rails of turf and a bank of turf.  The purchaser cut it and saved it themselves.  That is how they, and many people like them, survived.  The Government has crossed the line with the measure and has hurt many people in rural Ireland.  It was the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications who suggested it.  He is part of the Government and he has to be controlled.  The Government has lost a lot of ground with what he has said and done in the past few weeks.  I am sorry that the people of rural Kerry have been hurt.  They are angered, mad, sad and sore at what has gone on in the past number of weeks.  The Minister had free rein out in the open when he was on holiday.  He is nearly more dangerous when is on holiday than when he is here, because we can curtail him some bit.  The Government crossed the line in allowing the Minister to do what he did and say what he said.</p></speech>

As the Association of Farm &amp;amp; Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI, has highlighted, we must ensure that enough green diesel is ring-fenced for the contractors, especially with silage season coming up.  There is a concern about basically getting in crops or getting enough fodder for the winter.  Even if it is through reserves, we must ensure that if things start getting tight, there is enough green diesel around to be able to look after contractors.  You reap what you harvest.  We need to have enough stuff there to get in fodder for cattle and all the different animals on farms for the winter.</p>  <p>  On home heating oil, it is regrettable that nothing is being done for householders.  I know that we made decisions on some bits of it, but I think a few of us have touched on the fact it is a sad day when we have to go over to these so-called masters in Europe to get permission.  I do not bow to them.  I do not know why we have to go over to ask if we can do this, that or the other, or we may be at risk of going into a higher rate.  It is a damnable situation.  Either we have our sovereignty as a country or we do not.  The Minister should realise that the price hikes for the people who can get gas, whether it is in Dublin or in other parts of the country, and those using home heating oil, have been colossal.  We must ensure that the vulnerable are looked after.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the carbon tax, it is the most vulnerable and those on the lowest incomes that use a lot of solid fuels.  As was touched on earlier, currently approximately 50% of our stock is social housing.  The Government plans to do 30% of the retrofitting of all housing by 2030, which is welcome.  There is nobody against that.  However, there is huge anger out there about what the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has said over the last two weeks.  What we must remember is that many of these people have a range.  Many of them are elderly.  They may have a back boiler that basically heats their house.  They are hearing all of this stuff that is going on at the moment.  Some of them are in fair sized towns.  What is the choice for them?  There is a carbon tax and a rise in the cost of nearly everything for them.  If they have a car, there is a carbon tax on the diesel or the petrol that they buy.  If they have home heating oil, there is a carbon tax on that.  I know it has to be done because the lights have to be kept on, but at the same time, the State will throw 7,000 tonnes of coal a day into the likes of Moneypoint and will not pay carbon tax.  People can zoom off on holiday.  I believe that 750 flights come into Dublin Airport a day, and not one bit of carbon tax is paid on aviation fuel.  That really smacks people in the face.  They believe that they are the pawns that are being used in all of this.</p>  <p>  On the turf issue, there are people in rural areas - and in the constituencies of both the Minister and the Minister of State in towns in counties Laois and Cork - who will buy a couple of trailer loads of turf.</p> <p>On the other hand, and this is the reality, many of these people are on, say, &euro;13,000 a year with the pension and they get the fuel allowance with that.  What they buy is maybe ten or 15 bags of turf to keep them going.  I will tell the Minister why they buy it.  Kerosene was 43 cent in March 2020 and it is &euro;1.30 today, and gas has also gone up.  The reason they buy it is because it is a cheaper fuel that they can afford.  The Minister does not have to be a mathematician.  I hear all of these statistics coming out from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications suggesting that they see a bit of an upsurge.  No wonder they do.  There is a war on, first of all, and the price has trebled.  People did not get three times the pension so, obviously, they have to use their money as they have it.</p> <p> We need to be very careful where we are going on this.  I have seen a bog battle before in 2010 but I have never seen such anger in communities as what is there at the moment.  It is not the Green Party of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, because it is not thought much of in rural Ireland; it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that are going to be the big losers if this fellow is let run the way he is going.  The Minister has to be hauled back.  Common sense has to come into it.  We are all into making sure that no wet timber is sold.  I backed that last year in order to get the moisture right in timber at under 25%.  We do it a simple way.  There is a lot of talk about kiln drying.  If it is seated in a kiln for seven, eight or nine months, it is sound, it is 100%, and the moisture is down.  To take the example of the peat briquette, I cannot for the life of me understand why if I have a peat briquette in one hand and a sod of turf in the other, they are telling me that I can burn that one in the fire but not the other one.</p> <p> I had it tested last week by a mechanical engineer.  The turf that was cut last May, when they checked it out, was at 18%.   No one in their right mind would burn wet timber or wet turf.  Park the environment, the first thing they would do is burst the flue liner in their house.  It is not a thing anyone would set out to do.  There was a problem with wet timber where people were cutting it, splitting it and going off with it, and it was bad timber at that, such as spruce and the like.  I fully believe in the regulation of that.  We can do the same in this regard.  We can make sure that quality product in big urban areas is sold but we do not have to say to somebody that we are banning it.  That idea of banning for sale or distribution needs to come out of all of this.  There must be common sense.  People will work with the Minister but he cannot come out and make a big, bold statement and then go off hiding.</p></speech>

I want to summarise and conclude in respect of the two motions before the House, one of which deals with VAT and the other with excise duties.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the first financial resolution is to reduce VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9%.  This is possible because, as a result of the revised EU VAT directive, gas and electricity are now classified at reduced rates, in other words, they are no longer subject to the standard rate.  This means the Government has the flexibility to reduce both of these services to the lowest reduced rate in Ireland, which is 9%.  Other fuels, including kerosene, still fall under the standard VAT rate at EU level and, in an Irish context, this means the 23% rate.  However, because such fuels were subject to a 13.5% rate at the time the VAT directive was put in place, Ireland was allowed to maintain this lower level under section 118 of that directive.  This is known as a parked rate.  Under EU law, the lowest this can be reduced to is 12%.</p>  <p>  If the Government were to reduce kerosene to 12%, the saving would be very small for a person buying 1,000 l of oil but there would be a considerable additional cost to the Exchequer.  That is because we would also have to reduce all other areas currently subject to the 13.5% rate to this level as we are only allowed to have two reduced VAT rates under EU law.  The 13.5% currently applies to about 25% of all economic activity and as well as fuel use for heat and lighting, it also includes construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  It would cost in the region of &euro;216 million between now and the end of October, approximately a six-month period.  It is not being proposed but this is the most that could be done in regard to VAT on kerosene and that is the outer limit if it is all done and the 12% rate applied.  In summary, the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to reduce kerosene to 9% would be contrary to EU law and is likely to lead to an infringement.  Even if the EU were to facilitate such a proposal, which is highly unlikely, a difficulty with that would be that once normality was restored, we would be required to revert to the standard rate of 23%, that is, we would lose our right to use the parked rate of 13.5% and this would have long-term cost implications for customers and the people of Ireland, even after the current energy crisis was over.</p>  <p>  I want to refer briefly to excise duties.  Last month, the Government brought forward a financial resolution to the D&aacute;il providing for excise duty decreases on mineral oil tax with effect from 10 March.  This provided for a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction for auto diesel, with a 2 cent reduction for the excise on marked gas oil known as green diesel.  These measures were VAT-inclusive and were set to last until 31 August 2022.  The estimated cost of this is &euro;320 million.  The purpose of this financial resolution is to extend the excise duty decreases until 11 October 2022, which is budget day.</p>  <p>  The financial resolution also provides for a further reduction in the excise rate on marked gas oil, which amounts to a VAT-inclusive reduction of 3 cent, effective from 1 May to 11 October.  This excise reduction extension and the further reduction in the rate applied to marked gas oil will have a cost estimated at approximately &euro;97 million, made up of &euro;80 million for the extension which I mentioned and &euro;17 million for the change in the marked gas oil.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty put forward four amendments in respect of these resolutions which I dealt with extensively during my earlier contribution.</p></speech>
