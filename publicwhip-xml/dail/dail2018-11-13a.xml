    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="02:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300003#A00200"><p>I have raised on a number of occasions in the House the value and importance of the hospice movement and the enormous public support it enjoys from many volunteers and the public generally who fund and contribute to hospices.  In particular, I refer to Marymount in Cork, Blanchardstown, Raheny, Galway Hospice and the mid-west hospice in Milford, Co. Limerick.  They are continually being disadvantaged by Government policy and left in unsustainable positions in terms of funding, recruitment and retention.  The recent Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, agreement worsens their position and creates an unsustainable funding pathway for them to retain and recruit staff because essentially it breaks the historic link these hospices had with their HSE employees and confirms a two-tier workforce in perpetuity.  The agreement covers only those who worked in the hospices at the time the FEMPI legislation was introduced.  New people coming in are not covered.  There is no retrospection.</p>  <p>  The entire approach of Government for the past year and a half has been as mean-spirited as one can get towards these hospices.  It is a slap in the face to the thousands of volunteers who support them and to the public who fundraise for them.  It flies in the face of the national palliative care strategy, which the Government announced with fanfare last year.  It is also contrary to the policies of Sl&aacute;intecare, which recommends full integration of palliative care with acute hospital care within the health service.  Hospices are an essential part of our health service; they are not an ancillary service.  The Government's approach to pay policy has been to continue to treat them as an ancillary service.  They provide community care, home care packages and vital interventions at critical parts of a person's journey with cancer or other serious illnesses.  Their model is the one we should aspire to for other areas of care within our health services.  They are enormously important in alleviating pressures on acute services.</p><p>I met with representatives of Marymount Hospice yesterday.  It costs approximately &euro;20 million to run it on current funding, some &euro;3 million of which is raised by the citizens of Cork and the surrounding region.  The same can be said of Milford, Galway, Blanchardstown and Raheny, yet they are treated in a discriminatory manner by the Government, which must stop.  In Marymount's case, as the people to whom I spoke made clear, they had to fund the pay restoration under the national agreement, which cost &euro;277,000 in 2017, &euro;562,000 to date this year and is expected to cost &euro;798,000 for the full year.  They told me they cannot afford to deliver the current quantum of services.  Decisions are under consideration and review about cuts to services.  They had to cancel community visits to people and they are considering closing specialist palliative care beds in the hospice, which could happen as early as next January.  </p> <p> Is it not time to treat these hospices as essential parts of our health service, as other hospitals and health institutions are, and transition them to section 38 agencies in order that they can enjoy the same payscales as everybody else within the HSE?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="02:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300004#B00200"><p>I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised the importance and value of our hospices and the hospice movement on many occasions.  He often mentions Marymount, which he knows well, and St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown and Raheny, which I know well as a constituency Deputy.  We have seen enormous improvements in recent years in end-of-life care and palliative care, ensuring more people die in a hospice or at home than in a hospital.  This means that, in general, people who are in their final few days or weeks can pass away with dignity and comfort, managed in a pain-free environment, in a way that is much more difficult to do in a busy hospital.  Those improvements will continue and new hospitals are being provided in Wicklow and Castlebar, for example.  There are also plans to develop palliative care in Drogheda and Waterford as well as the midlands, should we be able to come to an agreement among the different counties on an appropriate site.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare proposes that palliative care become universal, but it does not specifically propose that it be taken into the public sector as a section 38 agency.  Rather, it proposes that it be universal.  When I asked the Sl&aacute;intecare team what that means, it said that it should be provided in all parts of the country because it is not now, or at least not to the extent that it is in other parts.  There has been much Government support for hospices in recent years, such as for St. Francis Hospice, to which the Deputy referred, where the land by the Government through my predecessor, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, while the equipment and staffing were provided by this Government when we came to office.  </p>  <p>  The agreement to which the Deputy refers was brokered at the WRC.  It acknowledges there is a difference between section 39 and section 38 bodies, as he will understand.  The difference is that section 39 bodies are typically charities, private institutions and, in some cases, companies.  They are not part of the public service and they are not owned by the public.  The land and the buildings are not owned by the public, and nor are the pension liabilities or the debts.  If some bodies want to move their classification from section 39 to section 38, we can consider and talk about that, but there will also be consequences to that, namely, relating to ownership, legacy pension liabilities, legacy debts, control, membership of boards and so on.  These matters would have to be resolved.  If some section 39 bodies are willing to give up some or all of their independence and transfer their lands and ownerships in return for becoming part of the public service, that is the type of thing we could discuss.  The board of each individual section 39 body, however, would have to decide for itself that it wants to go down that road and it would have to be negotiated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="02:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300004#B00300"><p>Words come cheap from Government.  During the budget talks, the Taoiseach set his face against any consideration of bringing those agencies under section 38.  He said it was not even being considered.  He can make all the announcements he likes, such as the palliative care strategy or Sl&aacute;intecare, but they mean nothing in the real world.  When one comes face to face with the financial controllers of these institutions, who are trying their best and have been moderate in their response, it is clear that the Taoiseach does not value them.</p><p>He says he does.  I get no pleasure in saying this but he does not value them, because if he did, he would not treat them as he does.  He mentioned Wicklow.  That will come in under Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross.  That means that it will be fully HSE aligned.  The remaining hospices I mentioned will be further discriminated against.  There will be a HSE hospice network while those in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Blanchardstown  will be continually disadvantaged by the Government.  The WRC agreement is a cover operation.  The unions look after their members, which is their job.  The Government gets to frustrate the whole thing for a year and a half and the Taoiseach can stand here and say that the Government has an agreement.  In reality, behind the scenes, this puts an unsustainable strain on the hospices I mentioned.  It is time for the nice words to end.  People are no longer interested in the announcements that generate photo opportunities or the nice words that placate them in their daily duties.</p></speech>

It illustrated again in some detail the horrific treatment of Maurice McCabe for daring to speak out about Garda malpractice in the Cavan Monaghan division.  We are agreed that Maurice is a good and honourable man of incredible strength.  He, his wife, Lorraine, and their family deserve not only our support and solidarity but also our gratitude.  For daring to speak out and for putting his head above the parapet, Maurice was smeared and bullied by fellow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He was the subject of the most despicable type of character assassination imaginable.  That is a fact.  The Charleton tribunal found that Maurice was "repulsively denigrated" for being nothing more than a good citizen and police officer.  The tribunal also established that the then Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, undertook a most disgraceful attack on Maurice, aided and abetted by his press officer, Dave Taylor.</p>  <p>  Against that backdrop, Maurice McCabe is justifiably pursuing legal action against the State and Maurice Callinan.  However, it has emerged in recent days that the State will pay Mr. Callinan's legal fees, using taxpayer's money, which is outrageous.  Martin Callinan is a man who went around telling people falsely and without foundation that Maurice McCabe was a child sex abuser who should not be trusted.</p><p>At the weekend the Taoiseach stated: "As a former State employee who is being sued in the course of his work it is norm for the State to offer representation...".  However, I put it to the Taoiseach that this is not a normal case.  Mr. Callinan has, of course, every right to defend himself in court but in this case, which is being taken by the person he repulsively denigrated, he should not get one red cent of State money.  Setting out to destroy Maurice McCabe was his doing and he should face the consequences of his actions.  The reputation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as we all know, was deeply damaged by this episode.  For the State to now come to Mr. Callinan's aid by way of providing for his legal fees is simply not acceptable.</p> <p> The decision taken by the acting Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, to recommend, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, that a defence be funded by the State was a decision taken before the tribunal had concluded and before it had found so heavily against Martin Callinan.</p> <p> The State has already failed Maurice McCabe on numerous occasions and now it looks set to support the individual who went to extraordinary lengths to destroy his character.  I want the Taoiseach to state categorically here this afternoon that this will not be the case.  I want him to ensure that Mr. Callinan funds his own legal defence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="02:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300006#D00200"><p>First, once again, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Maurice McCabe, the enormous service he has done to this country and his honesty and decency.  As I said in the past, I believe he is and was a distinguished member of the Garda and a good example of the kind of person we want to have in our police force.</p>  <p>  When it comes to what we do next, I believe the most important thing is that we do right by Maurice McCabe and his wife, Lorraine, even if that is coming rather late in the day.  Some people will have seen the programme on RTE television last night and for many people who have not met Maurice McCabe and do not know him this may have been the first time they had a chance to hear his voice and understand what he, his wife and family went through for nearly a decade merely for telling the truth and merely for having the courage to expose and stand up to wrongdoing and malfeasance in the organisation, for which he worked, and how he was treated not just in some cases by senior people in the Garda but also by his peers.  It is really sad to see that in our public service, when somebody in a public service position points out what is wrong and their own peers, instead of supporting them, turn on them.  That was really sad to see.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that this is not a normal case.  It is not.  The decision to offer State representation to the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, was made in July.  That was prior to the report of the disclosures tribunal and was done in accordance with section 48 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  We now have a tribunal of inquiry established by this House and that tribunal of inquiry has made findings.  That allows us to review the position, and the position is being reviewed at the moment.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that the fact the State is offering and providing legal representation to the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, does not mean the State will pay for the defence or even necessarily that there will be a defence.  I would like to see this case settled, and I hope it can be settled to the satisfaction of Maurice and Lorraine McCabe sooner rather than later.  I have also asked the Attorney General to advise the Government and to give us legal advice on whether we would be in a position to pursue both the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and also Mr. Taylor for a contribution to any damages that may be paid.  The Deputy will also be aware that it is open to Mr. Justice Charleton, as head of the tribunal, to pursue a similar process in respect of tribunal costs should he feel those witnesses, or any witnesses, did not fully co-operate with the tribunal.</p></speech>

I very much hope we can get clarity and finality on these matters.</p><p>We are agreed that this is not a normal case.  In fact, it is exceptional.  We are agreed that Charleton found against Martin Callinan and that the tribunal's report has been accepted by the State.  We are also agreed that it would be a contradiction in terms unthinkable for the State, on Mr. Callinan&rsquo;s behalf, to enter any form of defence.  That simply would not make any sense at all.</p> <p> The Taoiseach said this matter is being reviewed, which I welcome.  When will we have the outcome of that review?  When will we know for certain that not a red cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be used to defend Mr. Callinan?  If this case is settled - I agree with the Taoiseach that it ought to be and speedily - will Mr. Callinan and others be pursued for costs?</p></speech>

I would like to be able to answer it as soon as possible.  I do not want to have the Government take action without knowing what we can do legally.  We do not want to find ourselves costing the taxpayer even more money by making a decision that might appear to be the right one but without having done the correct analysis first.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality met Sergeant McCabe and his wife to apologise in person on behalf of the State for the manner in which he was treated.  The new Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, has done the same.</p>  <p>  In accordance with section 48 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Minister, on the recommendation of the then Garda Commissioner, approved to grant State representation to Mr. Callinan for the purpose of that case.  That was done in July before the tribunal reported.  He, along with all other parties in that action, is currently represented by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  It is important to say on the record of the D&aacute;il that State representation does not constitute an undertaking or a grant of indemnity.  That has never been granted.  Nor does the granting of representation imply that the case is going to be defended.  It just means that the party is legally represented.</p></speech>

That means women are working for more than a month free of charge compared to men annually.  One of the great benefits of joining the European Union was a requirement of equal pay for equal work, as well as the abolition of the naked bias, such as the law which required women to leave the public service on marriage.  We brought in equal pay legislation in 1974 - a long time ago - but we still await pay parity.  In the past, this was explained by differences in qualifications between men and women.  Today, however, significantly more young women than men have third-level qualifications.  Previously, we might have explained that the pay gap happened because many women stopped working while their children were in school.  This is no longer the case for a great number of families.</p>  <p>  There is a gender difference in the professions taken up by men and women which, in turn, might explain some of the differences in pay.  There is a question, however, about whether we value women&rsquo;s work as much as we do that of men.  There is a real question as to whether men and women are being paid equally for the same work.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party has progressed legislation through all Stages in the Seanad for the mandatory reporting by larger companies of the levels of pay by gender.  The Government has promised its own legislation in this area but it has not been delivered.  We are happy to work with the Government through all D&aacute;il Stages to ensure this legislation can be swiftly enacted into law.  We know mandatory reporting has worked in other countries and we believe it will work here.  In some cases, companies may not even be aware of the extent of the wage differences in their own workforce.  Ignorance is no excuse, however.  The legislation which the Labour Party has put forward would remove that excuse.</p><p>Does the Government agree that a 14% gender pay gap is both unacceptable and unsustainable?  Will it undertake to support the Labour Party's legislation, which has already been passed by the Seanad, and help it through the D&aacute;il as the swiftest mechanism to address this important issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="02:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300008#F00200"><p>The Government accepts that the gender pay gap of 14% is unacceptable, unfair and a hallmark of gender inequality in our society.  The Deputy will also be aware that such pay gaps are not unique to Ireland and exist across the developed world, including, even, very progressive Nordic countries which have larger gender pay gaps than Ireland.  However, that does not make it in any way acceptable.  Equal pay for equal work was introduced in 1974 as a consequence of European law and it has made a real difference.  More than 30 years later, however, we continue to have a gender pay gap for multiple reasons.  One reason is that more women work on a part-time basis than men, which is often because women are still expected to bear the greater burden of caring in society, including caring for children and older people, and are likely to work part-time as a result.  That is not something that is simple to change.  It can be changed, however, by providing more subsidised childcare, as we are doing, and by providing paternity benefit to men so that more men take up caring roles.  That is one of the things that has to change.</p>  <p>  Another issue is, of course, gender bias in promotions.  I attended the National Gallery yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, for the launch of the actions we are taking in the higher education sector.  This is just one example.  While approximately 50% of the lecturers in our universities and institutes of technology are female, it is only 25% when one gets up to the professor level.  It is evident that we need to put accelerators in place so that more women are promoted and in that way help to close the gender pay gap.  The Deputy will be aware of the decisions we made in that regard yesterday.  They are very progressive, albeit controversial in parts.  On 26 June last, we approved the general scheme of the gender pay gap information Bill.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality will carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme on 21 November.  That is in only eight days' time.  I appeal to all parties in the House to get that scrutiny done quickly and before the end of the year so that we can proceed to legislate.</p></speech>

We have a vehicle in the Bill passed by the Seanad.  We can pass it here readily.  The notion that we will start a new Bill with pre-legislative scrutiny in a couple of weeks' time with no prospect of enactment in the current calendar year makes a nonsense of new politics.  If the Government is serious about addressing the issue, it will surely not matter whether the Bill comes from the Labour Party or is drafted by Government.  There was no fundamental issue with the legislation as it passed through the Seanad and, in fact, a promise to support it was made.  Why will the Taoiseach not simply address this issue if he agrees that it is one of critical importance and that gender-biased pay is unacceptable?  Let us start the process by shining a light on companies' pay bills and determine how exactly they fare in gender-focused pay terms.  I ask the Taoiseach again to simply accept the legislation.  If he wants to amend it on Committee Stage, let us do that but let us also get this done rather than pretend to want to address it while resisting the mechanism for doing so when it is presented.</p></speech>

While we have a long way to go, no one can dispute the Government's good record.  It has done a great deal in respect of gender equality and advancing the rights and freedoms of women in our society.  I mentioned it simply to point out the complexity of the issue.  It surprises people to hear that some of the Nordic countries with subsidised childcare and a long-standing history of gender equality and progress have larger gender gaps than Ireland.</p><p>That demonstrates the number of factors in play and how what may appear to be solutions at first glance prove not to be so on further examination.  I do not wish to engage in a contest with the Labour Party on this matter.  Rather, I want the legislation to be passed.</p></speech>

We protested the treatment of the young woman involved at her clothing being passed around the jury.  This week, another young woman suffered humiliation during a rape trial in Cork.  We cannot comment on the verdict in the case but we need to focus on the lessons.  Why has nothing yet been done to stop the routine use of rape myths in trials?  How concerned is the Government about the chilling effect this is having on victims coming forward?  A barrister told the jury to "look at the way she was dressed", that she was "open to meeting someone" because she was "wearing a thong with a lace front".  A 17 year old was put in the dock for her choice of underwear.  She was "open to meeting someone": the implication was that she was asking for it.</p>  <p>  Women in this country are getting a little bit weary of the routine victim-blaming in Irish courts and the failure of lawmakers in this House to do anything about it.  Either the Judiciary believes these rape myths, in which case they should be forced to undergo education - it should not be voluntary - or they are being used to introduce sexist stereotypes which they know exist in society and among juries.  I suspect the latter.  Recently we have seen clothes, fake tan and even contraception being used to discredit women who have the bravery to go to court.  The most recent study by the Rape Crisis Network estimated that, at best, 10% of rapes are ever reported and only one in 40 rapes is appropriately punished.  How heroic and what levels of fortitude must one have to pursue a rape trial in this country, particularly when research shows there is less chance of the accused being convicted if the complainant is young, knew the rapist, had consumed any alcohol or drugs or is from a working-class background and up against a well-paid lawyer?</p>  <p>  We do not have data in this country because of the lack of funding for an updated Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report, but the Trades Union Congress, TUC, in Britain found that 63% of 18 to 24 year olds have experienced sexual harassment at work, as have 69% of hospitality workers and 67% of manual workers.  Last week, Google workers effectively took strike action protesting sexual harassment and inequality even though they do not have a union.  The #MeToo campaign has to be taken into the workplace and into society.  Women and men see the necessity of taking action because they cannot wait for the pace of change being offered by this Parliament.  Protests against the conduct of the trial will take place in five cities, including rallies at the Spire in Dublin and on St. Patrick's Street in Cork at 1 p.m. tomorrow.</p>  <p>  It might seem embarrassing to show a thong here in this incongruous setting of the D&aacute;il, but the reason I am doing it is, how do you think a rape victim or a woman feels at her underwear being shown in the incongruous setting of a courtroom?  When will this D&aacute;il take serious action on the issue of sexual violence?</p></speech>

Let there be no doubt that nobody asks to be raped and it is never the fault of the victim.</p><p>It does not matter what one wears, where one went, whom one went with or whether one took drugs or alcohol.  Nobody who is a victim of sexual violence or rape is ever to blame for the crime committed on them.  I believe any defence on those lines is absolutely reprehensible.  Let me put that very clearly on the record of this D&aacute;il.</p> <p> In terms of any individual court cases, the Deputy knows how the courts work.  We live in a democracy.  This is Parliament.  Parliament is separate from the courts.  When there is a prosecution, there is a defence.  The judge and jury hear all the evidence presented during the trial.  The jury comes to a decision on whether there is a conviction and then the judge rules on an appropriate sentence.  We cannot interfere in the way individual court cases are conducted.  However, I believe we need to examine this matter.  A review has been established under the chairmanship of Tom O'Malley, who is a recognised expert in this area.  He will look at issues like the evidence offered, the protocols, the practice and the procedure to see whether we can improve how such trials are conducted.</p></speech>

We need massive legal changes.  We need a discussion about consent throughout the length and breadth of society.  The Government could start this process by approving the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018 immediately.  This Bill, which has been proposed by Solidarity, has consent at its core.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to have compulsory training for the Judiciary and for juries?  Provision should also be made for advocates for survivors.  If we put the survivor at the centre of this process, we will ensure we do not maintain the current high attrition rate for sexual cases.  Most people have to wait two or three years to have their cases heard.  All the cuts to the rape crisis centres imposed over the last decade need to be reversed.  This will ensure the centres can do the type of research that is necessary.  Will the Government set up the specialist Garda units that were apparently dropped, for whatever reason?  We know there is a report coming from Tom O'Malley.  Change is happening in a piecemeal manner and at a snail's pace, especially in the context of the feminist revolt in society, which is a huge global phenomenon.  I encourage people to come to the protest.  That is what forces the political establishment to act.</p></speech>

In the past couple of months, we have passed and enacted new domestic violence legislation and gender-based violence legislation.  That will enable us to sign the Istanbul Convention on domestic violence and gender-based violence.  In terms of services for the Rape Crisis Network, as the Deputy will be aware, Tusla is the funder of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  The budget for such services has been increased to &euro;23.8 million, which represents an increase of &euro;3.4 million from 2016 to 2018.  I know that some individual service providers and advocacy bodies have had their funding reduced.  Others have had it increased.  Overall, there has been an increase in funding for these areas.  We have put a significant effort into the whole issue of consent.  This has involved workshops with professionals.  A particularly big effort has been made in education - in our schools and universities - to make sure those discussions are happening.</p></speech>

I raise this in the context of the programme for Government, the cancer strategy and the timely attention to people in difficult situations.  It is a very challenging diagnosis.  The woman was given an appointment for 9 November last and was told to arrive fasting on that day at 7 a.m.  She had to come up to Dublin the day before.  People have to make arrangements when they are travelling from the country to Dublin hospitals.  A phone call came to say the operation was cancelled along with 34 others because of some edict from on high.  The Minister for Health was mentioned but I presume it was not someone at that level.  There was a fear of overcrowding in the accident and emergency department and that there was a need to preserve beds and cancel what were considered to be elective procedures.  No guarantees could be given as to when the procedures would take place or that such an event would not happen again.</p>  <p>  This is not an uncommon phenomenon but it seems to be happening with greater frequency.  It is an extremely worrying development because part of the success of cancer strategies has been the idea that elective treatment and treatment generally would be ring-fenced and that in the centres of excellence there would be timelines for treatment after diagnosis which would not be breached by the pressures that acute services can impose on a hospital.  I am aware of other hospitals where there are breaches and the timelines that were originally set down for treatment in the aftermath of diagnosis are not being met because of pressures on the acute tertiary hospitals.</p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach concerned about that?  Will he investigate the situation - I can give him the particular details - and the wider issue that arises as a result of such cancellations of urgent intervention which seem to happen more frequently?</p></speech>

It must be particularly distressing if a patient is travelling a long distance or if he or she has been psyched up for a procedure or has to fast for a prolonged period.  What the Deputy mentioned does happen.  Operations are regularly cancelled, unfortunately, where overcrowding occurs in hospitals.  That is done for good reasons.  The Deputy mentioned that overcrowding in hospitals can have an impact on mortality and morbidity, and that is why elective operations are cancelled far too frequently.</p>  <p>  With regard to the solution, first, bed capacity must be increased.  An extra 250 beds were put into the system in the last year alone.  We have proposals now to develop elective hospitals that do not have emergency departments so they do not get overwhelmed on a busy day and operations do not get cancelled.  We have a bit of that already with Cappagh hospital and some other hospitals-----</p></speech>

In the aftermath of the budget, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il said he would seek additional tax breaks for landlords in the Bill.  We never got to the bottom of what precisely those would be.  However, I want to know whether the Taoiseach will provide a tax break for renters.</p><p>Yesterday's quarterly rental report from <i>daft.ie</i>shows rent has risen to an all-time high of &euro;1,334 per month.  In every single county in the State, the 4% rent pressure zone, RPZ, cap is being breached.  In Galway city, a RPZ, average rent is 16% higher than in the same period last year.  That is four times the 4% cap.  Eighteen counties in addition to Galway show double-digit increases, including 20% increases in Limerick and Waterford cities.  It is, therefore, time for the Taoiseach to accept that his approach to tackling spiralling rent increases has categorically failed.  What we need if we are to tackle this crisis are an immediate three-year rent freeze and tax relief for tenants.  Sinn F&eacute;in will reintroduce its amendments to the Finance Bill next week to provide such tax relief.  The Government will then have the opportunity to do the right thing to help struggling renters, or it can do the wrong thing again alongside its partner, Fianna F&aacute;il, and persist with introducing tax breaks for landlords instead.  When this choice is made, we will then see whether the Taoiseach is on the side of renters or landlords.  The choice is, of course, his.  I would like to know whether he will support our amendments.</p></speech>

Against that background, members of the visually impaired and blind community in the south-east Dublin region, basically from east Wicklow up through D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Ringsend, were shocked and distraught to discover that the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, which is mainly funded by the HSE, intends to close down its office in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I was protesting with them on Friday and some of them believe they will be lost, isolated and left with nothing in terms of the brilliant supports that are provided by the NCBI if this office closes.  They have been told that the only option is to travel to Tallaght or Drumcondra, which will be impossible for many of these service users.  Will the Taoiseach contact the HSE about this?

It is not a gift, it is something into which people have paid.  We have to consider pension rights and property rights and whether or not the public would want to give us the power to take away somebody's pension rights.</p>  <p>  The second issue that would need to be considered is due process.  While there are people who have sailed off into the sunset with very generous pensions and lump sums, there are also those people who have been very unfairly hounded out.  We would need to make sure there is due process in that regard, and consequences for those people who have hounded them out.</p></speech>

Although delaying a plebiscite for the people of Dublin on whether they should choose to directly elect a mayor, and in doing so reversing previous commitments given by the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach has agreed and committed to constituting a special citizens' assembly of Dubliners.  We welcome this measure if only for the reason that such a citizens' assembly would probably end up being even more radical than those on this side of the House who are proponents of a directly elected mayor.  Will the Taoiseach confirm - this is important - that the 100 members of the proposed citizens' assembly would be drawn exclusively from the electoral registers of the four Dublin local authorities?</p></speech>

I can confirm that the citizens will all be from Dublin city and county and not from the surrounding counties.  It is not intended that the directly elected Dublin mayor will have jurisdiction over parts of Meath, Kildare or Wicklow.  I am happy to reassure people of that.</p>  <p>  It may be the case, however, that all the 100 people may not be just citizens.  There may be a case made for including on the assembly a certain number of councillors or Oireachtas Members from Dublin.

As a result, we are committed to reforming the direct provision system, with particular focus on families and children.  Given the recent announcement by the Department of Justice and Equality that it has leased the only hotel in Wicklow town, namely, the Grand Hotel, as a direct provision centre for up to 100 people, including families, how does that action form part of reforming the system?  Equally, in the context of town and village renewal - dealt with in the section on urban renewal and tourism - the Government made announcements regarding Wicklow town in the context of enhancing the visitor experience, giving additional funding to Tidy Towns to reach gold medal status and providing LocalLink services to Wicklow and Glendalough.</p></speech>

Last week, we raised a number of issues concerning my own county in the House.  We were told today that the Garda station in Templemore will close at 7 p.m. because of the ban on overtime.  I am also told that the same will happen in Cashel.  There is a Garda division in my county to which 52 garda&iacute; are assigned and I am told by senior Garda officials that more than one third of those are not available for work at present with no replacements being assigned.  If we are serious about fighting crime in urban and rural areas, these decisions need to be reversed.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's point that it will not help farmers, I argue it will if it is capped at 22.5%.  The present situation is up to 100% of the farm can be taken under the fair deal scheme.  This would apply a cap at 22.5% so it would be far superior to the current arrangement.  The review is still continuing.  I hope by year end to have some progress on it.  I note the Deputy's interest and I will keep him updated.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, put on a cross-party event this morning and has more planned for during the week.  I will return to a question I asked about funding this time last year at the start of Science Week.  The Taoiseach will be aware that Horizon 2020 and the programme for Government committed to spending 2.5% of GDP on research and development funding.  We are at about 1.6% or 1.7%, which is just over halfway there.  When I asked the Taoiseach last year he answered me by saying there are many competing challenges such as housing, healthcare, transport and education, which I entirely acknowledge and agree with but which I do not see as being mutually exclusive.  I will make that point.  Spending on research and development can assist with our societal challenges if directed in the right way.  We are not anywhere near 2.5%.  That is our agreed target from Government.  When will we hit that target?  Where are we at in terms of meeting those commitments?</p></speech>

I understand that target is not just for the Government.  It is 2.5% of GDP from the entire economy.  It is not solely down to Government to provide all the funding for science and research.  Industry has to play its part as well.  I do not know what the figures are for 2019 but I am confident there has been an increase in Government spending in that area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is doing a very good job in that regard and he really has taken to the whole issue.</p>  <p>  I beg the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I fear I may have done a disservice to the food supplement industry.  I should rephrase.  Instead of saying very rarely, I should say many food supplements have no proven health benefits but some, of course, do.</p></speech>

There is absolutely no end in sight for hard-pressed people trying to pay rent every month.  Waterford was not included in the initial rent pressure zones for the 4% cap on rent increases.  When will we see a review of the rent pressure zones to incorporate this new up-to-date data?</p></speech>

We had the <i>daft.ie</i>report very recently.  We have the report coming from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, in December for the third quarter.  It works to a much more comprehensive data set.  It will tell us that rents are increasing and that in many parts of the country rents are too high and unsustainably high for people who are trying to pay them and trying to get by and meet all those other bills.</p></speech>

Legislation will come to the House very shortly that will strengthen the rent pressure zones and also allow new enforcement powers for the RTB as well as the money that was provided to it in the budget for 2019.  I am in discussions with the RTB on the qualifying criteria for the rent pressure zones because it is something we need to keep under review constantly as we continue to deal with the shortage we have in housing.  The CSO has released recent data for increases in construction of housing completions which are continuing to trend upwards by the thousands each quarter.</p></speech>

Under the programme for Government, the Government committed to enhancing mental health services.  In west Cork there is a facility called Lisheens House which helps people with mental health difficulties and also tackles the huge problem in west Cork of rural isolation.  It means that people no longer have to make the long journey to travel to the city for help.  The facility has been refused section 39 funding.  To add to the pain of the refusal, it had to wait for the decision.  The decision about funding was due in March and it only heard in October it had been refused.  Not only was it refused but it had to wait to hear of the refusal.  Will the Taoiseach please guarantee funding for this fantastic facility and also explain why it had to wait so long for a decision?</p></speech>

The mental health budget next year will exceed &euro;1 billion for the first time, including &euro;55 million for development, so there is a big increase in funding in the area.  It has been much acknowledged by people across the House.  If it has been refused, I imagine it has been refused for a good reason but I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to correspond with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I will raise an issue in Sligo University Hospital.  There was a day room for patients and families.  The room has been closed for the past 20 weeks.  The room was fitted out by public donations and was a great facility.  The Taoiseach knows, as a medical person, the distress to patients and families.  The room was there for families and in some cases for people to stay overnight when people were very sick.  The room has been closed.  I cannot understand why and I cannot get an answer.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could talk to the Minister for Health and try to get some answers.</p></speech>

The Bill is similar to one I introduced in the Thirty-first D&aacute;il and another one we introduced in this D&aacute;il in 2016.  </p><p>The Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to ensure Ireland will not and could not aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for a war, save with the assent of the D&aacute;il.  It also affirms that Ireland is a neutral State and that the State should have a policy of non-membership of military alliances.  The continued use of Shannon Airport for foreign militaries to facilitate their ongoing wars, coupled with the increased militarisation of the EU and this State's deeper integration in the EU's military system through permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, ensures this Bill is timely.</p> <p> I will ask the Government and all parties and groups to support the Bill when it appears for debate and to stop undermining Irish neutrality.  Sinn F&eacute;&iacute;n believes that if Ireland followed a policy of positive neutrality, our State could make a highly significant contribution to the long-held global objective of peace and justice and the achievement of the goal of universal human security to which everyone has a right.</p></speech>

Some 120 years later in 1914, as the First World War or Great War, as some call it, was beginning, the Irish Neutrality League issued its first circular, which was signed by its president, James Connolly.  Some 100 years after more than 40,000 or 50,000 Irishmen died in that imperialist war, the proud tradition of not aligning ourselves with belligerents and imperialists' resource wars is not enshrined in the Constitution.  In fact, the opposite is the case, especially since 1997 when Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to the NATO's Partnership for Peace.</p><p>This weekend I will open an international conference in this city.  It is the first international conference against US and NATO military bases and it will be held in Liberty Hall on Friday.  Guests from all around the world hold Ireland in such high regard that Ireland was selected for this conference, but that will not last if this Government, like recent others, continues to allow Shannon Airport to continue to be used as a US Army forward base, as it has been since 2002, or if it continues to go along with the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron or those in the European Commission, such as Jean-Claude Juncker, whose intention is to build a real European army through PESCO and so on and to have it in place by the middle of the next decade.</p><p>When the Bill appears on Second Stage, I hope the D&aacute;il will reconsider how it has voted in the past.  Although the numbers voting for Private Members' Bills have increased, I urge both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to consider their approach, not least in memory of the imperialist war and the effect it had on Ireland.  Ireland has such a proud tradition internationally of not being aligned to one side or another in wars and, therefore, I urge Deputies to endorse the Bill in order that we can ask the people their opinion.  Why is the Government continuously afraid of asking the people for their opinion on this issue?  The only poll that was done on this issue in recent times showed an overwhelming majority of Irish people are in favour of the intent of this legislation and, therefore, I urge the D&aacute;il to endorse the Bill when it comes before it again and allow the people to have their say.  Perhaps we will, once and for all, enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.</p></speech>

I met the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, the chief EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the chair of the European Parliament Brexit steering group, Guy Verhofstadt.  At all three meetings, I said we wanted the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible, but that it was essential that a legally robust backstop is set out clearly in the withdrawal agreement.  I expressed my appreciation for the ongoing efforts of Mr. Barnier and his team in the negotiations with the United Kingdom and thanked all my interlocutors for their robust solidarity with Ireland.  The EU proposals outlined in the draft protocol earlier this year are practical solutions to protect the gains of the peace process and to keep the Border as open and invisible as it is today.  They represent no threat to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  We want to see a future relationship agreed between the EU and the UK that makes the backstop unnecessary once the period of transition ends, but that outcome cannot be guaranteed.  The backstop must, therefore, be in place as part of the Irish protocol to offer full confidence that under no circumstances will there be a return to a hard border in Ireland.  My interlocutors reaffirmed their solidarity with Ireland and reiterated their strong view that the UK is under an obligation to deliver on the clear commitments and guarantees that Prime Minister May gave in December, March and September if there is to be a satisfactory withdrawal agreement, including provision for a transition period to the end of 2020.  I assure the House that these and other reassurances of solidarity that I receive in private are every bit as robust as those voiced in public.  EU backing has been unwavering.  Ongoing political engagement with our partners remains crucial and I will continue to take every opportunity to ensure our partners fully understand our particular concerns to enable the best possible outcome for this country.</p>  <p>  Along with my fellow members of the European Council, I met Mr. Tusk and Mr. Barnier again at our most recent summit in Brussels on 17 and 18 October.  I have seen President Tusk twice since then, including at the European People's Party conference in Helsinki.  I also recently met President Juncker in Paris.</p></reply>

The practice of ongoing commentary caused many problems over the past year and it is understandable that the EU side is determined to allow maximum room to manoeuvre in the discussions.  There is a desire to try to create some space to allow people engage in negotiations without megaphone diplomacy.  It is noteworthy that Tony Connolly's piece last Saturday suggested that our Ministers had been asked to stop constantly commenting and making political points during the latest phase of discussions.</p><p>From what we can see, it seems clear that there is a deal on the table with the organisation of its choreography in London the outstanding issue.  The London Government has secured its main objective of having a buffer of access to the customs union until it is ready for an alternative to seeking to maintain control of when it should exit that union.  Britain staying in the customs union is good for Ireland because there has been a lamentable lack of focus on the east-west axis.  Our trade with Britain is critical and the idea of Britain staying in the customs union is one that should be encouraged, and for longer than some in the British Parliament would wish.</p> <p> On the deal specific to Northern Ireland, the British Attorney General is reported as being prepared to argue that the wording is flexible, that the withdrawal treaty is, by definition, not capable of permanently binding the United Kingdom and that the backstop is capable of being ended if the United Kingdom so desires.  As a result of a motion currently before the House of Commons, the advice of the British Attorney General will be made available.  I understand that the British Government recently decided to make its legal advice available to the Commons.  Our Attorney General was in Brussels last week to examine the proposed wordings.  There is a real possibility that there will be one wording on the backstop but two contradictory legal interpretations as to what it means.  It is entirely conceivable that the United Kingdom Government will insist that it can end the backstop unilaterally while our Government will state that it cannot.  We may have an agreement with multiple interpretations.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will, at the very least, make available to it the same level of information that will be available to Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, namely, the legal advice?  We cannot have British parliamentarians having more information available to them than is available to their Irish counterparts.  If there is a deal, will the Taoiseach commit to delivering full information on the legal implications?  Will he also commit to publishing an immediate update of economic forecasts of the implications of what is agreed?  Brexit has already had a significant economic impact on Britain and Ireland.  We have a right to know the best estimates regarding its future impact while the agreements are being discussed and not merely after they have been concluded.</p></speech>

This year, the EU has the chair of the Kimberley process, which is the certification process for the diamond industry and its exports.  Ireland will hold the chair between 12 and 16 November.  A key aspect of the Kimberley process is to prohibit the export of blood or conflict diamonds.  Palestinian activists and civil society have called for the Kimberley process to include conflict diamonds coming from Israel on the grounds that the latter is engaged in ongoing systematic abuse of human rights, most recently launching a bombing raid on Gaza in which five people were killed.  That followed a covert Israeli military operation on Sunday during which seven Palestinians were killed and also the killing of four Palestinians only a few weeks earlier.  Over 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Great March of Return this year.  Should Ireland not use a power that we will hold this week as chair of the Kimberley process, to call Israel out and impose a sanction which would have a real impact?  We ought to demand that Israel no longer has a diamond trade while it continues to deny and suppress Palestinians their basic rights and wantonly kills individuals as part of its brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="04:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300019#R00300"><p>I echo Deputy Boyd Barrett's concerns about the ongoing situation in Palestine, the siege there and the continued breaches of international law by the State of Israel.</p>  <p>  Returning to Brexit and the imminent deal, there have been several waves of discussion and negotiation regarding the Irish protocol.  The initial position held by the British Government, notwithstanding commitments into which it had previously entered, was to contest the notion that there is a need for a specific backstop for Ireland.  We have come through the discussion regarding the backstop's scope.  While it was ongoing, there were those - Government and others - that held steady in insisting that Northern Ireland is not as British as Finchley, that we have particularly Irish concerns and needs which must be met and that, therefore, a bespoke solution and insurance policy are required.</p>  <p>  We then moved to the question of a backstop's duration.  Tension emerged between the British demand for a something that would be temporary and the Irish demand for something enduring.  Many Deputies argued that temporary protections are no protections at all.  I understood that we were all on the same page in respect of these matters.  In our dealings with the British Government, Michel Barnier, Guy Verhofstadt and others, we went to great lengths to reiterate our position, which we believe to be commonly held across the Irish political landscape.  Then the Taoiseach began to talk about a review clause and mechanism.  I am deeply troubled and puzzled by that.  Will the Taoiseach explain what this is and its provenance?  I want him to consider the following points.  First, in any review clause or mechanism, this State, and whoever is in Government, will not be a direct party to such a review.  Second, I assure the Taoiseach that even thinking out loud about the concept of a review offers the Tories the prospect of these being temporary little arrangements.  Third, we all spoke of achieving stability and certainty for our politics, society and economy.  By definition, review mechanisms prolong uncertainty.  The Taoiseach was wrong to raise this.  Has he conceded a review mechanism?  Will he clarify if a review mechanism is part of the deal that is on the table?  I cannot understand why he shifted substantively the Government's position at this point in the negotiations.  Has he seen the review wording?  Has the Attorney General similarly viewed words that constitute a review clause, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has suggested?  If the Taoiseach has agreed to this, why has he done so?  If he has not, then why was he thinking out loud along these lines?  At a time when we require clarity of purpose, a singular focus, steadiness and sticking to the bottom line in the context of this country's needs, the Taoiseach has wavered.  His words and actions in this are very dangerous.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, in these negotiations we have moved into classic brinkmanship mode, with all the hard decisions being left to the final hours.  We have heard that negotiators are up until 3 a.m. and resume their meetings at dawn, negotiating in what has been called "the tunnel".</p><p>Everything is now urgent.  There is little time left for information to be released, digested and analysed.</p> <p> Like others, I want to make it clear that we need time to see specifically the structure, content and import of any withdrawal agreement and to make sure we are legally clear before we vote in this House on any of these matters.  Will the Taoiseach make Government officials available to brief us, other Members of the House and parties across the House once the agreement is finalised, if it is finalised, and provide us with any legal interpretation upon which the Government is relying?</p> <p> I agree with Deputy Martin's point that the east-west part of the equation is extremely important for us.  I say that not only as leader of the Labour Party but as somebody who represents Wexford and Rosslare port.  A UK-wide customs union would be a great advantage but it must be established on a permanent basis.  I cannot see how that could be acceptable to the UK authorities.  We will see what is on offer and what is acceptable to Britain when the time comes.</p> <p> I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a review mechanism that was mentioned.  I asked him about that last week and he gave me some answers on it.  Perhaps more has been made of this than it merits but we need clarity on it and the Taoiseach might give us that clarity now.  Has he discussed the review mechanism with Michel Barnier and what is his understanding of what is meant by that term?</p> <p> We have had a report today covering the common travel area.  I have had discussions with a number of people on this matter.  Some legal advice I got is that we should not try to codify the common travel area because once we start legally framing it we are perhaps in some ways reducing the rights base of it.  The common travel area is a very shallow term for a very broad range of rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK and UK citizens here right down to access to health services, education, housing and even the right to vote.  My fear is that if we had an acrimonious parting of Britain and if it was perceived by the British, or certainly by the Tory Government, that the Irish issue was at the heart of the reason for an acrimonious departure, then rights enjoyed that are not legally codified and agreed may well disappear.  In private briefings there has been discussions on this but perhaps the Taoiseach would put on the D&aacute;il record what exactly is the extent of negotiations on the rights of Irish citizens and British citizens here which, separate from our European Union rights, would endure in what we now know to be, or call, the common travel area.</p></speech>

Has he seen a legal draft of it?  Has Mr. Barnier proposed such a legal paper or draft which has been shown to the Taoiseach or to Irish officials, or other representatives?  Does he believe he still has bullet-proof proposals on the backstop?  What is his desired deadline for agreement on Brexit?  Is it the December Council meeting or later than that again?</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Good Friday Agreement changed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland?  Will he expand on how that has affected his discussions with both Mr. Barnier and Mr. Tusk?  Does he agree it is almost inevitable that if Brexit proceeds along the lines we understand it to be proceeding, there will be a constitutional crisis in the UK, specifically regarding Scotland, which voted against it but has no power in terms of the negotiation, while in the North we have no functioning Executive to represent, in a legitimate way, the views of the different parties, communities and traditions in Northern Ireland?  It looks like we are drifting inevitably - I said this a long time ago - to the last few hours of the last night of negotiations.  I encourage the Taoiseach to be forthcoming to the D&aacute;il, on what is a most important decision for everybody on the island of Ireland, for the EU and for the UK, as to where he thinks it stands now.  I ask him to cut out the spin and tell us where he believes it is at.</p></speech>

The negotiations are happening in private.  They are happening in a &quot;tunnel&quot; and in private for a very good reason.  I have always said throughout these talks over the past year and a half that it was not helpful to give a running commentary on negotiations.  It is certainly not in our national interest to do that.  That is particularly true when we are approaching a very sensitive phase.  I believe we are approaching a very sensitive phase now so I hope Deputies will understand why I need to be a little cautious in the way I answer questions.  However, I am very happy to make officials available for confidential briefings with the party leaders and their teams this week and also should we come to the point where we have an agreement.  I would be very happy for that to happen.  I will ask my officials to contact the leaders' offices to set that up as soon as possible.</p><p>Deputy Martin was correct in saying that the UK staying in a customs union for a time or staying in a temporary customs arrangement would be beneficial for Ireland because of the benefits of frictionless trade east-west between Britain and Ireland, which is very important for the agrifood sector our small and medium enterprises and also for Northern Ireland.  Let us not forget that much of the trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain goes through Dublin Port and Rosslare.  It is the quickest way to get from Northern Ireland to the midlands and the south of England.  It is not Larne to Stranraer and all the way down.  It is Dublin to Rosslare and across to England.  I hope business in Northern Ireland will see the benefits of the UK staying aligned to the customs union.</p><p>  In terms of legal interpretation, again Deputy Martin made a very valid point.  There have been some discussions on this already.  We want to avoid a situation whereby we have an agreement that is made and then, two or three days later, we have the European Union interpreting it differently from the UK.  That is something we are aware of and some consideration has been given to making sure we have a common legal interpretation, as it were, of the agreement whenever it comes.</p></speech>

I will make everything available to the D&aacute;il that I can but there is a difference there.  We are talking about legal advice.  This is an EU-UK agreement.  It is not an agreement between the UK and Ireland or the UK, the EU and Ireland.  It requires ratification by Westminster and the European Parliament so the UK Attorney General is in possession of his own legal advice.  The European Union legal advice is in the ownership of the European Commission legal service and the European Council legal service.  It is very likely they will make that available to all of us but it will be made available to all the European Parliaments-----</p></speech>

I have written to him about this.  I am not sure if he has received that letter yet but it explains why it does not apply to Israel and why what he proposed cannot be done, in the view of the people who know all about the Kimberley process.</p> <p> Palestine was also discussed last week in Helsinki at the European People's Party, EPP, congress.  There was a discussion around the Human Rights Watch report on human rights in Palestine, Two Authorities, One Way, Zero Dissent, which is worth becoming familiar with.  It refers to the extent to which Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza face oppression by both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.  It is important that when we talk about the conflict in Israel and Palestine, we do not turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses being committed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.  Sometimes it seems that if a Palestinian is a victim of human rights abuses by Israel, it is raised.  However, when a Palestinian is a victim of human rights abuses by Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, there is silence.  I hope that the Deputy does not have a higher level of tolerance for human rights abuses committed by Hamas or other Palestinian groups than those committed by the state of Israel.</p></speech>

In the previous Administration, much work was done through Cabinet sub-committees which usually met for a full day.  I know it is the Taoiseach's practice that more work is done at full Cabinet meetings rather than at Cabinet sub-committee meetings.  However, that means one has long agendas.</p>  <p>  Does the infrastructure committee deal with the national broadband plan?  We went through a hiatus on one of the most important infrastructure projects in the State because of the resignation of the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Taoiseach himself has described the roll-out of broadband as analogous to the rural electrification programme.  What has happened on this?  Has a Cabinet sub-committee discussed the national broadband plan?  Where are we now with the review of the integrity of the plan's process to date?  When will proposals be brought back here?</p>  <p>  Tens of thousands of people living in my constituency and throughout the country are desperately anxious to know when they will have access to broadband.  This is one of the areas one would imagine a bespoke Cabinet sub-committee would be set up to bring in all the officials concerned from across various Departments to ensure there is a full and vigorous evaluation completed of the process to date, what needs to be done to mend the fatally damaged hand of the Government and how we proceed.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance working group, which the same Minister of State chairs, published its seventh progress report yesterday which highlighted, again, the Government&rsquo;s failure to set up an insurance fraud unit.  This sums up the Government's overall failure to tackle the insurance rip-off.  Yesterday, we were told that the Garda Commissioner has yet to form a view on the proposal and that several issues will require further consideration before any decision to proceed is taken.  This is a disjointed and messy set of messages coming from the Government.  Will the Taoiseach afford us some clarity on the matter?</p></speech>

The opposite seems to have happened.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that the reality is that many of the committees meet rarely.  It cannot be argued that the Cabinet committees play any substantive role in moving policy forward.  If one looks at two critical issues, health and broadband, there is no evidence that the relevant committees have made any impact.  They have only met several times this year.</p>  <p>  The last time he was challenged on this, the Taoiseach said he liked to raise issues at full Cabinet meetings.  That would mean brief and limited papers being prepared, as well as brief discussions.  There would be none of the more detailed discussions which were the norm with Cabinet sub-committees of the previous genre.  Previously, there would have been a full afternoon on a particular topic.</p></speech>

The infrastructure committee met once at the start of the year and will meet once or twice this year.  Is the Taoiseach happy that this represents adequate strategic oversight of an issue like broadband?  Given the growing shambles and incoherence in relation to rural broadband, which is now the subject of a personal crusade of the Taoiseach, how has Cabinet been carrying out its oversight role, in particular in view of how rarely the matter has been discussed at Cabinet-committee level?  It is a real issue given what we are now learning about costs being multiples of what was originally understood as well as in relation to what transpired over the last five to six weeks with certain meetings.  One gets the distinct sense that the Cabinet's eye was off the ball in relation to rural broadband and that there was no Cabinet committee which was on top of the issue.</p></speech>

What discussions has the Taoiseach had, which sub-committee deals with it and to what extent does the Taoiseach have a handle on the issue of affordability for those whose incomes are above the eligibility threshold but too low to get a bank loan?  Yesterday, for example, I had a distraught mother telling me about her son and daughter-in-law.  Her son is highly qualified and works for a telecommunications company.  He cycles all the way from Ballybrack to Dundrum every day and gets a reasonable wage while his wife works as a hairdresser.  They applied for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme but were refused without explanation.  They have their deposit and a clean credit rating but they were refused.  That mother simply asked me if the scheme was a scam.  If someone like her son and his wife, making the efforts they have made to get themselves educated and working, cannot get this scheme, who can?  How could they possibly be turned down?  She went on to say that her research shows that 67% of applications for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme are being refused.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that?</p></speech>

Their only child is ten years old which means their childcare costs are not as high.  They meet all the criteria and yet they have been turned down.</p>  <p>  Some time ago, I asked the Taoiseach about meetings of the Cabinet committee on security and related issues, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and on the report on the future of policing.  The Taoiseach told me that he had a different style as Head of Government, which is fair enough, and that he did not like having Cabinet sub-committees.  He prefers to have reports like that discussed by the Cabinet as a whole.  That is fine and it has always happened.  However, I asked him in a follow-up question what had happened and he said the report was noted.  Since then, I have seen no evidence that the report has been acted on.  From my experience with a report as detailed as the one on the future of policing, I cannot see how progress on the detailed list of actions can be discussed other than at some kind of sub-committee.  It is at a sub-committee that detailed actions can be commissioned by the Taoiseach for the implementation of this vital report.  In our own constituency, people are complaining strongly that they simply do not see enough community policing which is at the heart of the proposals in the report on the future of policing.</p></speech>

I was asked about working mechanisms and it is always sensible to be flexible in that regard and practical about how one decides to operate Government business.  As Members have acknowledged and unlike the case with previous Governments, I have focused on involving the whole Cabinet in decision making as far as is practical.  Today, for example, we spent an hour on Brexit.  While Cabinet committees include officials and advisors, they often exclude Ministers.  I like to do more things with Ministers than was the case in the past and often hold bilateral or trilateral meetings, in particular around health and housing.  These meetings involve me, the line Minister and another relevant Minister, usually the Minister for Finance.  We also use the Cabinet committees.  For example, we decided specifically in regard to the O'Toole report on the future of policing that the Cabinet would note it and agree to its publication and that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, would come back to the Cabinet sub-committee with a reasoned response to it and an implementation plan.  On that occasion, the right approach was that it should be noted by Cabinet and published and then referred to the Cabinet sub-committee for further consideration.</p>  <p>  The infrastructure committee, which is sub-committee D, covers the national broadband plan and I receive a report every two weeks on the progress being made.  On Thursday, we will have a meeting of that Cabinet sub-committee to deal with two major issues, namely housing and the implementation of Project Ireland 2040, respectively.  The latter discussion will include broadband.  There are two steps to come in the national broadband plan.  The first involves the report of Peter Smyth on the process and whether it has been okay.</p></speech>

As I said, it has not arrived yet but it is imminent.  There are no proposals for a referendum on compensation payments currently.  I acknowledge in this context the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, and his predecessor, the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, which has had results.  For example, motor insurance premiums peaked in 2016, having risen very steeply, and they have now fallen by 20%.  Much of that is down to the work led by those Deputies.  Health insurance costs had been increasing very rapidly under previous Governments but they have levelled off and even fallen in the last year or two.  Much of that is down to the legislation we introduced on lifetime community rating, which has worked.  It is legislation I brought through the House and which has made a difference to health insurance costs which had been rising every year for I do not know how long.  They have now levelled off and actually fallen for VHI customers.</p>  <p>  On affordability, I am advised that approximately 1,000 Rebuilding Ireland home loans have already been approved, which is a not insubstantial number.</p></speech>

This is a matter of great concern to me and my Department.  I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed by our failure to maintain the usually exceptionally high standard of service provided by the staff of the Department. </p><p>The root of the difficulty lies in the transfer of the illness benefit scheme to our new core business objectives information technology, IT, platform on 4 August.  The transfer had a number of objectives, including moving the illness benefit payments from a very old IT platform which is approaching end of life to a newer platform which already manages most of my Department&rsquo;s other payment schemes.  We wish to realise cost savings by eliminating the need for labour intensive data entry and enabling the re-use of existing data already on the business objectives platform.  It was hoped that the transfer would facilitate, in due course, with the co-operation of general practitioners, GPs, the move from submission of paper medical certificates by people to one whereby an ecertificate is transmitted electronically from the GP to my Department and the move away from certification each week by a GP to a system whereby a single certificate is provided to cover the entire illness period.</p><p>  The system change worked effectively for approximately 80% of those who claim illness benefits but a several difficulties arose which affected payments to a significant number of people.</p><p>The redesign of the medical certificate enabled the forms to be scanned rather than manually entered into the system.  However, approximately 50% of GP practices initially continued to submit old form medical certificates which led to long delays in claim processing on the new system in early August.  The delays were overcome by the Department implementing an automatic certification process to ensure that people, including those whose GPs were not submitting the correct certificates, were paid.  Although the process ensured that people received their payments, it resulted in approximately 15% of recipients receiving a split payment in the period from September to November.  People who received split payments were not underpaid as a consequence of this approach; the total amount paid to them was in accordance with their entitlement.  However, they did not expect the payment to be split.</p><p>  During this time, my Department deployed additional staff to process old form certificates received from GP practices.  This allowed us to cease the auto-certification process in mid-October and the issue of split payments has since been largely resolved.  Approximately 75% of medical certificates now being received are in the correct format and the remaining forms are being processed manually on the day they are received.</p><p>The removal of the auto-certification process has belatedly exposed some underlying deficiencies in the design and operation of the new illness benefit system.  The main issue identified relates to the transition from a payment-in-arrears approach to a current-week payment approach, that is, from a system whereby people are paid their entitlement the week after the submission of a certificate to one whereby they are paid during the week of certification.  This leaves very little tolerance for late receipt of certificates once a claim is in payment, which is causing significant uncertainty for people.  The new system has very tightly defined rules which must be satisfied before a claim and a certificate can be accepted and processed.  Although these rules are valid in principle, they are leading to payments being delayed for reasons that would not have been applied under the legacy system.</p><p>My Department has taken three main steps to resolve these issues.  We have deployed additional staff to process the tasks and respond to inquiries arising from the tight application of scheme rules by the new system.  We have developed some new IT routines or work-arounds that, in effect, build in a seven-day buffer to address the payment gap issue and automate the processing of tasks to ensure a faster flow-through of payments.  We are reviewing the design rules in the system, including the payment in the current week rule, and will modify the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.  In addition, my Department continues to engage with the medical profession regarding the implementation of e-certification and single closed certification.  We hope that these measures will lead to an improved delivery of services.  My Department has allocated additional managers to take responsibility for the programme of work I have set out.  The management team includes a full-time assistant secretary and additional staff at principal, assistant principal and higher executive officer level.</p><p>  As a consequence of these measures, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order should now receive their payment entitlements.  Payment volumes were restored to normal levels last week and are being monitored on a daily basis to ensure that they remain at that level.  Any further issues that may arise will be quickly identified and further remedial action may be taken to address them.</p><p>  It is important to note that there are always cases - and there were always such cases under the old system - of people&rsquo;s payments being legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons.  Such issues will remain and are normally dealt with via our helpline number.</p><p>In addition to the system issues, my Department sincerely acknowledges that it did not communicate effectively with people in advance of the new system coming into effect or in the immediate post-implementation period.  Although my Secretary General wrote to all those in receipt of illness benefit some weeks ago to apologise for the difficulties they were experiencing and to advise of the supports available, I accept that communication was too little, too late and of limited comfort to those unduly distressed.</p><p>Our experience with the illness benefit transfer has been a salutary reminder of the longer-term impact of short-term remedial actions.  Such actions, even those taken with the best of intentions, may have unanticipated issues or failures and must be carefully thought through before implementation.  In order to ensure that lessons are identified and learned from this experience, I and my Secretary General have commissioned an independent review of the project to be undertaken by a retired Revenue Commissioner.  I expect that it will be delivered to me by the end of the year and its findings will inform our approach to future system and process changes.</p><p>As I have stated, my Department sincerely regrets the distress it has caused to recipients of illness benefits in recent months and we will endeavour to ensure that nothing like this happens in our Department again.</p></reply>

However, we must bear in mind that much of her reply was couched in the past tense, as if the problem had now resolved itself.  I could show the Minister the five messages I received on my mobile phone today in respect of this issue.  My office has probably received many more.  The problem has not yet been resolved.  We must remember that this has been going on for three or four months.  It began in August when the new form of medical certificates which require a significant amount of extra information were demanded out of the blue without any notice or consultation.</p><p>When that seemed to be about to be resolved, the software problem kicked in.  We have to bear in mind that we are dealing with some of the most vulnerable people in the country.  They are too sick or too disabled to work.  In the vast majority of cases, they depend entirely on social welfare from week to week.  We have all heard various stories and received emails telling us about instances of hardship caused by this problem in individual cases.  On behalf of all those people, I ask the Minister for an assurance that this will not recur.  Is there any accountability here?  I am not looking for a head or anything like that.  Surely somebody in the Department made the decisions that gave rise to all this hardship, anguish and pain.  Has anybody spoken to the officials in question to point out the error of their ways?</p></speech>

The sickest and most vulnerable people in the State are looking for their entitlements and benefits.  They paid into the Social Insurance Fund in the hope that it would kick in as a safety net when most needed, but it failed them.  I have heard the apology to people who have been messed up since August.  They have been running from pillar to post in an attempt to get money to which they are entitled.  There was a major failure in communications between the Department and the recipients.  Some community welfare officers around the State were stepping in to give payments, but others were not.  They claimed that people were not entitled to payments because they had received part-payments.</p>  <p>  Accountability is the key issue here.  I want to ask specifically about the consultants who rolled out this IT system.  What accountability is there?  The Minister did not act when I first identified and raised these issues in August.  She has acknowledged that action was not taken until October, when three different things were implemented.  Serious questions need to be answered in that respect.  The Minister and the Department have said on a number of occasions that anyone who is entitled to money has received money, but that is clearly not the case.  Two weeks ago, the Minister went on radio on a Friday to say that people would be paid, but that has not happened.  At this moment in time, has everyone received the money to which they are entitled?  In the cases of those who are due money from the Department, have underpayments been made?  Can we have a figure?  People are fearful about overpayments that took place when they received money they were not due.  What measures are being put in place to deal with such serious concerns?</p></speech>

Instead, I will set out my point by reading from a letter that some of us have received from a person who continues to serve this country in a very important role.  He speaks for everyone in the letter, which reads:</p><blockquote>I am close to a complete breakdown due to a system which is clearly even more overrun than it was prior to the changes, changes which I am guessing were introduced in an effort to improve an already troubled setup, but which are a disaster.  I would like to ask at this point if you may have been aware of these difficulties which many of the population of this country are faced with and, if so, if you might be willing or able to step in to attempt to rectify the endless and needless stresses which this puts on me and on my family and on many many others throughout the country.  What will it take in order for our services and systems to stop pushing already struggling and suffering citizens to despair and desperation?  Is it going to take an example like this on Joe Duffy to highlight the mess the system is in?</blockquote><p>This person has paid his taxes and made his contributions.  His case is a genuine one.  When he asked for a bit of help from the system, he found he was entitled to nothing.  It is an awful story.  There is more to it.  I cannot believe it.</p><p>People were left hanging on phones.  How many additional people were asked to deal with this?  I want to know whether the officials were in favour of this at all.  Was there a big change in the Minister's Department?  Was that part of the problem?  We are talking about appointments of assistant secretaries general, etc.  We left these people high and dry.  This is an insurance-based system.  People are entitled to their money.  The Minister should not tell people to go down to the community welfare office, where means tests are used and people have to sit looking in.  It is just not right.  I have met people who are destitute.  I think it is a disgrace.  A system should not be changed like this ever again.  Why was it changed at all?  We should never change something that is doing all right.  This is the first time I have ever got angry with the Minister.  I think she is doing a good job but this was an utter failure.  It is rare for me to use words like that.  This was a shambles of the highest order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="04:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300024#W00400"><p>I thank the Deputies.  I am not standing here in front of anybody trying to justify any of the actions that happened over recent months.  I have said on a number of occasions that this is particularly difficult to accept because an exemplary level of service is offered by people in the Department 99.9% of the time.  That is why this debacle is so difficult to try to explain.  I assure Deputy O'Dea that I am not talking in the past tense.  We have issued over 50,000 payments in recent days.  We have issued 29,000 payments this week alone, and it is only Tuesday afternoon.  On average, we would have 50,000 people on illness benefit in any given week.  That has been the average weekly tranche this year, last year and the year before and it will be the expected number of weekly payments next year.</p>  <p>  All arrears have been paid.  There may be cases in which arrears are still due.  We are using the business-as-usual manual processing for some of the old forms.  Anyone who is awaiting arrears from an old payment form will receive those arrears this week.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of calls being made to our helpline arising from the changes that have been made in recent weeks.  That is how I know that the vast majority of changes have been successful.  The number of calls has returned to normal levels.  I reiterate that there will always be cases in which people are refused illness payments because they are not entitled to such payments, because the medical certificate was not filled out correctly - the incorrect date may have been used, for example - or because a payment was missed.  There will always be a small number of issues with some of the 50,000 payments that are made each week.  That was true of the old system and it is true of the new system.</p>  <p>  The first change that we made was made in August.  It had to be made because just 50% of doctors were using the new form.  I acknowledge and accept that this was our fault.  There was a lack of communication with doctors.  We have learned so much.  It is probably the case that we have yet to identify things that we need to learn.  I hope that will happen on foot of Revenue's independent audit.  The only thing I can genuinely do is apologise sincerely to the people we have distressed over the last couple of months.  It was never our intention to distress them.  While we were trying to improve the system, we genuinely upset people.  This was not our intention.  We are going to make sure it does not happen again.</p></speech>

However, I am continuing to get a number of queries.  The Department might be telling the Minister that all arrears are being paid, but that certainly does not tally with the information I am getting from my constituents.  I accept that the Minister is not seeking to justify what happened.  I accept that she does not stand over it.  I would like to return to a question I asked earlier.  Will anybody be held accountable, even in the sense of being spoken to or remonstrated with?  If consultants were involved in the installation of this software, as has been suggested, what are the prospects that they will be employed by the Government again?  Have they been spoken to?  What about the officials who signed off on the new medical certificates last August without any notification or any advance notice to anybody?</p></speech>

I have spoken to numerous people yesterday and today.  One woman, who is a new applicant, told me yesterday that she has not received a payment for six weeks.  I have spoken to another woman who was out sick and is actually back in work now, but has not yet received a payment.  There are substantial issues in this area.  Accountability is one such issue.  I would love to see the remit or terms of reference that were given to the consultants who were involved in this process, particularly with regard to training.  Certainly, the staff in the Department who were expected to administer and deal with this matter did not receive enough training.  That is no reflection on the staff, who have been put under massive amounts of pressure because of the roll-out of this system, which seems to have been doomed from day one.  The Secretary General told the committee that this IT platform is due to be rolled out for the one-parent family payment and for jobseekers' payments.  The independent review will be critical.</p><p>I was given a commitment that the terms of reference of that independent review would be circulated.  We need to get them but that review should be made public and scrutinised because lessons need to be learned from this.  People have been affected unnecessarily and that must never happen again to anyone entitled to funding and a safety net from this State.</p></speech>

That is not good enough.  There are staff in the Department who work very hard and I concur with the Minister because I saw them working there.  If the Minister does not put enough people on to man or woman the lines &ndash; women do an awful lot of this good work &ndash; she is in trouble.  That is a problem.</p>  <p>  Surely the Minister is not intending to roll out this system for any further payments after this fiasco until this report comes clear and we get an opportunity to examine, scrutinise and invigilate it to ensure that the mess that was made of this is sorted out.  Deputies Brady and O'Dea are correct, we are paying out many thousands of euro to consultants and everybody else when it might be better to allow the Department's people to work within their own system and make qualifications to ensure that it complies with modern day standards.  I would be against any further roll out of this until this problem is sorted out.</p></speech>

If they were not I will get them for Deputy Brady.  There is no problem about sharing them.  I am not doing the review to keep it a secret.  We can all go back to the committee so that we can all learn effectively together.  The most important reason for doing it is to learn why it went wrong and how we did or did not effectively respond to it so that I can ensure it does not happen again.  When the report comes back to us I will be quite happy to go back to the committee and talk about it and to glean the Deputy's advice and suggestions.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Penrose, we are going to move our other schemes from the old system to a new one because the old one is creaking and has been around for probably 40 or 50 years.  It is on its last legs and needs to be moved to a new system.  I can absolutely and categorically assure him that any plans we have are on hold until we learn from this particular roll out all of the lessons we need to learn to make sure this does not happen again. </p>  <p>  In response to Deputy O'Dea, there is nothing wrong with the medical certificate because I know he thinks there is and that it caused the problem.</p></speech>

In effect, had the system gone the way it was supposed to go it would have worked but it gave rise to other anomalies that we did not recognise because of the changes we had to make in the response to people using the old medical systems.  That is our fault, nobody else&rsquo;s fault.  The miscommunication is our fault.  It is part of the learning process to make sure we improve our communications.</p>  <p>  I recognise, as Deputy Brady says, that our staff were put under incredible pressure and that they told us that there were deficits in the training programmes given to them.  I think the training was probably as good as it could have been but when people tell me it needed to be better I have to listen to that and take it on board.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Penrose, approximately 1,000 calls come into the Department every day.  That number went up to 12,000 a day.  I do not know where I would have got the staff to turn around the kind of service that is given daily but I hear what he is saying.</p>  <p>  If Deputy Brady knows a lady who has not received a payment for six weeks this is not why she has not received it.  If the Deputy gives me her details and personal public services number, PPSN, I will resolve that issue today.  </p></speech>

From a broader perspective, the wider issues relating to maintenance, including the establishment of a child maintenance service to assist lone parents, are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who has responsibility for the family law Acts, which govern maintenance requirements.</p>  <p>  The family law Acts place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children.  In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply.  Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly between the parties themselves, or with the assistance of supports from the Department of Justice and Equality, such as the family mediation service and the Legal Aid Board, or ultimately through the courts.</p>  <p>  With regard to the work within the Department, the preliminary stages of the internal review have now concluded.  My officials now intend meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality, with a view to ascertaining its views and to considering jointly the next steps in relation to family maintenance arrangements.  A meeting has been scheduled for later this month.</p></reply>

Why has that not been extended in tandem with the changes in the lone parent allowance regulations?  When the child is older than seven years the lone parent gets a different type of payment, jobseeker's transition, as opposed to lone parent allowance but there seems to be no logical reason why that system does not apply equally to somebody who is in the jobseeker's transition on the basis that they are a single parent.</p></speech>

I am not sure it is our job in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to chase errant parents.  It is definitely somebody's job but I am totally against penalising women, as they are in the main, for not chasing the errant partner to look after their children.  I have several ideas as to what should happen if the world was perfect but some of them fall under my remit and some do not.  That is what will be discussed at the meeting later this month.  Once that meeting has been held we can maybe have a further conversation about what might be most suitable.</p></speech>

The poverty statistics among lone parents, as the Minister is aware, are particularly stark.  In many cases somebody is not in a position to go to court because their partner is violent.  Even when they do go to court and do not get paid the Department tends to assess them for maintenance which the court has granted but which they are not being paid.</p></speech>

If somebody is in that situation they will not want to take the risk of getting an order for maintenance which they feel sure is not going to be paid and having it assessed against any lone parent allowance they will get.</p>  <p>  The lone parent allowance will not make anybody rich and in its current form it will not do much to combat the levels of poverty among single parents but if they were able to get maintenance in addition it would certainly combat poverty in an area where it is particularly prevalent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="05:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300025#X01600"><p>Whether we expand or downgrade our liable relatives division has no impact on a parent's poverty whatsoever because the payment issued to the parent is done on the basis of that parent's circumstances.  If they get maintenance there is a very generous maintenance disregard.  If they do not get maintenance it is not included in our assessment.  They do not get it and we compensate for the fact that they do not get it.  That is as it should be.  The Department is here to look after people in vulnerable positions.  If they get money towards maintenance they get a generous disregard.  If they do not get money it is up to the State to ensure that family has a minimum standard of living.</p>  <p>  I need to square the circle of whether it is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's legal responsibility to chase errant parents or that of some other arm of the State, or maybe a collective authority from the Department of Justice and Equality and our Department.  Until I figure that out, I am not going to put any woman, and it is in the main women, in the vulnerable position of having to chase somebody so that she can qualify for a payment from our Department.  That is not the way it should be and that is not the way it is now.</p></speech>

It supports the long-term unemployed in securing and sustaining full-time paid employment.  Jobseekers are referred to the service by means of a selection process.</p>  <p>  A person who has previously completed a year with JobPath is referred back to an Intreo case officer.  This is in-house, so to speak.  If after six months, he or she has not found sustainable employment or is not engaged in education, training or with any other employment support we offer, he or she may be randomly reselected to go back on JobPath.  Jobseekers referred for a second time will start working again with a personal adviser, who will review their development during their previous time with the service.  Together they will prepare a new personal progression plan to build on that progress.  The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagement, with particular focus on the identified barriers that prevented them from moving into full-time suitable employment during the first 12-month stint.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, more than 193,000 jobseekers have engaged with JobPath.  Of these, 15,000 have been referred to the service for a second time.</p>  <p>  JobPath providers receive a registration fee each time they register a jobseeker for the service and the balance of their fees are paid subject to their clients achieving sustained full-time employment for a minimum of 13 weeks. </p>  <p>  There is no separate costing structure for jobseekers who are referred to the service for a second time.  The Department does not release details of fees paid to JobPath providers as these are commercially sensitive.  To do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts currently in place and, in particular, in any procurement that may be undertaken in this area.</p></speech>

The Minister implied in her answer that they are getting paid a second time when people sign the personal progression plan.  What is the figure for this?  How much is being paid out for the 15,000 people referred for a second time?</p>  <p>  What is the difference between the training in the first stint, which has not worked in finding jobs for the 15,000 people, and that in the second?  I have spoken to many of those referred for a second time and they say they are doing the exact same a second time round, namely learning how to write a curriculum vitae and engaging in other meaningless tasks.  There are being put in front of a computer and told to find themselves jobs.  The service did not work the first time round and it certainly did not work the second time round.  Could I have the figures?  The argument about commercial sensitivity does not wash.  The service is costing us millions of euro.  Issues are clearly arising, and I have raised them with the Minister on many occasions.</p></speech>

To answer his question, it is interesting that the vast majority of representations I receive from Deputies ask me to intervene directly with people on community employment schemes for a number of years and who desperately want to stay on them for a number of years.  It is one of our successful activation processes.  A large number of members from the Deputy's party have asked me specifically to intervene to allow people to stay for longer periods in community employment and activation processes than would normally be allowed, yet he has a problem with what is probably the most successful activation scheme and process we have ever had.</p></speech>

He does not have a problem, however, with people getting a second chance on the community employment scheme or T&uacute;s, which is incredible.</p>  <p>  The service works.  The reason we send people back for a second time is that they want to do so.  They want to work.  Despite the recommendations or protestations of Sinn F&eacute;in, the people on the live register want to work and avail of the assistance of any arm of the State to secure a full-time job.</p></speech>

The two companies are rubbing their hands together with glee.  The Minister failed to answer the questions I put to her on the training given to a person referred for a second time round.  There is no difference whatsoever between the training on the first occasion and the second?</p>  <p>  Do the State and Department have a responsibility to continue to feed agreed numbers to the two companies until the contracts with them expire?  The State is running out of people to feed this monster that it has created.  The Department is obliged under contract to continue to feed the two companies.  That is why the 15,000 people have been referred for a second time.  I could show the Minister dozens of cases in which people do not want to be in the service for a second time.  They feel their time is being wasted by being referred for a second time.  The Minister is saying people want to participate but that is not true.</p></speech>

Every time we have oral questions, Deputy Brady brings anecdotal evidence as to how desperately people are treated on JobPath, yet it is undoubtedly one of the most successful activation programmes we have had in the history of the State.  I would love to say we are running out of people to put on JobPath.  I am pleased that the number unemployed is under 200,000 but there are still 200,000 people in this country who have no work and who want to work and avail of the assistance of any arm of the State that will train them, give them education and experience and assist them in getting a full-time job.  The Deputy is ideologically opposed to JobPath.  He would rather see people on the ground living on &euro;198 per week.  That is what keeps him happy.</p></speech>

It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members' benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage, including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.  In developing these, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland in order that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  The provisions of this Bill, however, will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 that, among other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12-month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  It has been necessary to consult and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy to achieve a resilient solution.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by the Government, I will request an early date for Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Many of the provisions contained in the EU directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, will also support positive reform of the Irish occupational pensions sector.  My officials, together with the Pensions Authority, are working on the transposition process to ensure the necessary amendments to existing laws, regulations or administrative provisions will be made to give full effect to the directive.  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

It is now a year and a half since the legislation was introduced.  Deputies O'Dea and Brady and I have introduced Bills in this area.  The one I am asking about is a distillation.  Each of us had a Bill with more lofty objectives.  The aim was to ensure the protection of workers who are being thrown sacrificial lambs, even with well-to-do employers running amok.  The introduction of our Bills led to one company coming back from the brink and giving at least some employees protection.</p><p>There are important measures in the defined benefit scheme to ensure that employers do not disavow their obligations willy-nilly.  This Bill was to offer some degree of protection to workers in defined benefit schemes but a year and a half has passed.  I accept that the Attorney General's office is snowed under and the Minister has said there is a European dimension to it as well in respect of European legislative provisions that will enhance it, I hope, but can she give an indication of the likely time in 2019?  Does she expect it to be in the first quarter of 2019?</p></speech>

The reason is that the amendments we are proposing are particularly technical and complex.  The only thing I can guarantee is that I am as frustrated by the delay as the Deputy.  Advancing this legislation is on our management board meeting agenda every week.  It is near the top of my list and will certainly not go away until we get the date and the amendments we need accepted and brought back to the Cabinet.  All I can say is that it is getting my full attention.</p></speech>

We had a detailed discussion with ICTU and the various unions, including SIPTU and Unite.  All the trade unions are of one voice on this.  We want the legislative changes brought forward and the Pensions Act 1990 significantly amended.  There will be funding obligations coming forward that will curtail the smart alec employers from walking away from their obligations.  These people have significant funding and are not even insolvent employers.  If they were, sometimes the employees would be in a better position, as with Waterford Glass.  In this case, however, people who are very well off are making sure to enrich themselves and to give bigger shareholder payments and dividends, while throwing to the wolves the unfortunate workers who have contributed many years of their working lives.  We want to ensure that does not happen.  I urge the Minister to keep it at the top of her agenda.</p></speech>

Approximately 85% of all claims are awarded in the first instance and just 1% are appealed annually.  Nevertheless, my Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for the period January to October 2018 are 30.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.3 weeks for a summary decision.</p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is quasi-judicial and decisions have to be formally written up to a quasi-judicial standard because they are subject to review by the High Court.  Accordingly, the desire to process appeals quickly must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent, of high quality and made in accordance with the legislative provisions and the general principles of fair procedures and natural justice.  </p>  <p>  A number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past 12 to 18 months to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This has led to longer processing times during this period.</p>  <p>  The chief appeals officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her office and that she expects processing times to improve as recently appointed staff develop the necessary experience and expertise to determine appeal decisions to the standard required.</p>  <p>  An appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of his or her appeal.</p></reply>

They vary from 17 to 64 weeks.  A carer who appeals a decision, for example, must wait 29 weeks without a penny for a decision.  A jobseeker must wait 37 weeks.  That is ludicrous.  I heard the Minister's response but what is going on in the appeals section?  I accept her comments about new staff having to be trained to replace retiring staff, but that is only to tread water.  What additional staff have been appointed to deal with this crisis in the appeals section?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="05:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300027#Z01100"><p>I disagree with the Deputy's comment that they are without a penny.  Nobody is forced to wait whatever length of time is involved, be it 17, 19 or 26 weeks, without a penny.  That is what the supplementary welfare system is for.  I encourage anybody who is waiting a lengthy period for an appeal decision to go to the local office where we will look after him or her financially.  That is what we do.  In addition to the continuous focus on improving appeal processing times, work is ongoing in the Department on a number of fronts in the context of improving the quality of first-instance decision-making, reducing the number of appeals being received and reducing the time taken in the Department to prepare the appeal submission.  These include: better information gathering at the initial claim stage, which hopefully leads to better outcomes and better decisions; better explanation of the reasons for any decision to make it easier for customers to understand the decisions we make and to reduce the number of unnecessary appeals; a significant programme of training for decision makers on all aspects of their decision making functions.</p>  <p>  Social welfare forms are consistently being monitored to ensure they capture sufficient information at the claims stage.  In recent years, for example, improved claim forms were developed for the domiciliary care allowance application and that has resulted in the number of weeks people are waiting for the initial decision to reduce drastically.  We did something similar recently in the case of the carer's allowance application with the Carers Association.  Again, we expect it to yield a number of results for us.  Everything we do is to try to improve the situation.</p></speech>

The Minister knows, however, that when somebody applies to the community welfare officer, the matter is at the officer's discretion, in the first instance, and, second, it is means tested.  Not everyone will get a penny from the community welfare officer.  That is not the solution to the failure within the Department to deal with this situation.  Yes, forms have to be simplified but in the majority of cases it is not forms being filled incorrectly that leads to appeals.  The Minister did not answer my question about additional staff.  A key failure is that there are not enough staff to deal with the level of appeals.  Perhaps she will answer that question.  In addition, other means must be explored.  What are the Minister's views on accelerating the appeals?  She referred to simplifying forms and other measures.  I would be interested in hearing about them.</p></speech>

Most of these schemes are means tested anyway.  People would not apply or qualify for them if their means were not within that realm.</p>  <p>  Second, there are almost 6,000 people working in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I cannot answer the question about whether we have asked for more people in the appeals office.  However, we have tried, particularly in the difficult economic circumstances in the last number of years, to do more with the people we have.  In fairness, one can see the result in the fact that our appeal waiting times have come down drastically.  The reasons are that we have improved efficiencies in how we collect our information, we have provided people with new forms to make it simpler and we have tried to help people to understand that they do not need to hold back some information for appeals because they expect that everything will be rejected in the first instance.</p>  <p>  My main message is that, first, 85% of all applications that are made are found in the affirmative.  In fact, the social welfare Bill tomorrow will provide for automating that to make it even faster for people.  Second, nobody should be waiting without any money.  If people are, they can go to their local community welfare office and we will look after them.  We will continue to try to improve the turnaround level for decisions.</p></speech>

We are getting old.</p>  <p>  Pensioners born on or after the 1 September 1946 affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, can have their contributory state pension entitlement calculated under an interim total contributions approach, TCA.  The announced changes also provide for up to 20 years of home caring credits in the pension entitlement calculation for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p>  <p>  Significant preparatory work was required to design and develop the new, necessary ICT system changes and the necessary legislative provisions to underpin these changes, as initiated last week in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  The latest data I have identify approximately 79,000 pensioners to be reviewed, of whom just over 70,000 reside in Ireland.  The first 11,000 information letters issued last week to Irish residents.  I would expect and anticipate that the remainder will issue by the end of this week or early next week at the latest.  The 8,000 pensioners who are resident outside of Ireland are expected to receive letters from us in December.  The Department waited until we had access to end of month data before issuing letters as we wanted to capture as many of those pensioners as possible who will be entitled to a review.</p>  <p>  The letter informs pensioners that the Department will contact them again directly with either the outcome of their individual review, where sufficient information is available to us, or to request further information regarding gaps in their social insurance records.  It is not necessary for people to contact the Department on this matter in that we will do all the heavy lifting for them.</p>  <p>  The examination of social insurance records is under way.  Reviews and payments will commence in the first quarter of 2019.  Where an increase is awarded, it was agreed by this Parliament last year that it will be backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person's 66th birthday if later and arrears paid.  Pensioners who do not qualify for an increase as a result of this review will continue to receive their existing rate of pension.</p></speech>

As she said, it is a long time ago and much water has gone under the bridge.  When we discussed the matter this time last year we were hopeful that by the end of the year people might have received payments but now it is to be in the first quarter of next year.  I have some concerns that the letters are only going out.  The Minister said that 11,000 letters had been issued to date.  I am concerned that the Minister said the Department will do all the work.  It will still be up to the individuals to be satisfied that the intended changes have actually been made and applied to them correctly.  If they want to appeal the decision it would be some time down the road before those people might see their payments.</p>  <p>  There were two real anomalies arising from the changes that occurred in 2012 that need to be addressed.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on them.  One relates to the period of time that some people were out of work due to caring and the averaging of contributions by moving to a total contributory system.  The second issue has not been mentioned and it relates to the total number of contributions required to be eligible for consideration in the first instance.  Prior to 2012, it was 260 contributions but in the change in 2012 it went to 520 contributions.  Does the Minister's proposal recognise those people who had 260 contributions?</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will see multiples of that number this week.  A total of 79,000 letters need to be issued prior to Christmas and 70,000 of those are to issue to people who currently live in the State.  That is welcome news but it has been a long time coming.  There are, however, still concerns.  People have asked me what they need to do when they receive the letter.  Do they need to request a review or does that kick in automatically?  People need to be given assurance when the Minister says they do not need to do anything and that the review will automatically kick in.</p>  <p>  There are other concerns with regard to the 20 years for caring duties.  What do people need to do to satisfy that?  I have asked questions this matter a number of occasions.  People might not have the necessary correspondence or proof to satisfy the criteria.  What exactly is the process around that and what do people need to do to satisfy the Department's criteria in that regard?  I would appreciate some clarity on those points.</p></speech>

To answer the Deputies' questions, the letter is quite lengthy and it explains exactly what needs to happen and who needs to do what.  In the main, people will not have to do anything and I will explain why.  I will answer Deputy Curran's questions first.  It is 520 contributions because these people have already qualified for the new pension.  However, they received a reduced rate because of the averaging.</p>  <p>  I will now address the issue of gaps in a person's record.  The balance of the letters will be sent out by the end of this week to all Irish residents, or the beginning of next week at the latest.  As we have their records, we already know that in 65% to 70% of cases people are entitled to an uplift.  We have already done a trawl of our internal systems to identify people who will get an uplift.  They will be told they are getting an uplift, that the review is to be conducted, how much their new payment will be and when it will come into effect.</p>  <p>  There is not a delay.  It could not have been done without legislation being passed and I, along will other Deputies, will attempt to do that, starting tomorrow.  We will automatically be able to tell the majority of people who have a full record on the system what their new entitlement will be.  The people who will need to help us with the conducting of the review are those who have gaps in their contributions.  Some people will be able to tell us the reason for the gaps.  In many cases, it will be due to caring for children and we will already have the children's birth dates and PPS numbers but if we do not have them, we will ask for them.  In other cases, the gaps will be due to people looking after wives, husbands, grandparent, aunts or some other loved one.  It will literally be as easy as giving us the information.  People need to be reassured that there is probably no legal way of proving a gap from 1977.  We are, however, doing this collectively as a Parliament because it is the right thing to do, that is, to look after the people who were adversely affected by the changes in 2012.  We are not going to further punish people by putting them through loads of hoops.  We want to give these people the money they are entitled to.</p></speech>

It might be a bit slow but I take the point that the measure required the legislation.  From the Minister's comments, I take it that a common sense approach will apply to persons who might not be able to supply documentary evidence for periods of missing contributions where they may have been caring for a parent or someone other than a child.  That was my interpretation of what the Minister said she intended.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to see the proposed legislation contains the provision for payments to be backdated to March 2018, which is what the Minister said in her reply.  Unfortunately the legislation does not provide a payment or a commencement date.  This is a matter for the Minister.  I welcome the backdated payment is in the legislation.</p>  <p>  I have one final concern.  As there is a period of up to 20 years allowed in this measure for caring - I acknowledge this is an interim total contributions system - it indicates that it is being viewed over a 40 year working life cycle.  I hope it does not mean this is the policy position in terms of our general pension as we go forward with regard to total contributions proper, rather than the interim measure.</p></speech>

It is a critical one and we will come back to that in other discussions and debates in the near future.  I want a categorical assurance, as do many of the 79,000 people who are entitled to see their money restored to the rate it should be, that those backdated payments will be made in the first quarter of next year.  Can the Minister give a categorical assurance to the people who are entitled to increases that they will get that money backdated in the first quarter of 2019?</p>  <p>  My second point is where the criticism comes in, which is no surprise.</p><p>While there is retrospection up to 2018, many people have been impacted from 2012 up to now and the retrospection should go all the way back.  I am critical of the fact that this is not the case as are organisations such as Age Action and the people who have been impacted since 2012.  That is where the criticism is.  This is a welcome first step but that is all it is.  We need now to have it paid retrospectively to 2012.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="05:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300029#BB00200"><p>Regarding Deputy Curran's question, 2012 does have the conditionality of a 40-year life span but it is because we have the 20 years of caring credits as opposed to what we would have historically had, which was a 30-year working average life span but only ten years of credits.  That does not presuppose that this is what 2020 will look like.  The public consultation has not been finished.  I thank the Deputies who have made submissions to that.  The outcome has not been determined.  What the Deputy certainly cannot expect to have is 30 years and 20 years caring.  If one goes up, the other goes up and if one goes down, the other goes down, which eventually will mean the same result.  I would like to be as flexible as I can with regard to caring credits in the new system.</p><p>I can categorically give Deputy Brady a commitment that the back payments will be made from 30 March 2018 because &euro;55 million is allocated in the budget this year to make sure the money is there for those people.  I cannot give him a commencement date because I do not know how quickly the legislation will pass but, hopefully, it will pass.  A new IT platform is also needed.  We have a new interface screen on <i>mywelfare.ie</i>to interact with people in a much more friendly and interactive way.  The new system will go live in January, I hope, but I cannot tell the Deputy it is going to be the second week in January, just in case.</p></speech>

I am currently considering a small number of amendments, some of which are drafting amendments or just technicalities to be brought forward on Committee Stage.  I will clarify the position during the Second Stage debate.  </p><p>  The Bill delivers on the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulations relating to precarious work.  This is important legislation, the key objective of which is to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours in all sectors of employment.</p><p>Good progress has been made over the past number of years, in the context of our economic recovery, to create new job opportunities, the majority of which are full-time positions.  While this is great, we must remember those people who, not by choice, are in less secure arrangements and may not know from week to week what hours they are working.  This makes it difficult for them to plan their lives outside work.  The Bill will significantly improve the employment protections for all of those people.  I want the Bill to complete its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible in the current session.  If we all work closely together, we will get this out of the Seanad and back into the D&aacute;il and completed before Christmas so that we can deliver for the people who are in those precarious situations this year.</p></speech>

We will all put our backs behind it to make sure it is accelerated and becomes law.  I am aware that the Minister reviewed a number of aspects of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  Has she re-examined the various arguments made in the D&aacute;il by Labour Party Deputies and colleagues in the other parties to deal with if-and-when contracts?  If these rotten arrangements are not dealt with, they will become the weapon of choice for bad employers and that is the worry, even though there are thousands of good employers who work well with their employees.</p>  <p>  There are elements of the proposed legislation that are welcome and many of them were drawn from the proposals of my colleague, Senator Ged Nash, which he put forward to the Government in late 2015.  It seems that for most workers trapped on if-and-when contracts, their work will continue to be treated as casual.  This will deny them access to important provisions because they will not be classified as employees in the first place.  For example, if-and-when workers will not be able to request to be placed on an appropriate band of hours to better reflect the reality of the hours they work, as other workers can.  Has the Minister given any thought to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="05:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300029#BB00900"><p>Yes, we have given it loads of thought.  Each of the main elements of this Bill will improve the employment protections for people on if-and-when contracts.  The banded hours provision, for example, will apply to somebody on such a contract so that if they have worked an average number of hours over the previous 12-month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on the band of hours that reflects the realities of those hours that have been worked.  The amendments to the terms of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 will require employers to inform their employees including those on if-and-when arrangements by the fifth day of commencing employment what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the working day and the working week to be.  Employers will also be required to state the expected duration of their contract and whether that contract is fixed or temporary.  Employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions.  Where they are given notice of hours of work but do not receive those hours, they will have to be given their two hours' compensation in lieu of the work they have not been given.  Finally, employees on if-and-when contracts will also benefit from the anti-penalisation provisions in order that if an employer penalises them for exercising their rights under this Act, they will be entitled to pursue the matter through the WRC.</p></speech>

We in the Labour Party have certainly not changed our policy or views on if-and-when contracts.  My colleague, Senator Ged Nash, will table amendments to the legislation in the Seanad to address this problem.  Particularly, he will propose an amendment providing that where a period of employment has to be calculated, casual work should be included in the calculation if the casual worker was employed on a regular or systematic basis and if during the period of service the worker has a reasonable expectation of ongoing employment by the same employer.  That is important.  The law must have regard to the basic facts of working life such as whether the employee was offered work regularly, whether the employee generally accepted work when it was offered and whether there was a pattern or system to the work offered each week even if the amount of work offered might have varied .  Those are important components and indicia of a situation that should be comprehended and captured within the Bill.  That is the one amendment that I can signal already that Senator Nash will be proposing.</p></speech>

The Senator Nash wants us to ban if-and-when contracts but there are so many industries in this country, government being one of them, that simply could not live without such contracts.  I do not want to make life difficult for industry in carrying on its normal business but we will not tolerate a situation where people who are working on if-and-when contracts do not have the same employment protections as everybody else.  I am prepared to move a bit this way if Labour Party Members are prepared to move a bit that way.  I cannot countenance banning them even if all the Deputies and Senators gang up on me because there would be a significant backlash but perhaps we can try to achieve the same thing, which is to provide protections in law for the people who are currently working in those circumstances.  We might have a win-win situation.</p></speech>

There is a review going on within our Department.  The Deputy will be  aware from conversations we have had here previously that I was not happy with some of the aspects that I discovered when I came to this portfolio, particularly in respect of people who are under threat of domestic violence.  We have made those changes.  That allowed me to stick my nose into this section and say, "Hang on a second, what are we doing here?"  We have conducted a review over the past couple of months but, before finalising what we should do, manners would dictate that we should sit down with the people in the Department of Justice and Equality who have responsibility for this.  I need to question whether we should have a liable relatives division in our Department.  That does not mean it needs to go.  It either needs to be beefed up to do what everybody wants it to do or it needs to become the responsibility of some other Department.  I will not countenance people being disenfranchised because of a condition of application to schemes regarding what they are currently entitled to for the sustainable minimum living standards of themselves and their children.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if details of that review could be circulated to Members.</p> <p> The Minister will be aware of the current set-up regarding child maintenance.  Predominantly, it is the mother who is affected.  If she does not receive a payment, by and large she has to go to the District Court to chase it up.  Yesterday, I spoke to a mother who told me it had cost her &euro;9,000 in legal fees to try to get child maintenance payments.  Does the Minister agree it is wrong that they should have to go to court?  There are so many difficulties there.  People are afraid and feel intimidated going into a court setting.  That needs to be eliminated.</p></speech>

I thank him for sending it and I did read it.  However, the matter does not fall within my remit.  Much as I stick my nose into stuff that is none of my business, this definitely is not my business.  My Department exists to support people.  However, I agree with one thing.  The former partner of the lady who paid &euro;9,000 should be ashamed.  Every parent has a responsibility towards his or her children.  We should not need to bring someone - man or woman - to court to bear that responsibility.  We have a system that does not seem to be working and nobody is really satisfied with it because it infringes on the ability of our Department to give people who are most vulnerable the support they need to have a minimum standard of living.  We need to sit around a table to decide whether we are in or out, whether the Department of Justice and Equality is in or out, or whether we collaboratively do something that actually provides a straightforward mechanism.  Perhaps it could be something like in the United Kingdom with attachment orders against wages or social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  I have discovered that if there is an attachment order against a social welfare payment, we would just have to increase the social welfare of the person, meaning that again the State pays.  We need to tease these things out so that the State does not end up on the hook and taking over the responsibility from errant parents.</p></speech>

I accept that is not necessarily the responsibility of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but that of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have sat down with officials from the Department and they have said it is not on their radar.  It needs to be on their radar and it needs to come from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection with responsibility for lone parents to put the pressure on.  I welcome the meeting later in the month.  That needs to be a core element of the discussion on child maintenance.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility.  Why does she still include child maintenance when assessing means for social welfare payments?  The Minister will be aware that child maintenance is seen as a means of helping lift children out of poverty.  She has responsibility for that.  Does she see it as a payment for the household or as a payment for the child?</p></speech>

I am aware of the UN recommendation.</p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has generous disregards with regard to maintenance.  Income is income into a household.  Why would the State give the same money that is already coming into a household for a child a second time?  The Deputy cannot discount that is there; there certainly is a disregard for it.  The Deputy cannot discount that somebody is bearing the financial responsibility towards their child.  It would be errant for the State to make a payment twice.  We can certainly have a conversation about the Deputy's belief that it should be a higher payment.  That is a different discussion.  However, he cannot discount.  We are talking about ensuring that people are bearing their responsibilities for looking after their own children.  The Deputy wants us to say, "Don't worry about them doing it.  It's grand.  We'll give you extra money anyway."  I do not agree with that.</p></speech>

The announced changes also provide for up to 20 years of home-caring credits in the pension-entitlement calculation, for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p>  <p>  Significant preparatory work was required to design and develop the necessary IT system changes and the necessary legislative provisions to underpin these changes, as published in the Social Welfare Bill last week.</p>  <p>  The most recent data, which became available at the end of October, identified approximately 79,000 pensioners to be reviewed under this new system.  Of these, over 70,000 reside in Ireland.  The first 11,000 information letters issued last week to Irish residents.  I expect the remainder to issue by the end of this week or early next week at the latest.  More than 8,000 pensioners resident outside of Ireland are expected to receive letters in December.</p>  <p>  The letter informs pensioners that my Department will contact them again directly with either the outcome of their individual review, where sufficient information is available to make a decision for them, or to request further information regarding gaps in their social insurance record.  However, it is not necessary for anyone to contact the Department on this matter; we will do the contacting of the recipients.</p>  <p>  Over 60 temporary staff have been recruited to examine the social insurance records of these pensioners.  This phase is expected to continue to the end of the year.  Following further recruitment planned for January 2019, reviews and payments will commence in the first quarter of next year.  It will take my Department a number of months to work through the reviews and the payments.</p>  <p>  Where an increase is awarded, it will be paid immediately and backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person's 66th birthday, if later, and arrears will be paid.  Pensioners who do not qualify for an increase will continue to receive their existing rate of entitlement.</p></speech>

We have discussed this in the House previously.  It is an issue of major concern to the people affected and communicating the information to them properly is key.  Those letters as they arrive this week and next week will be very much welcomed.  I ask the Minister to confirm if the 79,000 covers everybody who is in receipt of a post-2012 pension?</p>  <p>  I am sure this project is a logistical nightmare.  How many staff are working on these reviews?  Does the Minister hope to be able to gather all the information from the time spent caring from the Department's records or does she envisage the Department will need to go back?  Will the pensioners be given the opportunity or be expected to provide information themselves?  I know the Minister has said that initially the Department does not need that information back.  What happens in the case where somebody does not get a letter?  Do they have a means to be able to contact the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to inform it that they believe they should have got a letter?</p></speech>

We have identified them because they are receiving less than 100% of a pension since the changes were made in 2012.  The first 11,000 information letters issued last week and the remainder will issue this week or next week at the latest.  People do not need to do anything for us because in the main we can already from our records whether they are entitled to an increase.  For the vast majority of people, probably between 65% and 70% of the people who are due to get letters, we will know between now and Christmas whether they are entitled to an increase because of the records already in situ.</p><p>We will be inviting those people who have gaps to log onto <i>mywelfare.ie</i>to fill in those gaps for us.  For example, a lady may have taken out ten years in the 1970s or 1980s to look after her children, but we may not have a record of her children.  There are many reasons why people might have been out of the system caring.  Heretofore it would only have been looking after children.  This particular caring credit could relate to an elderly relative, for example a parent, an uncle or an aunt.</p><p>Where there are gaps in our records, we will invite people to fill in the gaps and then we will conduct the review.  Anybody who is due the increase will get the increase backdated in quarter one next year.  Anybody who is not due an increase will remain on the payment they are on.</p></speech>

I am also mindful of the fact that when this is reported in the media, females are probably discussed but between 25% and 30% of those affected are male, many of whom left the country in the 1980s to work in England when there was no employment here.  They sent pay packets home but had that break in contributions.  They are as badly affected.  At the end of the process, if somebody feels they were entitled to an increase but the Department has adjudicated they are not, will there be an appeals mechanism or will there be some way for them to argue that point?</p></speech>

If there is a reciprocal arrangement between the country the person went to work in and Ireland, he or she can arrange for his or her credits to be included on his or her record.  The gaps can only be filled in this system by caring credits.  People who went to work, say, in London will not be able to come home and say they were missing.  They have to how who they were caring for and the period of time they were caring.  They can give us that information on a bona fides basis.  There are some people who will not be able to prove that in 1974 they were doing something but we will accept their bona fides.  As with everything, there is an appeals process.  If a person does not feel we have been satisfied about the gaps in their records, they can sit down with us.  I hope that during the review process over the next couple of months and through the interactive website we have established, <i>mywelfare.ie</i>, they will be able to provide us with all of the information and we will go and check it out.  If there are any anomalies, we will talk to people.  The ultimate aim of the Parliament was to recognise there were people who were getting less of a pension than they should have as a result of the rate changes made in 2012.  We want to rectify it from 30 March next year which is what we will do.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the social security arrangements between the UK and the EU 27 have not changed.  The future operation of arrangements will be determined as part of the complex process of negotiating the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  My key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.</p><p>The maintenance of the common travel area arrangements is one of the Government&rsquo;s four Brexit priorities.  The importance of maintaining the common travel area was acknowledged in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of 29 March 2017, which triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the joint EU-UK progress report agreed at the European Council on 15 December 2017 and the protocol to the draft withdrawal agreement published by the Commission on 28 February 2018.  It has also been acknowledged in the technical paper issued by the UK Government on 13 September 2018.</p><p>I met the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Right Honourable Esther McVey, on Monday 23 April 2018, along with all of her officials.  I emphasised my objective of ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the common travel area, are safeguarded and maintained.  I am happy that we have a broad agreement to preserve the <i>status quo</i>in that regard.</p><p>I have a dedicated team in my Department which is conducting a deep analysis of scenarios on a scheme-by-scheme basis and contingency planning is ongoing for all outcomes, including a no-deal or worst-case outcome, which hopefully we will not require.</p></speech>

It also stated the common travel area is not underpinned by a single legal agreement but by a hotchpotch of laws.  Does the Minister agree the common travel area would benefit from greater legal certainty?  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure greater legal certainty is provided?

They have been working for almost a year on each individual scheme that has reciprocal rights between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to ascertain what exactly we need to do to maintain those reciprocal arrangements.  I read the report with interest and was curious as to why it came out this morning but that is the nature of it.  It stated that we require greater legal certainty regarding the articulation of the common travel area.  It is untrue to say it does not exist in legislation.  It exists in much legislation.  It would be more ideal if it existed in just one Act.  We will need to move to put some sort of an agreement together.  That is what is being worked on.  I suggest it will be finalised long before 29 March but I will keep the Deputy posted and let him know.</p></speech>

There are long-standing relationships between the people of Ireland and the people of the UK.  We share common ground in tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of human capital.  We will ensure the reciprocal arrangements that exist between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, particularly on child benefit and all the social insurance and assistance schemes we have are enshrined into the future.  Until it is done, it is not done so I cannot give the Deputy much more information until it is complete, other than our ambition.</p></speech>

I do not think we have ever reached this number of questions.  </p>  <p>  In line with EU and OECD jurisdictions, reduced rates for young jobseekers were introduced from 2009 on a phased basis to tackle high youth unemployment.  These measures guard against the development of long-term welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme, he or she receives the maximum rate of jobseeker's allowance of &euro;198.  </p>  <p>  Age-related reduced rates do not apply to jobseekers with a qualified child, those transferring directly to jobseekers allowance from disability allowance and 18 to 24 year olds who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency during the 12 months before they reached 18 years of age. </p>  <p>  The youth employment support scheme, which I launched in September, is a work experience scheme for long-term unemployed jobseekers aged 18 to 24 or who face significant and particular employment barriers.  Participants will receive a minimum of &euro;229.20 per week or a weekly top-up of &euro;22.50 if they have dependants.  </p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment numbers on our live register, which is exceptionally welcome.  For example, the most recent data show that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to just under 12% in October 2018.  There has been a significant drop in the number of Irish youths who are unemployed.</p><p>Irish youth unemployment, which was at 23% in 2012, has fallen well below the EU average of 14.9%.</p></speech>

There was a time before 2009 when, on turning 18, claimants were paid a rate of social welfare, namely, jobseeker's allowance, that was equivalent to what everybody else got.  That was changed, initially in 2009 by a Government which was led by Fianna F&aacute;il and of which I remember being a member.  I remember well the arguments to and fro and the rationale that was advanced, but it did not achieve what was forecast.  While in other countries, such as the UK, there was a differential between people of different ages, I do not think that the objectives were achieved, insofar as I can recall them being outlined during the debate around the Cabinet table.  Circumstances have since changed dramatically.  What is the rationale for maintaining this distinction?</p></speech>

We do not want our young people aged between 18 and 24 to be sitting at home watching "Judge Judy".  Rather, we want them in education, training or employment opportunities, which is exactly what this measure has achieved.  Anybody who is at home on a reduced rate, aside from the people I described who have dependent children, have every opportunity to earn either &euro;198 per week by entertaining employment, training or education opportunities, or by going on the recently launched youth employment support scheme, which will, I hope, give them long-term attachment to a workforce and a long-term job.</p></speech>

Is cinnte go bhfuil d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nach bhfuil an tAire Sl&aacute;inte i l&aacute;thair, ach leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Catherine Byrne.</p>  <p>  We all know the considerable work that goes on in our hospitals, for which the staff must be acknowledged.  We know there are many difficulties with getting into the system because there is ample evidence of the waiting lists.  There was always the feeling, however, that once one entered the Irish system, the treatment and care were excellent.  While that continues to be the case, there are growing exceptions.  Patients are in the system, but the understaffing and workload are so significant that it has a detrimental effect on the mental and physical health of both the staff and patients.  The working environment, therefore, is not as it should be.  Although I am speaking about the Mater Hospital, in particular, it applies to other hospitals also.</p>  <p>  On St. Vincent's ward, which is an oncology and haemotology ward at the Mater Hospital, the patients are very unwell and they need extensive nursing and medical input.  Consequently, the ratio of patient to nurse was historically 4:1.  Nowadays, the standard is 6:1, but there are many days when there is one staff nurse for 12 patients, with a student nurse from 1st, 2nd or 3rd year on the ward also.  It is difficult, therefore, to give the patients the care they need.  For that ward to have the staff it needs to provide that care, there should be six staff nurses and two managers daily.  In recent times, however, there have been four members of staff and one manager.</p>  <p>  The patients on the ward are there for chemotherapy or complications relating thereto.  They must experience a safe, effective delivery of chemotherapy and support with follow-up monitoring, which needs two nurses who are qualified and trained in safe chemotherapy administration practice on the ward at all times, according to the ward's policy and guidelines.  In the past two weeks, it was lucky to have one qualified chemotherapy-trained nurse, leading to inexperienced nurses administering chemotherapy or vital chemotherapy being delayed.  There has been some improvement in the numbers following meetings with the Workplace Relations Commission, the director of nursing and the union, but the issues leading to those problems are not being adequately addressed.  Rather, there is high staff turnover because of the stress involved in working on a ward with very ill patients who do not receive the recommended care from qualified staff.</p>  <p>  Experience counts for so much, which newly qualified and overseas nurses who do not have experience of Irish hospitals may lack.  Newly qualified nurses need the guidance of qualified staff in order that they will become experienced staff in time.  Nurses who are trained abroad are entering a system with which they are not familiar.  I am not undermining or demeaning in any way the newly qualified or immigrant nurses, but they need to be guided by the experienced staff in Ireland in order that there is a mix of skills.</p>  <p>  Nurses are under a great deal of stress.  On a recent Sunday, three nurses were on sick leave, two of whom were trained in safe chemotherapy administration, which left on the ward two nurses who had been qualified less than two years previously and who were not qualified to administer chemotherapy.  That is not acceptable for patients or nurses.</p>  <p>  It is disturbing that the information I present today is in a context of excellent facilities and treatment for cancer.  So many advances have been made and we know so much more about cancers and their treatment.  It was disappointing and alarming, therefore, to hear about the staff issues.  I know it is not confined to the Mater Hospital because I have information about other hospitals also.</p></speech>

Due to a combination of resignation, sick leave and maternity leave, there were several vacancies.  The Minister was assured by the HSE that all avenues have been and are being explored to address the lack of oncology nurses.  As a result of these efforts, one nurse commenced induction yesterday and another will commence induction in December, after which all staff nurse vacancies will be filled.</p>  <p>  The Mater Hospital is working with the clinicians and nursing staff to reduce the impact on service delivery through redeployment of appropriately trained staff and the provision of additional raining.  The national cancer control programme has also supported the Mater Hospital in resourcing an additional oncologist who has been appointed and will commence in the new year.  The hospital continues to work closely with the Ireland East Hospital Group in conducting a review of its operational capacity as demand for oncology day services continues to rise.</p>  <p>  More generally, there are recruitment and retention difficulties in certain other areas of the health service, including nursing specialties.  In these instances, the HSE utilises a range of long-term measures such as overseas recruitment with agencies, rolling recruitment campaigns, recruitment fairs, social media recruitment campaigns and short-term measures such as staff reassignment to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  The HSE also continues to offer contracts to graduate nurses and midwives once they have obtained their registration from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI.  The Minister believes the recent pay proposals put forward by the Public Service Pay Commission were a positive step towards making the public health service a more attractive place to work for nurses and midwives.  The Government proposals made to address the issue of new entrants' pay will also benefit approximately 10,000 nurses to the value of approximately &euro;3,000 each.  The recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been a consistent priority for the Minister.  Challenges exist with recruitment and retention of these professions against a backdrop of shortages at a global level.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges, the data show that the HSE has managed to increase the number of nurses and midwives employed.  When the number of nurses and midwives employed by the HSE is compared between September this year and last year, it shows that there was an increase of 1,050 whole-time equivalents.</p></speech>

I see there has been some progress.  I had heard that some nurses came into work while unwell rather than let down their patients and fellow staff but that is not good safe practice, especially considering the immune systems of people who have cancer.</p>  <p>  We know that nurses are a very skilled workforce, they have degrees in science, some have Masters degrees and other qualifications, and they have done a great deal of work and study to become registered.  They want to deliver the service for which they have been trained and give the best care to their patients.  For cancer patients, it is about giving them every chance to recover and live their lives.</p>  <p>  I know St. James's Hospital and the pressures on their services well.  I know from someone who is currently receiving treatment there that it begins at 8 a.m. and the nurses see dozens of patients daily.  The first tranche is at 8 a.m. and the next is at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.  Not all of these people are receiving chemotherapy, some are getting injections or hormone infusions and blood.  There are 12 beds in the ward, and as soon as the treatment of one patient is finished, the next is called.  The nurses and doctors are run off their feet from 7.30 a.m. until late at night.  It can be after 8 p.m. before they finish.  I am sure that like me, the Minister of State has had family and friends with cancer who have gone through our system, facing the illness.  The treatment and the effects that go with it are very difficult but we have good success and recovery rates.  Cancer is not the death sentence it once was.  However, we need the qualified and the experienced nursing staff to work alongside the newly qualified because the experienced staff can bring their new colleagues along.</p>  <p>  We know that the problem is the overall pay and conditions, with the cost of living including housing that has resulted in our very well-trained nurses travelling to other countries.  It is those countries which benefit from the education and training provided here and it is the patients who suffer in the meantime.</p>  <p>  I have the reply and there are issues which I will have to follow up with the Minister.</p></speech>

I want to impress on Deputy O'Sullivan and others in the Chamber that both the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I believe that those working in the services in hospitals across Dublin do a fantastic job.  Sometimes they find themselves pushed and can work under a great deal of pressure with several cases at once, particularly in units as important as oncology day wards.  Living very close to St. James's Hospital, I understand the situation there.</p>  <p>  The Minister wants to assure Deputy O'Sullivan that he will continue to monitor what is happening in the Mater Hospital and will work to address recruitment issues in the short and long term and carry out measures which will improve the situation as we go into next year.  I assure the Deputy that the HSE recognises the need to focus on recruitment and retention of front-line staff and is committed to making a public health service a more attractive place to work.  I understand Deputy O'Sullivan's frustration, it is something that I am contacted about daily in my own office, and I will continue to raise it with the Minister on the Deputy's behalf.</p></speech>

They want to know why the new ambulance service which was based in Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim has been moved to Boyle in County Roscommon.  They want to know when the new measures which were promised by the HSE about new personnel, ambulances and first responder schemes will be put in place in Leitrim as advised in the 2015 capacity review of the national ambulance service.</p>  <p>  As an elected representative for the County Leitrim area of the constituency, I also want to understand the problems and to help to identify what has gone wrong with ambulance waiting times in the county.  I want to know what is being done by the HSE management to try to improve response times in the county and when the national ambulance service will be returned to its new base in Carrick-on-Shannon to cover the southern part of the county.</p>  <p>  There is much concern on the ground about this as there have been several shocking cases where people have been left waiting for hours for an ambulance.  In January this year in Ballinamore, a woman aged 85 years who had fallen and broken her leg had to endure a two and a half hour wait for an ambulance.  In June, another elderly lady in Ballinamore had to wait for almost five hours.  An ambulance was first called at 2.50 p.m. but did not arrive at her home in south Leitrim until almost 7 p.m.  The woman was eventually brought to Cavan hospital which is only a 40 minute drive from her home, and had surgery a few hours later.</p>  <p>  These are shocking examples of what is going on across the county under the current service.  I have done some research on the issue and have been advised in a written parliamentary question, according to the assistant chief ambulance officer, Mr. Oliver Reilly, that County Leitrim only ever had two ambulance rosters on duty, one during the day and a night shift.  One is based in Manorhamilton while another was set to be based in Carrick-on-Shannon but, as I noted earlier, is now based in Boyle in County Roscommon where it will remain for the foreseeable future.  It is alarming that only one ambulance is ever on call in the whole county.  In effect, one ambulance is often not available as under the current system, ambulances must often attend emergencies in other rural parts of the county.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe this is sufficient ambulance cover for a widespread rural area in which few community first responder units have yet been established?  If not, will he agree to make the HSE acutely aware of local communities' concerns on this issue and will the Department of Health make representations to the HSE as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="06:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300033#FF00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on behalf of Minister Harris regarding the ambulance service in Leitrim.  The national ambulance service operates from two locations in Leitrim, namely Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton.  However, services in Leitrim are not exclusively provided by staff based at these Leitrim stations.  This is because the national ambulance service is increasingly moving to a policy of dynamic deployment.  This ensures that vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than located at a particular station.  In line with this policy, and using the advanced medical priority dispatch system to triage calls, Leitrim is supported by other national ambulance service ambulance bases in Boyle, Sligo, Loughglynn, Cavan, Roscommon and Longford.  Several developments have been made by the national ambulance service in order to address the issue of response times and ambulance cover in Leitrim.</p>  <p>  I know too that in Border counties the national ambulance service works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order to provide a more responsive service for patients.</p>  <p>  The capacity review, published in 2016, identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas such as Leitrim.  The capacity review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responder, CFR, schemes.  The national ambulance service continues to work with local CFR groups across the region to enhance services.</p>  <p>  The national ambulance service has undergone a very significant process of modernisation in recent years and there have been important service innovations and developments.  This ambulance reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services, which was published in late 2014, and the national ambulance service capacity review.</p>  <p>  The National Emergency Operations Centre has been established, where emergency calls are received and emergency resources are dispatched.  The national ambulance service has visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.  In addition, the national ambulance service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, which frees up emergency ambulances for the more urgent calls.</p><p>A permanent emergency aeromedical support service has also been established to provide a more timely response to persons in rural communities.</p> <p> During recent years additional investment has been directed towards the national ambulance service.  This year, an additional sum of &euro;10.7 million has been made available, which includes &euro;2.75 million to fund new developments.  New developments include the development of alternative pathways to care with the Hear and Treat clinical hub that went live in the national emergency operations centre in March of this year.  This diverts some lower acuity patients to alternative care pathways and frees up some emergency capacity.  It is anticipated that such initiatives will help to improve response times around the country, including in the Leitrim area.  I will come back to the Deputy on other issues he raised.</p></speech>

A capacity review into the national ambulance service was conducted in 2015 and its findings were released in 2016.  It found that in order for the service to meet strict HIQA standards, additional staff needed to be hired.  Can the Minister of State identify the Government's efforts in that regard and indicate the progress that has been made to date in providing new staff and ambulances for the service? I note the capacity review outlined the case for working with community first responders in rural areas in County Leitrim.  They are generally the local GPs who are under considerable pressure, working in large rural areas on their own and they have very busy surgeries without adequate back-up and support.  What efforts are in hand to improve matters?</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to come to Leitrim to meet the local doctors to hear at first hand their genuine fears for their patients, namely, the prospect that they face the worst outcome as a result of longer than acceptable response times.</p>  <p>  As per the commitment given by the national ambulance service, will she agree to facilitate a meeting with the management of the north west ambulance service to enable its members to outline their efforts to increase resources in the area, place more than just one ambulance in the new base in Carrick-on-Shannon to serve the people of south Leitrim and west Cavan and reduce waiting times to under one hour?</p>  <p>  I have been advised this evening that the Boyle ambulance crew has filed a health and safety complaint regarding the deployment of the second ambulance from Carrick-on-Shannon to their base, thus prompting serious concern that only one crew from Carrick-on-Shannon will be moved and that the crew currently based there will be moved to Sligo, leaving no ambulance service for Leitrim in the county.  That would be regrettable and it is a matter of great concern to me as Deputy representing the county.  While the Minister of State is responding to the requests I have made, it is vital that these facts be brought to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

I will raise those with the Minister and, if the Deputy wishes, I will also ask the Minister if he will consider meeting him and visiting the area to enable him to fully recognise and understand the problems that have occurred in the past as the Deputy outlined.

As a result, they are entitled to fewer benefits such as sick pay, overtime, increments, pension contributions, maternity leave and holiday pay.</p><p>Department officials attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection last week to discuss the issue of bogus self-employment.  I was dismayed to learn the Department does not keep any records on bogus self-employment, despite carrying out inspections to supposedly identify it.  Despite keeping no records of cases of bogus self-employment, the Department believes from some reports it cites that the issue of bogus self-employment is not significant or prevalent in the State.  That is in stark contrast to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, which has estimated that over an eight-year period the State may have missed out on &euro;640 million in unpaid PRSI due to bogus self-employment in the construction industry alone.</p><p>  The newly-formed Connect trade union, which represents 40,000 craft workers, has estimated the practice is costing the State &euro;300 million a year.  Bogus self-employment is prevalent not only in the construction industry but in other sectors.</p><p>  The Eversheds Sutherland report highlights significant difficulties and inconsistencies in employment practices at RT&Eacute;.  The Unite union has highlighted the problem faced by workers in the English language teaching sector.  I understand there may be some employees - or they are not employees in the correct sense, - in this establishment who are suffering from bogus self-employment practice.  The Minister needs to investigate that and come back to us on it.</p><p>  With the increase in the prevalence of fast food, delivery services are becoming a major issue in this regard.  Does the Minister have any intention of introducing measures to combat this problem, which is costing the State significantly in lost tax revenue and leaving thousands of workers vulnerable in their employment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-13a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="06:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111300034#GG00700"><p>The practice of bogus self-employment and employers forcing workers on to self-employed contracts when they should be employees is, unfortunately, on the increase.  According to the Connect trade union, which organises more than 40,000 tradespeople, it is now rampant in the construction industry.  We also see it in the media and film industries, particularly in RT&Eacute;, and in many other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions calculates that the loss to the Exchequer is approximately &euro;80 million per year and amounts to &euro;680 million since 2007.  With all this in mind, it is baffling that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection keeps no records in cases of bogus self-employment, despite carrying out inspections to apparently identify the problem.  The Department cites that in 2017 it carried out 2,698 employer reviews with savings of &euro;2.27 million recorded, which we welcome, but it could not tell the joint committee the number of these reviews which resulted in bogus-self employment being identified.  We have a bizarre situation where inspections are being carried out, yet no data are being kept on the level of bogus self-employment found.  That begs the question as to why the Department would even bother carrying out the inspections in the first place.  Despite keeping no records of bogus self-employment, the Department believes in some reports it cites that bogus self-employment is not significant or prevalent.  This shows a very lax attitude on behalf of the Department to the issue of bogus self-employment and no real intention of tackling it.  While on the one hand the Department is happy to put pressure on ordinary citizens to recoup money where it makes a mistake and an overpayment is made, and the Government was happy to roll out a campaign on so-called welfare cheats which itself turned out to be bogus, it does not show the same urgency when it comes to employers using this practice.</p>  <p>  The Government has said time and again that this is not an issue, yet it is not collecting the data to demonstrate how serious an issue this is.  That is a failing on behalf of the Government and I want to know how that will be rectified.</p></speech>

If any Deputy is aware of any particular cases, the Minister strongly urges them to bring these to attention of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure they can be investigated.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s scope section makes in excess of 1,000 employment status determinations each year covering a range of issues including directors of companies, family employments, partnerships and public sector employments.  The number of cases involving a direct conflict of employment or self-employment status is relatively small.  In 2017, the scope section made 138 decisions resulting in a class A employment decision.  Of these, 35 could be described as disputed employment/self-employment cases.  In the current year, the section has made 113 decisions resulting in a class A employment decision of which 27 could be described as disputed employment/self-employment cases.</p>  <p>  Following a scope section decision, the employer will be liable for class A PRSI for the full period of employment.  This can be a significant penalty for a business.  Most employers co-operate fully with the Department&rsquo;s inspectors in insuring compliance following a scope decision.  Where they fail to comply, additional measures, including prosecution, can be brought to bear.  Cases referred to the Department&rsquo;s central prosecution service, CPS, for consideration of prosecution are examined using the principles established by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.</p>  <p>  Employer-specific social welfare offences have been considered by the courts as being of a technical nature in that they relate to a failure to keep and maintain prescribed records and remit PRSI.  If, during the proceedings, the employer remits the PRSI or provides the records that were requested, the case is commonly withdrawn or struck out.  The Department will generally only pursue a case where the employer refuses to comply.</p>  <p>  The Department carried out a media campaign on false self-employment in May 2018 to ensure better public awareness of the important service the Department provides in determining employment status, as well as to help develop a better understanding of the scale and nature of false self-employment.  The scope section received 50 calls and 30 emails during the campaign from individuals who had become aware of the service directly as a result of the advertisement campaign.  Up to 15 scope section investigations were created as a direct result of the media campaign.</p>  <p>  Given the relatively low number of formal requests for determinations, there may be some reluctance by individuals to seek a scope section determination due to concerns over how an employer will react.  This suggests that the most appropriate way to address the issue will be through inspection.  Anti-victimisation measures may be required to provide assurance to workers that they cannot be victimised if they raise legitimate concerns regarding their employment status.</p>  <p>  Although the response was low, the response to the campaign will inform the inspection work of the Department, Revenue and the WRC, including in sectors other than construction.  The Department has intensified its employer inspection activity since the campaign.  A separate series of investigations took place in the west focused on the construction sector.  Two further projects with a particular emphasis on identifying false self-employment are planned for the Dublin north and mid-west divisions.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to identify hard data on false self-employment without individuals coming forward for investigation and decision.  While there are some cases of false self-employment in particular sectors, this has not translated into any increase in overall levels of self-employment as might be expected if there was a growing problem.  The self-employed continue to make up just over 15% of total employment.  This is in line with the average rate of self-employment in the EU and has not increased in the past 16 years.</p></speech>

However, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has not grasped the scale of the problem with bogus self-employment.  We all meet people in our constituency offices who believed they were on different contracts but found out that they were not employees but self-employed.  This, in turn, caused problems when they retired or needed to access social services.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State forward our concerns to the Minister?  Will the Minister introduce legislation to outlaw this practice?  If not, why not?  It has been done in other jurisdictions.  For example, in Australia, the Fair Work Act 2009 protects genuine employees from sham independent contracting arrangements and outlines an employer&rsquo;s obligations in establishing an employment relationship.  In addition, the Prohibition of Bogus Self-Employment Bill 2018 has been introduced in this House.</p>  <p>  As a result of the evidence provided to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection last week, will the Minister make the necessary changes to ensure inspection records are kept in order that evidence can be gathered to establish how widespread the practice is?  Bogus self-employment needs to be addressed immediately to ensure workers have their full employment rights and the State does not lose out on millions of euro in lost revenue and PRSI.  The Minister needs to act on this issue.</p></speech>

The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 is currently going through the Oireachtas and it addresses several workers&rsquo; rights issues, including prohibiting zero-hour contracts in most circumstances and requiring the terms of employment to be produced by an employer within five days, a new minimum payment for employees called in to work but sent home again without work, a new right for employees whose contract of employment does not reflect the reality of the hours they habitually work, and for employees to be entitled to be placed in a band of hours that better reflect the hours they have worked over a reference period, as well as strong anti-penalisation provisions for employees.</p>  <p>  The Minister welcomes the broad support for the Bill, which aims to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  It particularly focuses on low-paid or vulnerable workers.</p>  <p>  I am aware of people attending my constituency office with these issues.  I go directly to the Department about these cases.  I urge the Deputies to bring these matters to attention of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as well as writing to the Minister about them.</p></speech>

Several issues have arisen, however, in how the State's procurement process has been implemented.  Ireland is a small open economy and has vulnerabilities that other European countries do not have.  The size and scale of our economy has put Irish contractors at a distinct disadvantage in the process.</p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that a product supplied by a company, which was successful in winning the tender to supply the Garda training college in Templemore, County Tipperary, does not match the normal standards for food labelling.  The contract was won at the expense of a local producer who had supplied the college for many years.  The product in question is a roasted coffee product.  The following issues have been presented to me which are of serious concern.</p>  <p>  The product is branded to suggest that it is from a company registered in Ireland.  However, there is no such company registered in Ireland, despite the packaging implying so.  The packaging implies that the product is roasted in a specific town in Ireland.  I can emphatically state that there is no coffee roasterie in that town.  There is a minimum of three different types of coffee making up this product but the packaging does not state this.  There is no labelling as to the origin of these coffees.  A high percentage of the coffee from the sample pack tested was damaged, under-roasted and of low quality and consistency.  A list of ingredients is not labelled on the sample pack examined.  This is one product from one supplier.  I am offering the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, evidence that normal standards of food labelling and safety have not been adhered to.</p><p>This raises serious concern about the effectiveness of the State's procurement process and demands that the particular incident be properly investigated.  On this evidence alone, it is clear the process is completely unable to guarantee the same standard of food which local companies supplied for generations.</p> <p> I have raised this issue on at least four occasions over the past two years and it is now a matter of urgency that we see real change in the national procurement process.  No account is made in the tendering process for the local supplier with generations of experience in the supply of quality, safe foods to the public sector.  I can also quote a furniture company, an office stationery company and a building company in my home town of Thurles which have been frozen out from supplying the public sector.  They offer well-paid sustainable jobs in our communities and can match price and service, yet the Government says "No thanks".  The Government believes some big international supplier can do better than our indigenous companies but it is wrong.  These big international suppliers cannot do it better than our own local Irish suppliers.  In this case, the big international companies are supplying a substandard product with very questionable labelling.  I remind the Minister of State that this is a food product that we are talking about.  In this case alone, the State's procurement process has got it terribly wrong.  No one can be expected to believe this is an isolated incident.  With the hundreds of thousands of products being supplied to the public sector daily, there is every chance that this is not the only low-quality product being provided.  I argue that the business model of these international suppliers involves replacing quality products with cheaper substitutes to secure contracts.  The Government is being penny-wise and pound-foolish.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State formally today to begin a root and branch review of the process and to put at its heart quality of product and service throughout the tender process.  I ask the Government to show some support for our local companies and to stop hiding behind EU regulations.  For once, let us support Irish jobs in Irish companies.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for carrying on and managing the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister has no direct role in the management of the finances of the Garda College in Templemore.  It is important to note that the Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and that expenditure in relation to the Garda College and the procurement procedures operated at the college are primarily his responsibility.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal audit report on financial procedures in the Garda College, which was completed in February 2017, raised serious issues in relation to governance and accountability in the college.  Oversight of the implementation of the recommendations of that report was referred to the Policing Authority by the Minister's predecessor in March 2017.</p>  <p>  One of issues of concern highlighted by the report was that the manner in which goods and services for the college were procured was not in accordance with public procurement legislation.  The Commissioner accepted the findings set out in the report and put in place arrangements to ensure that its recommendations were implemented.  The Commissioner has advised that, upon a request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Government Procurement issued a request for tenders on 16 November 2017 via the eTenders procurement portal to establish a single supplier framework for the provision of goods to the college.  To encourage small businesses to bid for this contract, the competition was divided into 13 product lots.  The Minister is further informed that the request for tender for the food contracts for the Garda College restaurant clearly outlined that all labelling of the goods must comply with national and European food labelling requirements.  The tender also included requirements in relation to HACCP and food safety compliance.  The Minister is advised that the procurement process is complete and that contracts have been awarded to the successful tenderers.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has assessed the action taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the recommendation in the audit report dealing with procurement at the Garda College and has deemed it completed.  The Garda Commissioner has advised that the principal administrator at the college continues to ensure that the procurement of all goods and services is in line with public procurement procedures.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that small local companies are being frozen out.  Templemore is just one example of what is, unfortunately, happening in the vast majority of tendering processes nationally.  I can set out other examples besides the issue with the quality of the coffee which I cited in my opening statement.  The quality of products being sourced is not up to the standard that obtained previously in the depot.  There were 14 or 15 local companies supplying products to the depot previously and they provided valuable local employment which was essential to the local economy.  All bar one lost out in this procurement process, however.</p>  <p>  I have seen the tender process that was forced on these small companies.  It was not possible for small companies to do what the procurement process demanded.  It was extremely expensive and required the expenditure of a great deal of money in a lot of cases.  Questions were also asked of suppliers which it was unreasonable to expect them to respond to.  No small company could deal with them.  One example relates to a local fruit company which had been supplying the depot for over 30 years and was asked what it would do in the event of a storm and about its capacity to source product.  During the storm event which took place a couple of months ago, however, it was ironic to find the depot having to turn back to local suppliers to source supplies for the students and employees of the college.  The procurement process which has been put in place renders it impossible for small local companies to win contracts.</p>  <p>  I make the following point forcefully to the Minister of State.  We now have proof that the product being supplied to one particular State institution is of an inferior quality by comparison to what was supplied previously.  I am sure the same will apply elsewhere.  This warrants investigation and I ask that one takes place.</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the obligation on the Commissioner to ensure that best practice under public procurement legislation is followed in the sourcing of goods and services at the Garda College.  However, the points the Deputy makes in his contribution and the concerns he raises are serious and an investigation is merited.  I will therefore ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to investigate this matter.</p></speech>
