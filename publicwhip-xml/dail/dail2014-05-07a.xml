The Chief of Staff who is head of Defence Forces headquarters is my principal military adviser, while the Secretary General of the Department of Defence is my principal defence policy adviser.  Military command is vested directly in the general officers commanding Army brigades, the Defence Forces training centre, the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service.  However, for matters relating to the overall management of the Defence Forces, including organisation of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff is the appropriate source of military advice.  The decision to undertake a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces within a two brigade structure was progressed within this well established overall management framework.</p><p>  Following my decision to initiate a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing the consolidation of three under-strength Army brigades into two full strength brigades, I tasked the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff with developing detailed proposals for my consideration.  A joint civil-military group was established to progress this work and I understand there was broad consultation within the military organisation in this regard.  This shaped the final proposals.  In addition, the strategic management committee provided a forum for discussing the work of the group.  </p><p>  Final proposals for the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force, agreed between the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General, were forwarded for my consideration in July 2012 and I accepted them in full.  I also accepted further proposals for the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force following the completion of a value for money review in November 2012.</p><p>I am satisfied that the reorganisation has maintained the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to the greatest extent possible within the available resource envelope.  It has allowed the Permanent Defence Force to continue to fulfil all roles assigned to it.  This remains a key focus and I will continue to work closely with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General in that regard.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, I put it to the Minister that it indicates a weakness in the process he applied that there was no consultation or formal study of the personnel, intelligence, operational, logistical and deployment implications for the Department and the brigades and that no consultation took place with the brigade commanders.  I accept the Minister's point that with a force of just 9,500, a three brigade structure is not ideal, but it would not have resulted in any reduction in operational outputs in the training or deployment capacity of the Defence Forces.  However, real problems have emerged as a result of the decision the Minister took, a decision he took unilaterally in advance of the Green Paper and White Paper process.  It appears that he took the decision without either he or the then Chief of Staff having any engagement with the relevant commanders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700004#B00300"><p>I am not aware of the problems the Deputy has said have emerged.  If there are particular problems he wishes to bring to my attention, I will ensure they are addressed.  As he knows, a three brigade Army structure was adopted in the 1990s when the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was set at approximately 11,500 personnel.  This structure was retained when the White Paper on Defence in 2000 revised the ceiling to 10,500 personnel.  However, it was no longer viable to retain a three brigade structure with a ceiling of 9,500 personnel, the approximate strength of the Defence Forces when I became Minister for Defence.  The Defence Forces were heading towards a position where, if we had not received additional financial allocations, the numbers would have dipped below 8,000 within 18 to 24 months.  At a level of 9,500 which we set as the objective strength of the Permanent Defence Force, there was too great an imbalance between the administrative support and operational elements within the three brigade structure.  This made the retention of a three brigade structure completely non-viable, as opposed to the viable two brigade structure we now have in place.</p></speech>

I put it to him that to suggest operational oversight of Permanent Defence Force and Reserve units in County Donegal can be managed effectively from Rathmines is not credible.  I would go so far as to say it indicates a level of recklessness in terms of State security.  It is equally not credible to suggest units in Galway can be overseen from Cork.  These are just two of the problems that can be identified.  We engaged with the Minister here and had discussions on previous parliamentary questions about other operational difficulties faced by members of the Defence Forces as a result of the decisions taken by him.</p></speech>

The architecture the Deputy's colleagues had in place while in government was based on a strength of 11,500 for a three brigade structure.  When I entered government and assumed the position of Minister for Defence, there was a strength of 9,500.  Therefore, if we are talking about architecture, many of the rooms in that house were empty and did not allow for the flexibility the Deputy suggests.  If there was an emergency, we could not suddenly find an extra 2,000 members for the Defence Forces overnight.  On the basis of the financial envelope I had inherited from my predecessor, I could not have recruited members to the Defence Forces in 2012 and 2013, as we did.  While no study has been completed, I can tell the Deputy from my experience and engagement with officers and enlisted personnel, both at home and on overseas missions, that I am satisfied the organisational changes in the Permanent Defence Force have brought positive improvements in the deployability of personnel and the sustainability of the force.</p></speech>

This led to the formation of the office.  Recently there has been some controversy because the Minister has made the position a part-time one and appointed to it a person who served in the Defence Forces rather than an outsider.  Will the Minister provide an assurance for potential whistleblowers in the Defence Forces in the future?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700004#B00900"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the programme for Government made a clear commitment to the introduction of whistleblower protection legislation.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, published the Protected Disclosures Bill in July 2013.  It is anticipated that the legislation will be enacted during this D&aacute;il term.  The Bill has as its main objective the protection of workers against reprisals in circumstances where they make a disclosure of information relating to wrongdoing in the workplace.  It will have application in all sectors of the economy, including the Defence Forces.  The Bill provides for a stepped disclosure regime in which a number of distinct disclosure channels are available, internal, regulatory and external, which the worker can access to acquire important employment protections.</p><p>  Three specific forms of protection are provided for in the legislation which will also apply to all members of the Defence Forces.  These protections are protection from the retributive actions of an employer; protection from civil liability; and protection from victimisation by a third party.  In a situation where an employer penalises an employee for having made a protected disclosure, the Bill provides for access to appropriate redress mechanisms.  For most workers, this involves making a claim for redress through the normal industrial dispute resolution mechanisms, namely, through a rights commissioner or the Labour Court.</p><p>  In the case of the Defence Forces, section 114 of the Defence Acts provides for an internal redress mechanism where a member of the Defence Forces thinks he or she has been wronged in any matter.  This system provides for the internal investigation of a complaint at various levels in the organisation up to and including the Chief of Staff.  In addition, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces provides an independent external redress mechanism for members of the Defence Forces.  Under the new Protected Disclosures Bill, either or both of these mechanisms can be used where members allege penalisation for making a protected disclosure.  The Bill specifically provides that members of the Defence Forces can make a complaint directly to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces where they consider they have been penalised for having made a protected disclosure.  They are not required to go through the internal redress system.</p><p>  I am confident that the provisions included in the Bill, once enacted, will copperfasten the safety and protection of whistleblowers across all sectors in the State, including the Defence Forces.  I am satisfied also that the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces works extremely well and that there can be no valid allegation of any nature other than that the current ombudsman deals objectively and fairly with all complaints that come before him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700004#B01000"><p>The Minister will be aware of the serious concerns of PDFORRA about the decision he made to make the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces a part-time one and to appoint a retired colonel, Liam McCourt, to the position.  To be clear, I do not question the character or sterling record of Mr. McCourt.  The issue for PDFORRA, however, is that there was a full-time independent person in the role for seven years but now it has been given to somebody who served in the Defence Forces.  Regardless of any decision he makes, this could put a question mark over the adjudication of issues that may arise.  Is the Minister entirely satisfied with the decision to appoint him and does he believe it has had no negative impact on anybody in the Defence Forces who has issues he or she wants to have addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700004#B01100"><p>I am satisfied that is the case and find it regrettable that the Deputy should raise any issue concerning the current Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The person concerned was a judge in the military court, adjudicated on issues and there was never any question that he did so other than independently and objectively and with fairness.  As the Deputy is aware, the issue he has raised has been part of an approach taken by way of litigation by PDFORRA.</p><p>I am not going to enter into that.  Moreover, the Deputy should be careful not to cast aspersions on the capacity, independence and objectivity of the current Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The Deputy says it is not his intention to do so, before asking questions which seem to do exactly that.  I said to him on a previous occasion that I find his continuing concerns for whistleblowers touching, given that some of his former colleagues in the Provisional IRA had little concern for such people.  Their remedy was a bullet in the back of the neck.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700005#C00200"><p>The Minister cannot resist the opportunity to pass the buck.  His stewardship over two Departments is an absolute bloody disaster.  PDFORRA, which represents the vast majority of men and women serving in our Defence Forces, has expressed grave concerns about the decision he made in this matter.  No aspersion is being cast on retired Colonel Anthony McCourt, but PDFORRA is making the obvious point that the Minister has replaced a person who was independent, not from a Defence Forces background and served full-time in the role for seven years with somebody who previously served in the Defence Forces and will work on a part-time basis.  Whether we like it or not, this might throw into question decisions made by the ombudsman or create a certain perception.  That is the reality.</p><p>  Will the Minister address the concerns expressed by PDFORRA as representative of the overwhelming majority of members of the Defence Forces?  I am merely putting those concerns to him today.  Perhaps he will even be willing to meet with people who have a different view from himself.  Instead of looking in the mirror for wisdom all the time, he might, God forbid, discover that there are people other than himself with a valuable opinion to offer.</p></speech>

The individual to whom he refers was appointed following the holding of a competition which I had no hand or part in influencing.  He was recommended following the outcome of that competition and so appointed.  That is the end of it.  As I said, the individual in question was formerly a military tribunal judge, yet the Deputy is suggesting that he is not an appropriate person.  Of course, what the Deputy is doing in this area is what he does in other areas.  He is seeking to pretend he is the friend of the ordinary rank and file of the Defence Forces while pillorying anybody who is in a position of leadership therein.  The narrative in which he and his colleagues are constantly engaged is an interesting one, but it genuinely does not fool too many people.  In the context of some of the history with which his party is associated, it will get little traction within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

The Minister is not exactly riding high in the credibility stakes at the moment.  My question flows from our discussion during the previous Question Time with the Minister on the continued use of Shannon Airport by United States aircraft.  Members of the Defence Forces were present at the airport on 24 April, 30 April and on several occasions in March.  In the context of the Minister's assurance on the previous occasion that the activities of such aircraft did not breach our neutrality because they were not carrying munitions or arms, did the Irish Army patrol units that were present get any information as to what they were actually doing there?</p></reply>

There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters.  The Defence Forces have deployed personnel to Shannon Airport, in response to requests for support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, since 5 February 2003.</p><p>  On 24 April 2014, a request for Defence Forces support was received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and troops were deployed.

The aircraft in question was a US navy cargo transport airplane operated by the VR-62 fleet logistics unit.  This is not any ordinary aircraft; it is fitted with special fuel tanks and was previously associated with special ventures such as the one which took out Osama bin Laden.  It also was used as part of a joint Australia-US military exercise in 2013.  Yet the Minister continues to state that such aircraft are not engaged in military activity when they land in Shannon.  If they are not carrying arms, ammunition or soldiers on their way to or from military operations or exercises, what are they doing at the airport?  Why would the US Government spend money on very expensive flights across the Atlantic several times a month if there is no associated military purpose?  Can the Minister shed any light on the situation?  The reality, of course, is that there is no explanation other than that they are landing as part of military activity.</p></speech>

In the context of this particular flight, my information is simply that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requested the assistance of the Defence Forces, and the latter provided that assistance.  I have no information in regard to the further flight plans of the particular aircraft the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I, of course, abhor the activities of Osama bin Laden.  The point I am making is that this was not an aircraft bringing soldiers on their holidays.  It is a specially modified aircraft for engagement in military exercises.  The idea that the Minister could say with certainty that these aircraft are not so engaged, when Defence Forces personnel have consistently failed to examine them, beggars belief.  There are no Russian aircraft or Chinese war planes landing at Shannon Airport, only US aircraft.  Can the Minister really not join the dots, given what we see happening around the globe, including the build-up of military aggression in the Ukraine and Syria, for example, and conclude that the US establishment is unlikely to waste its money sending troops on their holidays on these types of aircraft?  Will he not agree that the flights might have some other purpose?  The Minister has some neck in insisting otherwise when he has not taken the trouble to examine the situation.</p></speech>

I do not know whether that is the type of military aggression the Deputy has in mind.  She also made reference to Syria.  I do not understand what relevance this particular flight landing in Shannon Airport has to the dreadful tragedy being played out in Syria, where it is estimated that more than 130,000 people have lost their lives and many more are seriously injured.  In addition, nearly 2.3 million people are living in refugee camps outside Syria.  An horrendous civil war is going on and it seems clear that the country's ruler is continuing to use either chemical or biological weapons against his own population.  Moreover, fundamentalists of the al-Qaeda type have been responsible for killing large numbers of people and warfare continues between the groupings who contest the Assad regime.  What is happening in Syria is appalling and atrocious.  Of course, if the Americans tried to intervene to bring about peace, they would immediately be condemned by the Deputy.  What the situation in Syria has to do with the landing of an aircraft in Shannon Airport escapes me entirely.</p></speech>

Under the building programme there has been considerable capital investment at the Curragh Camp in recent years.  Between 2008 and 2013 my Department spent more than &euro;11.7 million on major building projects there, with individual building projects costing in excess of &euro;1 million as follows: new armoured vehicle garaging; refurbishment and alterations to No. 4 block at Plunkett barracks; refurbishment of the catering centre at McDonagh barracks; refurbishment of block No. 7 at Connolly barracks; refurbishment of the infantry school building; and re-roofing of the military medical facility.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the constraints on the capital budget, significant projects which will provide substantial additional facilities at the camp are currently being progressed, including continuation of the process to replace ordnance storage facilities so as to bring the complex into line with modern standards for such facilities, and continuation of the conversion to natural gas consumption of the major energy-consuming facilities in the camp.  The capital works programmes are based on operational requirements and are compiled on a priority basis by my Department in conjunction with the general staff.</p></speech>

The works he identified were needed and I welcome the fact that they have been carried out.  Between 2000 and 2005, the level of investment in the Curragh camp - &euro;64 million - was quite enormous.  Between 1997 and 2009, something of the order of &euro;400 million was invested in equipment, resources and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The Minister will be aware that the sale of barracks was, to a very large extent, a contributory factor in facilitating that level of investment.  There will be a need for continuing investment in the Defence Forces into the future.  I would like to see evidence to the effect that the Minister has a particular vision in this regard.  The next question, in Deputy Clare Daly's name, relates to housing at the Curragh.  On a recent visit to the camp - I thank the Minister for facilitating it - I was again struck by the level of dereliction which still exists there and the number of houses that are boarded up.  In the context of the operational capability of the Defence Forces, there is a need for continued investment.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to bring forward a plan in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

This is a very important matter in the context of the Defence Forces.  It will not have escaped the Deputy's notice that the State has been in great financial difficulties for the past three years and we have been obliged to substantially reduce our expenditure, both current and capital.  There has been a decreasing envelope of capital expenditure in respect of the Defence Forces.  Cuts to expenditure have, of course, been the case for every other Department.  Nevertheless, some very important developments have occurred and I listed some of those in my initial reply.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently working to produce a White Paper on defence.  Obviously, the latter will address the issue of capital investment in the Defence Forces.  An assessment is currently under way into the capital needs of the Defence Forces but, having said that, I do not want to pre-empt what might be contained in the White Paper.  The Deputy may rest assured that while we may disagree on some issues, I am quite happy to inform him that there is no doubt in my mind regarding the need for continuing investment in the Defence Forces.  My Department is, of course, committed to securing such investment.  I refer here to necessary investment and, in that context, one must identify where the priorities lie.  Those priorities are identified in consultation with the general staff.</p></speech>

I am conscious that in the coming years it is going to be particularly difficult for him to obtain the investment for necessary developments within the Defence Forces as he engages in combat at the Cabinet table.  Even in good times, funding had to be obtained by means of the sale of barracks.  As we move forward, it is going to be even more difficult to achieve the level of investment required.  Mowag armoured personnel carriers, which are vital to members of the Defence Forces involved in peacekeeping operations abroad, cost &euro;1 million per unit.  I do not believe there has been any reduction in their price.  We are going to face a challenge in meeting the very necessary cost of equipping the Defence Forces.  Particular responsibility in that regard will rest on the Minister's shoulders in the context of fighting at the Cabinet table to obtain the level of investment that will be required.  It must be remembered that there will be many competing demands on the money involved.</p></speech>

The largest investment my Department is making at present is in the two new naval vessels that are to be commissioned.  As the Deputy may be aware, one of those vessels, <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, was delivered to Haulbowline on Wednesday last.  I visited the facility there on Friday and was shown around the vessel.  A capital investment of &euro;54 million has been made to provide what will be the best ship, with the most modern technology, that the Naval Service has ever had.  The second vessel, <i>LE James Joyce</i>, is currently under construction and is due to be delivered next year.  The cost of this vessel will also be in the region of &euro;54 million.  Despite the financial difficulties with which the State has been obliged to contend, my Cabinet colleagues and I were able to make available the funding required in respect of the construction of the vessels to which I refer.  The first ship will be officially commissioned in the next ten days to two weeks and the second will be commissioned next year.</p><p>I accept that the point I am about to make will facilitate the Deputy in tabling a parliamentary question on another day but one of the issues which arises in respect of this matter is the age of the naval fleet.  There is a need to ensure we will be in a position to identify the funding necessary for any further new ships that may be required in order to replace those in our aging fleet.  We have already made very substantial inroads in this regard despite the financial difficulties under which the State has been obliged to labour and the constraints within which the Government has been obliged to operate.</p></speech>

The question relates to the accommodation units in the Curragh Camp and must be seen against the backdrop of both the court action and the pressure being exerted by the Department of Defence to remove those families that deemed to be overholders from their homes.  As the Minister is aware, my colleague Deputy Wallace offered his professional expertise in examining the properties in question.  The Minister instead chose to commission a technical examination of the properties, a move for which we were none the less grateful.  Where stands that examination at present and what are the plans in respect of the families involved?</p></reply>

As she stated, my Department recently undertook an assessment of vacant former married quarter properties in the Curragh Camp with a view as to their potential for future military use as single living-in accommodation.  The properties in question comprise a terrace of 16 houses and are typical of the type of former married quarters accommodation vacant in the Curragh.  Three of the houses have been reconfigured over time by combining adjacent houses.  As a result, there are now 13 individual units in the terrace overall.  The terrace is a solid brick structure with a slate roof.  The majority of the houses comprise two bedrooms, a kitchen and sitting room.  There is a small toilet located at the rear of each house on the ground floor but there are no bathroom facilities.  The assessment indicates that in order to be viable for accommodation use, adjacent properties would have to be combined to give a smaller number of larger units.  However, the assessment also indicates that the properties are in a very poor state and that the estimated cost of the repairs necessary to make them suitable as accommodation is simply prohibitive.  While the outcome of the assessment is still under consideration, it is clear that any renovation would be very costly, would only deliver eight to nine viable units and would be very limited in terms of future military needs.  This is not a cost-effective solution to meeting accommodation needs at the Curragh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700006#D01000"><p>This represents a radical U-turn on what the Minister previously stated in the House.  There are approximately 101 accommodation units in the Curragh Camp.  Our understanding was that the technical assessment to be carried out would contemplate all of these dwellings and not just the 16 which comprise a particular terrace.  If only those 16 dwellings were the subject of the assessment, then it is obvious the Minister has engaged in a sleight-of-hand exercise because the residents and Members on this side of the House understood that much more would be involved.</p><p>We cannot divorce this situation from the overall housing crisis that exists and the savings to the State of remediating what are otherwise solid units compared to having to rebuild up to 100 units or homes.</p><p> I would like to see the technical assessment thus far.  The Minister has given us little detail but he has been remarkably dismissive of the findings.  To level the playing field I am keen to have our experts examine the situation.  I call on the Minister to furnish us with the interim findings and to explain why the other 87 units which he was supposed to have examined have disappeared off the radar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700007#E00200"><p>It is my understanding that what was undertaken was a review of these particular units to get some insight into the possible benefits of undertaking renovation works and the likely difficulties that would be encountered.  I am told that in the context of the particular group of terraced houses examined, the estimated cost of works was in the region of &euro;863,000, VAT inclusive.  In respect of the terrace of 16 houses, this gives an average cost per house of &euro;53,937, if we could preserve 16 houses.  However, on the basis of the survey undertaken it was concluded that of the 16 terraced houses, ultimately only nine feasible units could be produced from the renovations.  This would put the cost per unit at &euro;95,888.  These are not costs that I could stand over in the context of a particular proposal.</p><p>  Since this was an initial assessment, I have no difficulty asking whether there are buildings in a better state of repair or whether works could be carried out at a lesser cost.  However, my understanding is that this terrace was used as a representative example of the difficulties that exist and the types of structure that are in place to get some sense of the costs involved, and I have outlined the costing I have been given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700007#E00300"><p>I would like to see the full report to date.  Even the figures the Minister gave do not amount to an excessive amount to pay for a dwelling house in the current climate.  We cannot divorce this scenario from the housing crisis in the State, not least in the Kildare County Council area, where there are thousands on the housing waiting list and the State is going to have to foot the bill.</p><p>  Reference was made to developing an accommodation unit for &euro;54,000.  I understood the Minister stated in his earlier answer that it was not 16 units but 13.  Somehow the figure has gone down to nine.  Anyway, even &euro;90,000 is not excessive.  One could not build a house from scratch for that amount anywhere else.  Again, will the Minister indicate whether we will be able to see the technical assessment of the properties such that we can consider it?  Could the Minister shed some light on where he sees the families currently residing in those units going as well as the position of some of the other 100 feasible properties in the area?  What is going to become of them?</p></speech>

The Deputy is aware of that because there are individuals, whom I referenced previously when the Deputy raised the issue in the Chamber, who are described as overholders in the technical sense and who have been living in some of these houses for many years.  There are elderly individuals there.  As the Deputy is aware, there is no intention ultimately to discommode them, but they are not in lawful possession of the properties.  No one will be rendered homeless on the basis of the manner in which we deal with these matters.</p><p>  There is a significant wider housing issue which must be addressed.  I have explained to the Deputy that as a Government we are altogether conscious of this.  The Minister of State responsible, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is doing what she can to address the issue.  Sadly and unfortunately, because of the financial position of the State, there is not an open-ended amount of money that can be made available to address this as comprehensively as we all would like.</p></speech>

Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist and crew skills to permit the development of organisational capabilities.  Career training provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels from section commander to brigade commander.  Collective training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together.  This moulds sub-units, units and formations into integrated and coherent combat forces.  It provides the Defence Forces with the capabilities required to fulfil their roles and missions at home and overseas.</p><p>  External education at university and institute level at home and abroad fulfils Defence Forces requirements by providing education and expertise that cannot be delivered within the organisation.  It ensures that Defence Forces personnel attain the required level of academic and professional qualification.  The Defence Forces have a budget of approximately &euro;2 million for training in 2014 and it is anticipated that all members of the Defence Forces will attend at least one training course this year.</p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice.  Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multilateral training and assessment.

Personnel are trained and provided with all the necessary skills to the standards required to ensure that they can carry out all day-to-day roles assigned to them.  This is clearly evidenced by the roles engaged in by the Defence Forces not only domestically but internationally.  For example, I have visited the Middle East, where we have members of the Defence Forces in southern Lebanon.  We have a joint Irish-Finnish contingent.  Our Defence Forces, when they were a sole contingent out there, were interacting with other contingents as opposed to being a joint contingent.  It is clear that the resources, weapons, protective resources and equipment available to them are as good as, and in some cases better than, the equipment being utilised by other defence forces.  For example, the deployment of our Defence Forces was requested in the Golan Heights following the announcement by the Austrian contingent that it would withdraw.  I insisted that specific and particular resources be available to provide force protection to members of the Defence Forces.  That was agreed and those resources were substantially superior to the resources available to the other contingents engaged on the Golan Heights at the time.</p></speech>

Training, for example, in the Air Corps is conducted in accordance with industry best practice and to the highest standard, referencing the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and Federal Aviation Administration, FAA's requirements and using the most modern methods and equipment available.</p><p>In the context of the navy - for fear of being accused of repetition - we now have the new naval vessels coming on stream.  We have the <i>Samuel Beckett</i>, which will be shortly commissioned and available and which has the most modern available technology as could be provided to facilitate the navy meeting its operational capabilities and obligations.</p></speech>

This question seeks to promote the idea that the capacity exists, in consultation with the Department of Finance, for our Defence Forces to play an even greater role in terms of conflict resolution.  What are the plans of the Minister and his Department in this regard?</p></reply>

As part of these missions, at which the Defence Forces excel, conflict resolution, as the Deputy is aware, is one aspect.  Conflict resolution is also one element of the reform of the security sector in the countries within which the missions are taking place.  For example, the training of Malian troops, which Ireland is undertaking in conjunction with the United Kingdom as part of an EU mission, seeks to train in the area of human rights as part of the mission's mandate.  This was also an element of the mission previously undertaken by Ireland as part of the EU training mission in Somalia.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, conflict resolution requires a distinct set of skills, such as mediation and negotiation.  These skills are crucial in the field, both during peacekeeping and also following the termination of conflict.  However, the primary role of the Defence Forces in overseas missions is to maintain peace and, as such, their role in direct conflict resolution is minimal.</p><p>  That said, the Defence Forces have partnered - I am sorry; I think my throat is giving up - with the Kennedy institute at NUI Maynooth and the European Security and Defence College to undertake a pilot course in mediation and dialogue skills for common security and defence policy crisis management activities.  This course will be held in Maynooth from 19 to 23 May this year.  The course will allow participants to explore these skills and to develop a personal capacity to be more effective in conflict resolution.  The aim of the course is to give students an understanding of mediation and negotiation.  It will allow them to apply these techniques in common security and defence policy crisis management operations and missions.  I assume that that is the type of activity that the Deputy has in mind.</p></speech>

It is an area in which we can expand our activities.  What we did in Mali and Somalia was of particular significance.  For this reason, many others and I were disappointed when the Minister decided to withdraw our participants in Mali.  Their work on human rights awareness was of great importance.</p><p>  The Curragh Camp training centre is liaising and actively engaging with the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for Conflict Intervention in Maynooth.  This is worthwhile and has the potential for further development.  I would like our nation to build on its major international contribution to peacekeeping and on the work of Irish Aid and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade so that we might have an integrated approach to problems.  Many of the situations in which peacekeeping and peace support are required derive from conflicts.</p></speech>

He might have meant "Somalia".  There was a reason for that, which I can come to.  In the context of Mali, there is a possibility of some additional members of the Defence Forces becoming engaged.  There is no question of limiting our role.  I merely said that, so far, we were playing a limited role in that context because there has been substantial emphasis on peacekeeping.  I think conflict resolution is of substantial important.  That is why we have members of the Defence Forces participating in the course that I mentioned.  I see it as a role in which we can have a greater engagement.  I think, in fact, the Deputy and myself are at one on those issues.</p><p>  The withdrawal from Somalia was not for that reason.  It was because the nature of the mission very substantially changed.  There were particular reasons about which the Deputy asked a question.  I am sure it can be replied to in detail in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy and I are at one.  This is an important area.  I think, in the context of the various conflict zones that exist across the world, when we deploy troops to particular areas, the capacity of our troops to engage in the manner that the Deputy describes can, on occasion, be of great value.  I would see this in the coming years as an expanding role, not a role to be limited, but there have to be particular circumstances to which it is appropriate.  We cannot engage in a role of that nature obviously in areas to which it is not appropriate.</p></speech>

There is considerable scope for development, particularly in the relationship that has been developed between the UN school in the Curragh Camp training centre and the Kennedy centre for conflict resolution.  Working with those two agencies, we have the opportunity to develop something on this island that can allow Ireland and its people to build on the successes of the past in terms of peace support.  We could also support Irish Aid to do much more than simply empower people to deal with crises.  Rather, they could be helped to avoid conflict and to deal with it where it exists.  This is something of which the Irish people would be supportive.  I am glad that the Minister is also supportive, but it will need capital investment.  It is an important matter.</p></speech>

Often, military personnel are engaged after the conflict has commenced.  There is a great deal of work that is done by civilians, by international organisations, by Ministers in governments across the world and by members of governments across the world to try to reduce tension levels and to provide prescriptions for conflict resolution, as we well know on this island in the context of the assistance that we have got from elsewhere, particularly the United States, in bringing about a conflict resolution.</p><p>  Conflict resolution has a role to play in troubled parts of the world.  It is not always appropriate to the Defence Forces to engage in that role.  On occasions when the Defence Forces go to a troubled part of the world, unfortunately the conflict has broken out, but there are circumstances in which that skill can be of benefit and of use.  I do not think the Deputy and I are in any great disagreement about the matter.</p></speech>

The Nordic battle group will comprise Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and possibly Lithuania and Latvia. The German led battle group will comprise Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Luxembourg, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.  The planned Defence Forces contribution to each battle group will be a reconnaissance company and related combat support elements.  It is also planned that Ireland will also take command of a multinational reconnaissance group headquarters, providing Ireland with a more significant role within these battle groups.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in both the Nordic and German led EU battle groups will be approximately 175.  However, this level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be called on to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The number of personnel involved leading up to and during the standby period may be in the region of 14 for the Nordic battle group and ten for the German led battle group.  These personnel, mainly staff officers and NCOs, will be engaged in training and planning activities serving in various appointments and posts.</p><p>  Any deployments of the above battle groups would be subject to the triple lock.  </p><p>  Participation in EU battle groups underlines our commitment to the development of CSDP and enables us to continue to contribute effectively to UN-authorised EU military and civilian crisis management operations in support of international peace and security.</p></reply>

Only six EU states are not full members of NATO.  A recent report stated that "the NATO Response Force and EU battle groups are complementary, mutually reinforcing initiatives" and called for efforts to maximise synergies between them.  The Minister is aware that Denmark and Malta do not take part in these battle groups.  Does he have any plans to adhere to the wishes of the Irish people and not have Ireland involved in these battle groups?  That would send a clear signal, and this is aligned to Deputy Daly's question on the issue of Shannon, that we are genuinely a neutral country.  That would reinforce the point Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l made about conflict resolution.  If we were not aligned to NATO forces internationally it would give us credibility in terms of being in a position to deal with conflict resolution.</p></speech>

We engage in the Common Security and Defence Policy, with which his party disagrees.  We will continue to participate as we do, which is to the benefit of our Defence Forces.  We will continue to make a contribution.  It is always interesting that the Deputy knows what the majority of the Irish people think on these issues.  I can tell the Deputy that in the context of the role battle groups have played, what they have done and our engagement in them has ensured that our Defence Forces reach a particularly high level of training that is important to them and assists them when they are engaged in UN sanctioned missions, and there is no intention of changing the approach.</p></speech>

I quoted from the report the hope and ambition of some people who oversee these matters at European level.  This is part of what the Minister does.  He accused Deputy Daly of supporting Osama bin Laden.  I cannot even find a word to describe that type of assertion.  In terms of Sinn F&eacute;in and the European Union, we are running four candidates in the four constituencies.  I am hopeful we will elect all four, no doubt assisted by the Minister's performance in his ministerial portfolio.</p></speech>

His party conveniently put forward candidates for the European Parliament while opposing the very existence of the European Union repetitively whenever given the opportunity to do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in is quite happy to look in two different directions simultaneously.</p><p>  Regarding battle groups, as would be evident from the Deputy, some of the European Union states that participate in battle groups are neutral.  Other neutral states find no difficulty in participating and contributing to Common Security and Defence Policy, and to engaging.  The Government does not have any intention of changing policy in that regard.</p></speech>

It was the subject of severe criticism by a series of external reports, mainly Price Waterhouse Consultants and the Efficiency Audit Group, EAG.  One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.</p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12 years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for non-commissioned officers.</p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby privates and corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received, as the Deputy may know, from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I understand that discussions are taking place with the representative association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.  As discussions are confidential to the parties involved in accordance with the terms of the scheme, I do not in any way want to prejudice them or impact on their outcome.</p><p>  However, I do understand the concerns it raises for enlisted personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families.  I am sure that all matters raised by PDFORRA on behalf of their members are being comprehensively examined at Conciliation Council.  I am also cognisant of the need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas.  It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place.</p><p>  As the negotiation process with the representative association is very much ongoing, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue publicly at this time.</p></reply>

By virtue of the fact that a discussion process has commenced, he is willing to consider the request made by PDFORRA.  Nobody is suggesting for one minute that a "Dad's Army" type of force would be acceptable.  What we are asking is that during a time of limited job opportunities the men and women who have served the Defence Forces and their communities with distinction and wish to continue in service after 21 years and meet the medical and fitness criteria in that regard be afforded an opportunity to do so.  While it is welcome that a negotiating process has commenced, the Minister, as the person with responsibility, has the power to accede to PDFORRA's request.  It would be beneficial to members of the Defence Forces if it were to be met.</p></speech>

I may be wrong, but this issue has been raised with me previously by the Deputy and other Deputies.  There is a process and a procedure in place to deal with issues of this nature.  PDFORRA is a party to the agreement I referenced.  As I said, issues have been raised by it, issues it is entitled to raise.  I do not want to say anything that would prejudice the outcome of the process under way, but I am conscious of the concerns and issues raised which must be addressed in the best interests of the Defence Forces generally and the context of ensuring the overall capacity of the Defence Forces to meet its objectives and provide the services required at home and abroad.  This is an ongoing issue.  As I said, I do not wish to say anything that would prejudice what is an important process taking place.</p></speech>

They will, however, be concluded in the coming weeks.  Much depends on both parties involved, but I do not want anyone to have to adhere to a definitive timeframe.

Is the process under way meaningful?  Is the Minister willing to listen to PDFORRA's side of the argument or is this process merely a charade and the Minister has his mind made up that the policy will not change?  The men and women concerned have served their communities and the Defence Forces with distinction.  We are effectively telling them that when they reach the age of 38, 39 or 40 years, they are no longer capable of work.  Some of them meet the highest health and fitness standards and are well capable of carrying out their work.  Members of the defence forces in other countries serve well into their fifties.  Having invested heavily in training these personnel, forcing them to retire at 38 and 39 years of age is an inefficient use of resources.  I hope the Minister will confirm the process is meaningful and not a charade.</p></speech>

It is important not to say people will be rendered unemployable because many members of the Defence Forces leave on retirement with particular niche skills that make them readily employable.  Even in a difficult jobs market, they are able to obtain employment, although I accept that does not apply to everybody and no one should pretend that it does.  The process is meaningful, as it must be.  However, the Deputy cannot have it every way.  He cannot say, on the one hand, say we do not want a "Dad's Army" and, on the other, that we should allow all members to remain until they reach the age of 55 or 60 years.  We must have a defence force that has the capabilities its requires.  Given the objective of having a force with a strength of 9,500, when members of the Defence Forces retire, this allows for the recruitment of new members.  As I have said previously in the House, approximately 400 new recruits will join the Defence Forces this year.  This number is based on retirements.  There are job opportunities for young people in joining the Defence Forces when members retire.  This is a meaningful process, not an engagement for a declaration or in a charade, and I hope it will produce an outcome within the coming weeks.  However, I cannot pre-empt its outcome.</p></speech>

I agree with the remarks made by other Deputies about forcing people to retire in their 40s.   Defence Forces personnel are required to pass fitness tests which, if not met, results in their discharge, which is fair enough.  However, some of the men and women concerned are very young, fit and healthy and bring a wealth of experience to the table.  In other areas such as construction in which the work is every bit as challenging physically tradesmen work into their late 50s, while labourers work up to the age of 54 or 55 years.  In employing Defence Forces personnel up to the age of 50 years we would not retaining them beyond use.  The French Foreign Legion recruits up to the age of 40 years, which means that it recruits personnel up to the same age at which Defence Forces personnel are forced to retire.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for attending in person to respond.</p><p>  All the talk is about medical cards but qualification for residential respite care has never depended on a medical card.  It has never been the constraint.  There have been constraints, but they have been funding constraints rather than constraints associated with an income threshold.  I believe the Minister made this point recently.  One reason I raise this issue is that a constituent of mine who was recently seeking residential care for her son was informed by the HSE that a policy decision had been made to no longer offer residential care to children with an intellectual disability.  Is this an actual policy decision?  Most accept that it is preferable to care for disabled children at home, but sometimes this is not feasible.  Sometimes there are family breakdowns that preclude it.  There are children whose intellectual disabilities are so complex and whose behaviour is so challenging that it is almost impossible for their parents to manage.  Caring for them can be much more challenging in some cases than caring for a child with a physical disability.  Financial constraints aside, I would like to be sure there has been no policy decision to preclude children whose behaviour or family circumstances are such that their parents cannot cope, irrespective of the budgetary position.  That is one problem I would like the Minister of State to address.</p><p>  Another aspect concerns the fact that there have been cutbacks during the years, obviously since the recession.  Circumstances have become more acute.  In recent years one has been able to say virtually no new residential places have been made available.  This, in turn, has put pressure on respite care places.  Emergency beds that were kept for respite care use are now being taken by those in need of long-term care, perhaps owing to a death in the family, marriage breakdown or a variety of other reasons.  As all of the respite care places have been taken, there is virtually no respite care service available.  It is almost non-existent and certainly does not meet the demand.  This is coupled with the absence of other supports in the community.  The Minister has spoken about the need for more support in the community, but the very concept of respite care is to help parents to cope.  This can work only if parents see that their children are making some progress as a result of other interventions available to them to ensure they can meet their potential.  I refer to physiotherapy, speech therapy to enhance communication skills and occupational therapy to help individuals function socially in the family and the community.  Nothing I am saying is a mystery to the Minister of State because I am sure he is aware that there is a chronic shortage of therapists and services in this area.  This is putting considerable pressure on families and, ultimately, driving up the demand for residential care.</p><p>  For years we have been talking about providing care in the community.  The HSE is talking about introducing new implementation networks to try to provide a more seamless service and easier access to services for parents.  It is a nightmare trying to gain access to services or even to learn what services are available.  Eighty new therapy places have been sanctioned, but I do not know how many therapists have been recruited.  To be honest, there are thousands of children awaiting a needs assessment in addition to thousands who have been assessed but who are not receiving a service.  It is clear that this must be a priority in the upcoming budget.  It is early in the year to be raising this issue, but the problem is acute.  Bearing in mind that funding is not available for respite care and residential services, we must try to prioritise in the upcoming budget the provision of services in the community for children with intellectual disabilities.</p></speech>

Traditionally, the provision of a residential placement would follow a detailed assessment to establish other means of addressing needs rather than admission to residential care.  There would be considerable communication between the HSE, the family or guardian of a service user, the service provider and the service user.</p><p>  The number of children and adults benefiting from residential services in 2013 was 8,880.  The target for 2014 is 8,884.  Respite care occurs in a variety of settings, depending on the family's needs and available resources.  It can be provided as out-of-home care, in-home care, home-to-home care, home support or family support.  Respite care helps to prevent out-of-home placements, preserves the family unit and supports family stability.</p><p>  There has been continued expansion of the availability of residential support, particularly planned or emergency centre-based respite services.  A total of 5,798 persons availed of a total of 243,260 bed nights from residential centre-based respite services in 2013.  In 2014, 5,890 people are expected to benefit.  In addition, between 2,000 and 2,500 persons availed of non-centre-based respite care services, including holiday placement, host family respite care, overnight respite care in the home and summer camps.</p><p>  In 2010 a working group carried out an overview of models of respite and residential care with host families in community settings to determine the viability of these models of service delivery for future development.  The HSE is aware of the challenge in maintaining existing service levels.  By working together, we can identity innovative ways to maximise resources to protect front-line services appropriately.</p><p>  In 2013 we commenced a major reform programme implementing the recommendations made in the value for money and policy review and the move to a person-centred support model.  Key steps this year include an additional investment of &euro;14 million and 130 additional staff.  Some &euro;7 million of the moneys allocated are to provide places for approximately 1,200 young people leaving school or rehabilitative training.  Some &euro;3 million is to provide emergency placements, while a &euro;4 million investment and 80 additional therapy staff will facilitate the rolling out of a new model of assessment and intervention to provide one clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend.  There is a reconfiguration of existing resources and efficiencies valued at &euro;5 million are being achieved.</p><p>  Disability service provision is moving towards a community-based and inclusive model, rather than being institutional and segregated.  The conclusions and recommendations made in the report on adult day services entitled, New Directions, and the report, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion, alongside the value for money and policy review, are helping us to achieve a more effective, person-centred disability service in line with international best practice.  The radical change involves collaborative responsibility shared between the affected persons, their families and carers, a multiplicity of agencies, the Government and society as a whole.</p><p>  I have listened carefully to what the Deputy has said and agree entirely with the points she raised.  As to whether there is a specific catch-all policy in place against providing a residential place, I would be very surprised if that were so.  I will certainly raise the matter with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, just to be absolutely clear on the specific point the Deputy fairly raises.  The Deputy has correctly pointed out that there are gaps, particularly in the community.  I am very conscious of the position on primary care services also because the topic raised is related to it.  The gaps in services in the community comprise a priority we have to address.  The Deputy is correct to say it should be addressed in the context of the budget to be introduced later in the year.</p></speech>

Ultimately, there must be services to which people can be referred.  It is important to prioritise this issue.</p><p>Just to highlight the extent of how challenging and difficult it can be for families, in one case that was reported to me, the mother of a very disturbed teenage boy with an intellectual disability actually reported herself to the Child and Family Agency as a potential risk to her child.  It highlights the measure of despair and desperation that any parent could feel that she felt she had to do this in search of services to help her and her family to cope.</p><p> We have all suffered in the recession - some more than others - and, hopefully, things will get better.  For many of us, there will be a second chance and many people will recover, but for children with a disability, there will be no second chance.  There is only a small window in their young lives where they will actually benefit from the therapies that could be made available to them.  It is very important, even in these difficult times, that we prioritise this particular sector.</p></speech>

I believe we have achieved some positive change, even in the context of the financial constraints that exist.  We are in a period of reform in terms of the structures and the configuration of these services but there are gaps that remain.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has done a very good job in terms of maintaining resources as best we can and, in fact, increasing the resources in this area, including the recruitment of new staff.  It is an area to which we need to pay constant attention.  Deputy Mitchell's contribution reminds us of its importance as an area of our health service which we need to continually prioritise and better resource in line with the improvements that undoubtedly have been made generally in the country in respect of the possibility for revenue.  This is an area we would all agree is a priority.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has stated on a number of occasions that he supports changing the way health care services are configured to improve delivery to patients who need the services.  I believe there is a big opportunity presenting in regard to the provision of insulin pump therapy to those who need it in the north west.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune condition characterised by the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, leading to an inability to produce insulin, resulting in raised blood glucose levels in children.  Conventional treatment involves giving insulin injections anything from two to five times per day using an insulin pen device.  Alternatively, it can be delivered using an insulin pump.</p><p>  It is accepted worldwide that the pump therapy is the best treatment option for many children with type 1 diabetes.  Insulin pump therapy can provide a child with a much improved quality of life, reduces the number of injections to be endured daily and can reduce the incidence of long-term complications arising, such as blindness, kidney failure and nerve damage.  These long-term complications of current diabetic treatments are extremely difficult and expensive to deal with.  International studies have shown that improved control of diabetes in children and adults can reduce the incidence of severe and costly complications arising by as much as 76%.  There is also an immediate cost saving to our health services in that, if a child with type 1 diabetes has an illness, it tends to be more manageable at home if a child is using an insulin pump.</p><p>  In summary, from a health and well-being perspective as well as from a short-term and long-term economic perspective, it is clear that insulin pump therapy is the way to go.  This was recognised in the HSE expert advisory group report on diabetes.  What is happening at present, however?  At present, children in the north west who were referred for insulin pump treatment must go on a waiting list and eventually travel to Dublin for the treatment.  This causes absenteeism from school, financial cost to their parents and disruption to the lives of the children and their parents, and they are the lucky ones.  Because of the numbers seeking such treatment, many are never taken from the waiting list.  This is not equity of access; this is discrimination based on location.</p><p>  We do, however, have a big opportunity in the north west because Sligo Regional Hospital has a consultant paediatrician with a special interest and training in endocrinology who is willing to support insulin pump therapy, and there is a part-time paediatric diabetes nurse qualified to support pump therapy.  The elements are all in place.  All it needs is the political will of the Minister and the Government and a modest resource allocation, which would in time be saved many times over, to make it happen.  Will this be done and, if not, why not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700012#K00400"><p>I thank Deputy Colreavy for raising the issue of the appropriate provision of specialised therapies for patients with type 1 diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a complex condition that has a profound impact on the quality of life of people living with the condition and on the health services as a whole.  Those with chronic, non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, are heavy users of the health services.  It is estimated that three-quarters of Irish health care expenditure relates to such diseases.  In practical terms, this translates to 80% of general practitioner consultations and 60% of hospital bed days.  Non-communicable diseases also account for two-thirds of emergency medical admissions to hospitals.</p><p>  The pressures placed on the Irish health care system by this burden cannot be sustained from a cost or hospital capacity perspective under current structures.  The national clinical programmes, with their models of structured integrated care, are gradually shifting our health systems away from an &quot;illness&quot; model of health care and encouraging patients to actively participate in the management of their condition, by seeking to provide treatment at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and as close to home as possible.  In this way, we can deliver better health outcomes, enhanced clinical decision making and more effective use of resources.</p><p>  The implementation of the national integrated care diabetes programme on a phased basis is a key development in the management of diabetes care.  I am sure the Deputy is very aware of the recent appointments of an integrated diabetes clinical nurse specialist, operating from Letterkenny General Hospital, and the recruitment of a paediatric diabetes nurse specialist at this site also, as well as the recent appointment of a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in endocrinology at Sligo Regional Hospital.  However, not all patient care can be managed locally.  The national clinical programme for diabetes states that people with type 1 diabetes or complex genetic or secondary causes of diabetes will have their diabetes-related care provided under the governance of the consultant-led diabetes multidisciplinary team in a secondary or tertiary care centre.</p><p>  With specific reference to insulin pump therapy, I acknowledge that such therapy is the &quot;gold standard&quot; as it is less invasive, less painful and more accurate, particularly in the management of type 1 diabetes in children.  I acknowledge also that the current requirement on children and their families to travel to Dublin from the north-west for device monitoring and adjustment is onerous.  However, the extension of this specialist therapy to other hospitals must be considered in the context of the recommendations of the clinical programme for diabetes, the expert advisory group report on diabetes, and the additional staffing and supporting resources which the establishment of additional insulin pump therapy centres would demand.</p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to note that these matters are under consideration by the Department of Health and the HSE in the context of considering the most appropriate service developments for the children of the north west and west, and that these ongoing considerations will also take into account potential appropriate cross-Border collaboration. </p></speech>

I thought we would be able to say that, yes, this is something good and that we will work to achieve it.  I am disappointed because, like many people in the west and the north west, when I hear words like "the matters are under consideration", it tends to scare me.  This is because previous considerations of services to Sligo Regional Hospital resulted in reductions in the number of beds, failure to employ a mammographer, the removal of the mammography equipment, with no word about its replacement, reductions in front-line staff, reductions in and withdrawal of day services and non-replacement of critical front-line staff when they are on holidays, maternity leave or are sick.  The most recent and frightening aspect is the leaked report that consideration is being given to the very future of maternity services at Sligo Regional Hospital.</p><p>I am not pleased to note that these matters are under consideration because if the outcome of these considerations had the same impact on Sligo Regional Hospital as previous HSE and Department of Health considerations of services at the hospital did, we will lose again.  </p><p> I have made a strong case that this service should be provided and based in Sligo Regional Hospital and I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not said that it can and will be done.  </p></speech>

In fact, it is something we are considering very carefully because the approach our health services take, particularly to chronic illnesses such as diabetes, will shape how we configure our health services more generally in the future because we simply will not be able to manage 21st-century illnesses like diabetes under the structures we have had to date.</p><p>  It is more complex than the issue of what we do in our hospitals although I acknowledge that, as the Deputy said, well-equipped and properly configured hospitals are critical.  However, they are not the full story.  We must emphasise the importance of primary care, care in the community and very often self care, particularly in respect of chronic illnesses.  The Government and I have been doing so.  Based on his contribution, I know the Deputy would agree with that.  I understand what he says about Sligo General Hospital and I hope to be there next week and also at Letterkenny General Hospital.  </p></speech>

We will not be able to manage and sustain our health service unless it changes.  I have listened carefully to what the Deputy said and he makes some good points.  The issue is not whether insulin pump therapy is a good thing or idea because it clearly is.  The issue is how we configure those services and facilities around our hospital services across the country and, most important, how we ensure we manage these major threats to our health and, ultimately, the funding possibilities for the health service in the community and primary care.  They are all issues we must address.</p></speech>

As the Minister for Education and Skills is aware, this issue came to my attention through the case of Robert Kells who is currently enrolled in second year in IT Carlow.  He was refused the special rate grant.</p><p>  I will quickly remind the Minister of State of the details of Robert's case and the difficulties he faces.  The family income for 2012 was well under the qualifying limit.  SUSI rejected the application on the grounds that the reckonable income of Michael Kells, Robert's father, did not include an eligible social welfare payment as of 31 December 2012.  He was on a qualifying payment and was on a community employment scheme up until November 2012 when due to an accident, he had to go on illness benefit.  Illness benefit is not on the qualifying list of payments as its currently stands.  Every other payment is on the list but not illness benefit.  When this was initially queried, I was told that illness benefit was a short-term payment and hence could not be included on this list.  Michael Kells has been on this payment since 2012.  The most recent reply to me from the Department of Education and Skills again insisted that illness benefit was a short-term payment but it seems particularly perverse when one paragraph later in that particular piece of correspondence, it was confirmed to me in the same letter that Mr. Kells had been on the payment for a period of 18 months.  I think it fair to say that 18 months is not short-term in anyone's language.  </p><p>  That particular letter then suggested that Mr. Kells should apply for disability allowance or invalidity pension but it is not good enough to say that this is a matter for the Department of Social Protection, as appears to be the view of the Department of Education and Skills.  Mr. Kells cannot apply for disability allowance until his PRSI credits run out.  He is effectively being penalised for having gone to work, which is indefensible.  If he had never worked a day in his life, he would be fine and his son would qualify without any question for the further education grant.  Equally, as I am sure the Minister is aware, it has become increasingly difficult to secure an invalidity pension as the criteria are now quite rigidly and strictly enforced.  That, of course, should be the case.  To obtain a pension, Mr. Kells would have to seek a medical diagnosis which rules him out of the workforce for the rest of his working life.  He does not want and should not be encouraged to do this.  Nobody should be written off in that way.  </p><p>  There is a blatant flaw in the system.  The Kells family are the victims of a very clear lacuna which must be corrected.  I am sure that the Department has prepared the Minister of State with quite a detailed explanation of the rules and regulations as they apply in this particular instance.  I already know what the rules are.  We already know what the rules are.  The problem is that the rules are inherently flawed.  Nobody would suggest that two weeks on illness benefit should entitle anybody to a full rate third-level grant.  That is not what I am saying but to dismiss the patently obvious fact that illness benefit is sometimes a much longer-term payment than anyone would countenance when they originally acquire an illness or problem is quite frankly ludicrous and an example of officiousness and red tape at its worst.  A grave injustice has been done to the Kells family.  If the Department does not act, this injustice will undoubtedly be repeated for other families.  I will be very disappointed if the Minister of State and his Department cannot find a way to remedy this for the Kells family and the small number of families across the country who may be affected as a result of this flaw.  </p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Education and Skills provided him with a detailed response on 19 February 2014 in respect of the application by the student referred to by the Deputy for support under the student grant scheme.  I understand that the Deputy has submitted more recent correspondence and the Minister will respond to this.</p><p>  The student in question qualified for the standard rate of maintenance grant plus a grant of &euro;2,500 for the student contribution charge.  The special rate of grant is a targeted access measure to provide specific interventions for the most disadvantaged students recognising their ongoing long-term dependence on welfare support. Under the student grant scheme, the qualifying criteria for the special rate of grant must include one of the listed eligible long-term payments by the Department of Social Protection or a long-term payment for a designated programme.</p><p>  Illness benefit is considered to be a short-term social welfare payment and, therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purposes of the special rate of maintenance grant.  Where a person is incapacitated on a long-term basis, and I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy when he describes 18 months as long-term because it certainly is, it is a matter for the Department of Social Protection to adjudicate on whether the person should be moved to a long-term payment.  Eligibility for the special rate can be reviewed during the academic year if there is a permanent change in circumstances such as when an individual is awarded one of the eligible long-term payments for the special rate by the Department of Social Protection.  Should the Department of Social Protection make a backdated award, this date is taken into account for the review.  While a student may not be eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant in his or her first year of study, he or she may apply for the special rate in subsequent years of their study if that change in circumstances occurs.</p></speech>

While it addresses some issues and puts on record the situation as it applies in respect of illness benefit and its consideration in terms of the qualification criteria for the special rate grant, it is completely unsatisfactory.  I am always reluctant to mention individual cases on the floor of this House but I do so with the express permission of the family because it illustrates a wider problem in terms of the operation of the SUSI system and the lack of discretion that is often applied by it.  I know the Minister and Minister of State are fair men.</p><p>They have both displayed commitments to fairness during their political life.  I am sure that, cutting through the density of the bureaucratic system and the administrative impediments, the Minister of State can see how the system as it is currently constituted lets down families such as the Kells family in this case, but if it is beyond the system's capacity to adapt and take into account the vagaries of this case then I would argue, hopefully convincingly, that SUSI should instead apply some common sense and imagination in dealing with difficult cases like this.  I would imagine there are few other cases that bear the hallmarks of this case and, therefore, SUSI really should be encouraged to ensure that some discretion or flexibility is applied.</p><p> My warning is that for some young students, if changes are not made to the system for situations such as this that are not necessarily black and white, it could well mean the difference between staying in third level education and dropping out.  I want to ensure that students have the kinds of opportunities to which we all should have access.  That is my fundamental concern.  I make a plea to the Minister to have this case reviewed and appeal to the better nature of the Minister of State and those of officials in the Department of Education and Skills and SUSI to review this and to make provision for Robert Kells to ensure he is permitted to finish his education.  That is his ambition and we should be supporting him in it.</p></speech>

At present, illness benefit is considered to be a short-term social welfare payment and, as the Deputy mentioned, persons can be on that payment for a period as short as a couple of weeks.  Therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purpose of the special rate of maintenance grant.</p><p>  It is not an issue of SUSI somehow being inflexible in how it applies the conditions of the scheme in the case of this particular family.  It is an issue of how exactly the Department of Social Protection deals with those who find themselves moving long beyond that short-term illness benefit period, as the Deputy described, for up to 18 months, and how an individual can easily transition from illness benefit to a more long-term payment which automatically entitles him or her to this extra support from SUSI and the Department of Education and Skills.  That is where the issue lies and perhaps the Deputy might engage with the Department of Social Protection to see how that conundrum can be resolved.  As it stands, because the illness benefit is considered by this Department to be a short-term payment and not eligible for that special support, it is not proposed to depart from the existing arrangements for the determination of eligibility for the special rate of maintenance grant.</p></speech>

Mr. John McGrane, a senior figure at Ulster Bank and a member of the board, stated at the end of April that there was a disagreement on the board and some members chose to leave, saying:<blockquote>It is as simple as that.  That is their right and I respect them.  Business will carry on.</blockquote>The five members quit at the National Concert Hall's annual meeting in Dublin on 9 April following the circulation of a note to members of the board which was critical of the position of some unnamed members.  The resignations are the culmination of a split in the board that has been evident throughout the past year.  The note, drafted by Mr. McGrane, stated that there were &quot;professional differences&quot; with some on the board.  A copy was also sent to Minister, Deputy Deenihan, who attended the annual meeting but who did not address Mr. McGrane's note, although he may wish to say otherwise now.</p><p>Those who resigned are Mr. Pat Heneghan, Mr. Bruce Arnold, Mr. Artemis Kent and Ms Patricia Slavin.  The National Concert Hall board chairman, Ms Margaret Ryan, who had previously indicated her intention to stand down, also formally resigned at the meeting.  The board is ordinarily comprised of 15 members, including the chairman.  The board is understood to be split on the running of the National Concert Hall in general and on strategies for the future.  The differences &quot;were on board governance and board focus&quot;, Mr. McGrane stated.  These were not related specifically to financial or artistic concerns.  He stated, &quot;They were purely about the focus of the board&quot;, and &quot;It is my belief that the focus of the board should be on being positive and proactive in the best interests of the hall.&quot;</p><p>Those who resigned were appointed to five-year terms on the board in July 2011 by the Minister, with Ms Ryan appointed to the chair last year.  I note Ms Ryan was also appointed a director with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, while Mr. McGrane was appointed to the board of the concert hall by the Minister in 2011.</p><p>In a statement, the Department confirmed that the four ordinary members of the board who stepped down on 9 April had done so &quot;due to differences on the board&quot;.  The statement added:<blockquote>The matters that were raised are matters for resolution by the board.  The main purpose of the Minister's address to the board on April 9th was to inform the board that the Government has decided to place the National Concert Hall on a statutory footing.</blockquote>It also confirmed a number of new appointments to the board, including new chairman, Mr. Gerry Kearney, a retired Secretary General of the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Mr. Kearney will take the position as chairman on an interim basis until the new legislation has been enacted.  This development will trigger the establishment of a new board.  Others appointments include Ms Maura McGrath, who has over 20 years' experience working at senior management and executive levels in the private and public sectors; Mr. Barney Whelan, director of communications and corporate affairs at An Post; Professor M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, a pianist, composer and academic who holds the professorship of music at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance at the University of Limerick; and Ms Rebecca Gageby, head of programmes and administration at the Royal Irish Academy.</p><p>The taxpayer, as the principal funder of the National Concert Hall, has a right to know what issues currently divide the board at the National Concert Hall, what strategies are in dispute, what opinion the Minister has on this dispute and whether taxpayers' best interests are served by this dispute.</p><p>I am conscious that the board and management of the concert hall have done a superb job over the years.  The most recent annual report available suggests that approximately &euro;2.4 million of subvention was available to the hall in 2012 and it returned a modest surplus of just over &euro;100,000.  It is deeply distressing to see an institution of State that has so much positive achievement to its credit be undermined as a result of board conflict at this time, and I suppose what we are doing today is providing the Minister with an opportunity to assure the country that efforts are afoot to ensure that whatever conflict exists can be resolved speedily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700014#M00400"><p>I am happy to avail of this opportunity to address the House on the governance and future of the National Concert Hall.  The National Concert Hall is one of our most important cultural institutions and one dearly beloved by both the Irish public and international visitors to Ireland.  Over the course of 2013, more than 300,000 people attended almost 950 events at the National Concert Hall.  This underlines the importance of the National Concert Hall as the most important venue in the State for musical performance of the highest standard.</p><p>  As part of the process of reform at a range of institutions, including the national cultural institutions, the Government recently considered the governance position at the National Concert Hall.  Since establishment in 1981, the National Concert Hall has operated as a company limited by guarantee.  On 25 February 2014 the Government approved my proposal to place the National Concert Hall on a statutory footing, similar to other national cultural institutions.  I informed the board of the National Concert Hall of this development when I addressed the board on Wednesday, 9 April.</p><p>  Since then, the Government has also approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the National Concert Hall on this statutory basis, and legislative drafting work in relation to this will be prioritised.  The draft heads of Bill on this proposal will shortly be submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for parliamentary scrutiny.</p><p> The decision to place the National Concert Hall on a statutory footing mirrors similar decisions taken by the Government last year in respect of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, which also operated as a company limited by guarantee since establishment. </p><p> This legislation is very important for a number of reasons, chief among them being that the next board of the National Concert Hall will have absolute clarity in respect of the position on all governance and operational issues at the National Concert Hall.</p><p> As a statutory body, and in line with good governance, the NCH will be required to prepare and adopt a statement of strategy, submit progress reports, and will also be required to prepare an annual business plan, to be submitted as appropriate to the Minister and the Oireachtas.  This is in common with the changes being proposed for other national cultural institutions.</p><p> As a statutory body, the National Concert Hall will have enhanced capacity to engage in fund-raising.  This again is common to other national cultural institutions which are already established as statutory bodies and which have strong fund-raising programmes.</p><p> To prepare for the change in governance arrangements at the National Concert Hall, I have made a number of changes to the board.  Mr. Kieran Tobin was chair until April 2013, at which point he stepped down from the role at that time for personal reasons.  He has decided not to resume the position of chair, but will remain on the board to help in the development of the National Concert Hall in the period ahead.</p><p> Ms Margaret Ryan took on the role of chair in April 2013 to replace Mr. Tobin.  This was always intended to be for a short term.  She has stepped down from the board of the National Concert Hall to focus entirely on her role with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Government has since approved my proposal to appoint a new chair to the board of the National Concert Hall.</p><p> This new chair is Mr. Gerry Kearney, retired Secretary General of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Mr. Kearney will take the position as chair, with no fee payable, on an interim basis until the new legislation has been enacted.</p><p> I have also appointed four new board members to replace the board members who stepped down on 9 April: Ms Maura McGrath has over 20 years' experience working at senior management and executive levels in the private and public sectors, and also not-for-profit organisations in Ireland and abroad; Mr. Barney Whelan is director of communications and corporate affairs at An Post; Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in is a pianist, composer, recording artist and academic, who holds the professorship of music at the Irish World Music Academy of Music and Dance based at the University of Limerick; and, Ms Rebecca Gageby is head of programmes and administration at the Royal Irish Academy.</p><p> The coming period will be one of change at the National Concert Hall.  The legislative reforms that we have planned for this institution will greatly enhance it for performers, staff and the public who visit the National Concert Hall each year.  I am very positive abou+t the future of this institution.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the board of the National Concert Hall for its help and support in making this Ireland's leading venue for the highest standards in musical performance.</p></speech>

However, in his response the Minister has not addressed the reason for the resignation of the five board members.  It is not every day of the week that five members of the board of a national institution resign.  Are they resigning because of the legislation the Minister is proposing?  Do they disagree fundamentally with that or are there other reasons?  Are there other factors in terms of the governance of the National Concert Hall?  Do they concern the focus of the board?  That is what we have been given to believe by a resigning member of the board who has spoken out to give the public some information on what has been going on.</p><p>  With all due respect, the Minister has given us no new information on the dispute and the problem that exists.  He simply told us who is there and who will replace those who have left.  We want to know what has been the problem with this institution which, in 2012, received &euro;2.4 million of public money.  It has a record of serious achievement in the performances it has mounted over the years.  It is an institution that has the respect of the Irish people, as well as many international performers, and overseas visitors who have come here to attend performances in the National Concert Hall.</p><p>  Now, however, we see there is a level of disarray among the board members.  Why is that happening?  The Minister should tell us because the Irish people want to know.</p></speech>

I have full confidence that they will fulfil their duties.  These people are doing the work <i>pro bono</i>, as did the previous directors, so there is no cost to the taxpayer.  The new chairman is also doing the job <i>pro bono</i>.  The National Concert Hall is operating very successfully.</p><p>At this stage, the reason for the disagreement has been outlined in various Sunday and weekday newspapers, so it is fairly well known.  There were disagreements among members which focused primarily on a fund-raising initiative in America at that particular time which, I understand, could have cost the National Concert Hall &euro;1.5 million.  What was thought to be a philanthropic arrangement resulted in a commercial arrangement.  That just could not be allowed to happen, and it was not allowed to happen either by myself or by the board.  Members were not happy with that arrangement and as a result they stepped down because of it.  That will not happen now.</p><p>I am providing for new legislation that will come before this House shortly and which will clarify the position.  Hopefully, the Deputy will facilitate that legislation when it comes before us so that we can get it through the House quite quickly.  In that way, we can clarify the role and function of the board and put it on a statutory basis like other boards.  </p><p>The new board is taking on this responsibility and will move it on to a statutory basis.  The National Concert Hall will continue to function successfully in future, as it has done in the past.  The contribution by the taxpayer is about 37% of its total funding.</p></speech>

His work on family law, children's issues, those who died in the care of the State, institutional abuse, the Magdalen women and penal reform will undoubtedly stand the test of time.</p><p>The Minister's decision to resign follows receipt of the report of Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC on a review of action taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pertaining to certain allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  I received Mr. Guerin's report last evening and the Minister and I have considered its contents during today.  Mr. Guerin has raised some legal issues that need to be addressed in advance of the publication of the report.  These are currently being considered by the Attorney General.  However, I can advise the House that the report is critical of the inadequacy of the actions taken by a number of agencies - notably An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but also including the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Minister for Justice and Equality - in responding to the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe.  In that context, the Minister has accepted responsibility and has taken the course of tendering his resignation.  </p><p>It is my intention that the Guerin report will be published on Friday morning.  The reason for the delay is that the letter accompanying the report from the senior counsel recommended that certain matters be attended to in terms of privacy, <i>sub judice</i>and so on.  </p><p>The Government will consider its response next week and there will be an opportunity for it to be debated in the House.  I intend to make an announcement on the replacement of Deputy Shatter as a member of the Government later this evening or tomorrow morning. </p></speech>

I am at a loss in the sense that I do not have possession of the conclusions or report of Mr. Guerin.

I understand there may be reasons for this, but I ask the Taoiseach if he can outline to the House the nature of the conclusions of Mr. Guerin's report that have led to the Minister's resignation.  It is a very significant outcome of the report that it caused the Minister to resign.  Can the Taoiseach outline whether the Minister spoke to him and whether he spoke to the Minister?  Obviously, the Taoiseach received the report.  Are there matters in it that he feels made it absolutely necessary for the Minister to resign?  Can he outline to the House, even in a broad sketch, the import and content of the report that have led to the Minister's resignation?  He will accept that it has caused a significant degree of surprise in the House that in a shock announcement he has indicated that the conclusions of the Guerin report have caused the resignation of the Minister and have been the factor which has resulted in him resigning from office.  Have there been consultations between the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the matter?  Did the Minister take the decision in his own right following a discussion between him and the Taoiseach after the Taoiseach had received the Guerin report?  When can we on this side of the House expect to receive a copy of the report?  When is it the Taoiseach's intention to have a debate in the House on the report and also on the resignation of the Minister?</p></speech>

The Minister has made his decision with a great degree of dignity.  This is not a case of a Minister having been involved in anything underhand, illegal or scams of any description.  It is a testament to the extent of the exceptional work ethic the Minister showed right across the entire spectrum of the justice brief that the report comes to the conclusion that there was inadequate investigation and analysis of the issues raised by Sergeant McCabe by a variety of agencies.  I point out that GSOC did not co-operate with Mr. Guerin.  I point out that Mr. Guerin did not speak to the Minister.  I point out that the report recommends that there be a comprehensive commission of investigation into the matters raised as the subject of the issues by Sergeant McCabe.</p><p>The Minister, in his letter, thanks all of the personnel involved in the work in which he was involved.  Obviously, he has read the report, considered its implications and, in the interests of the entire situation, made up his mind and tendered his resignation which I have accepted with reluctance.  He has a prodigious work output.  His work in the area of penal and legislative reform will stand the test of time.</p><p>The report, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin knows, came as a response by me to issues of grave concern raised in the House.  The Government appointed Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin, SC, to look at the documentation and the cases presented.  His report is factual and straight and, I must say, hard-hitting.  It points to the inadequacy of investigation by a range of authorities.  In so far as that issue is concerned, the brunt of the report deals with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality and, to a lesser extent, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In regard to his statutory powers, the Minister considers that it is in everybody's interests that he tender his resignation.</p><p>The report was sent to me as Taoiseach.  The accompanying letter from Mr. Guerin yesterday evening points out that publication of the report must take into account certain matters of privacy, named individuals, matters that might be <i>sub judice</i>and so on.  I have asked the Attorney General to deal with the report in that context and it will be published on Friday morning, taking into account the recommendations of the senior counsel.  The Government will respond next week in respect of the report's recommendation that there be a comprehensive commission of investigation, as I committed to here when the matter was raised in the first instance.  Obviously, we will make arrangements through the Whips to have the report debated at an appropriate time.  It will be available on Friday morning.</p></speech>

On a political and a policy level, we certainly had differences with the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  I recall his rather trenchant - or very strong - comments on this issue in the House, but be that as it may.  I take it that the Taoiseach has read the report and that, therefore, he must have had discussions with the Minister prior to his decision.  I take it that the Taoiseach was the first to receive the report because he had commissioned it.</p></speech>

Was the Taoiseach of the opinion that it made that a necessity?  Can he outline to the House in any shape or detail what the report states?  I take it that he is confirming that a separate commission of investigation to the one in relation to Garda taping will be established to deal with the very serious issues contained in the file I sent to him which had been forwarded by the whistleblower.  The issues were grave.  Can the Taoiseach indicate, in terms of his comment on the inadequacy of analysis, whether there is an implication in terms of the confidential recipient?  Was this featured in terms of the issues which had not been dealt with adequately by the various agencies and, ultimately, the Minister?  Can the Taoiseach shed any light on that aspect?</p></speech>

It concludes that there is a requirement to have a comprehensive commission of investigation into these matters.  It points to the inadequacy of investigation and analysis in dealing with the detail of evidence submitted by Sergeant McCabe in respect of these matters.  It points to the inadequate response of the Minister under his statutory function and responsibilities for independent investigation and analysis of these matters.  It is in that respect that he feels it is his duty to resign from his responsibilities and in that respect only.  It is his feeling as a Minister that this finding of the senior counsel of inadequate use of his statutory responsibilities requires him to tender his resignation.  Mr. Guerin did not actually speak to the Minister but obviously was in possession of the documentation and paperwork from the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>This requires him to tender his resignation.

He has a spouse, a family and a wider family upset by this development.  T&aacute; nuacht tagtha chun cinn le d&eacute;ana&iacute; a chuireann n&iacute;os m&oacute; br&uacute; ar an Teachta Shatter.

T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir nach bhfuil deireadh le sin f&oacute;s.</p><p>  The resignation comes as we await the outcome of separate investigations into the bugging controversy at GSOC and claims of Garda malpractice by whistleblowers and it follows a period in which Deputy Alan Shatter's judgment on a range of serious policing and justice issues has undermined public confidence but he was not in it on his own.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste supported him and resisted strongly and rubbished sensible suggestions from the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on justice, Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, to deal with these matters independently of the Minister in a transparent and appropriate way.  Labour and Fine Gael voted confidence in the Minister.  It was not just the Minister who has presided over the recent series of controversies, although he was a central actor and the author of a litany of mistakes.  He defamed the two Garda whistleblowers and misled the D&aacute;il.  The Taoiseach set out, in an inappropriate way, the need for the ombudsman to go to the Minister when that was not the case.  He allowed false statements to stand and corrected them only when it was politically expedient to do so.  He and the Taoiseach actively sought to minimise the concerns of GSOC that its offices were being bugged.  Does the Taoiseach expect other resignations and did he seek the Minister's resignation?</p></speech>

When the report is published, the Deputy and everyone else will have a chance to read it and an opportunity to debate it here.  I hope we can conclude on the terms of reference for the commission of investigation, which the report recommends.  On behalf of the Government, I said that these were serious matters that would be treated seriously and the Government responded immediately by appointing Mr. Guerin, SC, to look into them.  I indicated to the House that when the report was sent to me I would receive it, read it and see that it was published.  Following through on that, the report will be published in accordance with the parameters set in respect of privacy.  It will be published on Friday morning.  Having read the report and considered its implications, the Minister sent me his letter of resignation, which I accepted with regret.</p></speech>

In 2009, the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Deputy Willie O'Dea, made defamatory remarks to a journalist about the Sinn F&eacute;in Limerick council candidate Maurice Quinlivan.  Deputy Willie O'Dea swore an affidavit that he had not made those remarks and then retracted it when a journalist produced a tape-recording of the comments.  The Taoiseach then tabled at motion of no confidence in Deputy Willie O'Dea and sought, quite rightly, his resignation at that time.  Surely that rationale must apply to this case.  Cad &eacute; an difir?  Last night, like Tammy Wynette, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste were standing by their man.  If the Minister had not offered his resignation, he would still be the Minister.  Where is the rationale between the Taoiseach's position in 2009 and his current position?</p></speech>

This is bigger than the Minister because there are ways and means of dealing with the issues that depoliticise them, that are transparent and that allow people to have confidence.  Everyone makes mistakes but a system that allows citizens to have a sense of control over their politicians will prevent the kind of catastrophe we have seen.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that these events highlight the need for fundamental reform of the administration of justice and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Taoiseach should not be pulled into it but should do it as a reforming Government.  The Taoiseach has failed to do so.  It will be borne out as the reports are published that the Minister for Justice and Equality is not the only one culpable.  That will become clear and people will remember how the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste stood by, reinforced, rubbished and dismissed genuine efforts to try to sort out these matters.  Does the Taoiseach expect other resignations?  Does he expect resignations from the Department?</p></speech>

In respect of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy mentioned, with respect, Deputy Alan Shatter is not Deputy Willie O'Dea.  The Minister considered the implications of the report.  GSOC did not co-operate with Mr. Guerin.  The terms of reference included the fact that Mr. Guerin was authorised to interview Sergeant McCabe and such persons as may be considered necessary and capable of providing relevant and material assistance.  Despite this being an element of the terms of reference, at no time was the Minister interviewed by Mr. Guerin.  Even so, the report was concluded and prepared and he understands that.  Documentation was forwarded by the Department to the senior counsel but he decided not to interview the Minister.  For that reason and the reason of the report's conclusion of inadequate use of the Minister's statutory powers and responsibilities for independent investigation of matters, the Minister decided that he should tender his resignation, which I have accepted with regret.  Over my many years in politics, I have never seen anyone with a work ethic like that displayed by Deputy Alan Shatter in terms of his work and commitment to his responsibility.</p></speech>

We have been caught somewhat unawares by the announcement this afternoon, given the unequivocal backing of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and every one of the Government team through every scandal in which Deputy Shatter has been involved.  This includes, not least, the announcement over the weekend that he was guilty of a breach of law.  It is the first time in our history a sitting Minister was deemed to be guilty of breaking the law.  This is not just any Minister but one in the Department charged with responsibility for overseeing the data protection legislation.  The Taoiseach and the ministerial team, including Deputy Varadkar not later than this morning, sought to dismiss and rubbish the findings of the Data Protection Commissioner even though it is well established as precedent in every jurisdiction that, where a Minister is found guilty of illegality or lying to Parliament, immediate resignation is the norm.  While not bearing any personal grudge against the Minister, Deputy Shatter, everyone on this side of the House is amazed it has taken this long because in other jurisdictions he would have been long gone.</p><p>We say this particularly given the crisis he has weathered over the past 18 months, when the Taoiseach stood by him through the major scandals relating to the bugging of GSOC and the serious allegations of Garda malpractice put forward by Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Let us remember that Maurice McCabe, who last week had to make a complaint about bullying he is experiencing from members of the Garda force at the moment, has been campaigning on these issues for five years.  The report issued by Judge Guerin is based on allegations Maurice McCabe submitted to the Garda authorities and personally to the Assistant Commissioner - who, ironically, today applied to be Chief Constable of the PSNI.  We were told and he was told by the Minister that there was no case to answer and that those matters had been investigated.</p><p> My questions to the Taoiseach are as follows.  He has made the point a couple of times that GSOC did not co-operate with the Guerin inquiry.  What does he mean by that?  GSOC has been the butt of an undermining campaign by the former Minister on numerous occasions.  I am aware that the former Garda Commissioner approached the Garda organisations and asked them to issue public statements of no confidence in GSOC at the time of the bugging applications.  What is the implication of the Taoiseach's remarks that GSOC did not co-operate?  This is the body charged with Garda accountability.  The problem is far deeper than Deputy Shatter.  Does the Taoiseach accept now that we need a root and branch review of the entire operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and does he accept that Professor Dermot Walsh's recommendations on Garda accountability should be implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700018#Q00200"><p>When I say that GSOC did not co-operate with the senior counsel, I mean that GSOC expressed difficulties in respect of furnishing documentation to him.  Clearly, Deputy Shatter, as Minister for Justice and Equality, pointed out on many occasions the inadequacies, as he saw them, of both the then confidential recipient structure and the structure of GSOC itself.  If a properly functioning GSOC had been able to follow through on complaints made to it, this particular report might not have been necessary at all.  I believe that when the Government considers the terms of reference for the commission of investigation that Mr. Guerin has recommended, the question of the adequacy of investigation by GSOC should be considered as part of these terms of reference.  It is a matter for the Government to decide on this.  In so far as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned, we also have a commission of investigation into other matters conducted by Mr. Justice Fennelly, which is under way.  The terms of reference for this particular recommendation by Mr. Guerin will be considered by the Government next week.  Everybody in the House will have the opportunity to contribute on the issue also, including Deputy Daly.</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach advise us whether Deputy Shatter has resigned as Minister for Defence also?</p><p>  The root of this issue is Garda accountability.  This is a more serious issue than the issue of the Minister himself.  He defended lock, stock and barrel the operation of the Garda when Deputy Wallace moved legislation last summer calling for reform.  It has been our experience that GSOC desires to be what it was set out to be - a body to oversee complaints relating to the Garda force - but that it has been made toothless by the existing legislation.</p><p>  I am not sure what the Taoiseach's implication is when he says GSOC had difficulties in providing information to Mr. Guerin.  Is he saying GSOC could not find the information he asked for, or that it did not want to or was not willing to co-operate?  What the Taoiseach said is a sort of veiled information.  Would the Taoiseach agree with me that it is clear now that the issues around the Cooke inquiry with regard to the bugging of GSOC, which seems to be central to this whole issue, must now be brought under a proper commission of inquiry and that we must now take this opportunity to revitalise, redevelop and reconstitute An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a manner that has not been done since the foundation of the State?</p></speech>

The committee I chair on this had its first meeting last week and I expect that following the public consultation and discussions that will now take place we can come back in July with recommendations on setting up that structure and how it should operate.  That matter will be reported to and discussed in the House.</p><p> I understand the report due in from Judge Cooke is on its way, but I do not have a date for it.  When it comes to hand, I will treat it in the same fashion as this report.  It will be published and laid before the House and its recommendations will be considered and, hopefully, implemented by the Government.  The report is due shortly.</p></speech>

Does the Taoiseach then intend to have a full debate on the report in the House next week?  He indicated that time would be made available for a comprehensive debate on it.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is the order in which the Government intends to deal with this?  Will he indicate why he did not consult with leaders of the Opposition, given the gravity of what has unfolded and given the fact that prior to this there was a degree of engagement between us on the issues - albeit in a bona fide way - in the context of the establishment of the Guerin commission?  These questions concern the timeframe.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach may say there are legal reasons he cannot deal with the Guerin report today and therefore we cannot debate it today.  I presume that is why he suggested there are items for redaction and so on.  Is that the position?</p></speech>

As I said, the report came to me, as Taoiseach, yesterday evening and I considered it.  I said previously when we raised this matter that when the report arrived it would be received and announced to the House and not held.  I am quite sure that, as usually happens, when people find that a report has been presented to a Minister, to the Government, or, as in this case, to the Taoiseach, there will always be questions about why it is not being published or dealt with.</p><p>I want to put an end to that.  The report has to be redacted in part because of the personnel who are named and the surrounding issues which were pointed out by the senior counsel.  That work is ongoing today and tomorrow and, as I said, the report will be published on Friday morning.</p><p> The Government will look at the setting out of terms of reference for the commission of investigation, as recommended by Mr. Guerin, to see how they should be structured, what it is the commission of investigation should look at and whether it should include GSOC and the analysis that took place by the different authorities - the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on.  The terms of reference will obviously have to be debated here.  The report is 300 pages long and needs to be considered carefully.  It may not be appropriate, given its scale, for it to be debated next week, but that is a matter for agreement between the Whips.  When Members read it, they will see for themselves the scale of what is involved.  As I said, I would have been happy to have the report published immediately on receipt, but there is a clear recommendation that it be redacted for very particular reasons which I am sure Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin understands.  That work is ongoing and the report will be published on Friday morning.</p></speech>

I have just read the Minister's resignation letter.  The Taoiseach should have consulted or, at least, informed the Opposition of these matters.  The Minister, in his letter, says he has not read the full report and has reservations and concerns about it, in particular its conclusions.  He says he is anxious to avoid any controversy that might arise for the Government or difficulties which may be created for Fine Gael or the Labour Party in the lead-in to the European and local government elections.  This echoes to some degree what I said a moment or two ago, but we will put it to one side.  Does the Taoiseach have concerns about the report?  He made a point when he was speaking earlier of saying several times that the Minister had not been interviewed by Mr. Guerin.  The Taoiseach has read the report; none of us has.  Does he accept the report or does he, too, have reservations and concerns?  Does he have concerns, as the Minister does, about its conclusions?  Why did he not tell us that the Minister had resigned in order to avoid any controversy that might arise for the Government or difficulties this issue might create for Fine Gael or the Labour Party?  Why did he not circulate the letter of resignation to Members?</p></speech>

This provision was introduced as a result of the very poor transport services to the islands in the past.  However, in the past 15 years the position has changed and there are now very good transport services available to the islands.  It is worth noting that in recent years elections have been held on the islands off the coast of Cork on the same day as those held on the mainland.  This was despite the fact that Cape Clear Island is located as far out to sea as many of the other islands and has piers which are inferior to those which obtain on those islands.  If the Bill is accepted, it will ensure that those who live on the islands off Donegal, Mayo and Galway will vote on the same day as their counterparts throughout the remainder of the country.  This is particularly important in view of the fact that elections are often held on Fridays.  For those from the islands who are either working or studying on the mainland, it is much easier to return home and vote on a Friday than on any other day of the week.</p><p>I hope there will be a widespread welcome among Members of the House for this Bill and that it will be enacted prior to the next election after those due to be held later this month.  I do not expect that it will be enacted before 23 May next, but in view of the number of islands off the coast of Mayo, perhaps the Taoiseach might facilitate its being rushed through.  I will not live in hope in that regard.  I do hope, however, that the Bill will receive unanimous support and that it will be enacted in advance of the next general election.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700020#S03800"><p>I move the following Supplementary Estimate:<blockquote>That a supplementary sum not exceeding &euro;2,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2014, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, including certain services administered by the Department and for payment of grants and grants-in-aid.</blockquote>A Supplementary Estimate is required by my Department for the funding of the commission of investigation to examine certain matters of public concern relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other persons.  The reasons for establishing the commission are well known at this stage.</p><p>Following consideration of very serious matters relating to the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's telephone recording systems, the Government decided that the implications were potentially of such gravity that it was appropriate to establish a statutory commission of investigation to examine all matters of public concern relating to the issue.  The Government also decided to establish a new Cabinet committee on justice reform to oversee the development of proposals for an independent police authority, and other associated reforms to the policing and justice system.  We need to ensure full public confidence in, and support for, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na given the very difficult and important task it fulfils.  We therefore wish there to be a full public debate on the issue of policing and justice reform, and the Government will very shortly commence a public consultation process on the issue of an independent policing authority.</p><p>Deputies will recall that the draft Government order providing for the establishment of the commission was approved by the D&aacute;il on 15 April 2014.  The draft order included a copy of the detailed and extensive terms of reference for the commission.  The draft order was subsequently approved by the Seanad following a debate on 16 April.  In accordance with the legislation the Commission of Investigation (Certain Matters relative to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other persons) Order 2014 was then made by the Government on 30 April 2014.  The Government also formally appointed the Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly, as chairman of the commission.</p><p> The commission's terms of reference envisage a final report to the Government no later than 31 December 2014 subject to section 6(6) of the Act.  There have been calls for earlier reports on some elements of the investigation, particularly the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner.  However, it is important to recognise the independence of the judge and, therefore, the Government has given the commission full flexibility on the nature, timing and sequencing of any part of the investigation.  As required under the Act, my Department has made arrangements to publish the commission's terms of reference, the statement of costs and the timeframe for the investigation in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</p><p> The staffing requirements of the commission will reflect the scope of the terms of reference and the ambitious timescale involved.  The exact requirements of the commission will become clearer in the coming weeks as it begins to scope its work in more detail.  In accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 the appointment of staff and their terms and conditions will be subject to approval by me with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition to direct staffing costs, set-up and ongoing costs will arise in respect of the establishment of the commission's office, information and communications technology functions, administration, travel and subsistence etc.  Specialist expertise may also be required given the subject of the investigation.  Based on an initial assessment, a cost of &euro;2 million is deemed to be a reasonable estimate for 2014 and it is therefore proposed to provide for this from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This estimate is based on the assumption that the commission completes it work by the end of 2014 as specified in the terms of reference.  If it were deemed necessary to extend the commission's work beyond that date then further staffing and other costs would of course arise.  In addition to salary and administration costs, third-party costs may also arise.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, following consultations with the commission and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I will have guidelines prepared concerning this area.  The extent and timing of any such costs are difficult to estimate at this stage.</p><p> The commission will be investigating serious matters which have important implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our justice system.  My sole interest in addressing these matters, which are rightly of deep concern, is to establish the truth.  I believe that the establishment of the commission is the most appropriate, timely and cost-effective way of getting to that truth and, therefore, I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1054" speakername="Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700021#T00200"><p>I am stepping in for Deputy Martin, who has been called away.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the proposal before the House to fund a formal inquiry into the taping practices followed in some Garda stations over the years.  There are many aspects of this controversy which are unclear.  The most important of these is the potential impact of taping on past and future criminal proceedings.  The appropriate way for these to be addressed is by a formal independent inquiry.  The Taoiseach will recall that he assured the Houses that there would be detailed consultation in respect of the work of this inquiry.  Unfortunately, the many assurances of consultation which we receive never amount to more than, at most, the most informal of approaches, with the Government carrying on regardless.</p><p>  Understanding why this practice developed and continued, whether laws were broken in the process and if legal proceedings were prejudiced is a core part of the work the inquiry should undertake.  However, it cannot be left at that.  Central to addressing public concern is answering the question of why we had a sudden rush of activity by Government in recent weeks when this activity was known within Government since last year.  How is it that the Minister for Justice and Equality, now the former Minister, was officially notified of concerns by the Garda Commissioner but claims to have known nothing until summoned by the Taoiseach one Monday night?  These are not side issues; these are issues which are directly involved in the effective dismissal of a Garda Commissioner by the Taoiseach and his Minister for Justice and Equality.  If the Taoiseach constructs this inquiry to shield the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the focus is solely on the original activity rather than including how it was dealt with, then people will correctly see it as a cover-up.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has repeatedly attacked others for failing to abide by what he said was the law.  His attack on the failure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to inform him of bugging concerns is the most significant.  However, yesterday we heard that he can break the law with impunity as long as he makes an apology, no matter the level of bad grace involved in that apology.  The former Minister for Justice and Equality and his Department failed to act on this issue when they came into possession of information about it.  Yet we are now establishing a sworn inquiry into it and providing millions to fund it.  If the Government tries to prevent this inquiry from reviewing its actions then it will be rightly seen by the public as a whitewash.</p><p>  The Taoiseach will remember that on his appointment he made an explicit promise of running an accountable and transparent Government.  Over one month after the Taoiseach and his Minister for Justice and Equality decided to put pressure on the Garda Commissioner to resign, neither the Taoiseach nor the former Minister have uttered one word of explanation about the basis for this action.  The Taoiseach has at least continued to make himself available and there have been opportunities for him to be asked questions, even if he works hard to avoid answering them.  It is now almost two months since the former Minister for Justice and Equality was willing to do an open interview or a press conference.  His limited public appearances have included blanket refusals to talk about the forced resignation of the Garda Commissioner.  In recent days he attacked a journalist for a story about him which has turned out to be 100% true.  A Minister who will not answer questions or attend Garda conferences, who keeps attacking legitimate stories and who believes that there is nothing illegal in the use of confidential Garda information in a false attack on a political opponent is a Minister whose resignation is welcome and one who should have resigned or been fired before this.</p><p>  We are about to receive reports on other controversies surrounding the Minister and we look forward to Friday's report being circulated to us and to considering the establishment of other inquiries.  The challenge for the Government is whether it will allow genuinely independent inquiries or whether it will try to limit everything to minimise the political impact.  If it chooses to continue to put politics first, it will rightly increase public disquiet.</p><p>  Deputy Adams made reference to the Minister's letter of resignation.  As has been said by others, no one takes any great satisfaction in the resignation of a Minister.  It involved great personal trauma for him, his family and, I imagine, for his party as well.  However, the fact that in resigning he chose to put the resignation in the context of the impending election challenges speaks volumes of where we are.  Unfortunately, it suggests to the House and the public that politics in this country under the Taoiseach's Administration has not changed at all and that gaining political advantage is what is of primary importance rather than serving the people.  I believe that is a great tragedy at this point.</p></speech>

If I understood the Taoiseach fully - I might have picked it up wrongly - earlier when he announced the Minister's resignation he said there may be another commission of investigation.

My next point was that if this was to be the case would it require another Supplementary Estimate and, obviously, it will.  We also fully support the allocation of necessary finances for the investigation to be carried out comprehensively and professionally.</p><p>  The backdrop to all of this is that citizens were exposed in recent months to the fact that they had been kept in the dark about the truth of what really happened in the small minority of our Garda stations over many decades and in the Department of Justice and Equality more recently.  No one in authority, whether the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the former Garda Commissioner or the Attorney General, has given citizens answers to the questions that have been raised.  This is why an investigation of this nature is required.  Obviously it requires significant funding and will require many hours of work and a large amount of transcriptions.  We will also support the allocation of additional funding if it proves necessary.</p><p>  The revelations about the taping or tapping of telephone conversations at Garda stations was a major and serious development.  It goes to the heart of fundamental issues for any democratic society.  It has raised questions for the Garda, the administration of justice, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p>  A particular case prompted the Government to set up the commission - the Government had to be dragged into doing so and avoided it for a long time.</p><p>We would not be in this situation had the Government taken the advice of Opposition Members, including Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly, as well as members of Sinn F&eacute;in, such as our spokesperson, Deputy Mac Lochlainn.</p><p> It was the trial of four garda&iacute; in respect of the assault of Anthony Holness in Waterford in February 2010 that started all this.  The judge in the case ruled that recordings could not be used against the accused.  She also said the practice of Garda stations recording incoming and outgoing calls was in breach of the law.  However, it is the Ian Bailey case that is the real context for this scandal.  The former Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government had known since early 2012 of a critique by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the initial Garda investigation into the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  That critique effectively destroyed the premise of the entire investigation into the murder of that poor woman, causing grave difficulties for her family and friends.  Could I have the Taoiseach's attention for a moment?  Despite this, the Government continues to defend itself in a civil case taken by Mr. Bailey and his partner, Jules Thomas, at a huge cost to the taxpayer.  Every day it is costing the taxpayer a huge amount of money.  Surely austerity, if not justice, would dictate that this was not a good use of public funds.  Could the Taoiseach tell the D&aacute;il how much this is costing and whether it is a good use of public moneys?</p><p> This is now an international story.  The French authorities have been allowed to visit this jurisdiction to examine evidence provided by our authorities - evidence that we ourselves know is flawed.  While the commission's terms of reference will include an examination of whether there is evidence of unlawful Garda activity towards Mr. Bailey, the evidence of such unlawful activity in other cases has been known since 2001.</p><p> The State has much to do - none of us can take satisfaction from any of this - to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, in the Garda and, if I may say so, in politics.  I was struck by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l's comment to the effect that nothing had changed.  I believed he was going to add &quot;since we were in power&quot;.  Nothing has changed.  We have a job of work to do to restore public confidence, not just in justice and the Garda, but also in how the Oireachtas is governed.  This investigation can play a part in that work, but it cannot be the only action taken by the Government.</p><p> I support the moving of the Supplementary Estimate.  If I may, I will seek answers in some other way to my questions on the cost of the State's defence, etc.</p></speech>

Ms McMorrow was appointed in 2007, but her report was only published by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, a week ago, seven and a half years after the horrific death of Mr. Gary Douch while in the care of the State.  I can only imagine the additional and unnecessary distress and trauma caused to Mr. Douch's family by the delay.  It appears that the State's conduct was a primary factor in that delay - there were delays in providing important documents, primary evidence was destroyed and there was a long delay in payment to Ms McMorrow for her work.  Last June, it was noted that she had not been paid in more than three years, most of which time was during the lifetime of the current Government.  It is a pity that under the 2004 Act any commission must be dependent on the Minister of the day to sanction its expenses.</p><p>  Given the fact that the remit of the Garda tapes inquiry dwarfs that statutory investigation, it is difficult to see how Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly will be able to complete his extensive investigation in just six months.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the commission will consider publishing Mr. Justice Fennelly's conclusions on a volume-by-volume basis, as occurred in the case of the Morris tribunal?  The Government might update the House on the publication date for the report arising from the Cooke paper review, which merits inclusion in these terms of reference and a statutory investigation.</p><p>  The former Minister has been in possession of the Ombudsman for Children's report into possible Garda misconduct for more than six weeks but has not yet confirmed a publication date.  How soon does the Government intend to publish this?</p><p>  The entire episode of the alleged bugging of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, merits a full, independent inquiry.  The people of Ireland are concerned about it.  The Garda Commissioner and the Minister are gone.  The Government needs to use this situation as an opportunity to start afresh and to do policing in the way it should be done.  There are many challenges and problems, but we have not addressed them properly.  It will stand to the Government if it addresses them now in an honest, transparent and accountable way.</p></speech>

That is at the heart of the matter.  It is true to say that this is only one commission of inquiry into one aspect of a number of serious concerns about justice and policing that have been raised.  We all welcome it.  The Taoiseach has confirmed that on foot of the Guerin report, which we have not seen, there will be a commission of inquiry, but we do not know whether the Cooke report will similarly recommend a further commission.  Perhaps we need to stand back and ask whether the establishment of three, four or five commissions is the way forward.  Should we instead take a holistic approach?  At the root of this situation is the fact that the changes that were promised and the measures that were implemented following the Morris tribunal to ensure Garda accountability and an end to the blue wall of silence have not worked.  We know this and have been highlighting it for the past while.  This is the issue we need to examine.</p><p>  Regarding the tapes controversy, let us face it: it was not a secret that recordings were being made.  Maybe people did not know what the recordings were for, but a public tender was involved.  It is not credible that the Prison Service did not know that prisoners' telephone calls were being recorded.  People involved in the service have told me that they were aware of it.  As such, I find it difficult to believe that people high up in the Department of Justice and Equality did not know.</p><p>  We have the ongoing tragic infringement of the human rights of Mr. Bailey and Ms Thomas, whose families have been devastated.  Obviously, the unsolved murder has been devastating for the family of Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  Given the heartache that Sergeant Maurice McCabe has been put through, I want to recognise his role.  For five years, he single-handedly sought to put a spotlight on this issue.  We should take cognisance of the fact that he approached senior garda&iacute; more than once.  His claims and allegations were rubbished and dismissed and he was ostracised and treated poorly by people who are still in the upper echelons of the Garda.</p><p>  We need a holistic approach.  I wonder whether &euro;2 million is enough.  These are austere times and no one wants to spend money.  Compared with 50 staff for the banking inquiry, though, it is not a great deal of money.  Perhaps we should elicit the goodwill of individuals such as Professor Dermot Walsh and other policing experts to undertake a holistic review instead of engaging in commission after commission.</p></speech>

It provides for an obligation to make reports to the Child and Family Agency on children in certain circumstances.  It requires certain persons to assist the agency and organisations working with children to carry out risk assessments to identify potential sources of harm to children under their care and prepare child safeguarding statements.  It also provides for the establishment of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group and the preparation of sectoral implementation plans by Departments.  It places an obligation on two groups, the first of which is mandated persons designated within their organisations and professionals who have an obligation to make a report to the Child and Family Agency if they suspect children are at risk of abuse, neglect or harm.  Second, it places an obligation on service providers to carry out harm risk assessments and draw up child safeguarding plans.  This is a very welcome aspect of the Bill and shows that it has a serious intent that must be worked on into the future.</p><p>The legislation has been broadly welcomed across the House.  It is welcome to have the Children First guidelines placed on a legislative footing.  It had been indicated by the Minister for a number of years that this would happen.  The Bill has been welcomed by almost all groups working with children.  The broad based Saving Childhood group has welcomed, in particular, that the best interests of children are of paramount consideration, the requirement on organisations to provide child safeguarding statements and the establishment of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group.  The establishment of the implementation group is a welcome development because it is vitally important that the legislation be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  I have often commented in the House that a good deal of legislation brought before the House does not have a review mechanism built into it.  Some items of legislation provide that a review must take place five years after its enactment.  All legislation should have that ongoing review mechanism built into it.  The Bill has a wide-ranging remit across a number of Departments, including the Departments of Education and Skills and Health, as well as the Child and Family Agency, and a review must take place at all times to ensure it is achieving what it has set out to achieve in putting the Children First guidelines on a legislative footing.</p><p>The one flaw in the legislation which has probably been highlighted previously is the lack of sanctions for persons or organisations that fail to report.  The reason given is a concern that there could be a rush of allegations, complaints or reports to the Child and Family Agency that would clog up the entire system and prevent it from investigating what is happening with reports.  The Children First guidelines have been in place for 11 years and the figures from the Health Service Executive, the most recent of which are the for the period up to 2011, show that between 2007 and 2011 there was a 36% increase in the number of reports under the legislation, rising to 31,000 reports.  This shows that in the time the guidelines have been in place momentum has built in organisations recognising their responsibilities under them.  We may have passed the point where a raft of reports will come forward to the agency that will have to be investigated.  </p><p>The lack of a sanction is a real flaw in the legislation.  I would not like to see it used, but a commitment and a responsibility should be included in the legislation to ensure ten or 15 years on from the introduction of the legislation organisations will not take their eye off the ball in that regard.  That is the reason sanctions are important and I ask the Minister to consider providing for some form of sanction.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill passed Committee Stage yesterday, but I am concerned about the lack of a sanction for public bodies that have a positive duty to examine human rights and gauge their policies against their human rights commitments.  That is a worrying trend we may see in other legislation that does not include sanctions because it lessens the obligation on organisations to ensure they comply with their requirements.  We never want to see it being used, but such a provision should be included in the legislation to allow the Minister or the responsible body to act against organisations that do not report, as they are obliged to do.  The lack of a sanction may be a sop to the clergy or the Catholic Church in terms of their obligations to report, a major concern raised in the past year by priests in terms of what is said in the confessional.  I imagine it would be virtually impossible to secure a conviction against any member of the clergy who receives an allegation in the confessional.  The issue would never arise, but there are organisations that did not have a culture of reporting abuse or dealing effectively with abuse and not providing for a sanction in the legislation lets them off the hook.</p><p>Putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing is very welcome, but, as has been mentioned by other Members and as the Minister is aware, there is a difficulty for the Child and Family Agency in investigating reports it receives.  That is a major concern that must be examined on an ongoing basis.  The Irish Association of Social Workers has stated there are not enough social workers employed across the country to ensure they can investigate reports adequately.  An interesting quote from Ms Helen Buckley, Associate Professor at the School of Social Work and Social Policy in Trinity College Dublin, is worth reading.  She states:<blockquote>There is a common assumption that the harm and misery experienced by some of the children who featured in recent high profile cases was a result of failure to report.  This is in fact a misperception.  The majority of recent high profile cases had been reported many times to HSE social work departments.  The problems exposed in these cases occurred during the ensuing months and years when the children and families were known to a number of services.</blockquote>That is very telling and places a huge obligation on the Government to ensure the volume of complaints and reports received by the Child and Family Agency is dealt with in a timely fashion.  We do not want to see a repeat of some of the harrowing cases exposed in recent years when families were not dealt with, even though they were known to all agencies.  That is a bigger objective to achieve, but it is something we should work towards to ensure we achieve it.  It will mean the securing of resources for the Child and Family Agency and social workers to ensure investigations are completed and dealt with from start to finish to protect children across the State.  I know the Minister is committed to this, developing social work services and the recruitment of social workers.  As circumstances start to improve, I hope the Government will be committed to doing this also and that it will provide the resources required to ensure full enforcement of the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700023#V00200"><p>First, I acknowledge the Minister's commitment on the matter of safeguarding children and their welfare because we know too well the appalling litany of abuses of children in industrial schools, laundries, their homes, schools and sports organisations.  I mention, in particular, the young swimmers who were horribly abused a number of years ago at the hands of coaches.  We saw the ineffectiveness of the organisation involved to deal with it.  I know that some of the young women in question are still suffering badly today.</p><p>  We know that the effects of abuse and neglect suffered by children are carried into adulthood.  In many cases, such abuse affects their lives and relationships with others negatively.  We know that some of those who have been abused will abuse and have abused others.  In Dublin Central, the inner city, we know the pain associated with abuse and how it has brought abused persons into addiction, self-harm and suicide.</p><p>Childhood is supposed to be a time of innocence.  It should be a time of fun and enjoyment, a time to be care-free, with no worries about mortgages or making a living.  The abusers in society rob children of the care-free abandon of childhood, leaving them physically, emotionally, psychologically and mentally scarred.  For me, what is important about this legislation is what it will do to prevent this from happening and, in the event of it happening, the prompt redress provided for.  As with every plan, it may appear good on paper but not in application.  Likewise, child safeguarding statements will not automatically mean that children will be guarded.</p><p>I read the Minister's Second Stage speech in which she said the purpose of the Bill was to improve the care and protection of children by raising awareness of child abuse and neglect.  There is now, for a variety of reasons, some of them awful, a much greater awareness of child abuse and neglect, in particular among children.  This must be taken on board.  There must be greater space for children's and young people's voices to be heard and their concerns, fears and situations, if one of abuse or neglect, to be addressed with the appropriate services.  Calls by young people to helplines and organisations must be dealt with.  While not mandated in the Bill, we must ensure the availability of services for young people in order that when they report abuse and neglect, their reports will be dealt with adequately.  I acknowledge the role of schools, youth clubs, sports organisations, the scouts and girl guides, etc., in hearing the voices of young people and treating these voices with respect and creating within them an atmosphere of mutual respect and, in particular, respect for difference.  Very often it is the inability to cope with difference that leads to abuse, particularly verbal and emotional abuse, although often physical.  The more proactive we can be in terms of inputs and programmes the more we can create an atmosphere that is child-centred.  Given that we know that it is a child's sense of self-worth and self-esteem that is most damaged when he or she is abused or neglected, if we can work on self-awareness, self-worth and self-esteem in children, we will see far fewer cases of neglect and abuse.  </p><p>I take the point made by the Minister that child protection is only dealt with by mandated persons but that everybody has a responsibility to safeguard children.  I have serious concerns about particular groups of young people, the first of which is young foreign nationals, some of whom are residing in direct provision centres, while others are living in appalling housing conditions.  Regardless of what one thinks of how they arrived in the country or their status, they are children and they are not being treated equitably and fairly.  What is happening to these young foreign nationals will be the Magdalen laundry-industrial school-type scandal in years to come.  These children are being abused and neglected.</p><p>The second group is children born to parents with an addiction.  These children are living with parents who are leading chaotic lives.  A great deal of work is being done by the extended families and the projects to support these parents and their children.  These projects cannot take any more cuts to their services.  Like others, I also attended the pre-budget submission this morning by Early Childhood Ireland.  One of the issues highlighted by that organisation is the lack of special needs assistants and specialists such as speech therapists who are important in addressing children's issues at a young age.  This is another area in which we could be much more proactive.  We are all aware that in many cases the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is paying for assessments of children with special needs.  </p><p>I have read some of the criticisms of the Bill, including that it is a watered down version of previous Bills.  I would like to focus on the issue of sanctions.  The Bill provides that professionals working with children are legally obliged to report their concerns.  However, there are no penalties for a failure to do so.  In that regard, two issues arise, the first being enforcement.  It is important that the provisions of the Bill be strictly enforced.  The second issue is that of sanctions.  On reviewing my notes on the previous legislation I came across an article taken from <i>The Irish Times </i>by Professor Helen Buckley on some of the concerns of social workers and the preoccupation with reporting.  Professor Buckley states in the article that it is well established in other jurisdictions that criminalising a failure to report has led to unintended outcomes, including a disproportionate level of funding to manage the intake of reports, with a consequent reduction in the resources available to provide services for vulnerable children.</p><p>The article also highlights that a common consequence of reporting legislation is a significant increase in false positive and false negative reports, with false positives occurring where individuals, fearing criminal charges, report indiscriminately.  As such, a high rate of false positives could mean families suffering unnecessary distress and intrusion.  A high rate of false negatives is very dangerous because it means that children who are being ill-treated or abused are being overlooked.  Professor Buckley also makes the point in the article that the lessons from the Roscommon, Monageer and the national review panel reports include &quot;...that the principal weakness in the system is not failure to report, but a lack of commitment across health, justice and education services to proactively assist vulnerable children in the post-reporting stage of child protection work&quot;.  This Bill will go a long way towards addressing issues at the pre-reporting stage, but this must be matched by what happens post-reporting.  We need to be more active in vetting.  We are all aware that delays in the vetting process are holding up vital work.</p><p>It must be acknowledged that the majority of abuse takes place within the child's family and home.  I hope the Bill will be strong in that regard.  Perhaps a timeframe should be set out in the Bill for a review of the legislation to see if it is working and the consequences thereof.  I welcome the establishment of the EU-wide hotline for missing children.  It is another progressive step in this area.  On the proposed interdepartmental group, it is important that community groups working directly with young people are represented on it.    </p><p>Child abuse and neglect require a multi-pronged approach that includes not only legislation but also funding for the vital resources and supports required in dealing with a family crisis, homelessness or a housing crisis.  It is important that as a result of this greater awareness of child abuse in society there are in place programmes and plans for dealing with cases when they are reported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700024#W00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Children First Bill which is important and long-awaited legislation.  The Children First guidelines were first published in 1999 and an important first step in enshrining child welfare and protection measures in law.  The guidelines aimed to help in the identification and reporting of child abuse, but they did not place a statutory duty on individuals to report suspicions of abuse or harm.  There were significant delays on the part of the previous Government in progressing the guidelines.  In 1997 the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats programme for Government committed to introducing mandatory reporting of child abuse.  In 1998 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, reaffirmed to the D&aacute;il that mandatory reporting would be introduced during the lifetime of that Government.  However, it left office in 2002 having not delivered.  In June 2009, following the significant public response to the Ryan report, Fianna F&aacute;il again committed in the Ryan report implementation plan to legislate by December 2010 to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing.  A year later in June 2010 the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State with responsibility for Children, Mr. Barry Andrews, repeated this commitment to introduce draft legislation by end of that year.  However, the December 2010 Ryan report deadline was also missed by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p><p>  I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for bringing the Bill to the House and her tireless efforts in putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing.  The Bill does exactly what it says on the tin, namely, it puts children first.  So often in the past we have heard the phrase, &quot;Children should be seen and not heard&quot;.  That is no longer acceptable.  The Children First guidelines are about giving children a voice and listening to them.  We all recall the harrowing accounts of abuse contained in the Ryan, Murphy and Ferns reports which detailed the abject evil inflicted on many young, innocent children by some members of the clergy and those working in State institutions.  Such abuse also happened in family homes, but we will never read reports on it. </p><p>Such abuses also happened in family homes, but we will probably never read about many of them.  That is why it is so important to have a mandatory reporting system in place.  It would bring cases of abuse, no matter where they happened, to the attention of the authorities.</p><p> On entering office in 2011, the Government was determined to address the many outstanding issues relating to children and child protection.  For the first time in the history of the State, the Taoiseach created a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs and appointed a dedicated Minister with responsibility for children who sits at the Cabinet table.  For many years, the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been to the fore in changing children's lives and looking after their priorities.  Although the Children First legislation began its journey in 1999, it has taken a Fine Gael Minister to strengthen the provisions of the Children First guidelines and bring the Bill to the floor of the House.  The Minister has a wealth of knowledge and expertise in this area.  Her professional experience in social work is a great asset to her in her ministerial role.  Her genuine understanding of children's welfare has been of great benefit in developing the legislation.  Many years ago she played a huge part in the new St. Michael's estate and Fatima Mansions where she worked daily.  She was instrumental in the success of the children's rights referendum in 2012 which changed the Constitution in order that it protected children, supported families and treated all children equally.  </p><p> The Children First Bill was finally published in April this year.  It is one element of a broader set of measures aimed at strengthening child protection laws.  The Minister and the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, have been instrumental in bringing the legislation into focus.  The purpose of the Bill is to make further and better provision for the care and protection of children, including through raising awareness of child abuse and neglect, providing for reporting and the management of child protection concerns and improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services for children.  The Bill will require mandatory reporting of child abuse, ill-treatment and harm.  Mandatory reporting will place a legal duty on specified persons, generally health professionals and other individuals working closely with children, to report suspected or known abuse to a relevant authority.  Mandated persons include, among others, medical practitioners, registered nurses, teachers, social workers, garda&iacute;, members of the clergy, preschool child care staff and child protection officers of religious, sports, cultural, recreational and educational organisations offering services to children.  In the past there was always a duty to report and people knew they should report, but there was no obligation to do so.  The Bill states information on harm to children, past, present and future, must be reported.  To harm, as defined in the Bill, is to assault, ill-treat, neglect or sexually abuse a child.  The Bill will require certain persons or service providers to make reports to the Child and Family Agency on children in certain circumstances; require certain persons to assist the Child and Family Agency in certain circumstances; carry out risk assessments on potential harm to children; and prepare child safeguarding statements.</p><p> In 2012 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, debated the Children First guidelines and there was a positive reaction overall to the increased focus on child protection from the relevant stakeholders who attended the hearings.  However, I regret that some of the excellent suggestions contained in the submissions were not included in the final Bill.  Perhaps the Minister might review some of these suggestions.</p><p> It is welcome that the Bill requires organisations providing services for children to keep them safe and produce a child safeguarding statement.  The list of mandated persons includes child protection officers performing the child welfare and protection functions of religious, sports and recreational organisations offering services to children.  There has, however, been some criticism that the definition of &ldquo;mandated persons&rdquo; is not broad enough to cover those working in organisations focused on child protection, welfare and rights services.  The ISPCC is an example.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p><p> There is an omission in the Bill in that local and voluntary organisations are not specifically mentioned in the list of mandated persons.  We need clarification in respect of small, local organisations and need to know whether they are included in the Bill and, if not, why not?  I have some concerns about the fact that it is not an offence under the Bill to fail to report suspicions of harm to children.  However, I recognise that the Children First Bill forms part of a raft of legislation that includes the Withholding of Information Act and the national vetting bureau legislation, under which serious sanctions apply.</p><p> An important feature of the new child protection legislation is the creation of the Child and Family Agency.  On 1 January the agency became an independent legal entity, comprising the former HSE child and family services, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and a number of other child services.  It represents the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.  It brings together for the first time social workers and staff in community-based services, educational welfare and social care services to work in partnership with voluntary and State agencies.</p><p> To quote the Minister, &quot;We are going to move from a position where child and family welfare was barely a priority to a position where it will be the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, with a ring-fenced budget ... and streamlined management, overseen by a single dedicated Government Department.&rdquo;  I welcome this.  It is an important step in developing a strong framework for child protection in Ireland.</p><p> Part 4 of the Children First Bill allows for the establishment of a Children First interdepartmental implementation group on a statutory basis and the drawing up of sectoral implementation plans.  The aim of the implementation group will be to promote compliance and monitor implementation of Children First by various Departments.  This is another very important element of the Bill that I welcome.</p><p> With the publication of the Ryan report and other reports documenting unspeakable abuse and cruelty towards children, it became painfully clear that child abuse had been widespread in Irish society for centuries but had been hushed up, covered up, ignored and often not believed.  Child abuse and neglect were happening in many communities but were hidden away and never spoken about.  Children did not have a voice.  It is only in the past few years that child protection cases have come into the public domain and the perpetrators of abuse have been identified and convicted.  We have heard horrific accounts of child abuse and neglect and while many cases have now come to light, many more have not and will never be heard because many of the victims have passed away.  This cannot be allowed to happen again.  The Bill will result in increased reporting of abuse and appropriate action being taken immediately.  While most of the cases that have come to light involved awful sexual and physical abuse, there are also cases of emotional and verbal abuse which are often more likely to be hidden or ignored.  There are also cases of homes in which substance abuse, of the abuse of alcohol or drugs, or both, is rife and ravaging children&rsquo;s lives daily.  Such abuse can leave children with lifelong scars.  It never leaves them.  Even if they do reach out and seek help or counselling, the abuse can still be a great burden.</p><p> I acknowledge the many voluntary organisations and agencies that work with children.  I have experience of working with children in a voluntary capacity in the community and greatly enjoy it.  From a young age, I worked in my community and saw at first hand the effects of the trauma experienced by young children abused in the home.  One could tell from the moment a child walked through the youth club door that he or she was living through hell at home, a place in which he or she should feel safe, loved and protected.</p><p>We must, therefore, recognise the genuine dedication of local people to children in their communities.  For decades, volunteers throughout the country ran youth clubs, sports clubs, drama groups and so on and never looked for payment or recognition.  Today, voluntarism has all but gone and, while it is still evident to some extent, people are now reluctant to become involved.  Perhaps this Bill might change their minds and make them realise that the wealth of their experience is needed in a community.  I simply make the point that one of the reasons for this reluctance to volunteer is the difficulty encountered in Garda vetting, an issue which needs to be examined.</p><p> I spoke about the way verbal and emotional abuse could affect young children.  I had experience of this a couple of years ago with one of my own children.  She was in a club where, unfortunately, the person running the club decided they would use her as a bouncing ball in order to abuse her verbally and emotionally.  The abuse has not left her to this day and is very much part and parcel of the baggage she carries with her.  I believe there are many children who need to be protected, whether they are in an organised organisation or a voluntary organisation.  As a previous speaker said, we all want to love our children; we hope we love them and that we mind them in the right way.  However, there is a section of society that does not believe children have these rights.</p><p> I would like to conclude with a quote from the late Nelson Mandela who said: &quot;There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.&quot;  It is most important for all of us that, in all of our souls, we are all children and if we are not treated right, it reflects on us for the rest of our lives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1014" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700026#Y00300"><p>I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for making the Children First Bill a priority during this term.  The Bill has been a very long time coming, with child protection legislation having been promised in 1997 and again in 2010.  The establishment on a statutory footing of the protection and welfare of children through the Children First Bill is certainly a very important step and the introduction of the legislation marks a key achievement in meeting the commitments in the programme for Government.  Putting parts of the Children First guidelines, a key recommendation made in the 2009 Ryan report, on a statutory footing will provide the necessary measures to ensure the protection of children will last for generations.  The Bill also showcases the fundamental importance of having a dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a permanent seat at the Cabinet table.  It will form an essential part of the foundations of child protection in the State and work to protect some of our society's most vulnerable members.  We must all recognise the solid basis the Bill provides for the safety of children throughout Ireland - the protection of those who are the future of society.</p><p>  I welcome the main provisions of the Bill.  The requirement placed on those organisations which provide services for children to develop a child safeguarding statement is very positive.  Section 10 provides that such organisations will have to carry out an assessment of the possible risks of harm to children to create the basis for their child safeguarding statements and said organisations will, therefore, have an incentive to reduce the levels of risk to which children are exposed.  This will have to be carried out within three months following the commencement of the Bill and must be provided for staff members, parents and guardians on request.  I find it very important to mention that harm includes not only the act of harm and the circumstances which leads to harm but also the fact that it can occur owing to omission.  As many have Members mentioned, this is a critical part of the legislation.  The inclusion of omission, I hope, will act as a catalyst to deter people from turning a blind eye to abuses or the risk of abuse and, therefore, build a safer environment in which children can grow.</p><p>  Section 11 identifies mandated persons who have a responsibility under this legislation to report any information which they gain on child abuse and any child protection concerns they have to the Child and Family Agency which will be known as Tusla.  I am enthusiastic about this provision as it will stop non-reporting in instances where children are being abused.  Furthermore, on occasions where a child reports that he or she is being abused or has been abused, or is at risk of being harmed, it is the responsibility and statutory obligation of a mandated person to report the matter to Tusla.  It is a positive development to see that first-hand views of children must be taken into account for the appropriate action to be taken, should it be necessary.  Not only will such provisions ensure the protection of children is guaranteed the importance it deserves but they will also work to change the culture surrounding child protection for the better.  The requirement on mandated persons to assist the Child and Family Agency, if they are requested to do so, in assessing child protection risks will further facilitate such a change in culture.  After all, as the Minister has previously stated, one main purpose of the legislation is making best safeguarding practice the cultural norm for anyone working with children.</p><p>  The development of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group is a very encouraging sight and I thank the Minister for including the provision in the Bill.  The role of the group in reviewing the implementation of the legislation is a factor which will allow for its ongoing success in practical terms.  The group will include a representative from each Department.  Furthermore, it will provide the Minister with an annual report on the proposed Children First legislation.  This will continue to promote the implementation of the proposed legislation into the future, until such time as implementation becomes second nature and is viewed as merely being best practice.  I also commend the co-operation between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Through preparing the first draft of the heads of the Children First Bill, in conjunction with the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act which passed through the committee of which I am member, this will allow for this Bie to fit perfectly into a suite of legislation.</p><p>  As the proposed Children First legislation is designed to work in tandem with the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, it will be possible to impose serious sanctions, particularly for the withholding of information from the Garda.  The imposition of sanctions for the withholding of information is a positive step, as it will truly send the message that children are not second-class citizens and cannot be treated as such.  In addition, where a mandated person is found to have put a child at risk of harm, information can be passed to the National Vetting Bureau in this regard, while sanctions can also be imposed by the employer or a professional body responsible for the regulation of relevant professionals in this circumstance.</p><p>  The reorganisation which has taken place in the Child and Family Agency which has focused its Children First service as a national service, will assist greatly in making increased levels of child protection a reality throughout the State, with no area being left behind.  Having local information officers working as part of a national team will facilitate this further.  I am glad to see that the training framework is going to be put in place in the implementation of the proposed legislation.  The Child and Family Agency has worked with city and county child care committees to create a &quot;train the trainers&quot; system of training.  Staff members in each of these child care committees have knowledge of how to provide training for those who work with individuals in child care settings.  The fact that this is now in place with national cover will allow us to hit the ground running in the implementation of child protection legislation.</p><p>  I welcome the Bill which I see as a positive step in protecting children throughout the State.  Its main provisions, including the development of a child safeguarding statement, the identification of mandated persons and their responsibilities and the establishment of the Children First interdepartmental implementation group which will provide the foundations for ongoing child protection measures, are fundamental protections and children in the State deserve no less.</p><p>In addition, the proposed legislation will form the cornerstone of a suite of interacting legislation.</p><p> I repeat my commendation of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs because the work that she, her team and Department have undertaken in developing the Children First Bill is extraordinary.  It serves to highlight her commitment to work in the best interests of children and families throughout the State both now and for future generations.  I again thank her and the Cabinet for bringing forward this extremely important legislation.</p></speech>

Durkan is graciously generous to a fault.</p><p>  I say, &quot;Well done,&quot; for bringing forward this legislation.  I did not prepare a paper on it, but I want to make some observations on the narrative as I see it.  It is only a kerbside experience.  As a father of four adult children who has seen them grow up through their early years, school and involvement in sports into manhood and womanhood, I have learned a lot.  The great US entertainer Bill Cosby, a very talented man who has a master's degree in psychology, is a saxophone player and was possibly the highest earning entertainer in the world until Oprah Winfrey overtook him, noted that before he got married and had a family, he had many theories about what was good in child rearing.  He then had five children and no theories.  </p><p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, there are many uncharted waters for every human being who comes into this world.  It is interesting that child labour, often involving children climbing up chimneys to clean them, occurred in so-called civilised societies, including those following Judaeo-Christian customs and norms.  Kaiser Wilhelm II who was at the pinnacle of society in pre-First World War Germany had survived a very difficult birth with a deformity.  In order for the appearance of the future king to be the right, he was manipulated and abused as a child and put into steel braces for up to 12 years to correct what nature had done to him during his arrival into the world.  It crippled him psychologically and led him to do things as a leader of one of the most industrialised countries in the world he might not have done otherwise.</p><p>  Looked at in very simple terms, there is one exhortation from centuries back, that if a person scandalises children, it would be better if a millstone was tied around his or her neck and he or she was thrown into the depths of the sea.  That is a very simple exhortation in terms of the respect we all need to give children because as Deputy Catherine Byrne said, the child within us never leaves us.  It is that very sacred and unique aspect of each individual that we aim to cherish and encourage.  </p><p>  I will recount a personal experience in the wake of the child abuse scandals in the sport of swimming.  My children had begun to take part in competitive swimming and the club they were joining had just experienced the trauma of the revelation of sexual abuse by an Olympic coach.  The club and families involved were traumatised.  I was asked whether I would take on the role of president of the club and Leinster Swimming for one year to create a distinct line between what had occurred up to that point and what would happen in the future.  I did not want that chalice because of all that had happened, but I did it because we had not been involved and children in the sport needed to break from the past rather than have the sport closed down.  I, therefore, have first-hand experience of the difficulties involved.  </p><p>  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, regardless of how theoretically sound the framework and the law are, it is practical experience and living through the different aspects of life that count.  We need a change of culture rather than legislation.  Some of the tribal cultures of what we call primitive societies protect their children better than the more sophisticated and complex societies.  It is about a culture of norms and environments that are de-stressed.  There are huge stress levels in complex societies.  There is financial stress for two thirds of this society which will remain for ten to 15 years.  It is horrible that one third of society will survive relatively unscathed the deep distress and financial depression that still lingers unnecessarily for two thirds of society because of the unfair outcomes of the financial collapse.  </p><p>  I will stray a little, but it is relevant because it is connected to the topic.  It is too easy and glib to blame greedy developers and politicians, but it could not have happened without the credit bubble which was the responsibility of the boards of directors of banks.  It created the environment that remains and will remain unless we have the courage to insist on a debt write-down with our European partners.  Members may think I am out of order in mentioning this, but I am not because this atmosphere is like a fog that has caused depression for far too many.  We have not seen the faces of those who were on the boards of banks and abandoned the principles of fractional reserving in 2001.  They have not told us what they knew or did not know about the policies that should have been in place but were not all that time.  We owe it to our children.  That is the connection.  This is called the Children First Bill.  There are families which have been destroyed, are depressed and distressed because of the outcome and the wreckage that has been left.  One can measure the progression of the credit bubble and the culpability of the boards by looking at the balance sheets of the banks and building societies from 2001.  The sector has a culpability figure of 92%.  It is measurable.  We should start with the debate we might have been having on the banking inquiry, except that we need four days leading in to it.  We do not need outside financial consultants.  The reason I am saying this is children are suffering.  That is the reality.</p><p> When one codifies the law, which is what we are doing, one can sometimes digress from the practicalities of creating a culture and an environment which is safe for children.  The visual exposure of children on television and videos, etc., is deeply upsetting.  It is upsetting to me, as an adult, yet it will become the norm in the visual imagery in the minds of children.  It is not right.  One does not need a law to stop this; one merely needs good common sense.  We can excuse ourselves from using our common sense by patting ourselves on the back and saying we have articulate and complex legislation that hides us from the raw reality that in scandalising the little ones one deserves to have a millstone placed around one's neck and be placed in the sea.  It is a simple sentence and in any language we all know what it means.</p><p> The contributions of the women Members in the D&aacute;il and those who have supported the Bill through the Department are hugely important because women are the mothers of the children whom we are trying to protect and who have that close bond from the get-go, even before children are born, with their well-being.  It is always important for men to listen to what they have to say in this matter.</p><p> My contribution may seem kaleidoscopic, but it is connected with experience.  It is giving a narrative and putting flesh onto the legislation which, by its nature, has to be set out in codes, paragraphs, articles, sub-articles, etc.  When one starts to define what people have got to do, one can miss the point.  Our culture deserves to have an injection of generosity and that we, as public representatives, talk about this, that we not be afraid to talk about it and that we state it is not good enough to see the exposure of multiple matters such as gratuitous violence on television.  One would not allow weeds to become rampant in one's garden or chemicals to be used that would damage growth in it.  Why should we allow our minds and spirits to become corrupted or contaminated?  It is merely good sense.</p><p> When we look at those families in distressed regions of the world where there is no food or water, there still is great protection and shelter, warmth and love, for the children, no matter how distressed are the adults.  One does not see perverse behaviour towards the children, yet in more complex and sophisticated societies one can get weird stuff that is hidden in darkness and the occult on the Internet and elsewhere.  We need to get back to basics.</p><p> As I stated, in the banking inquiry we need to look at the basics.</p></speech>

It has been long-awaited.  It was spoken about for a long time, during which many commentators pointed to the need for it.  The Minister went about it in the right way in the sense that the day a Minister enters office for the first time is the day the target has to be set because it takes approximately three years to achieve it.  That is exactly what it took in this case.</p><p>  This is ground-breaking legislation.  Let us not forget that there are peculiar attitudes in this country and worldwide about children and what is deemed to be neglect and abuse.  It comes after a long history of appallingly sad events in the way children were dealt with in our society.  It is an appalling reflection on the degree to which society did not seem to care because, obviously, children were young and innocent and perhaps, in some cases, not able to communicate.  In many cases, they did, but they were not believed.  Even when it was obvious that there were serious issues that needed to be dealt with, they still were not believed.  We should learn one or two lessons from this.  The innocence of children is something we must always try to protect because to pollute the mind of a child is an appalling act.  It is unpardonable, not only for the perpetrator but also for society, on which it reflects.</p><p>  Every one of us in this House has dealt during the years with serious cases in which there was evidence of child abuse in various forms, whether it be physical, mental or sexual, or by silence and control.  It is sad that we did not learn enough and did not learn in time and, for some unknown reason, continued to pursue policies that were more in keeping with a Dickensian age.  I was a member of the visiting committee of the health board many years ago and it was appalling to observe the neglect inflicted on innocent children who knew of no reason for the neglect and had nobody to whom they could talk, the reason being they had special needs.  These poor children had, for want of a better description, been &quot;detained&quot; in utterly appalling conditions.  My biggest concern at the time was that there were persons in charge who did not think there was anything wrong with it and that it could continue.  That is merely one of many instances about which I spoke in the House at least 30 years ago.  Sadly, it took the scandals and upheavals of recent years to finally bring recognition to bear on us and recognise that something had to be done about it.  One should not forget that in the recent referendum campaign on the rights of children 100% of the population were not in agreement with the proposal, which is also a sad reflection on our society.  </p><p>  At this stage, we should compliment the Minister on having the courage to stay resolutely with the task of bringing the legislation before the House.</p><p>We hope it will do the job it is intended to do.  If legislation does not work to the extent intended, it should be re-examined.  I have said this about all legislation during my time in this House.  If it transpires that there are weaknesses in legislation, we should be able to amend it where possible and not wait an abnormally long time before doing so, as the Minister will readily recognise.  Obviously, we cannot get everything right at the first attempt all the time, but we hope it will be done in this instance.</p><p> We all need to be aware of the reportage on child abuse.  We have all seen situations where we would have had inner concerns about what might happen behind the halldoor to children, women, teenagers, people with special needs and other vulnerable persons.  There may be other competing issues in a household also.  Some such cases have, unfortunately, ended tragically.  On occasion, we pointed to the likelihood of something of that nature happening, although we were not always believed, no more than adults were when they protested during the years about how they had been treated as children.  Some of them did not realise they were being abused, as we must remember an innocent child believes what he or she is told.  They believed the treatment to which they were being subjected was normal and that that was the way life was in society.  It is sad. </p><p> We have still not addressed all of these issues, but, at least, this legislation sets down fundamental guidelines and parameters within which action can be taken in the interests of children.  The Children First Bill is well named in that the child should be our first concern.  Children are vulnerable and dependent on those around them, as well as on their circumstances.  We failed to address that issue for a very long time.  At this late stage, I hope we can fully recognise our failings in that regard.  There must be a commitment by everybody and society at large, both within and outside families, to ensure it does not recur.</p><p> Even in recent times we have had examples of some peculiar activity concerning those charged with the responsibility of looking after children, but that should not happen in a civilised society.  I wonder whether we are, to some extent, governed by modern communications technology, including the Internet.  Child abuse is perpetrated through the electronic media, yet, amazingly, it seems nobody can do anything about it.  I do not agree, however, that it is impossible to control it.  When technology is established, electronic or otherwise, it must be possible to control it and quickly.</p><p> A previous speaker referred to the portrayal on television of violence against women, children and other vulnerable persons.  Of course, the human mind is conditioned by this and after a while, people expect that this is part and parcel of life.  Children will be influenced by something like this very quickly and come to believe it is the normal way to behave.  They, in turn, will treat other children in the same way as it is depicted in the media.  </p><p> Internet grooming is another issue that has arisen in recent years.  We know it goes on, but we are having great difficulty in dealing with it.  One person's freedom can involve the incarceration of another or the restriction of his or her rights.  When any person, group or agency seeks to restrict the rights and entitlements of a vulnerable dependant such as a child or older person, it reflects badly on our society.</p><p> In our clinics we all meet the parents of children with special needs.  They are valiantly providing for their families and trying to make available to their children whatever facilities can be obtained.  I pay tribute to parents in such circumstances.  It bring tears to one's eyes the degree to which such parents, usually mothers, will go to the ends of the earth to achieve the best possible outcome in what appear to be appalling and depressing circumstances.  </p><p> The Celtic tiger implosion may have been good in that it has brought us all to our senses.  It is not all about material things because there are other aspects also.  In rebuilding our society I hope we will have greater regard for the needs of those who look up to us for support and an improvement in their quality of life.  They depend on us, as legislators, to give the lead.  We should know what we are doing and be forward thinking.  </p><p> The threat posed by Internet pornography has serious implications for children.  People may say it can be blocked off on television, but there are other ways of circumventing this and hackers are past masters at doing so.  They specialise in it.  The problem does not affect this country alone but also various other jurisdictions, including Belgium and the United States, where appalling atrocities have been perpetrated on children through the use of electronic media.  In Nigeria recently children were taken away from their school and are going to be sold into slavery.  What an appalling thing to do to another human being in a so-called civilised society.  It is all very fine for us to say it did not happen here.  That may be so, but other things did happen here that were of no great credit to us.  We are living in a very cold and callous society, even though we have been known for our charity and concern.  That is as it should be, but let us not forget that we have been callous in turning the other way and averting our gaze from the kinds of thing that occur which are a major slur on society.</p><p> From time to time, like others in the House, I have had to deal with the question of reporting suspicious circumstances.  The difficulty is that one is loath to err by suggesting something might be wrong if, in fact, it is not.  When I was first elected to the House many years ago, I used to be scared that anything I might say might not be factual.  Having listened to some of the things said in the House during the years, however, I have reassured myself that one should not have to worry about such things.  In the event that we have a deep suspicion that something is not as it should concerning children, we must always take action.  We should seek reassurance and report to the appropriate authorities in whatever way we can, not to undermine the character of the people or institutions concerned but to try to ensure children are cared for as they should be.  We must seek to avoid neglect and the kinds of situation we have had during the years where children were simply ignored.  In so doing we will set a new standard for the future.</p><p> I hope the legislation will the job it is intended to do.  It is extremely broadly-based and the provisions the Minister has made are adequate to do the job.  However, there are always instances in which someone ignores the obvious.  It is amazing.  If people ignore the obvious in a situation such as this, which is not to say the Minister or anyone else can patrol or supervise every institution or circumstance, it is important that there be a clear recognition that there must be retribution and accountability, for which I am afraid we are not great in this country.  Sadly, the chances are that someone will say, &quot;Look, in the circumstances of the time, it was not possible,&quot; refer to the one hand and the other and express all of the other nonsense spoken from time to time.  I hope, however, that the legislation will stand the test of time and do the job it is intended to do, which is to put children first.</p></speech>

It does what it says on the tin and puts children first.  It is long overdue.</p><p>  Having listened to the debate this evening and since the Minister introduced the legislation, I note that others have contextualised the Bill in terms of where the country has come from.  It is no harm to do that.  Every morning every Member walks in past the Proclamation.  We were in Arbour Hill this morning to commemorate those who gave their lives in 1916.  The Proclamation set out the aspirations of the Republic that was to be founded in the aftermath of the Easter Rising.  Looking at that Proclamation, how it was delivered and the context in which it was proclaimed, and looking at Ireland in 2014, we see that over the 98 years since 1916 we have not lived up to the aspirations set out in respect of children.  We probably did not live up to the aspirations for women either.  The opening salvo in the Proclamation refers to &quot;Irishmen and Irishwomen&quot;.  It identifies them as equals.  Our legacy over the last 98 years in the protection of children has not been a very proud one, and this is something on which we must work harder.  Over the intervening period, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Kilkenny incest case and a host of other horrific matters fell out of the media night after night.  Even now, in 2014, those cases continue to shock.  They still send a shiver down the spine when they are recalled.  They have been dramatised in films such as &quot;Song for a Raggy Boy&quot;.</p><p>  As a society, collectively, and as a Government and people, we must apologise and pay respect to the children who were dealt an appalling hand by the State and by accidents of birth.  One of the most horrific places I have ever been is the graveyard at Letterfrack in Galway.  There is a small graveyard there attached to what was an industrial school.  The tiny headstones are a constant physical reminder to us - if we ever needed it - of how we failed not just one generation of children but countless ones.  The previous speaker referred to the ills of the Internet and social media, but we must look at the positive side of those and of lifting the lid on a horrendous time in our history.  One gets to look in and see what was done in the name of the State and of institutions which were looked up to in a lot of cases and which failed children by not providing the protection, education and shelter they needed.  In many cases, they were severely lacking.</p><p>  That was the context.  If we fast-forward to 2011, we see a Government giving children the recognition they deserve by providing them with a voice at Cabinet for the first time since the Proclamation was issued on the steps of the GPO and a commitment was made to cherishing the children of the nation.  It was not until then that the voice of the child was heard in a forum in which it mattered - at the Cabinet table, over which decisions are taken which have an impact on children who are vulnerable on foot of their age and the accidents of birth which determine the homes into which they may or may not be lucky enough to fall into.</p><p>  The Bill identifies a number of things.  I was not a member of the committee that deliberated on this over a number of meetings, but there is a concern I have.  The Bill places on people an obligation to report.  No one disputes that that is in the best interests of the child.  However, there may be instances of intentional failure where it can be proven beyond any doubt that mandated persons intended not to make a report.  Perhaps the person might know the abuser or the child's family.  Where there is an intentional and clear lack of commitment to the child, there must be consequences.  Reading the Bill, which has rightly been welcomed by children's organisations, and the media commentary on it, I wonder if we will be looking at it in future and asking if there was a need to put a penalty in place as a safeguard in respect of mandated persons.  While I hope it does not arise, we never know what situations will occur.</p><p>  The people who went before us in the House 30 and 40 years ago never thought they would see what fell out of the cupboards in terms of the abuse that was being carried out in the name of the State.  Honourable men and women sat on both sides of the House.  They were probably kept in a cocoon or a cloud of denial through an intentional campaign by those who were put in charge of children not to bring forward information that was absolutely necessary.  That was the way it was and one simply did not talk about those things.  I acknowledge that the Bill has a long way to go, but I wonder if consideration might be given to penalties for those who intentionally withhold information and put a child at risk.</p><p>  The Bill addresses the issue of neglect.  As someone who taught for a short period, I was trained at Mary Immaculate College, where we looked at the concept of neglect.  I have mentioned to the Minister previously the concepts of shelter, food and nourishment, which are hugely important.  A child may not report for school week after week and be missing in the roll book.  Some children are present at school for a fixed period in the run-up to the delivery of a sacrament before going missing.  Where a child vanishes off the face of the earth, as does his or her family, there is an onus on the State to find out what is happening in his or her home.  It is all well and good for the child to be instructed in the sacraments.  While I am a huge advocate of that, there is a caveat.</p><p>It is seriously questionable when a child is taken out of school after receiving sacraments in the local parish and the family vanishes into thin air with no follow-up from State agencies to see what kind of schooling the child is getting and whether the child's best interests are being served.  The child is still an Irish citizen, regardless of whether the child is in this jurisdiction or another.  There is an onus on the State to break the cycle whereby children are being taken into and out of schools just to fulfil particular elements of what the family requires.  It must be examined.</p><p> I welcome the associated legislation produced by this Government in the run-up to this Bill, including criminal justice legislation such as the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act.  Having heard the news of the resignation of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I would be remiss in not paying tribute to him for the work done on the protection of children.  There will be argy-bargy afterwords on &quot;Prime Time&quot; on RTE and on TV3 about the resignation, but that does not take from the fact that Deputy Alan Shatter did a huge amount of good work in protecting the children of this country.  It behoves the House to acknowledge that in whatever way.  The evening should not pass, when talking about legislation that is inextricably linked to the criminal justice system, without our paying tribute to him.</p></speech>

They are cheek by jowl with children on a daily basis and they have an important role to play, but they need to be supported, resourced and trained.  They need to be sensitive.  When the heads of the Bill were being examined, some of the contributors at the committee meeting were reluctant to suggest penalties for people who did not engage in mandatory reporting because they worried that the system would be clogged with frivolous reports.  That misses the point, which is the protection of the child.  If there is any doubt whether a child of five, six or seven years of age is at risk, there is a duty to report it, and mandated people working with children on a daily basis cannot brush it off.  Mandated people should not make a decision on whether to report on their own.  Support mechanisms need to be put in place on a localised basis.  In the Bill, the Minister has set out the criteria for interdepartmental work, but it must get into the staffroom in the school.  The teacher must be comfortable telling the principal or colleagues or seeking advice on how to deal with the child about which there is suspicion.</p><p>  I return to the issue of neglect.  For teachers, there is not much point in marking the roll book in a classroom on a daily basis if they do not feel they are being supported by the State in the imposition of the law.  The interdepartmental element includes the HSE, social workers, the Department of Education and Skills and everyone working at the macro level, but at the micro level, whether in a small village, a small town or a community in an urban area, people must feel resources are available from which they can seek advice.  It may not involve a report but clarification of what people can do about a particular child they have worries about when the child is acting differently on a particular day.</p><p>  Positive work has been done on Garda vetting.  I am involved with community groups that work with children and take children overseas.  We go through hoops to be Garda vetted, and these are properly constructed and are in place for a very good reason.  Many people moan about the fact that one must be vetted each time one signs up to a new organisation.  I would love to see a Garda vetting passport that could be renewed every six months or two years and was a live document that could be taken from one organisation to another or to schools.  Every time one joins an organisation dealing with children or vulnerable adults, one must be vetted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A live document could be accessible by mandated people, such as a local Garda superintendent, and this would make it easier than having to go through the same rigmarole upon joining a new organisation.</p><p>  The previous speaker referred to the horrific scenes in Nigeria over the past few days.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has a particular interest in inter-country adoption and in taking children from particularly vulnerable parts of the world and giving them opportunities in Ireland.  She must be credited for this.  The scenes in Nigeria are horrendous.  If the House can encourage the Nigerian authorities or be of assistance to the European Union in stopping this, every effort must be made to do so through diplomatic channels, through the Minister's office, through the T&aacute;naiste's office and through the European Council.  That schools are being raided by militia in 2014, with young girls being sold into slave camps, is unbelievable, and no self-respecting democracy should be tolerant of it.  The Nigerian Government requires assistance from the EU, the United States and a host of other places.  Through the offices of the Minister, the Government should make these noises heard at EU and UN level so that we do whatever is necessary to put a stop to this.  This piracy must be stopped.</p><p>  I pay tribute to the Minister for introducing the legislation, which is timely, and I put on record my sincere thanks to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, for everything he did in the area.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

Today is a dark day for children because of the loss of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I happen to share the same political party as the former Minister but, all politics aside, I am not overly political in debate, and certainly not on this occasion.  I am speaking about him as a man and I am fortunate enough to work with children in the care of the State.  I am extraordinarily grateful for the work done by Deputy Shatter, which has had a direct impact on the quality of life of some of our most vulnerable children in the care of the State.  I have never known anyone in the political class who has made such a contribution to children's welfare and well-being.  On a personal note, I am very sad on this dark day when the Minister has had to leave his portfolio because of the amount of legislation he was continuing to champion, including the children and family relationships Bill, which is due before the House in September.  It is pioneering legislation that will have a positive impact on the lives of so many children.</p><p>  Deputy Alan Shatter is a lawyer and understands family law.  He has written numerous books on it, and it was an extraordinary opportunity for the State to have a man with his knowledge of children's rights and issues in that post.  I commend him and thank him for his contribution to the well-being of children over the past three years and, all politics aside, I am sad for the children who have no voice today.  He was an enormous asset for children and, unfortunately, he will not be in that role any more.  I wish his successor well in his or her endeavours.</p><p>  I was recently at a conference on the children and family relationships Bill organised by the Children's Rights Alliance.</p><p>There, I was blown away by the genuine effusiveness of the praise given to Deputy Shatter by all contributors there who were working with children, many of whom were working with very vulnerable children.  People there included people like the former Supreme Court Judge, Catherine McGuinness, Geoffrey Shannon and Tanya Ward from the Children's Rights Alliance.  They were effusive in their praise of Alan Shatter and what he had done for children and their rights.  Not long ago, I heard Fergus Finlay speak on a radio station and when he was asked whether he thought the then Minister should resign, he said he genuinely hoped he would not and that he would get to introduce the changes he was about to bring about.  I acknowledge the contribution of Alan Shatter to the rights of children.</p><p> I welcome this legislation to the House.  It is timely and is a further commitment of the Government.  It is not a solution in itself, but is another step towards ensuring that children and their rights are protected.  Children are our greatest asset.  In regard to the referendum that was passed last November but which is still held up in the courts, I regret that delay because that referendum was a milestone in our society.  It was a referendum that would not have had an impact on the majority of children of this State, but it had an impact in regard to the most vulnerable children, those in the care of the State.  Daily, I regret the delay in being able to implement the changes brought about by that referendum.  Every day gone is a day wasted and I hope the issue gets through the courts quickly and we get to see change being brought about for the children impacted and that their lives will improve.</p><p> Today, I read the 2014 report card issued by the Children's Rights Alliance which welcomed the positive contribution of the Child and Family Support Agency, an organisation with 4,000 employees and a budget of &euro;600 million.  This is another step and welcome development towards improving the lives of so many of our children.</p><p> I have a concern with regard to one area of this legislation and I presume this can be examined further on Committee Stage.  This concerns the need to include foster carers in the mandated section.  Foster carers work with vulnerable and special children and many of them could be in the way of picking up on abuse of children coming into care.  Many foster carers deal with short term care and children come and go through their homes through the system.  I suggest the Minister should consider including a provision in this regard in the legislation further down the line.</p></speech>

The debate has provided an opportunity for me to set out the overall rationale to the proposed legislation and I hope this has been of assistance to Deputies in considering the approach which has been taken in the Bill following detailed policy consideration and consultation.</p><p>  Many Deputies have indicated a wish to work constructively on the Bill and have made suggestions, which I will consider in the course of Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Bill addresses a key recommendation in the implementation plan of the Ryan report, which was published in July 2009.  It also meets the commitment in the programme for Government, which was to put Children First on a statutory basis.  I am satisfied I have fully met the commitment given in regard to legislating for Children First.  To imply otherwise, as some speakers did earlier, is to engage in political point scoring and obfuscation of the real purpose of the Bill.  The goal is not simply to deliver on these commitments, but to improve legislation that will protect children.  The goal is also to ensure the legislation supports the provision of the right information in the right way and on a timely basis so as to guide the actions of the Child and Family Agency in protecting children.</p><p>  In summary, the Bill provides that organisations providing services to children must consider the potential risk to children availing of their services and demonstrate awareness and good practice in a child-safeguarding statement, which will be available to parents and the public generally.  It is important parents ask to see this statement and that it is publicly available for them so they can check out any organisation providing services to children.  A number of Deputies have made the point that they feel there should be consequences if organisations do not have a safeguarding statement and I will consider that.</p><p>  Certain individuals who are mandated persons under the Bill will be required to report child welfare and protection concerns in accordance with the legislation to the agency.  Mandated persons will also be required to report to the agency any disclosures of harm made to the mandated person by a child.  The categories of mandated persons have been set out clearly in the legislation.  It has been decided to focus on a small, qualified cadre of persons.  This is based on evidence, including international research, which suggests that to do so improves the reporting of child welfare and protection concerns which have higher rates of substantiation.  The reporting of harm to children by persons who, by virtue of their training, qualifications and professional experience, are well equipped to recognise harm is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessment of risk by the agency.  In essence, those persons who are mandated to report under the provisions of the Bill are aware of risks to children and of their responsibility in that regard.  It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of a high standard, which will assist the agency in carrying out assessments of risk in an effective and efficient manner. </p><p>  Some Deputies raised concerns that the Bill does not include sanctions for non-reporting of harm by mandated persons.  I wish to point out that this Bill is part of a suite of legislation, including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, wherein there is a criminal sanction for withholding information from the Garda in regard to the abuse of children.  Therefore, as there is already an offence provided for in that legislation, it is not intended to create the same offence in this Bill.  I wish to inform Deputies that careful consideration was given to all aspects of imposing sanctions.  However, in accordance with legal advice and the overall policy objectives, we decided not to impose extra sections.</p><p>  There is a clear obligation in the legislation to report abuse and I believe this will be taken seriously by mandated persons, their employers and their professional bodies and there will be consequences for those professionals who do not report.  The option to report a person to the relevant fitness to practise committee of his or her regulatory body remains open to the child and family agencies.  There is also a link to the national vetting legislation.  Therefore, there may be implications for a person's employment if he or she is clearly seen not to have reported something they should have reported.  I will work further with the interdepartmental group to examine the potential sanctions in regard to funding that could be removed from organisations in which mandated persons work who do not report.  We will examine potential funding consequences where the obligations set out in the Bill have not been met.</p><p>  The committee highlighted the need to include emotional abuse and this was taken on board in the published Bill.  In the drafting of the Bill, I had to take into account that not all forms of abuse are as clear cut as others.  This has particular relevance in the area of creating criminal offences.  I wanted to ensure that when we approached this Bill, we would do so on the basis of what serves best to protect children.  We should not lose this focus in pursuing the legal requirements entailed in criminal prosecutions.  As I have said, these are dealt with elsewhere in other legislation.</p><p>  In parallel with the legislation, promoting awareness among parents and the general public of the importance of child-safeguarding statements can create a powerful influence on service providers to deliver fully on their responsibilities in a transparent fashion.  I thank all Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage on the Children First legislation.</p></speech>

recognises that managing our water resources effectively is also essential to ensure that Ireland can continue to attract major overseas investment and employment;

notes that the:- programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver a clean and reliable water supply which will involve the installation of water meters in all households and the move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance; and

- the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which has been assigned responsibility for economic regulation of the water sector, commenced public consultation on the structure and design of tariffs for both the non-domestic and domestic sector on 17 April 2014 and will finalise the level and structure of the tariffs in August 2014;welcomes the:- progress with the roll-out of the domestic metering programme being delivered by Irish Water with over 200,000 meters installed to date, supporting some 1,150 jobs;

- commitment of Irish Water to maximise the delivery of the domestic metering programme in 2014, on foot of which it is expected that a further 40,000-50,000 meter installations is achievable over and above the 400,000 target for end-2014 already indicated to the CER;

- the indications that progress remains on track for the installation of 1.05 million meters, with programme completion likely to be ahead of the target - mid-2016 rather than end-2016; and

- fact that further options in relation to metering additional properties are under active consideration;welcomes the Government's: package of measures to ensure that domestic water charges are introduced in as fair and equitable basis as possible, with particular reference to the following elements:- Irish Water's Government subvention in 2015 and 2016 to be conditional on the average annual domestic water charge not exceeding &euro;240;

- each household will receive an annual free allowance of 30,000 litres of water and a corresponding allowance for wastewater;

- there will be an additional free allowance for every child under 18 to cover a child's normal consumption of water supplied and wastewater treated of up to 38,000 litres per annum, with the level of consumption underpinning this allowance to be verified from actual metering data;

- the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government intends using his powers under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, to issue a policy direction to the CER requiring:- the domestic water charging regime to remain fixed until end-2016;

- that, for social and environmental reasons, there should be no standing charge for domestic customers - there may be a minimum charge applied to properties that are not permanently occupied, for example, holiday homes;

- assessed charges to be based primarily on occupancy and possibly refined based on data from metered usage to ensure that they are as close a proxy for metered usage as possible;

- the CER to ensure provision for retrospective adjustment of charges including a rebate above a reasonable threshold in the context of transitional arrangements for people moving from assessed to metered charges;

- charges to be capped for people with high water usage due to certain medical conditions; and

- Irish Water to take account of the quality of services provided for customers, including circumstances where services are reduced or restricted, for example, due to boil water notices;commitment to a package of supporting measures under the social protection regime to assist particular groups; and

intention to provide funding to increase investment in public water services infrastructure by &euro;100 million in each of the years 2015 and 2016, including for a scheme to provide each household with a free fix of the first leak on a customer's water supply pipe;supports the Government's overall water funding package, which balances the need for a sustainable funding model to support long-term investment in the sector, taking account of the relevant European rules on Government accounting, while ensuring that domestic water charges are introduced in the most affordable, fair and equitable manner possible; and

welcomes the timely announcement of the package of measures, which responds to the Government commitment to provide early visibility in relation to the level of water charges, in advance of the final determination on charges by the CER, following detailed examination of Irish Water's cost base.- (Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government).</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, admitted on television that some families will be paying up to &euro;450 per year in water charges.  With the Government adhering to its target of taking &euro;500 million from this tax, it is inevitable that some people will be paying more than others.  The Minister is coming back to rifle through the pockets of ordinary people who cannot see how they will pay this additional tax in their current circumstances.  This is not about conservation; it is simply an austerity tax.  If the Government really wanted to encourage water conservation, it would have put the &euro;1 billion it is spending on meters and the &euro;140 million it spent on consultants into fixing pipelines and preventing the loss of 40% of our expensively treated water into the ground.</p><p>  I am delighted to see people coming out in housing estates in Cork and Dublin to protest against the installation and implementation of water metering.  I fully support their action.  These people are not fooled by the sham battle in which Fine Gael and the Labour Party engaged in recent weeks and all the talk of protecting vulnerable people, including the elderly and children.  This is not about the protection of vulnerable people.  It is about the protection of vulnerable election candidates on the doorsteps.  After all, water charging is one of the issues most frequently raised by voters.  The two-year review that has been indicated will see everybody paying much higher water charges thereafter.</p></speech>

I have a copy of the KPMG report the Minister commissioned at that time, which stated that installing domestic water meters would be unproductive, inefficient and not worthwhile based on the revenue likely to be generated.  Instead, the Minister proposed a mechanism whereby the rates support grant to local authorities was increased by allowing them to keep all of the proceeds of motor taxation.  That taxation has increased four times since 1997.  How dare the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and his Government claim that Irish citizens do not pay for water?  The current proposal has nothing to do with paying for water and is, in fact, simply another tollbooth on a necessary public service in order to pay the interest on a debt that was foisted on the shoulders of Irish citizens.</p><p>  As Deputy Joan Collins observed, the sham row is over.  The Government went into this looking to take &euro;500 million out of the pockets of citizens and it has succeeded in that.  If, as the Minister claims, some people will pay less, then we can be sure that some will pay more.  I am shocked at how out of touch the Labour Party is on this issue, which really is saying something.  The idea that obliging the working poor to pay more is somehow a thing to be lauded is amazing.  Moreover, the notion that this is a conservation measure is a joke.  Within a square kilometre of this House, we have a range of public buildings in which no rainwater is harvested.  I doubt if a single kilometre of pipework has been fixed in the three years since the Minister came to power.  It is sickening to note the Government's refusal yesterday to introduce a financial transactions tax - out of step with 11 other EU member states - which would have raised enough to negate the need for water charges.</p></speech>

The Dublin region water supply project, which is sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has noted that 148 litres per person per day is the current average usage.  Moreover, its projection is that with all meters and charging in place, the best possible reduction that can be achieved by 2030 - 16 years from now - would leave average usage at 130 litres per day.  In other words, the supposedly free allowance for 18 years olds is 44 litres per day fewer than current usage and 26 litres per day fewer than the supposed average when the optimum saving is in place.  A 16 or 17 year old does not need to wash less, drink less or use fewer sanitary facilities than a 21 year old.  The Minister's blanket claim of free water for under 18s is a blatant falsehood concocted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to save their skins in the local, European and by-elections in the face of public anger at another austerity tax.</p><p>  In accordance with Standing Order 48 of the D&aacute;il, I give way for the 30 seconds remaining to me to allow the Minister to clarify or withdraw that falsehood.</p></speech>

Fine Gael and the Labour Party are kicking the question of water charges down the road until after the local and European elections, with the decision to be made in August.  On the basis of the interviews and statements made by the Minister yesterday, a household of two adults and two children will pay &euro;360 per year, while a household of three adults will pay &euro;586 per year.  Households with more than one person are being penalised by this so-called Government.  It is particularly shameful that the T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party has agreed to these proposals.  This is a man who built his career on opposition to water charges.  The reality is that we are already paying for water, and these charges amount to double if not triple taxation.  In addition to the so-called local property tax, we will now have a completely unfair and unjust water charging regime.</p><p>  I have two questions for the Minister, which I expect him to deal with in his reply.

I strongly oppose the introduction of water charges, which amount to a new tax on people who are already being hammered and who see 40% of their water supply going into the ground.</p><p>That is both an absolute disgrace and a completely inefficient use of the water system.</p><p> I am becoming somewhat fed up of the brass neck displayed by those in government who continually state that people must pay for water and that everyone must accept their political ideology.  We are already paying for water through taxation.  The Government should fix the leaks, create jobs, get on with it and stop pussyfooting around.  When I buy a packet of cigarettes, 76% of the money I hand over goes in tax.  Annually, this brings approximately &euro;1.2 billion into the Exchequer.  The figures I quote in this regard were provided by the Minister for Finance.  It is because of the additional tax people are expected to pay that protests in respect of water charges are taking place in areas such as Raheny in my constituency.  Water charges are being introduced at a time when hard-pressed taxpayers are already struggling.  I am of the view that these charges are going to push many more people into poverty.  They are being imposed against a backdrop of continuing job losses, falling incomes, tax increases and the introduction of other charges, including the property tax.  The latter is being raided for the purpose of subventing Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> I am calling for water charges to be scrapped, for the return of control of water services to democratically-elected local authorities, for the provision of a statutory binding commitment to the effect that water services will not be privatised, for the development of an all-Ireland strategy on water provision, for the establishment of a national water sector framework under which the operation of and capital investment in that sector might be governed and for investment in upgrading our aging and leaking water distribution system.  I urge all Deputies to support this important motion and oppose water charges, which are nothing more than another tax on the hard-pressed people of this country.  The latter are already being both hammered and crucified.  What the Minister is doing is not good enough.  He needs to up his game and withdraw these charges.</p></speech>

The Dublin region is on a knife edge.  It has no spare capacity and future growth is going to increase pressure on the system.  Throughout the country up to 40% of water is being lost through leakages.  In Dublin, the figure is 28%.  A previous speaker referred to the fact that leaky pipes are not being replaced in certain areas which are not too far from this House.  I welcome the fact that several kilometres of pipes in which leaks were found were replaced in recent years in the Dublin South-East constituency, particularly as this has given rise to an improvement in water pressure.  Most of the water that is lost through leaks disappears as a result of faults in the connection between the main supply and people's houses.  This is why I welcome the fact that from now on - and for the very first time - leaks in connections to private property will be fixed.  This is extremely welcome because it will be both cost effective and will lead to money and water being saved.</p><p>  We are investing - but not sufficiently - in water.  With the establishment of Irish Water we will be able to double the annual investment in infrastructure.  In the short term, we will be obliged to invest approximately &euro;10 billion in the water system in order that we might ameliorate problems in Roscommon, where 19,000 boil notices have been issued to people, and Dublin, where in the past two years it was necessary for water rationing measures, which remained in place for up to six weeks, to be introduced on three occasions.  It would be easy to present that down the road everything will be fine.  However, we must plan now for the economic growth that will occur by 2020 and that will provide the jobs of tomorrow.</p><p>  This is a complex issue.  However, the Government has acted in order to ensure that every householder will receive a free allowance and that water charges will not apply to children and that older people living alone, those with large families or people with serious medical conditions will be protected.  We recognise that families are hard pressed and that is why the Labour Party in government has fought for these measures.  Holiday homes and properties that are not permanently occupied will be subject to a standing charge.  This recognises the cost of providing the network infrastructure.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to travel back in time to 2010.  Unfortunately, Deputy Martin has left the Chamber but I am sure he would recall the national recovery plan which was agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and which incorporated the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding.  Under this plan, those who were in government in 2010 mortgaged the country and committed their successors to introducing water charges by 2014.  It is a bit rich for Eamon Ryan of the Green Party to state that when he signed the bailout agreement, he expected the Labour Party to veto water charges when it entered power.  Mr. Ryan seems to have completely forgotten that the Green Party requested and secured the introduction of water charges in 2009 when it renegotiated its programme for Government with Fianna F&aacute;il.  What is clear is that both Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were in favour of water charges in 2009.  They were so in favour of them that they made their introduction a condition of the EU-IMF bailout.  It should not be forgotten that Eamon Ryan and Deputy Martin were both members of the Cabinet which signed off on the 2009 deal which led us into the bailout.  When the current Administration took power, Fianna F&aacute;il promised to provide responsible opposition.  Now, however, it has returned to its usual trick of shouting loudest.  The latter was probably prompted by the party's fear of Sinn F&eacute;in.  If those in Fianna F&aacute;il cannot even remember their policy on water charges, then it is easy to understand why they cannot recall who they asked to run for the party in Blackrock in the local elections.  Perhaps Deputy Martin and Eamon Ryan should ask Mary Hanafin, who served in Cabinet with them, what was the previous Government's policy on water from 2009 onwards.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not want to allow any of its previous Cabinet Ministers back onto the pitch.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath has been a very good spokesperson on finance.  When this D&aacute;il first convened, he stated that his party would not engage in any tricks.  I recall that he spoke in a very constructive fashion when the deal on the promissory notes was announced.</p></speech>

The need to pay for water was always going to be seen a contentious issue.  However, it was never previously seen as an issue in this country despite the fact that people in rural areas, particularly those who own farms and people in group water schemes, pay for their water.  I am of the view that the real point has been missed during this debate.  The nature of that point is that regardless of what the Government proposes, the Opposition will just say "No" to it.  Those in Fianna F&aacute;il set out what they had planned to do if they had been returned to Government in 2011.  Other Members have indicated that they are completely against water charges but they have not outlined what they would do differently.  The same people are also opposed to the property tax and to tax increases of any kind.</p><p>  This matter relates to the need for major investment in our water services infrastructure.  It has been stated that the money relating to what is being done at present should be used to fix leaky pipes and that this would solve all our problems.  However, the latter would not give rise to the difficulties that exist across the entire country being resolved.  Many counties have been obliged to issue boil notices in respect of water supplies.  Those counties should be the subject of particular attention when Irish Water announces its investment programme.</p><p>  A great deal has been stated in recent weeks with regard to how much people are going to be obliged to pay for water and in respect of those who are going to receive special dispensations.  I welcome the fact that those with specific medical conditions and the elderly will be assisted in the context of paying their bills.  However, the latter does not mean that the level of anxiety experienced by these individuals has been reduced to any great degree.  It is important that we should make it easy for people to pay the charge.</p><p>  The most important point in respect of this matter does not relate to what is going to happen now but rather to what will occur in the future.  The majority of people do not have a difficulty in paying for water as long as they can see that there will be a positive outcome.  It was in this context that much of the anger about Irish Water and the set-up costs relating to it arose.  Perhaps this was a communications issue and the wrong words may have been used at the wrong time.  People immediately became extremely angry when they heard about the millions of euro used to establish this State utility.  Setting it up was never going to be easy, however, particularly when one considers the level of expertise that was going to be required.  Such expertise is expensive.</p><p>What people now want to see is two things.  First, they want the money put into Irish Water - taxpayers' money - to be put into proper infrastructure, not only now but for the next 20 years.  Second, they want any money we invest in Irish Water now to actually save us money in the long run.</p><p> We should ensure one thing in particular since some people are rather angry about this issue.  For the Government to get this right, Irish Water must be set up on a sound financial basis because if the State utility is to work, it must be resourced.  If we are honest with ourselves, a decision such as this should have been made many years ago when there was far more disposable income to pay for it.  The troika may have left the country, but some of the measures it proposed and that are widely used throughout Europe are being implemented.  Anger comes from the fact that people have never had less disposable income.  That is what angers them the most.  These measures should have been brought forward 15 or 20 years ago when there was a greater ability to pay.  We should be cognisant that this is why people are so upset.  From meeting many people I understand they have major concerns about paying for water because this is something we have never done.  It has been said we pay for it through income tax which is spent and prioritised ineffectively.  For the first time, this will allow us to put a vast amount of money into water infrastructure, which is a welcome development.</p><p> The Government committed to getting the information out before the local elections.  That has now taken place.  Some detail remains to come from the bone and the regulator will have to do this.  It is important that the regulator also examine the costs incurred in setting up Irish Water and ensure all of the money was spent correctly and that if any of it was not spent correctly, the bill will fall on Irish Water, not the taxpayer.  Only then will people be able to see that the money invested in Irish Water is being well spent and will gives us the quality of water we need.</p><p> Those of us living in rural Ireland, especially in the constituency of Galway East, know all about this issue.  We are looking for broadband and more power.  Another thing institutions and companies are looking for is a proper water supply.  We must get all three right.  We are still way behind in certain parts of the country, but we are working towards getting this done.</p><p> I have no issue with paying for water.  I realise this is a conservation measure as much as anything else, although some do not want to believe this.  For it to work in the future, we must be able to show that the money being invested in Irish Water is being well spent, that as a result, the infrastructure is being upgraded and brought up to a proper standard and that, consequently, we will be in a better situation where jobs will be created, sustained and spatially spread throughout the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700035#HH00200"><p>I have learned one thing in this House in the introduction of any new charge, levy or tax, that is, it is always an issue of great contention.  By people's nature, especially in a recession, it is difficult for them to invite it into their day-to-day living, especially for those who do not have the greatest of resources.  People have a natural suspicion of any additional charge or tax.   Others have alluded to this, but given the importance of a water supply, the issue should have been dealt with in better times.  Like others on all sides of the House, I acknowledge this fact, but the reality is that it was not done.</p><p>  As a member of a local authority in Dublin, I quickly came to the conclusion that the idea of having different local authorities providing water would not work.  From my experience and speaking to people who worked in local authorities, I came to believe it was never the ideal solution in providing for all citizens of the State a proper drinking water system.  I may be wrong about this, but, whatever its shortcomings, in principle, I agree with the idea of having a water authority because all citizens should have access to a proper drinking water supply.</p><p>  There is more to the question than the simple matter of introducing a levy and charging people for water because it is so basic in our day-to-day living.  It is a great resource, one many people on other continents cannot avail of and which costs them their lives.  I am probably as guilty as anyone else in this regard, but perhaps traditionally we have taken it for granted that the rain falls from the sky into pipes and that when we turn on the tap, it flows, but that is not how it works.  Turning rainwater into drinking water is an expensive process.  Until recently, apart from the Brits, we were probably the only people who actually washed cars and pavements with drinking water.  We buy high pressure hose appliances which can be seen in neighbourhoods and people wash their windows with drinking water.  It is absolutely daft.  If we are to find another way of managing the issues of a charge, conservation and the importance of water, some of the European models are the best ones to examine because the emphasis is placed on those who waste drinking water.  They are the ones who pay for it and that is the view to which I subscribe.</p><p>  I look forward to the Minister's water conservation plan because it is a strong element in how the public will view this measure.  There will be teething problems.  People have made arguments, some of them valid, although I do not agree with all of them, to the effect that we could set up a utility such as Irish water without spending money and that we know all about having a central authority for processing rainwater into drinking water.  However, we do not because it has never been done before in the history of the State.  This is the first time it is being done.  There are problems with it and there will be problems as it moves along, but it is for people like us to tweak it and get the message across that wasting water is almost anti-social.</p><p>  Since the system has been neglected for so long, we find ourselves in this awful position.  Some will argue, probably rightly, that not enough money has been allocated following the Minister's announcement on repairing existing schemes, given the associated shortfall and the question of aged water systems.  However, I welcome this measure and it must be taken.  It will not solve all of the problems, but, as was said at the beginning of the programme, it is a matter of rolling it out properly for all citizens of the State.</p><p>  I have never agreed with having a standing charge.  There are a few exceptions, but I would seldom agree with having a standing charge because such a charge allows those who are better off to pay, while those who are not are put under stress.  I welcome the change and the introduction of the associated allowances.  We have some way to go, but I look forward to the Minister's water conservation plan.</p></speech>

Several points on political expediency should be highlighted.  True to the Taoiseach's commitment, we said we would outline the details of the average charge for water before the local and European elections and we have now done so.  I greatly welcome this.  If Members across the Chamber were in power, I imagine there would be far more sleight-of-hand, as we have seen in the past, in how they faced up to these matters.  Before the last general election, we in Fine Gael were very open about the need for water charges and a local property tax and, knowing this, the people voted for us.  I welcome the introduction of a free allowance of 30,000 litres per household and the additional allowance to cover normal water consumption for children under 18 years.  Effectively, this means that water charges will not apply to children.  The free first fix scheme announced for households, as well as the accelerated metering programme, are also welcome.</p><p>  What we have is a history of vast under-investment.  Fianna F&aacute;il has placed this motion before the House, but the previous Government carries a great deal of culpability, given the years of under-investment in water services.  Someone said to me recently that we had great motorways and roads and asked why the same investment had not been made in the water system.  The comment was made that one could cut a ribbon when a road was opened and that everyone could see it, but if one were to pump all of the money into underground pipes, the political return would not be as much of a hit as those in Fianna F&aacute;il would like.  Therefore, it did not invest and we now have a litany of problems.  There are problems in my constituency, Kildare South, as a result.</p><p>Kildare town still needs a network.  I will lobby for that to be part of the Irish Water work programme.  Osberstown has finally received &euro;32 million - I thank the Minister for his investment - for its plant and network, but the Newbridge interceptor sewer also needs to be upgraded.  The Ballitore treatment plant is close to my home.  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave us &euro;178,000 for a rising main from the new school in the small community of Crookstown, itself a &euro;4 million investment by the Department of Education and Skills.  That main links us to the Ballitore treatment plant, which needs significant investment and is not operational.  In an estate in Millbrook, Timolin, raw sewage has been flowing out onto a footpath for years.  Kildare County Council has spent a fortune in emergency measure funding to empty those tanks.  That is dead money now.  Following the announcement last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, we received a slice of &euro;10 million to address that problem.</p><p> We are firefighting, because these issues occur all over the country.  We must tackle them by ensuring proper investment.  The best way of doing so is to increase expenditure so we might invest in our infrastructure, which has been neglected for a long time.</p><p> I welcome the capping of charges for people with high water usage rates due to certain medical conditions.  A constituent who is on home haemodialysis and uses up to 1,000 litres of water per week approached me.  There are approximately 45 or 50 similar cases around the country.  I do not doubt that the Minister will ensure adequate allowances are provided in such special cases.  A constituent with prostate cancer who needs to bathe regularly also got in touch with me.  We need to show flexibility and care in such circumstances.</p><p> As a farmer whose land gets water from Poulaphouca, I pay whenever my cattle drink water.  I have been paying water bills to Kildare County Council for a number of years.  Likewise the shops, pubs, restaurants and industry in my area.  It is right and proper that everyone should share the burden of paying for what is an important resource for all of us.</p><p> I have raised a concern about Irish Water's establishment with the Minister a number of times.  Kildare County Council has stopped processing taken-in-charge estates in the belief that the Irish Water legislation prevents it from doing so.  I do not accept that the situation is so cut and dry.  The protocols are due out shortly and I hope they arrive as quickly as possible, but I encourage the council to progress the taking in charge of estates.  This is necessary.</p><p> Deputy Connaughton referred to power and water, our two most significant issues and the toughest that politics has had to address in recent months.  Whenever a new manufacturer, pharmaceutical company or other industry is determining whether to set up in an area, it looks for water and power.  We are addressing these infrastructural issues.</p></speech>

I will start by reading into the record, probably not for the first time in this debate, a document dated 10 October 2009, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il's &quot;Renewed Programme for Government&quot;.  The Members opposite will remember this:<blockquote>We will introduce charging for treated water use that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied.  It will be based on a system where households are allocated a free basic allowance, with charging only for water use in excess of this allowance.  In keeping with the allocation of greater responsibility to local government, Local Authorities will set their own rates for water use.</blockquote>This is from the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government's review of its programme for Government.</p><p>I have a further document belonging to Fianna F&aacute;il from 1977, some 37 years ago and before my time or my dad's, in which it abolished local rates, ringing the death knell for the delivery of local services across our country.</p></speech>

It is laughable that the Members opposite sit and point fingers at the Minister, Deputy Hogan, when we are in this scenario because of their failed policies and their failure to provide basic investment for infrastructure that will be necessary if we are to deal with a growing population.  The birth rate is the highest it has been in more than 30 years.  I come from the fastest growing local authority area in Europe.  Its average age is also the lowest in Europe.  There has been a systemic failure by local government, through the funding provided by central government, to invest in water infrastructure.</p><p>  Between 2004 and 2009, my local authority of Fingal County Council, with the little money it had, invested &euro;10 million in 30 km of pipe replacements, including wooden pipes in the north of the county that had been there for God knows how many decades.  Due to the requirement to replace pipes that are damaged or rendered beyond use because of their age, the council must replace an additional 300 km of pipes.  Deputies can work out how long and how much this will take.  In Dublin city, I understand that 800 km of pipes require replacing.  For decades, we have needed to spend money on dealing with constant problems because of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's failure to address basic standards, for example, the use of asbestos pipes in certain instances and the installation of substandard facilities up to and including water treatment plants the length and breadth of the country.</p><p>  It is laughable that the Members opposite have tabled this motion for nothing other than electoral purposes.  Thirty-seven years on from the 1977 general election, electoral purposes are being placed ahead of the State's basic needs.  That is a disgrace.  Fianna F&aacute;il's motion condemns the &quot;cynical, politically motivated delay of information&quot;.  What nonsense is Fianna F&aacute;il talking?  The Cabinet makes decisions on a weekly basis, just as Cabinets under Fianna F&aacute;il's control did for 27 of the past 30 years.  This has always been the case.  We are in a coalition Government and it is clear that there will be different agendas at the Cabinet table.  That is the cut and thrust of politics.  Even if we are to believe that Fianna F&aacute;il has been resurrected from the disgrace it brought upon itself in recent years, not for one second do people believe this nonsense.  No one wants to pay water charges - of that I am certain - but we do not have a choice in the matter because of Fianna F&aacute;il's decisions in 2010.  In 2009, even before we entered into the financial programme of assistance, Fianna F&aacute;il signed us up to water charges.  Here we are with cynical electioneering for the purpose of garnering votes in the local and European elections.</p></speech>

The regime for the delivery of water and sewerage infrastructure that existed heretofore under local authorities with direct funding from the Department did not benefit rural Ireland.  During my time on Mayo County Council, the large population centres, such as those along the east coast, received water and sewerage schemes and, accordingly, State investment while country areas lost out on schemes.  Those that were delivered arrived slowly because they were not commercially viable.  In common with other rural county councils, Mayo County Council could not achieve a "polluter pays" contribution because we were operating on a low rates basis.  Planning levies were also limited, unlike in larger areas that saw significant levels of development and growth.</p><p>  Water infrastructure is vital for rural Ireland.</p><p>We rely on our tourism industry and much of our lands are environmentally sensitive, yet as we speak tonight - this has been going on for years - raw sewage is flowing into rivers, lakes and bays in my county and other rural counties.  Some towns do not have any sewage treatment facilities and raw sewage is being pumped into special areas of conservation.  For example, in the town of Belmullet, the Environmental Protection Agency discharge licence will expire in December 2015.  Something must be done by that time.  Currently, inadequately treated sewage is being pumped into the bay.  This area is specially designated by a European Union directive for the protection of shellfish.  If something is not done about that, who will be prosecuted and fined if there is a diminution of water quality in this area, which is an offence?  Will it be Irish Water?  That would cost the State more money, yet we would still not have a solution and new sewage treatment plants would not be built.</p><p> I have repeatedly made representations for other towns in my county such as Foxford, Charlestown and Killala.  How can such towns and their businesses be sustained and allowed to grow?  How can they attract inward investment when they cannot give an assurance of good water quality or supply?  They need sewage or wastewater treatment plants yesterday.</p><p> Rural Ireland is at a total disadvantage even on the water supply side.  Water pipes are so old in some towns that they have melted in the ground, to coin the phrase of the workmen who are out day and night repairing leaks.  I have looked down some of these holes and one cannot even see a pipe.  We need a plan for timely and systematic replacement of these pipes.  That plan should have been produced yesterday, but it was not.  That evidence proves the system is not working.</p><p> I want to acknowledge mains rehabilitation funding of over &euro;4 million that is coming to my town of Ballina, which has the problem I describe.  Every few days workmen are out on our main busy thoroughfare, the N26, fixing leaks, which stops traffic and affects businesses.  Houses, businesses and companies do not have any water.  This is modern Ireland.</p><p> East Mayo needs a regional water supply scheme to ensure water supply for towns such as Bunnyconnellan, Foxford, Swinford, Charlestown, Kilkenny and Knock, along with Balla and Kiltimagh - the list goes on.  Those are only the towns identified as being urgent cases.  The list has been available for years but nothing has been done.</p><p> We are now facing the publication by Irish Water of the two-year water investment plan.  I very much welcome the additional &euro;200 million that has been put into that fund to be spent on the infrastructure to which I refer.  However, I hope it will be fair to rural Ireland because what has been going on to date has not been fair in that we do not have the infrastructure I have described.  Many people have been patient with the changes, but we need to see equal treatment for the country, as much as for the city areas and the infrastructure, delivered in a timely manner.  Irish Water should not make decisions based on return on investment, which more often than not will see rural areas lose out and the big urban centres gain.  This will be the test for it, and I look forward to seeing a comprehensive plan that will address the problems in the area I represent.</p></speech>

Irish Water got off to a very bad start in that we saw the proposals for a new layer of bureaucracy, particularly the amount of money paid to consultants, including the bonus payments mentioned, which would be funded by water charges on householders and businesses across the country.  We were told by the Minister that the initial charge would be &euro;240 per household and that there would not be a standing charge, but there is a major question mark about whether other payments will arise.  There is no indication either of the way in which more than 1 million unmetered houses will be charged.</p><p>The Government has been committed to water charges for over three years and it is time to clarify the full cost to each householder.  An overall clear plan is needed for upgrading the network.  The issues of conservation and a regular safe supply of water are important.  We should be assured of the supply.  Business and industry need a consistent, high-quality supply for the creation of jobs and to attract new investment.</p><p>The water shortages in Dublin highlight the need for a regular safe supply of water.  There has been talk of a 16% leakage rate in south Dublin, a 60% rate in Kerry and a rate of 40% nationally.  That highlights the need for serious investment in the network and in the mains.  Water services now cost &euro;1.2 billion per annum, with &euro;200 million provided by commercial water ratepayers.  We need a full upgrade of the current system, following which we could have equity in water pricing.  </p><p>Good work has been done on water supplies at local authority level but they have not been able to provide water to more isolated rural areas.  There was an urgent need for a group water scheme movement, which is particularly strong in Galway.  Committees have been set up in Galway, Mayo and other western counties to identify a supply of water, collect money and get grants from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, sometimes from the European Union Regional Development Fund, to bring water to homes and farms.  There was a charge for people who went out to do this work.  They would sometimes try to get a supply from a local authority but more often they would have to go to an alternative supply such as a well or a river.  These group schemes were set up and, in fairness to the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, he gave a 50,000-gallon subsidy towards these group schemes, which is something the previous Labour Party Minister forgot about when he abolished water charges.</p><p>We have had a domestic allowance and a subsidy to ensure equity with the public water schemes, but the issue of the unmetered houses has not been addressed.  In the past there was pressure on group water schemes to have their schemes taken over, but with these new proposals on charges, water schemes will not be as keen to join a public scheme.  These committees find it difficult to recruit new members, and we must remember there is a huge amount of voluntary work in the organisation and maintenance of group water schemes.  </p><p>There are questions and uncertainty about the future.  I saw an article in today's <i>Metro Herald</i>newspaper about what will happen in two years' time.  Everybody is talking about what will happen in two years' time.  The Minister talks about an average payment of &euro;240 for two adults and two children.  We have asked questions about households with a third child or an elderly person but have not got answers.  Deputy Maloney was right when he referred to people washing cars with drinking water.  What happened to the rainwater harvesting projects?  Fianna F&aacute;il put money into those projects in the past.  The former Minister, John Gormley, with whom I was a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, had a project in a school in Mayo and a farm in County Meath.  These issues have not been developed.</p><p>I tabled questions to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on meters and leaks, and one reply stated that where the leak has been identified as being within the boundary of the property under the 2007 Water Services Act, the repair of the leak has been and remains the responsibility of the individual householder.</p><p>Questions arose last night on a television programme about finding leaks, and it was interesting that the Minister's reply stated that where a leak is identified on the public water mains, the repairs are undertaken by the local authority acting as an agent of Irish Water.  Local authorities that have lost many of their staff must now be agents for Irish Water.  It is time we clarified some of these issues, including the question of the free fix, which was not answered last night on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, and are given answers about what is happening.</p></speech>

Historical references are made in every debate in the House.  Deputy Farrell referred to a document from the 1977 election manifesto but he omitted to tell the House that 75% of the rates were abolished by the previous Government and that only 25% of the rates were abolished by the incoming Government.  That has been overlooked by many commentators the length and breadth of the country.</p><p>  I wish to raise a number of issues.</p><p>People are outraged at the amount of money spent on the establishment of the quango that is Irish Water.  There is a huge amount of expertise within the local authorities in terms of water service provision and a great deal of work has been done by them down through the years to improve services and so on.  </p><p> The previous speaker spoke about group water schemes and the huge amount of effort in this regard by local communities.  I have been involved with many group water schemes in my area where the underground water supply is of poor quality and would require a huge amount of treatment to make it fit for human consumption.  In other areas supply is limited because of difficulties in reaching high ground.  People in these areas came together, submitted an application for a group water scheme to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in respect of which they received a grant per household.  Following the initiative introduced by the previous Government some of these schemes also benefited from a top-up under CL&Aacute;R, which made what was an unaffordable scheme affordable to many communities in my area.  The last water scheme put in place in County Cork was in the Lombardstown area, on which a huge amount of work was done.  I compliment all those involved in that work.  Many of these group water schemes do not know how they are fixed going forward.  Some of these schemes, which are delivering water from the county council reservoirs to farms and homes, have not been taken in charge by the county council or Irish Water.  This is creating major difficulties.</p><p> As I said earlier, people are concerned about the amount of money spent by Government on the establishment of Irish Water.  In establishing this agency the Government is taking from local authorities a function for which they have been responsible since their foundation and have been executing well.  Many previous speakers spoke of areas that do not have proper sewerage facilities.  I compliment my predecessors in this House and on the county councils who worked diligently to ensure their communities were served by proper water and sewerage schemes.  When I was elected to this House in 1997, only one village in north Cork did not have proper sewerage facilities.  Thankfully, that was rectified soon afterwards.    </p><p> Much work has been done and a great deal of expertise has been developed by the local authorities.  There has been much commentary around the centralisation of the medical card system and the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards.  Water is important for people on dialysis.  A constituent of mine who has cancer is experiencing huge difficulties because of a leak in her water supply.  These types of issues were dealt with compassionately by the local authorities.  Giving responsibility for these issues to a giant quango will hurt people.  It is time it was acknowledged that centralisation has a negative affect on rural communities.  It is time to stop going this route.  </p><p> Water charges were abolished in 1996 by a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and are now being reintroduced by a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  Many of the people who have come together and set up group water schemes do not now know where they stand.  The vast amount of money wasted on setting up the giant quango that is Irish Water cannot be in any way deemed good for society or the country as a whole.</p></speech>

I am sure that like all of us the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, has been out canvassing and will know first-hand what a big issue this is for households and families.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, these families are living in fear of the imminent charge and how they are going to manage to pay it.  The squabbles between Fine Gael and the Labour Party over the past couple of weeks in regard to how this money is to be taken from them has made this more difficult.  The resolution is to take the same amount of money from families but in a different manner.  What is being given to them in swings is being taken from them on the roundabout.  This is the same type of approach taken by the Government to the recently introduced property tax.</p><p>  The Labour Party now has the audacity to try to gain credit with the electorate by promising a 15% reduction in water charges if people vote for Labour councillors.  On the one hand Labour supports Fine Gael in the introduction of water charges and on the other hand it is promising a reduction of 15% if its councillors are elected.  The public is supposed to be grateful for this.  However, the public knows well the value of these types of promises.  What has been announced in the past few days is very much with the local elections in mind.  Despite protestations to the contrary, the public knows that this is not where it ends and expects water charges to be increased further by this Government during the remainder of its term in office.</p><p>  The introduction of water charges comes on the back of the most expensive establishment of a quango in the history of this State.  Flying in the face of the bonfire of the quangos promised by the parties in government, we have seen &euro;60 million of taxpayers' money spent on consultancy fees.  Deputy Cowen tabled many parliamentary questions to the Minister seeking the amount spent on consultancy fees.  While the Minister repeatedly refused to answer, he eventually had to come clean and admit the level of money sunk into this organisation while not 1% of the 40% leakage in our water network across the country has been repaired.  </p><p>  Rather than applying additional financial pressure on families across this country this Government should be seeking, by way of improving the network and addressing the need to supply more than 40% more water because of the leakage in the system, to ensure a reduction in the cost of water supply nationally.  While I acknowledge we are in difficult times financially research has shown that investment in our public network would result in savings to the Exchequer.  Despite the Government's statement that flat charges will not be introduced and that charges will be meter and usage-based, it now proposes to impose charges on everyone despite the fact meters have been installed in only one third of households across the State.  </p><p>  I commend the motion to the House.  I reiterate again that this Government's mishandling of this issue is causing great difficulty for families across the country, which I am sure is what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is hearing on the doorsteps daily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/945" speakername="S&eacute;amus Kirk" time="21:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700038#LL00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this important debate.  When the legislation to establish Irish Water was brought before this House the amount of time allowed to debate it was truncated.  The Private Members' motion provides Members on this side of the House with an opportunity to have an input into what is a fairly complex issue.  There is nothing straightforward about introducing water charges given the range of needs and disparities in the population.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the issues of illness in a house, the number of adults in a house and the number of children.  Those with distressed mortgages will have to pay water bills annually.  It is important that we have an opportunity to tease out the provisions in the regulations catering for these categories.</p><p> Having spent some of my earlier political years helping to organise group water schemes in rural communities in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies, I realise the sorts of challenges that arise.  In many instances in rural communities, people did not have access to public water and were depending on wells.  In some cases, the water was polluted from some of the range of sources of pollution that featured in rural areas.  On a practical level, I am reasonably familiar with the problems that exist.</p><p> There is one aspect of this debate that has been subject to quite limited focus.  One should bear in mind the difference between the volume of domestic water used for consumption, as in water for drinking and making tea, and that used for sanitation, including showers and baths.  I do not have the relevant statistics available but suspect the volume that could be sourced from rainwater is quite significant, both for individuals and communities.  Giving a credit to households that are prepared to install water harvesting facilities should be considered.  The facilities are on the market.  They are relatively expensive and I suppose the economics are fairly marginal.  However, considering our annual level of rainfall, I believe harnessing rainwater for showers, baths and toilets would be a very practical move on the part of the Minister and Minister of State.</p><p> If one calculated the huge volume of water used annually in all schools, from primary to third level, in my constituency, Louth, one would realise it is very significant.  Will the planning regulations be adjusted to oblige designers of new schools to ensure water harvesting facilities are provided?  The retrospective installation of water harvesting facilities would be very much worthwhile.  When adjudicating in annual tidy towns competitions, should additional brownie points not be awarded to local committees that systematically encourage owners of community buildings and schools to install water harvesting facilities?  If it is possible to organise water harvesting on a communal basis in estates with 20 to 40 houses, credits could be given to individual householders who participate in the scheme for a period of three to five years.  Given that there is leakage of 40% in the water supply system, it would be worth considering my proposal.</p><p> Consider the exemption thresholds, including those that might apply where there is sickness in a household.  Will there be flexibility for those with distressed mortgages?  This seems an obvious question to ask.</p><p> Standing charges will not be part of the new provisions.  We already have standard charges for commercial and agricultural users.  Do they fall under the new regulations, or are they to be taken out of the system?  I refer to individual farmers using water for dairying and stock and to commercial businesses.  They are paying water charges and a standing charge.  What will happen in their circumstances?</p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath referred last night to water of poor quality.  This kind of water registers on the meter.  How will it be catered for in the new system?  These are the unanswered questions that underline the importance of having this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-07a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014050700039#MM00200"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak.  I thank my colleague Deputy Barry Cowen for tabling this motion on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is very timely as there are many issues pertaining to Irish Water that need to be discussed.  They are being discussed on the doorsteps of the people, who see the meters being installed on their streets.  Contractors are working in several areas around the country.  This issue is now becoming a very lively, hot topic.</p><p>  We should not be talking about water charges as the charge is, plainly and simply, a new water tax.  There is no new service and no water of better quality will be provided.  All that is happening is the installation of water meters to collect money.  Over 1 million households will have no meters when the bills arrive.  It is meaningless, therefore, to link metering to water quality, water supply and water conservation.  The bills will arrive regardless of whether one has a meter.  We are installing meters only to collect taxes.</p><p>  The people know what happened with the local property tax.  They were promised that it would be spent on local services by local authorities but the Government raided the kitty and took the money back in order to spend &euro;180 million setting up the new super-quango that we call Irish Water.  Some &euro;85 million has been spent on consultants, PR and bonuses for staff, many of whom have transferred from full-time pensionable positions in local authorities.  The way the Government has set about this reminds me of only one possible phenomenon , namely the way the private sector works when greed takes over.  The Government is setting up an organisation that will be ripe for privatisation from the very beginning.  It will have a customer base for a saleable product, as with Eircom and the mobile telephone companies.  It will be asked how many customers there are and how much money can be extracted from them each year.  It will be advocated that these figures should be calculated and that Irish Water should be sold.  The Government is privatising Bord G&aacute;is and has done a lot in this regard.  It has privatised the customer base.  As sure as night follows day, if Fine Gael remains in government it will privatise the water services, although I do not know whether it will be on a national or regional basis.  I do not know whether the Government will follow its counterparts in England, the Tory party, with which it is associated, or whether it will operate on a national basis.</p><p>  The issue of pricing is very serious.  Everyone knows the charge of &euro;240 is only the start and that it will double as time passes.  Most people will see that the charge of &euro;240 is only to get the foot in the door.  The Government has very cleverly said the Commission for Energy Regulation will deal with pricing.  However, it will be so restricted it will be almost like a puppet of the Minister.  It will be told to the last penny what the average charge is to be and that if it does not come up with this it will have to go back to the drawing board.  The Government will use the regulator as a way of saying charging has nothing to do with it.  On the other hand, the Minister will be telling the regulator at every hand&rsquo;s turn precisely what it should do.  The regulator will be almost like a ventriloquist's dummy.  The Government has undermined the regulator significantly.  It will pretend the regulator is independent but it will be doing the Minister's bidding on every single occasion.</p><p>  We noted the attitude of the Government last autumn when it voted down the proposals on freedom of information, including in respect of Irish Water.  Under pressure from ourselves, it had to do a U-turn in this regard.  In recent weeks, we brought in legislation to bring Irish Water under the remit of the Ombudsman but the Government has not agreed to that.  I hope it will do a similar U-turn because, as matters stand, the people will have nowhere to go if they have complaints.</p><p>  I have tabled parliamentary questions asking who looks after the consumer.  The response is that it is the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The regulator will not engage in personal disputes about the quality of water or water supplies cut off for a period.  When will all the households that the Government says will be metered be metered?</p><p>  On foot of the press release issued by the Government yesterday, a few issues need to be highlighted.  When the public sees what was in the press release, it will have genuine cause for fear.  The Government states the allowance for a standard house will be 30,000 litres, which is but 20% of what it states is the average volume that will be consumed per household, namely 140,000 l.</p><p>There is no free allowance.  They are paying for 80% of it, but the Government is giving the impression to some people that they will have free water if they conserve it.  They will not.  They will be paying for 80% of everything that comes in their door, based on the Government figures.</p><p> Then the Government moves on to the issue of the allowance for children.  However, the press release states that the allowance for each child under 18 is aligned to entitlement to child benefit.  How long has the Government been telling us that child benefit cannot be touched?  Now we have a situation in which child benefit is being linked to Irish Water and water bills - this is in the Government press release issued yesterday, in the last paragraph on page 2.</p><p> On page 3 of yesterday's press release, it is stated that Irish Water charges will have to take into account the quality of services provided and due regard will have to be had to these matters.  What about the issue of limescale destroying household electric kettles and shower units and clogging up pipes?  It is stated that these issues will be referred to the regulator.  As the Minister of State knows, the CER has a zero role in regard to the quality of water.  What is in this document is a fudge, a half-story, an untruth.  The Minister of State and I know the EPA is the regulator when it comes to water quality, but there are two regulators for Irish Water, with the other regulator dealing with pricing.  Is the EPA going to tell the CER that there is a poor-quality water service in a particular townland or street, and it will adjust its charges accordingly?  There are two regulators and, ultimately, the Minister can tell the CER what to do with the price.  Thankfully, the EPA is independent of the Minister and it will not take such nonsense from the Minister in terms of telling it how to do its job on a daily basis.  Therefore, we will have the Minister and the energy regulator involved in setting the charges, whereas the EPA is the regulator for water quality.  It is a recipe for disaster before this even starts, and the Government has not sorted that out.</p><p> I then look at question No. 11 regarding what happens people who do not pay their bills.  The Government states that it will go to court and that the legislation will not allow water to be turned off.  However, Irish Water is empowered by the legislation, which the Government rammed through here by guillotine without a proper vote before Christmas, to reduce water pressure in order to restrict water supply.  It is time we knew what is going to happen to people in financial difficulty.  Irish Water will give them a dribble of water that would fill an electric kettle so they will not die of dehydration, and that is what the Government will call a high-quality supply of water.  I ask the EPA to adjudicate on whether that constitutes a water supply of proper quality.  It should not be the energy regulator or Irish Water that determines that, and I hope others will deal with it.</p><p> One of the most alarming issues is mentioned in the next paragraph of the same question, No. 11, which states that the free allowance will be available only to households that pay their charges in a timely manner.  As with Bord G&aacute;is and Eircom at present, people get 14 days to pay their bills.  If somebody has not paid their Irish Water bill within 14 days of receiving the bill, they will lose their free allowance - that is in the Government press release.  Therefore, there is no free allowance for anyone in financial difficulty who is a day late in paying his or her bill, so the free allowance is optional, only received if the person pays.  People will probably have to sign up for a direct debit to qualify for the free allowance.  The Government is linking it to the prompt payment of bills, which is a disgrace.</p><p> The press release then refers to non-principal private residences and how the Government is going to separate people with holiday homes from people who have a second house that is rented out.  The Minister of State has not explained that issue.  However, we have learned two things.  The Minister of State has linked the bill for Irish Water to children's allowance - it is in the Government's document - and he has said the free allowance is conditional on quick and up-front payment, probably by direct debit.  This free allowance is a hoax and a cod.  It is not available for everyone.  For people with big families it is being linked to child benefit, and the Government will not give them their free allowance of any description if they do not pay.  Shame on the Minister of State.</p></speech>

There is now a great deal of clarity on the situation regarding domestic water charges.  There has been a rigorous analysis of the funding model to ensure we have a system which is fair and efficient and provides an incentive for householders to use water resources efficiently.  The details are true to the commitments made in our programme for Government, with the provision of a very generous free allowance for households.  There will be no standing charge, which means that the system of charges will be purely based on usage above the free allowance, so people have it within their power to control the charges they have to pay.  Households will, therefore, only pay for water use above 30,000 litres per annum.  The level of free allowance will increase by an additional 38,000 litres for each child in the household, which, in essence, results in free water for children.  I think that is-----</p></speech>

I believe these are very progressive and good rules, regulations and legislation which mean that children's consumption is actually free.</p><p>  Extensive consideration has also been given to providing supports to vulnerable households.  In this regard, the Government has agreed on additional affordability measures to assist pensioners, people with disabilities and carers who receive the household benefits package.  This package, which currently provides assistance with ESB and gas bills as well as covering the full cost of a television licence, will now be extended to assist with water costs.  The value of this additional benefit will be approximately &euro;100 a year to each recipient.  In addition to the free allowance and supports through the Department of Social Protection, the Government is also providing that charges for those with high water usage arising from a medical condition will be capped at an average charge.  The details of this measure are being discussed with the Minister for Health.</p><p>  The Government has also decided that provision should be made for circumstances in which the quality of the water service provided to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or impaired.

The regulator has been provided with statutory powers to act as the economic regulator.  All of Irish Water's charges will be subject to regulatory approval and all the processes around that will be subject to approval.  It is not what Irish Water wants to do; it is what the CER gives it the power to do and not to do.  There is a big issue there which will be resolved independently if there are problems.</p><p>All of Uisce &Eacute;ireann's charges will be subject to this approval.  A policy direction will be issued to the regulator such that the decisions around the funding model will be built into the tariff structure.  The regulator will undertake consultations in June 2014 before the tariffs are announced in August.  </p><p> The Government has also made an announcement about the position of households without a meter when charges commence.  We have announced that the charge will be assessed based primarily on occupancy and will be a close proxy to the actual meter charge.  Moreover, where the household is subsequently metered, there will be a provision for rebates above a reasonable threshold if the usage has been assessed as too high.  </p><p> The funding model announced by the Government is fair and has the interests of customers at heart.  The average water charge will be &euro;240, which compares very favourably with charges in the UK not to mention the charge in Northern Ireland which is, on average, &euro;980 per household.  </p></speech>

Irrespective of what it might be and the scrutiny we might place on it, I thank the Government for eventually coming forward with a package despite the fact that it was dragged kicking and screaming before we could analyse this in the manner it deserves.  I do not want to rehash or go into huge detail about the story that has been Irish Water since it was first announced in March 2012.  This was a story that was clouded in secrecy where a concerted effort was made by the Government to withhold information about the mammoth costs associated with the setting up of Irish Water from this House by virtue of not answering parliamentary questions and, by association, withholding information from the public.</p><p>  Despite Government assurances when it awarded Bord G&aacute;is the contract, we learned in January 2014 that Bord G&aacute;is did not have half the expertise at its disposal that it apparently stated it did have when it won the contract from Bord na M&oacute;na in the first instance.  We know now that this misinformation cost the taxpayer &euro;80 million.  That was the cost associated with consultancy fees or as was explained to us thereafter, outside expertise.  I understand that queries from many Members and most definitely those from the media are being farmed out to a public relations company for answering.  We have obviously learned nothing since then if it is still paying huge rates for outside expertise in respect of simple questions.  </p><p>  That misinformation also cost the Government and Irish Water their credibility in respect of this project.  It allowed us to shine a light on Irish Water and that light exposed the fact that Irish Water was growing and continues to grow into a super-sized, bonus-driven quango - a quango of a middle and high-ranking management tier that is newly created on top of existing personnel and expertise in local authorities.  This is a quango that rushed to create its own corporate identity and has yet to identify a specific roadmap or plan having failed to publish, audit and identify how it would reduce leakage, for example, from 40% to 20%.  We have no idea, as many Members said earlier.  </p><p>  This quango and Government were always solely interested in inflicting charges as soon as was practicably possible.  The Government has form in the few short years it has been in office because it inflicted a household charge and a property tax without, as it said itself, a red cent being spent locally in the counties and local authorities from which it was taken despite a promise given in the past.  We should not be surprised that it would put the cart before the horse in this area as well.  </p><p>  I have read the various reports outlining the details of yesterday's announcement.  I have watched and listened attentively to Labour and Fine Gael representatives in the media and in this House seek to assure the public that the charges that are now being proposed are fair and reasonable.  However, I have also listened to representatives from Irish Water and was particularly interested to hear them say that they will still get the full cost recovery from households.  One of Irish Water's representatives stated categorically today that in the absence of a standing charge, Irish Water will make up the difference by virtue of raising the price of water per litre in order to compensate it for the loss it experienced when Labour challenged the Fine Gael Minister some weeks ago.  </p><p>  I have also been asking myself why the Government did not produce tables of different family types and different households, as it would in a budget, to show the public the effect of these proposed charges.  In the absence of such tables, it seems that it is up to us in Opposition as usual to expose what is going on here.  I will give the Minister of State some options and examples which I believe to be correct having listened to Irish Water today.  If I am wrong, I want the Minister of State and the Government to correct it immediately so that the public has a better idea of what exactly it will cost them when these charges come through their doors next January.  I will bring the Minister of State back three weeks ago when Fine Gael brought its memo to Cabinet.  We were told that the charge would be &euro;240 per average household, there would be a free allowance and there would be a &euro;50 standing charge.  </p><p>  Let us analyse that.  The CSO says that an average household is 2.7 occupants.  The average use by any person is reckoned to be 55,000 l per year.  So if one multiplies 2.7 by 55,000, that adds up to 148,500 l.  We will permit a free allowance of 30,000 l considering that this was what the Government said yesterday and assuming that was what it was saying three weeks ago.  That is 118,500 l used.  Irish Water has its &euro;50 standing charge off the top so let us divide 190 by 118,500 l.  This gives one a cost per litre of &euro;0.0016.  That is the average.  Let us look at the example of a household with parents and four children, one of whom is over 18.  This is based on three weeks ago.  Six times 55,000 litres is 330,000 l.  The free allowance for the household of 30,000 l - that was what the Government said then - so 300,000 l are used by that household.  If one uses the example I have just explained which is the per litre rate of &euro;0.0016, the charge ends up being &euro;480 per year.  That is a long way from &euro;240.  </p><p>  Let us fast forward to yesterday when Labour supposedly had its say.  We all get together, find the reason to throw this at the wall and allow it to stick long enough to get us beyond 23 May and let the repercussions come thereafter if they wish but our candidates will not be sacrificed in the mean time.  That is the message that had to be put out.  Let us go back to the average people again - 2.7 occupants per household and 148,500 l less the free allowance per household of 30,000 l.  Let us assume the 0.7 occupant is under 18, let us allow them to become one whole person rather than 0.7 of one and take away another 38,000 which the Government says is the free allowance for a child under 18.  We have 88,500 l to be costed.  Irish Water says it will get full cost recovery so it must up the rate per cent per litre.  It comes out at 0.0027 cent per litre.  Let us go back to the family of two plus four with one person over 18.  A total of 330,000 l are used and the free allowance for the household is 30,000.  </p><p>Let us have the Labour Party's sap.  With three children under the age of 18 years, let us allow them 38,000 litres each.  Great, it will do this.  That is a total of 114,000 litres.  That means only 196,000 litres will have to be charged for, but they will be charged for at 0.0027 cent per litre, which is equal to a figure of &euro;527.  That is the point Deputy Joe Higgins has been making all day, but nobody wants to listen to him or give him time for fear it might get out.  The cat is out of the bag on this one.</p></speech>

What the Government has done is up the charges to be paid, not reduce them.  Either the Minister of State will publish the cost per litre, tonight or before 23 May, in order that families will be able to see the real costs and charges or I and, I am sure, Deputy Joe Higgins and others will say that, as usual, the public has been sold a pup and a pig in a poke.
