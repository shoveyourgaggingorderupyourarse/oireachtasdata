    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400003#A00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leo si&uacute;d ar fad a ghr&iacute;os m&eacute; agus a chuidigh liom an obair seo a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo si&uacute;d ar fad at&aacute; gafa leis an bhfeachtas chun Sr&aacute;id an Mh&uacute;raigh a chaomhn&uacute;.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n acu ann a bh&iacute; gafa san fheachtas sin sula raibh mise ceangailte leis.  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to move Second Stage of the Ceathr&uacute; Chult&uacute;ir 1916 Bill 2021.  I look forward not only to seeing it progressing today but also to its progress through Committee Stage and back to the House again.  Its purpose is to ensure that an area of Dublin city centre that is now quite derelict will be the location of an appropriate cultural quarter and an appropriate memorial to those who fought and died in 1916.</p>  <p>  There are people who are consumed with anti-Sinn F&eacute;in hostility and cannot see beyond criticism of this legislation.  In fact, the Bill is based on legislation that was introduced by the then Senator, now Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for which I applauded him at the time.  There have been other Bills introduced seeking to ensure that this area be set up as an appropriate cultural quarter.  I want to see that concept of a cultural quarter located in the heart of the city, in an area which is celebrated by many as being quintessentially Dublin.  We want an area that celebrates, commemorates and illustrates what it was like to be a volunteer of Cumann na mBan, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann or the Irish Citizen Army, or a member of Fianna &Eacute;ireann, rushing jaded from the inferno that was the GPO that Friday in April 1916, a few long days after the Proclamation was first read aloud on O'Connell Street.  It should show what it was like for the IRA garrison that ran up Henry Place with James Connolly on a stretcher, under constant fire, before breaking into No. 10 Moore Street, disturbing the residents and then starting to burrow all the way down the terrace.  I cannot do justice in the few minutes I have to the atmosphere, tension and apprehension of all those long hours in Moore Street.</p> <p>The historian Ray Bateson used survivors' own words in a beautifully-put-together bilingual book, <i>Battle of Moore Street 1916 Cath Shr&aacute;id U&iacute; Mh&oacute;rdha</i>.  It is published by Kilmainham Tales.  He has captured all that for us.  I urge those who have an interest to purchase a copy.  It is a beautiful book and it is easily read.<br/><br/>How did it feel to be a volunteer in O'Hanlon's yard at 20-21 Moore Street while Tom Clarke, Joseph Plunkett, and Michael Collins tried to persuade the volunteers to stand down after the Army Council had met in 16 Moore Street and decided on the surrender?  How did it feel to hear the persuasive calm quite comments from Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada when he outlined that only the leaders would be shot and that the ordinary volunteer would live to fight another day?  &quot;We, who will be shot, will die happy - knowing that there are still plenty of you around who will finish the job.&quot;  That is a quote from the book.  &quot;All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born&quot;, as Yeats says in the poem <i>Easter, 1916</i>.  How right he was.  Many of the men and women gathered in that yard and in the houses of Moore Street at that time were to regroup, reorganise and learn from the week-long Republic as they began the next phase of the long fight for freedom after a few short months of incarceration in Frongoch internment camp.<br/><br/>Moore Street is not only about the Rising.  It is, was and will be a street market and a living street with residents, shops, cafes and stalls.  The Mercier Press book, <i>Moore Street: The Story of Dublin's Market District</i>by Barry Kennerk is an essential read for those who want to learn about the long history of the street, the market and its characters.  When we think of Dublin we think of the street traders crying &quot;Two for a penny&quot;, &quot;Two for a pound&quot; or, nowadays, &quot;Two for a euro&quot;.  I do not think &quot;Two for a bitcoin&quot; will really take off but one never knows and we will see in the future.  Anyway, they are the phases associated with the history of the area.  Those phases capture the breadth of the market for the 150 years it has been in place.<br/><br/>The intention of the Bill is to preserve the lanes and buildings of Moore Street.  It is to restore the cobble lanes and the buildings to their former condition and then awaken the area again with life and make it a living museum.<br/><br/>The area of cultural and historical tourism is one of the fastest growing areas of tourism today.  Many of us have been to other cities and enjoyed the historical experience.  Through the use of modern technology, hologram, sound effects, lighting and graphics we would create such an experience from the now due-to-be-empty GPO all the way down the terrace of Moore Street.  We should think of what could be achieved.  It is to do with imagination and we need imagination.  That is why I have been trying to ensure this proposal has been to the fore in all of our plans for that area.  There could be small galleries, book shops, cafes, butchers, bakers, fruit stalls, flower shops, other stalls and tea shops.  Let us think of the smells and sights that people get when they visit a French or other continental town or city where there is a fresh produce market.  This is intertwined with all the other activities and life in general.  That is what Moore Street could be rather than what has been planned over the years, whether a huge shopping mall or office blocks.  We cannot stand idly by, to use a term from history, and watch as developers plan to destroy what is our architectural heritage.  Once that heritage is gone, it is gone forever and no one can then recreate history in the way that we want to see it.  That is not possible if there is a big block of apartments or offices on top of the area.<br/><br/>Is &eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist leis an gcomhlacht at&aacute; in ainm is a bheith curtha ar si&uacute;l ag an reachta&iacute;ocht seo n&aacute; go mbeadh muid cinnte de go mbeadh an bheocht athuair sa sr&aacute;id seo, Sr&aacute;id U&iacute; Mh&uacute;raigh, agus go mbeadh stair, litr&iacute;ocht, ceol, rince agus eala&iacute;n ar si&uacute;l beagnach an t-am go l&eacute;ir, fite fuaite leis an ngn&aacute;th oibre at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; ar an tsr&aacute;id. B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh ceangal chomh maith le Cearn&oacute;g Parnell, &aacute;it at&aacute; m&uacute;saem na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute;, d&aacute;nlann Hugh Lane agus ina mbeadh leabharlann na cathrach ann chomh maith.  Thar na blianta, d&uacute;radh linn nach f&eacute;idir leis seo tarl&uacute; agus gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn smaoineamh ar rud &eacute;igin eile.</p> <p>Mar a d&uacute;irt Uachtar&aacute;n St&aacute;it Aontaithe Mheirice&aacute;: "Is f&eacute;idir linn" agus sa ch&aacute;s seo is l&eacute;ir gur f&eacute;idir linn agus t&aacute; an deis againn &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh anois in ainneoin gur le Comhlacht Hammerson a l&aacute;n den tsr&aacute;id seo.

Visions have been created by various groups over the period of the campaign, the latest being from the Moore Street preservation trust, which includes some beautiful illustrations of what could be.  Through these visions and approaches to a street in the heart of a European city, we could allow history and day-to-day life live hand in hand with each other.  We have an opportunity to ensure that the street thrives and young and old people alike - tourists, Dubliners and people from outside Dublin - can go there and learn about the events of the last two days of the Rising in the city of Dublin as well as about life for the ordinary working Dubliners who have lived and worked on that street for more than 150 years.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.  I urge Deputies to consider its intent and not only pass Second Stage today, but ensure that the Bill comes out the other end of the legislative process as quickly as possible and we act upon it so that the dereliction of Moore Street comes to an end and life begins once again for those who are trading or have shops there and for the general public who have to walk through it daily.</p></speech>

It is a place that holds much pride for many across the Thirty-two Counties and many Irish across the globe.  Moore Street is where five of the great leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising met for the last time.  The district should long have been a national monument.  That it was not is in many ways symbolic of the attitude of successive Governments to the ideals of Easter week and the legacy of the great leaders of that period.  That it was even possible for a property consortium to acquire large tracts of land and buildings in the area with the intention of large-scale demolition and commercial construction is telling.  That the developers enjoyed the connivance of Governments and city councils is shameful.  To add insult to injury, when large parts of the property ended up in State ownership via the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the State failed to recognise its previous failures and the sites were fire sold to another large British commercial shopping mall chain.  The intention is for a large shopping centre to be built on this historic location.  Thankfully, due to the diligent efforts of the relatives of the Rising's leaders as well as other campaigners, this obscenity has not yet come to pass.</p>  <p>  Thanks to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's legislation, which I commend him for, the House can preserve and revitalise the historic 1916 Moore Street quarter and ensure that the State no longer allows this important part of our heritage to be dispensed for corporate greed.  As such, this is an important opportunity that we should all grasp.  We should always remember with pride those who fought and died for Irish freedom and independence.  An Phoblacht ab&uacute;.  I commend the Bill to the House and urge all Deputies to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1464" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400006#D00100"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, for bringing it forward.</p>  <p>  Over the years, we have seen the history of Moore Street and the surrounding areas reduced to plaques in high places where eyes do not go.  We have even seen Fine Gael Ministers in the courts on this issue, fighting the side of big business and private interests.  The walking tours of Dublin bring the area to life now and again, but most of the time one would be forgiven for thinking it has stood as it is now since time began.  It is as if it has been hidden away from the general public for decades.  Today is the day to change that.</p>  <p>  The families of those who died in the 1916 Rising have put forward a fantastic proposal that I believe needs to go ahead.  What is needed is a proper cultural quarter, something which the public can flock to in order to learn about the history of the area.  It is a history of which we can all be proud.  There are economic benefits to the proposal too, all in the heart of this great city that is crying out for regeneration.   The brave women and men who fought and died on Dublin streets against the might of the British Crown deserve their fight for Ireland to be immortalised and their names remembered and projected throughout this city and country forever more.  The Bill would ensure the Minister recognises the importance of this area, something which previous Governments have lacked the conviction to do. </p>  <p>  The argument for a cultural quarter could not be stronger.  What better street for it than Moore Street, which is of such historical significance?  Governments have previously delayed and frustrated proposals similar to those in the Bill.  That needs to stop.  There must be no more delays.  The Government should do right by those who died during the Rising and give them the recognition they deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400006#D00200"><p>I commend my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, on bringing forward the Bill.  It is the product of a long campaign by those concerned with our cultural and revolutionary heritage.  The management and development of our heritage, culture and history cannot be left in the hands of private developers.  To do so would be a catastrophe and, above all, a terrible indictment of how the State has failed to value that history.  The Bill offers an opportunity to preserve the built heritage and create a truly cultural quarter where the leaders of the 1916 Rising fought, while also allowing for an economic boost, tourism and development that includes the community.</p>  <p>  The Bill also provides a model for the preservation of other cultural areas and not just those in Dublin.  Although most, if not all, of the Rising was concentrated in Dublin city centre, the events that followed were fought in cities, towns, villages and farmland across the State.  I refer to my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Longford was the most active county in Leinster, apart from Dublin, during the War of Independence, while volunteers in Westmeath acted in the most heavily militarised area in Ireland in terms of its proportion of population.  The now-closed Columb Barracks in Mullingar could act as a hub for a similar development, given its history and location in the town.  What is important is that these developments preserve the history of the region and are community-driven.  Developments of the infrastructure could be undertaken in tandem with community wealth creation schemes and would create local jobs as well as providing national and local educational opportunities.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that we should commemorate all aspects of this revolutionary heritage.  It was a time of profound struggle for suffrage, industrial labour rights, land reform and cultural, linguistic and literary revival.  All of these movements shaped the Ireland that we know today and the movement for independence overlapped with them.</p> <p>Many have been forgotten; more have been ignored.  It is important that regeneration of our historical areas commemorate and recognise the totality of those events during these revolutionary times.<br/><br/>Moore Street must be preserved and there must be a viable future for it.  This Bill would ensure that.  This should be the start of a new policy direction which values our heritage and history, rather than continuing to ignore it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400007#E00200"><p>"There should be no further commercial development work in the vicinity of this site or in the [Moore Street] area.  The strongest way to secure that is to designate it as a historical quarter."  These are fine words and as much as I would like to claim credit for them, I cannot.  They are the words of current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in 2015.  It is not often that I find myself in agreement with the Minister but he was on the money when he said that.  I urge him to maintain that position in 2021.</p>  <p>  As a child, I spent a lot of time in and around Moore Street.  My late grandparents, Jim and May O'Hanlon, ran a tailors and dressmaking business in the inner city.  I loved nothing more than experiencing the colour and culture of Moore Street.  If old Dublin could speak, it would sound like Moore Street.  There is something almost lyrical about an old Dublin brogue.</p>  <p>  As I grew older, I became aware of the significance of Moore Street in the Easter Rising of 1916.  As the flames spread across the roofs of the GPO, The O'Rahilly cleared the way for an escape route.  He paid the ultimate sacrifice as he was shot and eventually died in Sackville Street at the side of Moore Street.  Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett, Clarke, Se&aacute;n McDermott and Willie Pearse held a council of war in No. 16 Moore Street.  The decision was made to surrender to save the civilian lives and the lives of the rank and file of the Volunteers.  They made that decision in the full knowledge that they would be shot by the Brits.</p>  <p>  Late last year, an unscrupulous developer pulled down the ancestral home of The O'Rahilly in Herbert Park.  This was cultural vandalism at its worst.  We cannot allow this to happen to Moore Street.</p>  <p>  As I said, there should be no further development work in the vicinity of Moore Street and if you do not believe me, ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, for bringing this Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il and giving us this opportunity to restore and preserve Moore Street for generations to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400007#E00300"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for bringing forward this Bill.  I know he has a deep passion for, and interest in, the future of Moore Street and the surrounding part of Dublin central, as we all do.  I have listened carefully to what he has said.  I share with him the same sense of the seminal importance of the 1916 Rising, its central place in the history of our State and of the importance of commemorating it and preserving the traces and memories that remain of the events that occurred at that time and of the men, women and children who were involved.  I certainly felt a sense of place and poignancy as I stood in 14-17 Moore Street.  It is an important place in our history.</p>  <p>  None of this is lost on the Government which I believe can look back with justifiable pride and satisfaction at the wonderfully successful and highly inspirational programme of commemorative events that took place throughout 2016.  That programme drew in communities from every corner of the country in unprecedented numbers to pay respectful tribute to the 1916 leaders and to the sacrifices they made on our behalf to gain for us our independence and right to self-determination.</p>  <p>  Before I get into the detail of the Bill, I want to address briefly the suggestion that it is similar to an earlier Bill brought to the Seanad by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, in 2015.  The reality is that we are in an entirely different situation now compared to the one extant in Moore Street at that time.  In 2015, plans to have the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street procured by Dublin City Council had fallen through and, with them, any prospect of the buildings being restored.  The site surrounding the national monument was in the control of NAMA.  There was also planning permission in place for an enclosed shopping arcade that could have led to significant architectural and structural interventions into the legibility of what remained of the Moore Street streetscape.  If that development did not go ahead, the alternative was further urban decay, accompanied by increased anti-social behaviour.  Furthermore, in 2015 what was in prospect was an inexorable loss of the history and heritage of the street along with its centuries old street trading traditions.</p> <p>We are, however, in a much better space now.  The national monument is owned by the State.  It has been weathered and secured structurally, and there are plans to progress with the 1916 commemorative centre project.  Funding is in place for that, on which I will comment further later.</p> <p> The surrounding site has been acquired by a development company, which is engaging meaningfully with the Moore Street advisory group of which I will also say more anon.  The development company has also unveiled the plans for its site which are very different in character from what was previously envisaged.  It is soon to apply for planning permission for a mixed use development comprising family housing, retail and office units, along with public squares and open spaces.  There will be extensive commemorative elements to show and pay tribute to the events and people of 1916 and a whole range of buildings previously in danger will be retained and restored.</p> <p> With regard to the Bill introduced this morning, the Government fully appreciates the constructive motivation that brought it about and for that reason I will not be opposing it on Second Stage.  Instead, I will be advocating that it should go to the relevant Oireachtas committee for further scrutiny and to examine what are evident drafting and legal issues; and to do so against the background of the imminent report of the Moore Street advisory group which is due to report to me shortly.  I will clarify as I go along the importance of the report to the question of whether there is a case for the Bill to progress further.</p> <p> No. 16 Moore Street is where the decision to surrender was made by the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street were declared a national monument in 2007 as the most authentic, complete and coherent collection of surviving pre-1916 buildings on Moore Street that have clear associations to the Rising.  Each of the buildings has extensive original features, including plasterwork, partitions, staircases, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  The 18th century building form and profiles also survive.  Most significantly, there is also the evidence of the presence of the insurgents themselves in the form of the passageways they burrowed through from building to building during the final phase of the Rising.  I had the privilege to see them myself.</p> <p> Earlier proposals to secure the restoration of the national monument through a combination of funding from NAMA and a property exchange between Dublin City Council and the developer within the surrounding Dublin central development site did not materialise.  The monument buildings were then acquired by the State from NAMA with a view to having them at least partially open to the public in time for the centenary of the Rising.  Unfortunately, that was not possible due to the project being interrupted by protests and ultimately by a High Court judgment, which effectively stopped all works apart from essential preservation and stabilisation measures.  That judgment was later overturned in its entirety by the Court of Appeal.</p> <p> All this culminated in the establishment of the Moore Street advisory group which is now working and making progress on finding answers to the future regeneration of the Moore Street area in a way that reflects its history and culture and, most importantly, the events that played out there in the closing stages of the Rising.  The Moore Street advisory group was established by the then Minister in May 2017 and its current membership includes Deputy Snodaigh, who is promoting this Bill, and Deputies Hourigan, Gannon and Br&iacute;d Smith.  It also includes 1916 relatives' groups, city councillors and street traders.  Its role is to represent and work with all stakeholders, including the owners of the site surrounding the State-owned national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  The idea is to broker regeneration solutions that can be supported by all concerned, solutions that will properly respect its part in the 1916 Rising, retain the traces that remain of those events and ensure that its street market tradition continues to have pride of place in a part of Dublin that is crying out for regeneration.</p> <p> I have met the chair of the advisory group, Dr. Tom Collins, to whom the owners of the site that is largely encompassed by this Bill have recently presented their latest plans.  I understand that the plans are seen as a welcome step change on what was previously in prospect and that they respond positively to the recommendations of the advisory group's previous report to the Minister in August 2019.  I also understand that the developer has appointed a prestigious design team with international experience to draw up and finalise detailed development proposals for which planning permission will be sought in the near future.  I should also mention that Transport Infrastructure Ireland has recently come into the picture and is working with the site owner to integrate the construction of an underground MetroLink station on Upper O'Connell Street that will connect Dublin Airport into the development.  What is now being proposed will retain a greatly expanded range of buildings associated with the Rising, seek to facilitate and guarantee the future of the street traders, appropriately remember and commemorate the events of Easter 1916, provide almost 100 new residential units, build a new metro station and create more than 9,000 jobs.  What is particularly welcome is the commitment to retain the fabric of a large number of buildings with historical significance, such as Conway's public house, Nos. 8 to 10 Moore Street, Nos. 20 and 21 Moore Street, O'Brien's Stables, O'Brien's Bottling Stores, and the potential artistic use of the White House site, along with a re-imagining of 10 Henry Place as a potential gallery.</p> <p>In any context the prospect of all these jobs must be welcomed by all, but especially in the context of the economic and social challenges in the north inner city.  </p> <p> Once the report of the Moore Street advisory group is to hand, it can be reviewed alongside the Bill by the relevant committee, which is the Joint Committee for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The committee will also examine any potential policy, legal and financial issues contained in the Bill.  These include the reliance on the judgment in the High Court case in 2016, which was later overturned.  There are further issues, such as section 3 which obliges me, as Minister, to issue preservation orders over properties in the area because the Moore Street battlefield area is a national monument of extreme importance to the State.  There is no provision in the National Monuments Acts for a preservation order to be issued for this reason.  I will be asking the committee to thoroughly examine the Bill for those sort of instances and indeed to assess the extent to which there is justification for the Bill to advance further in light of what emerges from the Moore Street advisory group's report.   </p> <p> Deputies will be aware that, as I have previously mentioned, the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street is now in the ownership of the Minister.  Plans are well under way to ensure that the monument be refurbished as soon as possible.  My Department was delighted to recently be in a position to announce funding of &euro;121.3 million for Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city under the urban regeneration and development fund.  This significant investment will support the regeneration and redevelopment of several areas that have suffered from dereliction and decline over a long number of years.  </p> <p> It also includes the Moore Street national monument, which is earmarked for grant aid amounting to &euro;12.7 million.  This is a generational opportunity to protect the national monument and open it up to the public to resonate the mercantile, social and political heritage of the area as a 1916 commemorative quarter.  Officials in my Department are in ongoing liaison with the OPW with a view to moving forward with the project, and I hope to see works commencing on this very soon. </p> <p> In summary, and to finish, the Government intends not to oppose this Bill on Second Stage, on the grounds that, in line with Standing Order 95, it will be subject to scrutiny on financial, legal and policy matters by the Joint Committee for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Officials from my Department will be available to liaise with the committee throughout this process on issues associated with the Bill and also to appraise the committee of developments in regard to the Moore Street advisory group and its upcoming report to the Minister.</p> <p> Indeed, should the recommendations of the advisory group chart a clear path for progress on the regeneration of the Moore Street area that enjoys the overall support of its membership, then it may very well be the case that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and his party will find it unnecessary for the Bill to progress any further.</p></speech>

I compliment the work that has been put into the Bill by the 1916 relatives' group, whose commitment to saving Moore Street and preserving our history has never wavered.</p>  <p>  One can travel to almost any nation across the world and see the value and respect they put on sites that played a significant role in the shaping of their nationhood, whether it is Gettysburg in the USA, Flanders in Belgium or Brest Fortress in Belarus.  Moore Street and the laneways surrounding it are no different to those aforementioned battlefields.  Moore Street holds significant importance in the birth of our nation and revolutionary history.  This battlefield must be preserved as a national monument and as a living museum would safeguard our history for the generations to come. </p>  <p>  The Bill creates many more opportunities than simply listing Moore Street as a national monument.  It will develop Moore Street into a cultural quarter.  It will give the community within the inner city an opportunity to regenerate and develop into a living city with sustainability, history and culture at its heart.  </p>  <p>  When I think of the long battle to save Moore Street, I always think of The O'Rahilly who, after leading a charge of Moore Street, was mortally wounded by several bullets.  He wrote a note to his darling Nancy as he lay dying.  It finished simply saying, "It was a good fight anyhow".  As we approach the 105th anniversary of the Easter Rising, we are still here fighting to protect Moore Street and give it the value and respect of which it is worthy. </p>  <p>  Our history, heritage and culture cannot be left in the hands of private developers.  It is too important and valuable.</p> <p>We do not want a repeat of what happened at The O'Rahilly house in Herbert Park.  We do not want a repeat of this cultural vandalism.  </p></speech>

For too long in our recent past, bad planning, disastrous development decisions and a disregard for our heritage lost us forever the Viking site at Wood Quay, the Georgian facades of St. Stephen's Green, the Metropolitan Theatre, and more recently the criminal destruction of the home of the 1916 leader The O&rsquo;Rahilly.  We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and not replicate them in the present.  The decisions that must be made on this historic quarter must not be left to the vagaries of developers or speculators, whose only concern is profit.  This is a site that even the National Museum of Ireland described as the most important historic site in modern Irish history.  It is an area rich in the history of the Rising.  After a week of shelling, fighting and fire at the GPO, the garrison fought its way to the houses on Moore Street, where the final acts of the Rising were played out and the decision to end the Rising was made.  Each house on the Moore Street terrace has its own historical significance, not least, No. 16, the site of the last headquarters of the Provisional Government.</p>  <p>  We have in this Bill a great opportunity to develop a historical and cultural quarter that would include a living museum that would recreate the historical events of the area and provide visitors with a practical interpretation of the Rising.  There would be an economic and tourism bonus from the development of such a quarter and an opportunity for regeneration of the historic Moore Street market. </p>  <p>  I have a very personal interest in all of this, as both my grandfathers were out in 1916.  One fought with Pearse and Connolly in the GPO and the other with Markievicz and Mallin in the College of Surgeons.  I have historical artefacts and medals connected with the Rising that have been passed down through my family and I could see no better home for them than in a museum situated on this battlefield site.  This Bill and its proposals ends the uncertainty around the development of the site and raises it from its current state of ruin and decay to an area that is both revitalised and renewed, and also serves as a living memorial to the men and women of the Rising. </p></speech>

It supports the 1916 relatives&rsquo; regeneration plan to create a cultural quarter around Moore Street and will preserve the built heritage of the street.  The Bill does three key things: it gives legal recognition to a Moore Street cultural quarter; protects the built heritage of Moore Street from destruction; and will regenerate the local area to boost tourism and footfall.</p>  <p>  Of particular importance is the establishment of a permanent outdoor market, which will preserve the Moore Street market, which has been trading at the site since the 1850s.  Hammerson, a British shopping centre owner, was virtually gifted the site by NAMA.  It is worth noting that Hammerson&rsquo;s Irish branch is run by a former NAMA employee.  We expect that a planning application for a shopping centre and office development will be submitted next month.  It would be frankly obscene for us to hand over a national monument to private interests that will destroy our heritage and will not benefit the local community.</p>  <p>  If we develop a modern historical quarter we preserve our history, language and culture, and put those values at the centre of the regeneration of the north inner city.  A project of this kind will give an enormous boost to tourism in the city, in a way that also benefits the local community which has suffered due to decades of neglect by successive Governments.  I am confident that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, will support this Bill because it is very similar to a Bill he introduced himself in 2015.  </p> <p>At that time, he said that we needed to designate the site as an historical quarter to protect it from any further commercial development work in the vicinity of the site.  The Minister was correct when he said that, but he has a track record when it comes to saying one thing in opposition and then another as Minister.  I hope, though, for the sake of our patriot dead that he sticks to his guns on this issue.  This is important for all of us.  The battlefield area was recognised as a national monument by the High Court in 2016 and the National Museum of Ireland has defined Moore Street as the most important street in Ireland for historical reasons.  It must be preserved for the benefit of everyone.  Turning it into a shopping centre and offices would be historical vandalism and it must be stopped at all costs.</p></speech>

From Georgian Dublin to the cottages of the west, we are more than happy to allow developers to buy up whatever artefacts of our history they like and then tear them down with JCBs.  We saw that most recently with the house of The O'Rahilly, which pulled down to make way for a hotel.  Will we see the same happen with the Markievicz cottage in Sandyford?  Will that other link to 1916 be demolished and turned into a modern bungalow?</p>  <p>  It is not just the houses of the 1916 leaders or the big houses down the country that need protecting, although too many of those have been allowed to fall into wrack and ruin.  With our careless disregard for our past, we are allowing the snapshots of how ordinary Irish people lived and worked to vanish.  If this Government had its way, Ireland would be nothing more than steel and glass, sterile and cold.  </p>  <p>  Dublin is a modern city and its people are its heart, but every year it becomes a little more modern and a little less vibrant.  We must preserve the built heritage of Moore Street, where the 1916 volunteers fought and died in their last stand, and protect it from destruction.  We go beyond that as well, however.  We must cherish what is left of our heritage before it is replaced by shopping centres, hotels and offices.  We need not trade one for the other, but always to strive to incorporate those links to the past into our everyday environment.  People should not have to visit a museum to have to get a snapshot of our history and our culture.  It should surround us every day in our daily lives and inform us as we go along.  </p>  <p>  The proposed cultural quarter for Moore Street should be a roadmap for how we can preserve what brought us to the present, lest we forget of course where we came from.  I commend the Bill, and I look forward to other Members supporting it.  However, it is not just about supporting the Bill; we must move on this issue and preserve this site.  </p></speech>

I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing it to the House, I commend the now Minister for bringing a similar Bill before the Seanad six years ago and I also welcome the Minister of State saying the Government will not oppose the Bill on this Stage.  Ultimately, everyone wants to get to the same place on this issue.  As a Dub, it is hard to not feel connected to Moore Street as a historical, cultural, social and economic space.  While I would like to remove tribalism from any debate on this issue, it is hard as a northside Dub not to be a bit tribal about this topic because Moore Street is so vibrant and special.  Throughout my life, many trips with my family and friends into town from Finglas involved getting off the bus and going through the gateway of Moore Street into Henry Street.</p>  <p>  Preserving our history and culture is vitally important.  However, we must also protect the workers and street traders on Moore Street now.  This Bill covers that aspect as well.  We cannot forget those workers and traders because they have been kicked around as political footballs for many years.  People have poured honey into their ears by saying how much they love the Moore Street traders, but where has the support for them been in respect of infrastructure such as bathroom facilities where they could wash their hands, for example?  Nothing like that has been provided by Dublin City Council over the years for these traders, whom we all say and know are so important to the vibrancy of this part of Dublin and who make it distinct and different and a wonderful place to be.</p> <p>They need to be supported and be at the centre of any development that will take place.</p> <p> The only issue I have with the Bill, which is more of a gut reaction than anything else, is the word "quarter", although I think that comes from other parts of Dublin being labelled as quarters.  I suppose it fits for the place in question, given the geography and shape of it.  The area from the GPO through O'Connell Street and Moore Street and up to Parnell Square, a square that has also been earmarked as an area for cultural development, has been given zero attention for many decades.  It is an area of great importance, as has been set out by previous speakers.  We could spend hours talking about how important this area was in the 1916 Rising and for our patriot dead, such as the meetings that took place in the old Rotunda building.  Everything took place here.  It should the cultural, historical and social focal point of Dublin but it has never been given that position.</p> <p> The Bill will help to put it there.  The work that Dublin City Council and its councillors are doing should help to put it there and we all need to support this goal.  It is a complex area of history.  The great work of Dublin historians such as &Eacute;amonn Mac Thom&aacute;is or, more contemporaneously, Donal Fallon with his walking tours, wonderfully captures the intertwined histories of the traders, over the course of 200 years, the Rising and the battlefield, in this world that has been dominated by capitalism.  Now there is a group that is seeking to build a shopping centre that will be entered from the O'Connell Street side.  There is a huge battle against that, not just to preserve it but also to build and develop its cultural heritage and significance, which we need to do.</p> <p> My party, on Dublin City Council in the early 2000s through motions tabled by Councillor Dermot Lacey, ensured that 16 Moore Street was declared a protected structure.  When very few people on Dublin City Council were paying the issue any attention, we ensured that this was captured for us in order that we could be in this position now to move forward.  Everyone wants to get to where we need to go.  We want the Moore Street traders there but we want them to be protected, valued and looked after.  We want Moore Street to be preserved and developed as a proper cultural and historical site that pays due respect to the 1916 Rising and everything that took place there, which was fundamentally important to the birth of our State.  We want it to feed in to what will happen in Parnell Square too.  The area from O'Connell Street to Parnell Square can no longer remain deemed by many to be unsafe, underappreciated or under-resourced.  It needs to be put front and centre in the development of Dublin city.  It is a significant area of cultural and historical significance, and the Moore Street quarter that is referenced in the Bill is a huge part of that.</p> <p> Given the Minister of State's history on this issue and his own presentation of a Bill, and given that everyone who has spoken thus far, including on the Government side and I am sure everyone who will speak after me, is looking to achieve the same goal, there is no reason we should not be able to move forward.  The work of the Moore Street advisory group, in tandem with what is going on in Dublin City Council, such as A vision of hope for Moore Street Market, the report presented to the council last month, to my eye has an awful lot of good aspects.  How all these various actors and stakeholders interact with one another in the short term will be vital to where we ultimately go.  The dereliction of Moore Street over the decades should be, and is, a cause for national shame.</p> <p>We cannot be here in ten or 20 years' time, or even further on, having the same debates about this important area in our capital city and this important part of the story of Ireland and our State.  Everyone talks about the sensitivity of the decade of commemorations through which we are living.  As a State, we are ultimately handling this quite well across all sides.  Let us continue to do so with Moore Street.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for bringing this before the House.  I hope we can all work collaboratively to deliver a Moore Street that pays due respect to our history while also looking forward and protecting what is vibrant and great about this part of our great city of Dublin.</p></speech>

I will be doing so on a number of fronts.  I am a representative of the constituency.  I grew up in the north inner city.  I am the son of a Dublin street trader, albeit a Henry Street trader rather than a Moore Street trader - there is a difference.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on introducing this Bill and I commend Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh not only on bringing it forward today but on the work he has done over decades with regard to preserving revolutionary history, preservation for which he has advocated both in his role as a Deputy and as an activist.</p>  <p>  Moore Street represents something extraordinary in this city.  It has been said already that if one were to hear the old voice of Ireland, it probably would be what one hears on Moore Street today, but for me it is a little bit different.  Moore Street represents a fusion of old Dublin and old Ireland and the new Ireland.  Street traders who have carried on their trade there for generations now mix with the new communities that have joined and enhanced us over recent decades.  That is what Moore Street represents today but it is underloved by the State and the city council.  What has emerged is really interesting.  It is a fusion of new communities and old communities which just get on and support one another.  While we absolutely support the preservation of the history of the site, we also want to acknowledge what the area is today.</p>  <p>  I really believe it is a fantastic Bill.  I read it and went through it yesterday and I like the fact that it acknowledges the work the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage did and holds him to account for his words.  We should be always held accountable for what we say in opposition.  If we suggest something in opposition, we should implement it when we have the opportunity to do so.  </p>  <p>  One aspect of the Bill which I find exciting is that it lays out a vision for the city and for an important part of it which is in decline.  I spent six years on the city council and I have very rarely seen that level of ambition.  A conversation was already emerging before Covid but it has accelerated since.  It is about what the centre of our capital city will be over the next five years or the next decade.  I can say what it will not be.  It will not be a place just for shopping centres, shops and all of those other things in which we have invested over recent years when we gave ourselves over to consumerism and capitalism.  That view was already in decline.  Long before Covid emerged, the city centre was losing commercial footfall to shopping centres along the M50.  People were also already starting to shop online.  This means that, if we want to enhance our capital city, we will have to look somewhere different.  The answer is very obvious; we must look to our culture, to our history and to the presentation of ourselves.  I refer to what we present to the people of the world when we invite them here to show what it means to be Irish.  These are the very things that will save us.  This cultural quarter will be part of that.  </p>  <p>  As has been already demonstrated, this can be also connected to the Parnell Street developments.  If we look around the city, we see that Croke Park is a stone's throw away, as is the Abbey Theatre.  All of these really important cultural components of our city are contained within a very small area.  If the city council will not do it, the Parliament has a responsibility to step in and protect this area.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious, when speaking about our revolutionary history, that it is complex.  I do not seek to lecture anybody on the history of this country because there are so many people in and around this Chamber who know it and understand it better than I do.  It is a complex history.  When we talk about our revolutionary past, we should not seek to speak only about the parts where we are valiant or when we stood in opposition to the British.</p> <p>We should also acknowledge that it is difficult and we should not shy away from those aspects of our history.  As we are protecting these battlefield sites, let us also acknowledge the more thorough societal history around them.</p> <p> When one learns about the history of 1916, one cannot help but be in awe of the sacrifice, courage and bravery of those involved.  I remember being in school and hearing that when the rebels were being led out, some people were throwing fruit at them because those people did not support the rebels at the time.  That fascinated me and I could not understand why that would happen.  Then as one develops and takes a broader interest in history through historians such as Myles Dungan, one hears that these were separation women whose husbands had been locked out during the Lock-out of 1913 and had to go off and fight in the First World War.  They were terrified of what that moment would have meant for them with the loss of their incomes as it would probably have led to them facing hunger or their husbands, on the front line or wherever they may have been, facing further victimisation on top of what they were already facing.</p> <p> There are complex histories and narratives that are important when we talk about our revolutionary past.  The communities around it, including the civilian deaths from the bombings and gunshots, are also important. It is important to talk about the revolutionary parts of our history that not only started in 1916 but that were accelerated from then on moving into the War of Independence.  While I love the majesty of the Proclamation of independence as presented in 1916, the document that stands out for me during that revolutionary period is the Democratic Programme of 1919, which for the first time enshrined civic and economic rights.  That moved on to the counter-revolution when that document was described as being largely poetry, and that included the Civil War, and we have not discussed in any great detail what that meant for us.  The Civil War will be another complex conversation we will have to have in the coming years.</p> <p> All of those histories, both the good and the bad, need to be captured as we preserve these battlefield sites.  It is massively important that we do so, and the ultimate question is what did independence mean for the average person on the street?  As we engage in that question, it will incorporate conversations about how we handed control over to the church and all of the hideous things that came from that, including the Magdalen laundries, institutions and asylums.  All of those things must be included when we have a true narrative of our history.</p> <p> I want to talk about what Moore Street and the market represent today.  There is a vital role for one particular group that has not been mentioned, which I am sure is not an omission and which I am sure we can include in the document.  The reason there is still a market in operation on Moore Street today or when we open back up is because of the role the new communities have played in preserving them.</p> <p> I note that the document of the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government from a couple of years ago that is also contained here mentions there will be no more commercial development on the site.  I understand what is being referred to, namely, large multinational shopping centres coming in.  The commercial development that has happened there in the past decade has been carried out by our new communities in opening up small little shops, bringing new types of vegetables onto the street which we had probably not seen in Ireland previously, and merging that with the old and the new.  That contribution from those new communities equally needs to be protected.</p> <p> If there is a vision for Moore Street that requires a new and beautiful market, those communities need to be central to that.  The idea of a market is important.  When we are bringing people into this city in the future, it will not be for shopping centres.  Shopping centres are well catered for all over the M50 and that is where people will drive to, but when we are bringing people into the city, it will be for amenities such as a market, and that market, as laid out in this proposal by Sinn F&eacute;in, has the potential to be really vibrant and different.  It could be something that people will come into the city to experience.  When we do it, we need to work with traders to diversify their stock and we need to fuse in the new communities and their cultures.  If we get that right and if we capture that history and the contemporary aspect of the street, then there will be a vision for this city that is exciting and that has not existed before.</p> <p> One of the conversations we have not had is on the failure of Dublin City Council to present, preserve and enhance these important streets within our capital city, and Moore Street is probably most prominent in that.  That is a failure of leadership and we need to discuss why that failure of leadership continues to happen.</p>  <p>That is no reflection on the councillors who do astounding work with very limited powers.  It is a reflection on the structure of how we give power to unelected bureaucrats who never need to lay out a vision or be accountable for it.  That is one aspect which has left streets like Moore Street in decline.</p> <p> I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing the Bill before the Parliament.  We will support it and we welcome that the Government will not oppose it.  We hope to continue to partake in the discussion as it develops.  This is an exciting vision for the city, which will help us better understand ourselves and better project ourselves not only nationally but on a global stage.  This is the vision of Ireland that will bring people here and help protect our city.</p></speech>

I welcome that it is not being opposed and will be allowed to progress.  I have not heard all the debate and do not want to repeat what others have said.  It is important to recognise the relevance of the monument.  The space between the GPO and Moore Street is very significant in our history - the history of struggle in this country to rid ourselves of British imperialism.  Those most associated with it were the heroes of 1916.</p>  <p>  For me, one of the greatest heroes among them was James Connolly.  The relevance of his role in the Rising should stand out on its own.  Connolly did not actually come from a nationalist tradition.  He came from a socialist tradition but saw the relevance of joining those who were willing to fight to strike at the heart of the British Empire.  This was done in the middle of one of the worst carnages on a global scale, the First World War.  We should not forget that in 1916 the First World War was raging.  In the words of a famous poem, "Dublin's broken union men die first in Flanders fields" because many of them after the Lockout could not get any other work, fled into the ranks of the British Army and were killed at the Somme, Flanders and the other famous horrible battle sites.  </p>  <p>  Connolly stood out among the international socialists as somebody who absolutely opposed the First World War.  There was major pressure on socialists and people who are engaged in international fightback at the time to endorse the war as a way of protecting what were then called the small nations, such as Belgium.  That was the spin put on it by the British Empire.  Connolly, Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were among a handful of socialists who stood up, condemned the war and declared their opposition to it.  That is very relevant to this battle site because the role of James Connolly in an international historical context cannot be forgotten.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that after the Rising many of the auxiliaries and the officers who fought the volunteers at the GPO and elsewhere across the city were then moved off to Palestine to carry out the British divide and conquer there; we can see the bitter fruits of where all that has left us today.  </p>  <p>  The British Empire was an empire in which it was said the sun never set, but it was also said that on it the blood never dried, which is very true.  We can see the connections between the Rising in Dublin and its consequences across the empire where revolts in India and some countries in Africa and in the Middle East against the British Empire were inspired by the handful of brave men and women who stood up against the might of this imperialist force in 1916.  That is a very important international lesson that we should remember.  We should also remember the lessons from one group of colonial repressed people rising up against their oppressor were learned without the benefit of television, Facebook, Twitter are any of the modern connectivity that we have, but connectivity was nevertheless there.</p>  <p>  Famously, Lenin wrote about the Rising in Dublin and put it up to the rest of the international socialist movement that James Connolly absolutely did the right thing by throwing in his lot with the nationalists and striking a blow against the British Empire in the middle of the First World War.</p> <p>For me, that is an aspect of the history that it is not only important to remember, but should also attract people to this site once we have it in our grasp and treat it properly as a national monument.</p> <p> I would like now to focus on what is in the Bill and how, possibly, it could be amended.  I refer to the idea of a living city.  A city is not alive without people living in it.  Paris, Berlin, Brussels and many of the other wonderful European cities that have cultural quarters also have populations living in them.  We, unfortunately, do not have people, or at least enough people, living in places such as Moore Street and the quarter surrounding it.  We should be pushing for public housing in this area such that we can take people off the housing list and bring them back to live in the heart of the city where many of them have come from.  At the time the Rising took place, it was a living city, but that is not the case now.  </p> <p> Others have mentioned the relevance of the market and the Moore Street traders.  Clearly, they are very much part of the future and they cannot be forgotten about, but the other communities that I believe we should factor into whatever plans we have are the new communities that have kept Moore Street going.  Moore Street would have collapsed long ago through neglect were it not for the Chinese, African and Indian shops and restaurants built up there.  They have kept that street alive, enhanced it and made it more multicultural, vibrant and interconnected than ever before.  There has to be a special place for the new communities in the campaign to create this quarter.  </p> <p> The campaign to reclaim Moore Street was important because it was neglected by the city council.  When I was a councillor people such as James Connolly Heron, the Moore Street traders and others were constantly lobbying councillors to try to get something done to reclaim Moore Street and to not let the developers flatten it and change its character entirely.  At one stage, councillors were brought on a walking tour from the GPO through the back alleyways while it was explained to us how the escape from the GPO took place and where they took refuge before the surrender.  We were then brought into the houses to see how the walls had been blown through from one house to another in an attempt to escape.  That campaign is to be commended.  We would not be here today were it not for people resisting the agenda of the developers and the neglect of the godfathers of this city, namely, those who run the city council.  They have neglected the city badly in many ways.  It is down to ordinary people that it was preserved.  </p> <p> My final comment relates to the company that the Bill proposes to establish.  At all costs, we should avoid - this may have been referenced earlier and I missed it - this company turning into a replica of the Temple Bar Investment Trust.  We cannot allow that.  We need something that will be about people, history and culture, not stag parties and people drinking to all hours of the night and taking away from the dignity of the area.  It has to be open and accountable in terms of the culture and the history, remain that way and not be seen as a means of topping of the profits of the drinks and entertainment industry across this city.  I look forward to the debate around it and to making a positive contribution to it.  </p> <p> Go raibh maith agat do Sinn F&eacute;in agus molaim an Bille don Teach.</p></speech>

Given that it is about Moore Street in Dublin, one might wonder why a Deputy from Galway would be concerned about it, but it signals what we need to do with many of our buildings around this country that have gone into dereliction because we do not have the means or the courage to maintain them and bring them back into use.  It is important Moore Street is blended into a modern Ireland.  We must ensure we bring life back into that part of the city, a life that complements the history of that particular site.</p>  <p>  The recently published Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland report shows that more than 70% of the space over retail units in Dublin is vacant.</p> <p>That space is there to be utilised and brought back to life in order that people can live there and have a living city.  The reason it is not being used is that there are huge issues around trying to match up the heritage and archaeological aspects of the sites with the requirements of making them viable for people to live there.  We have a challenge in this regard and it is one that arises throughout the country.  In my own constituency, there are public buildings that are completely derelict because we do not have the appetite or the funding to bring them back into use.  It is a shame that is not being done because it would unlock huge potential in terms of having places of interest in the places where people are living and working and ensuring we have vibrant societies in towns and cities throughout the country.</p> <p> Moore Street is probably the best example of where we have, in effect, been paralysed in our thinking about how we can maintain our heritage and history and, at the same time, bring it back into use.  We need to set a template by which local authorities, councillors and policymakers can provide the funding to ensure we get the full potential from all the sites throughout the country, rather than just tipping around the edges with them.  This is a fine example of where we need to have new and fresh thinking.  This Bill is a platform by which we can do that and I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing it forward.  It starts the debate that is needed to ensure local authorities know what they need to do to realise the full potential of these sites.</p> <p> Every place in this country has history.  It is in our fields, towns and villages, but it is locked up in dereliction and nobody goes near it.  It is a shame.  Abbeyknockmoy in Galway is the location of one of the best-kept abbeys in Europe.  It is a beautiful place but nobody goes there.  It should be a beacon of light for tourism in north Galway.  There is also Tuam, which was the capital of Ireland at one stage and the place from which the O'Connors ruled the country.  It is an archdiocese with huge historic buildings but they are not being used properly because there is a conflict between their preservation and their use.  We cannot just put a lock around them and say that nobody can go into them.  We need to embrace the potential of the assets we have and bring them back into use as quickly as possible while retaining their cultural and heritage value.  We will all benefit from that into the future.</p></speech>

The lanes that surround Moore Street record the heroism and actions of the people who were out in 1916.  The Moore Street battlefield site was the location of the final stand of many of the Volunteers who fought in the GPO.  They came under heavy machine gun fire in the laneways around Moore Street as they set up the headquarters of the 1916 provisional government and the final council of war.  Those actions were the precursor to the independent State of today and the precursor, we hope, to the independence of the North of Ireland some sunny day soon.</p>  <p>  The freedoms we have in this State today are a direct result of the heroism of the men and women who fought on that battlefield site.  I ask the Ministers who hold office today to think about the fact they do so in large part because of the actions of the men and women of 1916 on this particular site.  What is the result of holding office when it comes to the Moore Street battlefield site?  After ten years of Fine Gael in government, the most important battlefield site of the Republic is shrouded in grime and dereliction.  It is a place where people urinate and defecate and where traders are assaulted.  More than 100 years after the 1916 Rising, this battlefield site, the birthplace of the Republic, is an absolutely derelict site.  After all the talking, Bills and forums, it is an outdoor toilet.</p>  <p>  That is an absolutely shocking dereliction of duty when it comes to our heritage as a people, country and nation.  It is a shocking dereliction of duty in terms of the responsibilities we owe to the traders who operate on that site.  This dereliction of duty shows the priorities of the Government.  I have been on some of those groups, committees and forums and I have listened to the D&aacute;il debates on this issue.  The net result of the ten years of work on Moore Street is dereliction.  It has been allowed to die a slow death.  That should not be the case because the Moore Street site presents a serious opportunity.  It could be an engine of renewal in the north inner city.  It could be a cultural hub that breathes new life into the area west of O'Connell Street.  It could be where the historical, cultural, Irish language and commercial interests of this country can operate successfully side by side.  A rejuvenated Moore Street could rival the great outdoor markets that are seen in other European cities.</p>  <p>  Instead, it is a derelict site because of Fine Gael's inaction over the past ten years.  The Government is paralysed, waiting for Hammerson, which owned much of the battlefield site, to act.  The Government's strategy, like the strategy of the previous Government, is to defer to the commercial interests of the vulture funds that have owned this site.  The Government has given primacy to the commercial interests of large property companies at the cost of Ireland's heritage.  This battlefield site is now the site of another battle between large international property owners and the citizens' and relatives' groups that are battling to keep the site as part of Ireland's valuable heritage.  On which side is the Government in this battle?  On which side are Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party?  Fine Gael has stood with the property interests against the heritage of Ireland for many a long year.  Anybody who wants another example of this simply has to look at what happened to The O'Rahilly house in the past six months.  Despite my warnings to the Government, it was allowed to be demolished.</p>  <p>  Where does Fianna F&aacute;il stand on this?  It stands in different places depending on the weather and whether it is in government.  The Bill we are discussing today is largely based on one brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, which he quickly dropped as soon as he got a ministerial seat under his rear end.  It is an incredible situation that Fianna F&aacute;il will say one thing in government but be a different party when in opposition.</p>  <p>  The deferral to Hammerson's plan is a massive mistake.  It was reported in the newspapers just this week that Hammerson is in serious financial trouble, posting a &euro;1.7 billion loss for 2020.  The company gave a formal warning regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.  The Government has put all its eggs in the Hammerson basket in regard to the rejuvenation of Moore Street, but this is a property company that may not be able to make it to the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Why is the Government waiting to act?  The State already owns a large number of buildings on the street.  We could be rejuvenating the parts of the street that the State already owns.  We could have a museum there and begin breathing new life into the street.  We in Aont&uacute; have already introduced a Bill with proposals for Moore Street and we have campaigned strongly for the heritage of this country to be given the value to which it is entitled.  Unfortunately, our efforts have been landing on deaf ears to date.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an mBille seo.  I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing forward this important Private Members' Bill.  Unfortunately, we are seeing the typical political stances taken by the main parties, especially Fianna F&aacute;il.  I note from research that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, when he was a Seanad&oacute;ir, brought forward a Bill on which the legislation we are discussing today was modelled.  As the last speaker said, it is amazing that when one get's one's bund&uacute;n into the nice surroundings of a ministerial car, one can forget one's principles and ideals.</p> <p>The person can forget our heritage and the significance of what the people did to give us the freedom to be able to rent this dastardly place - it is so big and expensive - to sit here during the pandemic.</p> <p> It is vital that we preserve our heritage and have those people recognised.  While I am at it, I hope the Acting Chairman will allow me to mention the great Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Treasaigh, who lost his life on Talbot Street.  A person would have to look with a magnifying glass to find the plaque on the wall.  It seems we cannot have a proper and fitting monument in a place off our main thoroughfare to salute the heroic sacrifice that Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Treasaigh made with many others and the gallant way he fought for our freedom.  The plaque is not even clean.  A stranger would not see it if he walked down the street as it is up high on the wall and barely visible.  It is a shame that we get such little recognition of our patriots.</p> <p> The creation of a cultural quarter for the inner city to boost tourism and increase footfall to the local economy of the area is an excellent idea.  We cannot have the country plundered and literally raped by developers for their own profits.  We need to have cultural quarters.  We need to have areas like this preserved, protected and maintained.  We need a living city for our famous and renowned song, dance and poetry agus stair.  We see today the impact on our heritage with the practice in any village of a fete being banned.  We are one of only three countries in the world in this position.  Saudi Arabia and North Korea are the others.  My goodness, I did not think we would be trampling to get to the top of that line.</p> <p> We need to recognise where we came from with regard to our rich heritage.  We need to have it.  It is great to have historians to write about it but we need to have living memory.</p> <p> This is an excellent Bill by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I do not know what position the Government is taking on it but I would not be surprised either way.  As someone said, there is a different position every day depending on the weather forecast and what way the wind is blowing.  The Rural Independent Group supports this legislation wholeheartedly.</p> <p> I took a stroll outside two weeks ago with Deputy Collins.  We went down the back near Sheriff Street.  We saw the residents down there.  They are living people.  I am not talking about history and heritage - they are living.  They have been swallowed up by greed, developers, hotels, and apartments.  Their lives have been ruined.  When they saw us walking, they knocked on windows and asked whether we would wait and talk to them.  I spoke to a lovely gentleman.  He explained that he got little support from any political party when it came to stopping the madness that went on with houses.  We are in the country and we try to get planning for a house but there may be problems if a development is overshadowing another house or if it is in any way affecting the views.  These people have been swallowed up.  We expect them to live in those conditions.  It is a scandal and should not be happening so we are supporting this legislation.</p></speech>

The UK property group, Hammerson, owns a six-acre site stretching from O'Connell Street to Moore Street and Parnell Street.  It is to seek planning permission next month that will involve knocking down buildings and changing the streets.  I am in full agreement with the measure in the Bill to put a preservation order on the terrace and curtilage of the premises from 10 to 25 Moore Street.</p>  <p>  While speaking about history I would like to mention my area of Lowertown, Schull and the Michael John McLean memorial.  Michael John lost his life 100 years ago in December in Gaggan, Bandon.  I am delighted to have played a part in remembering Michael John on 8 December last.  There was a hard-working committee comprising Michael Bambrick, Tim Bannon, Colin O'Driscoll, Bernard O'Sullivan and Gr&aacute;inne Wilson who have worked on the surrounding of the McLean memorial in Lowertown.  We need to protect and respect our culture and areas.</p>  <p>  I am keen to speak about the fine museum and memorial gardens in west Cork, including the Michael Collins Centre between Ballinascarthy and Timoleague run by the Crowley family.  This museum has never received a cent in State funding but it is one of the finest dedicated to Michael Collins in Ireland.  My thanks to the Crowley family, who are relations of the late General Michael Collins.  This is surely is one of the greatest historical museums in the country and we could well do with supporting it not only by visiting it but with State recognition for the people as well.</p>  <p>  The Kilbrittain memorial committee built a memorial garden in 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of people in the area who died at that time.  The parish lost the most people in the sense that eight local people out of 800 in the parish lost their lives more than 100 years ago.  The committee intends to erect a bronze statue of Charlie Hurley, the officer commanding the west Cork brigade.  The committee is seeking funding for the statue.  A modest amount from the State would make such a difference for groups who want to commemorate those heroic days.  It is time for this country to stop talking and start funding these vital community commemorations.  We should remember that west Cork played a most active part in Ireland in 1916.  Throughout west Cork there was equally strong committed work done by the membership of Cumman na mBan.  We should remember that the War of Independence would never have been the success it was but for the work and suffering of these great women.  Many were imprisoned and went on hunger strike during the Civil War.</p>  <p>  We should also give great credit to voluntary organisations like the Crossbarry community action group, whose commemoration has been moved from this year to next year, like so many others, due to the pandemic.  The Battle of Crossbarry was the turning point in the War of Independence.  It was led by Tom Barry and during the battle the great Charlie Hurley lost his life.  I know Joe Croke, Marie Murphy, Leo Flynn, Maureen Bohan and others are working towards that commemoration.  Credit needs to go to these people.  I mentioned Joe Croke.  He is also involved in the Lowertown committee so he is an all-round type of person.</p>  <p>  I genuinely support this Bill.  It is something I have heard Deputies speaking on for a long time.  I agree that a preservation order should be put in place where Moore Street is concerned.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Sinn F&eacute;in for giving us the opportunity.</p>  <p>  I recognise and appreciate what the men and women in Moore Street did more than 100 years ago to secure our freedom.  We are all joined here, regardless of the political party to which we are affiliated or otherwise, to appreciate those people who fought and gave their lives for our freedom.  There are places in Kerry where people fought.  The people involved included men and women from Cumman na mBan.  There were men like Tadhg Coffey and his gallant group who fought at the Countess Bridge in Killarney.  There were the men at Ballyseedy.  Stephen Fuller was the only one to survive.  They were all tied together.  Then a bomb was put into the middle of them by the English and they were blown sky-high.  Stephen Fuller survived.  Then the local flying column took on the English at Headford.  But for the train coming sooner than it should have from the fair in Kenmare, they would have done more or sorted out more of the English soldiers that day.  However, they did kill eight.  Two volunteers, Allman and Bailey, lost their lives after they were shot.  Others involved included men like Johnny O'Connor, who became a Deputy, Michael Doherty from Lisnagrave, Tom 'Scarteen' O'Connor from Kenmare, Captain Flynn, Pat Shea and Tommy Mac from Ballymacelligott.  I want to thank the local commemoration committee, including Derry Healy, Jimmy Kelly, Seamas Moynihan, Michael Scannell and Tina Healy from Rockfield.  Her grandfather was Dan Healy from Rockfield.  He was in the fight on that day of 21 March.  Tim Horgan and Liz Spillane, a local girl, were involved too.  I knew Dan Patsy O'Sullivan from Kilgarvan who was there.  He lived to be old and I was glad to have known him while he was alive.  I appreciate very much what he and his companions did.  There were 39 of them there on that day.  They had a major victory.  It put the English in their place and put them thinking.  They were never the same or as strong after losing that battle at Headford.</p>  <p>  I really appreciate the freedom that they gave for us in that major fight.  Everyone here has to appreciate those people and understand what they went through.  There was torture and torment.  Some of them were tortured and went through a major ordeal to secure our freedom.  I support the Bill.  It is important that Moore Street stays the same as it is.  We have to remember the people - the men and women - who fought there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="12:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400019#R00100"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I will start by paying tribute to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for introducing this important Bill.  Interestingly, the Government is using the usual tactic of accepting the Bill on Second Stage and sending it towards Committee Stage where it will probably stay and die a death.  Instead of doing that or voting down the Bill, the Government could have the strength of its convictions and tell us how it will deal with the problem.  In reality, though, it will not deal with the problem.</p>  <p>  What happened on Moore Street and Moore Lane in 1916 was important for everyone nationally, not only Dubliners.  It is important we remember the struggle to gain our freedom.  This debate shows how far we have regressed since then in terms of how the Government responds to Bills and how much the preservation of our history, including a battle site, is developer led.  That is disappointing.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, outlined what would be done and what the Government intended to do.  It sounded good.  He spoke about negotiations with the developer on an underground station to tie into the line from the airport and on 100 residential units on the site.  He also spoke about how 9,000 jobs would be created.  Behind it all, though, we must wait for the developer.  To preserve Moore Street and the rest of the site, which was important in the development and foundation of our State and in the Irish people asserting themselves, we are waiting for the developer to come up with a plan.</p>  <p>  This situation has been going on for many years.  The first developer went bust, so a plan never materialised.  The House just heard that the current developer, Hammerson, will appear before the courts in coming weeks because it is also going bust.  This means the plan will be put back again and we will have to wait for another developer to come along.  The State should take in the historical sites, make preservation orders and tell any future developer that wants to develop around them that it must work to our development plan, not the other way around.  Doing this would be important in standing up for and preserving our sites.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that funding had been earmarked for the site.  Of course it has been earmarked.  It is earmarked because it depends on whether the current developer survives and puts forward its plans, gets planning permission and is willing to do this work.  Everything depends on the developer.  That is the crux of the problem and is the reason the Government does not want to accept this Bill.  It does not want what must be done laid down in legislation.  Instead, it wants to hold off and facilitate the developer in developing the site and making as much money as it can.  This shows where our State has come to, in that we have given over our rights and wishes concerning our national identity to developers.  Everything is development led.  That is the sad reality of the situation.</p>  <p>  We should propose what we want to do and make it happen.  This Bill shows that we can do so.  In the Seanad in 2015, the Minister stated it was his intention to introduce such legislation.  It is another sign of how things work in the State that, as usual, he forgot all about doing so as soon as he entered government and went along with the Government's plans, whatever they were, to ensure developers were protected.  This shows how the State has developed.  We can say and do one thing in opposition and, as soon as we move across into the comfortable seats, we forget it all and continue the process that has been under way.  I hope people will see the cynicism in that, that it needs to change and that such change will be delivered.  I hope it will be a salutary message to anyone who in future takes the Government members' positions that this has to change.</p>  <p>  Deputies stand on this side of the House and propose ideas.  When they move over to the Government side, their role is to ensure those ideas are fulfilled.  If something is worthwhile when they are standing here, it is still worthwhile when they are standing on the Government side.  That should not change just because civil servants, Deputies' partners in government or developers tell them it is not worthwhile.  Developers should not be treated as gods.  We must ensure there is continuity and that, when something is said in the House, people try to deliver on it when they get the chance.  We will then have a State that is worthwhile for everyone.</p>  <p>  What is happening around the commemoration of this 1916 site is symbolic of everything that is wrong in the State.  Developers are leading on it and politicians are saying one thing but doing another when they get into power.  This has to change.  If it did change, for example, through this Bill, it would be a good legacy.  Unfortunately, the Government has not changed it.</p></speech>

I reiterate the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan's affirmation of sharing the sense of great importance about the 1916 Rising and its central place in the history of our State and of the importance of remembering it and preserving the traces and memories that remain of those events and everyone involved.  No one party has ownership of the past, nor the right to appropriate it.  The hallmarks of the approach to commemoration have been the lack of partisanship and a shared agreement to engage together.  The all-party Oireachtas committee on commemorations and the model of stakeholder participation that is the Moore Street advisory group, now in its third and final phase, are models for that shared, mature and self-confident approach to addressing a seminal moment in our history.</p>  <p>  There has been much talk about the rejuvenation of our cities and towns in a post-pandemic period, including a renewed emphasis on liveability and quality of life with a greater mix of diverse uses to include cultural activities and events, as well as more homes, jobs and shops.  This is particularly true of the area in question, which is the traditional retail heart of Dublin and includes sites and buildings that have been subject to regeneration and development proposals for many years.  It is clear the pandemic has resulted in the acceleration of underlying trends in retail, including a shift to online shopping and suburban shopping centres and, consequently, vacant floor space arising from the critical loss of vibrancy and footfall.  This, combined with the impact of much of the workforce operating from home, has given rise to a serious challenge to our city centres.  We need to ensure we can develop sustainable and complementary alternative uses for central parts of our cities, in particular the complex and historical urban quarters that are of cultural, heritage and commercial value.  There is also a need to respond to changing trends and opportunities while retaining the key elements of areas' essential characters.</p>  <p>  To be sustainable, regeneration must ensure the future viability and attractiveness of places on an ongoing basis and be overseen by governance and funding mechanisms that are accountable and transparent.  Plans must be inclusive and involve all stakeholders, with no single interest having a veto.  To be successful and implementable, plans must be sufficiently grounded in reality and attract investment.  Ultimately, regeneration is about creating places that people want to live, work, visit and invest in and can remain so for future generations.</p>  <p>  I note the proposed functions of An Cheathr&uacute; in developing strategies of a commercial and commemorative nature to ensure Moore Street becomes a fitting and permanent tribute to the events of 1916.  The Ireland 2016 centenary programme included significant State investment in a capital programme of permanent reminders dedicated to the men and women of 1916 and the wider revolutionary period.  Eight flagship capital projects - the permanent reminders - were supported around the country.  Six of these are in Dublin, some quite close to the Moore Street area.</p> <p>They include the development of the GPO Witness History interpretive and visitor centre and the restoration and adaptation of two buildings that were part of Richmond Barracks, particularly the building in which the 1916 leaders were interred and court-martialled.  The programme also included the creation of an exhibition and interpretive space which offers an important amenity for the public and the local community as a modern heritage site.  There was an initiative funded by Dublin City Council and the Government to develop 14 Henrietta Street into a centre of the exploration of Georgian and tenement life in the north inner city of Dublin, incorporating exhibitions, a living oral history initiative and a training programme for the conservation of trade skills.  Another initiative was the restoration of the historic Kevin Barry Rooms in the National Concert Hall which were the setting for the Treaty ratification debates of the Second D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in London on 6 December 1921.  Other projects include the refurbishment of Kilmainham Courthouse and the completion of the new military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks.</p> <p> It is obvious, however, that Moore Street itself needs special attention and needs it now.  As such, I understand the motivation and concerns of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in introducing the Bill.  The trading situation on Moore Street is long and beloved.  The traders rely on a friendly and welcoming atmosphere in the area in order to continue to make a living in what is invariably a long-standing family tradition of trading on Moore Street.  It would be an absolute tragedy to allow this important part of our history to come to an end.  However, positive things are new beginnings.</p> <p> The acquisition by the State of the national monument at 14 to 17 Moore Street was an important step forward.  The recent announcement of a significant urban regeneration and development funding allocation will contribute significantly to the reversing of urban decay and the decline that has unfortunately been to the forefront in the north inner city in recent years.  I heartily welcome the opportunity presented by this allocation.  I understand the funding has been accelerated to progress getting the national monument to a stage at which it can be fully refurbished and presented for public tours.  The refurbishment and opening of the national monument, along with the advances in plans for the wider area will, no doubt, have positive feedback and knock-on effects for the street and markets.  The traders themselves can expect better times ahead and look forward to a better atmosphere and operating environment, as can local businesses that are struggling in the current circumstances.  On the subject of Moore Street traders, as Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, I encourage and fully welcome continued discussion with and support for the traders on the part of Dublin City Council.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that Hammerson, the owner of most of the Dublin central site, is in continuing discussions with the traders and aims to mitigate any destruction during the construction phases of the plans.  I also welcome the fact that there have been significant developments and changes in the Hammerson plans on foot of earlier submissions by the Moore Street advisory group.  I understand that the group showed and updated its plans earlier this year and that they were broadly welcomed.  The group now has an unprecedented opportunity to influence the future of the area for the better.  I know it will share its views with Hammerson before the planning application is finalised.  I am delighted with the commitment in the developer's latest plans to retain the fabric of the large number of buildings with historical significance, such as Conway's public house, Nos. 8 to 10 Moore Street, Nos. 20 and 21 Moore Street, O'Brien's Stables, O'Brien's Bottling Stores and the potential artistic use of the White House site, along with the re-imagining of No. 10 Henry Place as a potential gallery.  This will be particularly welcome in the context of commemorating the events of 1916.</p></speech>

I thank the Moore Street campaign and the proposers of the Bill because it does reflect the ambition of the Bill which I drafted in 2015 with the then Senator, now Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, supported by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Senator Fitzpatrick.  The Minister has already put his money where his mouth is by allocating &euro;12 million to the regeneration of the street, the commemorative centre and supporting the traders.  That builds on the decision by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, former Deputy Dick Roche, to designate it a national monument and the decision of the previous Government to take it into public ownership.</p>  <p>  I ask that Members work together on this issue.  We can deliver a world-class centre on this site.  I ask that we do not divide on the issue.  Some of the comments made during the debate today were false and incorrect.  I refer in particular to Deputy Munster stating that the national monument is being handed over to a private company.  In fact, the exact opposite is happening.  I think the record should be protected.  When we are standing at the opening alongside Deputy Munster, she will have been proved wrong and we will have delivered for the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

The debate on the Bill has adequately reflected the really important place that Moore Street occupies in the story of our country.  The years of neglect and abandonment by the State have not diminished its aura or its legacy for our people, notwithstanding the reality of the dereliction and grime and, as one Deputy described it, it being used as an outdoor lavatory from time to time.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, it is a place at the very heart of our country's long struggle for independence and a republic.  It is hallowed ground.  Its laneways are the laneways of history.  When one walks its streets, one walks in the footsteps of the brave men and women of the 1916 Rising who carried the dream of an Ireland that could be free, equal and united, a nation that cherishes equality and justice for all.  That is no small thing.  These are not just buildings, laneways and streets.  This is where the Republic lived as the rebels of Easter week fought to break the connection between Ireland and British imperialism.  It was in the Moore Street area that the very heart of that Republic beat.  It then reverberated through the years that followed and across the world.  Following six days of heroic resistance, the centre of our city of Dublin lay in ruins.  Five of the leaders of the Provisional Government met for the last time in No. 16 Moore Street and ordered the surrender.</p>  <p>  What happened 105 years ago in the area surrounding Moore Street changed the course of our history forever.  The area includes the historic terrace at Nos. 10 to 25 Moore Street, as well as the GPO, the White House, the O'Brien's Bottling Stores on Henry Place and the lanes, streets and boundaries of Moore Street, Moore Lane, Henry Place and O'Rahilly Parade.  What happened in these places, the stage upon which our city fought an empire, ensured that things would never be the same again.  As Yeats wrote, "All changed, changed utterly".</p> <p>The 1916 Rising brought with it a wind of history that has left its mark on every square inch of the Moore Street area.  That is why the battlefield site was rightly recognised by the High Court in 2016 as a national monument.  As has been said today, most countries have sites and buildings that are important to them in terms of their journeys to nationhood and freedom, revered places that stand in testimony to a people risen in the name of their independence.  It is right that these places are honoured and we should honour ours too.  Moore Street should be and can be a landmark of modern Irish history, a citadel of the values so poetically expressed in the Proclamation and in the Democratic Programme.</p> <p> Not only is the Moore Street area renowned for its place in our revolutionary history, but it is also teeming with culture and tradition.  The Moore Street market has been referred to.  It is Dublin's oldest food market and predates the Famine.  It is a place where generations of people have come to witness and soak up Dublin heritage at its most raw and in the most everyday of ways.  No trip to our nation's capital is complete without a walk among the stalls of Moore Street or without encountering the wit, banter and charm of our traders.  The authentic atmosphere and unvarnished experience of the Moore Street market is special and it is an experience that we must preserve, enhance and promote as part of our city's attractions.  The laneways of Moore Street echo with our past but they also chime loudly with the prospect of a vibrant future.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's Bill to revitalise the 1916 Moore Street quarter is about building an exciting future for an area that is steeped in our very proud history.  We need to unite over the truth that our heritage and past are too important to be handed over to the whims of a private developer who would perhaps pave over our history with a shopping centre.  The Hammerson plan should be rejected openly and outright and the listing of the buildings on Moore Street should continue.  The regeneration of the area can be advanced through the development of art, music and sport, as well as establishing a permanent, outdoor Moore Street market.  Such a creative and modern approach would boost tourism, footfall and jobs in an effective way.  This Bill supports the approach envisaged by the Save Moore Street and 1916 relatives groups who have fought long and hard for the State to take action to preserve and revitalise the area.  Indeed, it should be noted that the group's own impressive plan would see much-needed housing, retail and cultural experiences woven throughout this historic quarter.  That is the right plan for this area and should be adopted and driven by the State.  That plan has the potential to transform the inner city and act as a catalyst for further regeneration and enhancement.</p> <p> For far too long, Governments and Ministers have delayed acting and that needs to stop.  At the beginning of our debate, the Minister reflected that, in his view, we were in a better place.  That is true and it is not.  It is true inasmuch as we now have an identifiable national monument but it is not true insofar as we still face a reluctance, hesitancy and refusal to grasp this opportunity.  I want to challenge all of us, particularly those in government, to be ambitious and see the bigger picture.  Easter week in 1916 was a watershed time for Dublin, Ireland and, arguably, the world.  The leaders of the Rising who met for the last time at 16 Moore Street knew the importance of seizing the moment and, with this Bill, we now have the opportunity to create a vibrant 1916 historical quarter, a living museum in the heart of our city.  This is our moment and I wish us to seize it.  The 1916 Rising changed the course of Irish history.  It is not enough for the Government simply not to oppose this legislation and then sit back and do nothing.  We need active support for this legislation now.  I agree that we need to work in a united fashion and a collegiate way.  We need to sit down together to make this a reality.  No time can be lost.  We should adopt an all-Oireachtas approach and bring this Bill to life.</p></speech>

Some have highlighted the scandalous planning decisions associated with this area and the cultural vandalism of the State in the past.  The questionable role of NAMA and its officials in many of the projects has also been raised.  The Committee of Public Accounts might find a way to look at NAMA's Project Jewel and the fact that one NAMA official who was centrally involved in the Moore Street transaction left NAMA to head Hammerson Ireland, the company that is seeking to destroy parts of the 1916 fabric.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, apologised to me last night for the fact that he was unable to be here for the debate and told me he was not opposing the Bill.  I welcome his commitment and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to work constructively to ensure that any potential policy, legal and financial issues contained in the Bill are addressed.  I have put forward the Bill and I have been around here long enough to understand that it is not the Bill that will be before us at the end of the process.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the support for the Bill from, in particular, the traders and retailers on the street.  They do not want the Hammerson plan and do not have faith in the company.  They support my Bill's intention to establish a cultural quarter with homes above the shops, not another Temple Bar.  They have not been bought by the pie-in-the-sky job figures that were mentioned earlier or the promise of a metro sometime, somewhere, or the footfall figures based on a golden era of shopping malls that has long passed.  That era will not continue post pandemic.</p>  <p>  I want people to take the time to imagine a lively street with shops, market stalls, street entertainers, caf&eacute;s, music, galleries, butchers, bakers, bookshops, corner shops, our national monument buildings and the historic experience associated with them.  That is the intention of my Bill.  We have an opportunity here.  If that opportunity is lost by allowing Hammerson to develop, we will be doing a disservice to our historical culture.  Just in case the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is not aware of the fact, the decade of centenaries committee has not met for years and the Moore Street advisory group, MSAG, is not likely to support the Hammerson plan.  In fact, quite the opposite is likely if it takes a position on this matter at all.  I thank Deputies for taking part in the debate.</p></speech>

Thousands have not seen a day's work in a year.  Many have not seen family or friends in months and small businesses are either closing or struggling to survive.  It is fair to say that people have made huge sacrifices to suppress the virus following the dangerous position we found ourselves in after Christmas.  However, infection rates remain very high.  NPHET has warned that we are in a very &quot;volatile and precarious&quot; position.  People are now anxious about the possibility of a fourth wave.  They are worried about the prospect of a lost summer after months of slogging it out with this virus.<br/><br/>We are now approaching 5 April, the date the public had hoped would bring some relief from restrictions, yet people are still waiting to hear the Government's plan as to what lies ahead.  Instead of clear communication and strong leadership, what we have had throughout the crisis is mixed messages and kite-flying.  To say that people are at the end of their tether is in many cases an understatement.  They have seen the Government fail to do what needs to be done to get ahead of the virus, to pave a pathway for a safe reopening of society.  That has left many in disbelief.  I refer specifically to a stuttering vaccine roll-out, a failure to adequately ramp up testing and tracing and the <i>carte blanche</i>that has been given to meat factories, for example, with devastating consequences.<br/><br/>However, I think it is the refusal to deal with international travel that stands at the top of the list.  The lack of common sense in Government policy is mesmerising.  The situation is that people cannot go 5 km from their home, but they have to watch as up to 10,000 people a week arrive here from abroad, many on non-essential trips, including holidays.  As early as last May, public health officials were urging the Government to implement a full and proper form of mandatory quarantine.  These calls were ignored and that has left us exposed.  In the meantime, thousands travelled here from other countries.  Ten months later, the Government has introduced a scheme that does not go far enough.  The list of 33 countries is far too limited and, in any event, only two of those countries have direct flights into Ireland.  We have a half-baked plan that leaves us vulnerable to importation of the virus and to further dangerous variants, the threat from which was keenly highlighted in NPHET's most recent letter to the Government last week.  We need a system of real mandatory quarantine for all non-essential arrivals from all countries.  That is the only approach that will get the job done.  It will send a message to international travellers that now is not the time to come here.</p></speech>

I recall when I came in here early this year we had 42,000 cases in one week and we had 2,000 people in hospital.  I made it clear on that occasion that I wanted to see a consistent suppression of the virus.  In the past seven days we had 3,800 cases and 325 or 329 in hospital.  The point is that the sacrifices people have made have had an impact in getting case numbers dramatically down from the January figure and getting hospitalisations dramatically down, as well as the numbers in ICU, which are currently at 76.  That needs to be said.  The level 5 restrictions have worked effectively to bring numbers down very significantly from where they were.  That needs to be acknowledged.  People need to know that and not to be given mixed messages by the Opposition which consistently tries to blur the facts.  The numbers are still relatively high compared to the first and second waves.  The fundamental reason for that is we are dealing with a variant that is highly transmissible and more dangerous.  That is the context.  We have been very clear that increased mobility can be a factor in facilitating the spread of the variant.  That is why we are currently in level 5.  I have been very consistent in saying publicly and in every forum that no decision has been made on the post 5 April situation.  We will be engaging with the public health advice and other research regarding this.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge the enormous stress, strain and difficulties the current lockdown is imposing on people in terms of the restrictions on their personal freedom and liberties, keeping within 5 km and not meeting up with others.  The reason for that is we do not want to go back to a situation where we have 2,000 people in hospital or 42,000 cases in a given week.  That is what we must avoid.  The variant is essentially a new virus in terms of endeavouring to contain it.  That governs how we will approach the phase after 5 April.  I am watching other countries such as Czechia, France, Germany, Slovakia and a range of countries in Europe where the trajectory is upwards.  Ours is flattening but it has gone back up in the past seven days.  That is something we need to very seriously take into account.</p>  <p>  We are the first country in the European Union to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine.  I assure Deputy McDonald that I want to try to develop a united front here, but she was encouraging people and pressing the Government to facilitate travel at Christmas time.  She said that publicly.  She had her own definition of what constituted essential travel.  Up to quite recently she said mandatory quarantine should be for non-essential travel, which misses the point about mandatory quarantine in the first instance, because once one has mandatory quarantine it is designed to-----</p></speech>

The question that arises is how we get from under this, how we carve out a pathway where we can reopen safely and where society and the economy can remain open.  It is very clear at this stage that in the absence of adequate testing and tracing, a very efficient and safe vaccination programme and the necessary protections at ports and airports, we will not be in a position to reopen in a way that is safe and can be sustained.</p>  <p>  Let me return to my question which essentially revolves around mandatory hotel quarantine for all non-essential travel.  The Government has taken a half measure and half measures will not cut it.  The fragility and danger of this situation have been amplified again here today.</p></speech>

One is the jaw-dropping decisions being taken on housing.  I want to focus on one of those, namely, the long-term leasing of social housing.  Incredibly, social housing is now being actively sold as a financial product.  One website states:</p> <blockquote> 	There is no requirement to deal with tenants, as local councils (or housing agencies) are your lessees.  This is a hands-off situation with no risk of vacancies or the usual tasks associated with managing property lets.  The cash comes directly from local government into your bank account, there is no intermediary.  Build a portfolio of approved social housing units, houses, and apartments that will be rubber stamped by local councils and housing agencies for long-term leases.  Sleep peacefully without worrying about stock markets!  Your obligations stop at buildings insurance.  There is no local property tax when leases are over 20 years. </blockquote>  <p>This model effectively means developers build housing estates and rather than the State purchasing 10% for social housing at cost price, the properties are leased for 20 or 25 years with a four-year rent review.  Houses are refurbished at the end of the lease and handed back to the developer, and presumably the tenant is then chucked out.</p><p>The dominant means of delivery of social housing is now Part V and it is increasingly and, in some areas, exclusively delivered through long leasing.  Are councils obliged to accept leasing if offered under Part V?  Do they really have a choice?  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has stated on the record of the D&aacute;il that it is up to local authorities to decide, but it seems to be a take it or leave it scenario.</p><p>I have been told in the House that there has been no change in policy.  I have to ask whether the D&aacute;il is being told the truth or are we being misled?  In addition, there is little transparency regarding the process in the planning files.  Thousands of these tenancies will be in place before people realise they are being taken for complete fools.</p><p>An example given on <i>hobbsfinancial.ie</i>is a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin 8.  It is stated that the investment, including all acquisition costs, is &euro;290,000 and after 25 years the investor would have earned a rent of &euro;520,000, a profit of &euro;229,000.  That is, of course, courtesy of the taxpayer.  It goes on to state that the investor will have a refurbished property and no property tax obligations.  There will be thousands of these.  This may not be a product of Taca or the Galway tent, but it is right out of the same playbook.  </p><p>Has the Government examined the cost of this?  Has it considered it from a societal perspective?  What is the Taoiseach's view on social housing being sold as a financial product?  Will he change that policy?</p></speech>

We have taken a suite of initiatives.  The bulk of construction next year in terms of the provision of social housing will be through approved housing bodies, AHBs, which have consistently been building social housing on behalf of the State, but also the councils.  Direct builds will comprise the large bulk of social housing output, where councils, along with AHBs, commission, provide and allocate housing.  The majority of 9,500 units provide last year were constructed.</p>  <p>  However, number of other mechanisms will be used.  The Minister is clearly of the view that the majority of provision has to be through councils and AHBs, while also getting involved in affordable housing.  We have to dramatically increase the number of social housing units we make available through direct build, Part V and other mechanisms.  In many respects, that will remain our emphasis and focus. </p>  <p>  We will pursue a number of avenues.  We will continue to review them, in particular the cost-benefit analysis, what is most advantageous from the taxpayers' perspective and what provides long-term value for money.  We need more activity in the marketplace and more social housing provision than we have had over the past number of years.  That is what the Government is committed to doing through a number of schemes and mechanisms. </p>  <p>  In the initial period, leasing has been one of those options to create quick access to properties, in particular in addressing homelessness during the Covid phase.  We believe that there is an opportunity in the context of Covid to get the homelessness figures down and have more permanent provision of housing, in particular for single people who are homeless, which is a significant proportion of those who are homeless.</p>  <p>  Social housing will predominantly involve councils and AHBs commissioning the building of local authority and social housing.  That is the broad thrust of policy.</p></speech>

I do not think we disagree about that.  That is not the issue I am trying to raise.  I do not see the evidence on the ground.  Housing is the number one issue I hear about on my phone, and has been for the past ten  or 12 years.  I am acutely aware of it.</p>  <p>  This is the most expensive and least satisfactory way of delivering social housing.  Social housing is now a financial product.  </p>  <p>  I see no evidence on the ground of scaling up.  I see turnkey and long-term leasing in terms of how housing is manifesting in my area.  Increasingly, I am seeing that in some of the Dublin local authorities.  Is the Taoiseach certain about what he is telling is?  Has there been a shift in policy because I am only seeing turnkey and long-term leasing?  Increasingly, it is long-term leasing with a council being told to take it or leave it.  It is being actively promoted by the Department. </p></speech>

Clearly, in the first three months of the year Covid has restricted output.  That is obvious, because of the level 5 lockdown and our decision to reduce mobility.  That has had an impact on the first three months of the year.</p>  <p>  The &euro;3.3 billion available is the highest investment in housing by any Government in a single year.  Some &euro;500 million in additional capital has been provided for the delivery of 12,750 new social homes for people on the social housing list.  That is positive.</p> <p>Of that, 9,500 will be direct builds.  The Deputy has picked one particular scheme, which represents a minority of what will be provided, and presented it as the main plank of Government policy, which it is not.  The main plank is 9,500 of 12,750, which will be new builds through approved housing bodies and through local authorities.  I agree that we need to get output up and we have to use as many mechanisms as we can to get output up for social housing.</p></speech>

Plans have also been drawn up so that schools can fully open in the very near future and for when restrictions on business and social interactions might be eased or lifted, but the plans that I have heard little about are those for how our health system will return to some kind of normality.  Thousands of elective surgeries have been put back and cancer screening services disrupted while our hospitals struggle to cope with the wave of Covid-19 patients.  That has left the entire health system with a huge challenge going forward.  Latest figures show that almost 900,000 people are on the waiting list for treatment in hospitals in Ireland, an increase of almost 12% on this time last year.  Of those, more than 600,000 are waiting for their first hospital outpatient consultation.  Shockingly, more than 280,000 of those have been waiting for a year or more to be seen for their first appointment.  That is even more than the number of people who have been waiting at least a year for hospital treatment with the NHS in England, serving a population 11 times greater than that of the Republic of Ireland.  In England, 5% of the total number on the waiting list have been waiting a year or more; in Ireland that figure is 45%.  It goes without saying that Covid-19 is not entirely responsible for this but the pandemic has turned what was a crisis in our health service into a disaster.  We are not just talking about figures.  Every one of these people is a mother, father, son, daughter, sister or brother who, in many cases, desperately needs help to ease pain and suffering.  Bringing hospital services back even to the so-called normal levels of pre-Covid times will be an enormous and costly task.  According to the ESRI, it could cost more than &euro;1 billion to clear the hospital waiting list caused by Covid-19.  Regardless of the cost, it simply cannot be delayed.  A task this huge requires the establishment of a special task force that would identify what needs to be done, come up with a plan of concrete action and have real power to clear any obstacles.  Private hospitals should be commissioned to play their part in the recovery in the same way they were brought in to help the country handle the early wave of the Covid-19 emergency.</p>  <p>  What are the Government's plans to restore vital hospital services and clear the record waiting lists?  Will it employ the services of the private sector in doing this?  Will it Government agree to establish a task force to oversee the recovery of our health service that is causing so much pain and anxiety. </p></speech>

Covid has caused unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with both community and acute settings affected.  It also created extra pressures on the provision of cancer services, not only in Ireland but globally, because of the additional demands that treating patients with Covid has imposed on the health services and also the wider impact of Covid.  The Government has asked the HSE to implement new pathways of care where services can be delivered in line with demand and in parallel with Covid care.  Cancer services, for example, have continued throughout the pandemic in line with the national action plan on Covid-19 and the national cancer control programme is continuing to address backlogs and provide information to cancer patients on Covid-19.  This year, overall GP referrals for weeks 1 to 10 amount to 110% of 2020 activity; breast referrals are very high at 122% of 2020 activity; lung is 64%; and prostate, 56%.  Despite the Covid challenges, the number of Covid patients with symptomatic breast disease seen at clinics amounted to 88% of the 2019 figure.  Surgery numbers to the end of November last are at 77% of the 2019 level.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy is at 88% of 2019 levels and radiotherapy is more than 90% of 2019 levels.  Additional funding has been allocated, close to &euro;500 million, to permanently fund 2,600 beds in acute and community settings and another &euro;52 million for critical care beds, which will help to deal with waiting lists into the future.</p>  <p>  During the second and third Covid-19 surges, more services remained open than in the first wave, demonstrating how we have adapted as a health service.  The HSE is implementing a plan for the prioritisation and restoration of services.  It is informed by data modelling undertaken by the HSE integrated national operations hub and is in continued alignment with guidance provided by NPHET.  Phase 1 is March to June, phase 2 is July to September and phase 3, October to December.  We provided an additional &euro;240 million for an access to care fund, &euro;210 million of which has been allocated to the HSE and &euro;30 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  That allows for treatment in both private and public hospitals to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists.  The NTPF is working with public hospitals to arrange treatment for clinically suitable patients and as of the end of February, more than 4,000 day case and in excess of 2,000 GI scope offers of treatment have been accepted.  For outpatients, the NTPF had arranged 3,464 appointments by the end of February.  </p>  <p>  The safety net arrangement with all 18 private hospitals will continue and will be used to deal with the backlog and outpatient appointments.</p></speech>

It also has by far the highest number of inpatient or day cases waiting at 9,500 people.  The biggest problem is the backlog of orthopaedic patients and people seeking help for painful hips and knees that need replacing are being told it could take up to three years before they are seen for initial assessment.  I am glad to learn that work is to begin within weeks on the long-awaited second operating theatre for orthopaedics to replace the one that closed in 2017 but it will be a long time before it is operational.  I urge that special action be taken in the meantime to clear the exceptional backlog in Galway that is causing so much pain and anxiety to so many.</p></speech>

While we are waiting for permanent capacity to come in place, it is important that other interim capacity measures are taken to deal with that backlog, particularly in orthopaedics as well as other areas.  That is why the more sustained contract with private hospitals gives the HSE options to deal on an ongoing basis with a range of services where there are backlogs and where works are on the way to give more permanent capacity in the public system.  Significant capital works are under way.  The service plan provides nationally for an additional 16,000 staff above the December 2019 levels.  That includes more than 1,100 medical and dental staff, more than 3,500 nurses and midwives and 4,000 health and social care professionals.  A significant expansion is provided for both in current funding for the health service, way and above anything in previous years, but also capital funding to increase capacity as quickly as we possibly can in surgeries, operating theatres and beds generally.</p></speech>

I wish to ask the Taoiseach respectfully to increase the numbers who can go into a church for a funeral mass.  I ask him to take into consideration size and height and capacity of places such as cathedrals and big churches and to increase the numbers.</p> <p>Fr. Gear&oacute;id Walsh was on our local radio last week and he said that we have a professor for everything, but no professor or position has been created for a person with common sense.  I sympathise and empathise with the McCarthy family from Gneeveguilla, and particularly with Mr. Jack McCarthy who lost his wonderful wife, Mary Theresa, yesterday.  There are around 100 members of that family.  I do not know how they are going to manage, but I do not envy the person deciding who the ten people to go to the funeral will be.</p> <p> I want to go on to construction.  For too long now some construction workers cannot go to work.  Those involved in social housing can go to work.  It is very galling for some people, when Tim can go to work, but Tom and Mike cannot go to work because they are not working in social housing.  Not everyone is able to get on the social housing list and people need houses.  Some people want to build their own houses and they should be allowed to finish them.</p> <p> We have to recognise that English recruitment companies are looking for skilled workers of all types, including carpenters, plumbers and drivers.  Flannery Plant Hire is advertising every week for 360 degree excavator drivers and drivers of dumper trucks and different vehicles to work on the HS2 rail project in England, which is the biggest job since the Channel Tunnel.  If the Taoiseach does not believe me, he can get the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, while he still has him, to look on Twitter - he good on Facebook - to check all that is happening in that line.  Surely they should work together and see that, and they are looking for women as well in case that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is listening in to us.  You see-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400025#X00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  In his overall presentation, he was essentially dealing with the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on all our lives, including in such areas as attending mass or other religious services, in construction and in other areas of life.  The virus has upended our lives.  It has not been the Government, the D&aacute;il or the Oireachtas, but the virus.  The problem now is that we have a virulent form of that virus in the B.1.1.7 variant, which is the dominant variant in the country.  We need to be very careful in how we deal with that variant in respect of restrictions etc.</p>  <p>  That is why in the next number of days we will spend much time talking and getting the epidemiological data.  I am conscious that in the last several days the numbers of cases of Covid-19 have gone up, bar yesterday.  Everybody in this House needs to take that on board and interrogate it.  It is serious.  We are rolling out the vaccination programme and we will have far more vaccines in the second quarter.  Over 700,000 doses have been administered now and that is an important point.  As we move through April in particular, we will have far more people vaccinated.</p>  <p>  On funerals, I understand and accept fully the sincerity of the Deputy's presentation.  I think it is terrible myself.  Not being able to attend the funeral of a loved one is the one aspect of Covid-19 which hits people the hardest.  The numbers of people who can attend funerals are very low.  We will look at that.  We have been asked by the churches to look at it.  I am not giving any commitments or guarantees in relation to it because we want to protect people.  Unfortunately, some events at some funerals, a minority, have led to a spread of the virus, not in the churches, it must be said, but at subsequent events.  There have been very significant outbreaks related to funerals, unfortunately.  Hence, the extreme caution and the regulations which have been put in place relating to funerals.</p>  <p>  On construction, the evidence was that general mobility will give rise to the spread of this variant.  I remember back in January when we had 2,000 people in hospital.  At that time, everyone here was into suppressing the virus, into zero Covid and the prevailing mood in the Chamber was let us never open again given the extraordinary pressure that was on our hospitals and front-line healthcare workers.  I did say at the time that I knew it would not be too long before Deputies would be coming back saying we should open this and that.  I understand that, but we are dealing with a very transmissible variant and that is something we need to take on board.  It is not the Government or anybody that is trying to stop people going back building.  The Government wants a housing programme.  It is our No. 1 priority for us socially in respect of building more homes, but this virus, and this variant of it, is upending the best laid plans and most of all the quality of people's lives.</p></speech>

The problem though is we are not getting the figures down and if that is to continue, the Government will have to be sensible and allow sectors of the community to open and to work.  The Government must trust people.  People working on farm buildings can keep away from each other, as can people working on building a rural one-off house or a small estate.</p>  <p>  Other groups, such as small traders and shopkeepers, are also under severe pressure from multinational companies trading online.  They will never be able to open up if this thing goes too far, and I am afraid that it is.  Let us take hairdressers as an example.  When they were allowed to open, they were very careful to just allow one person in at a time.  We must be sensible and trust people to work.  If this continues, I do not know who or what is going to pay for it.  Are we going to lose all our workers to England?</p></speech>

In the last seven days we have had approximately 3,800 cases and today we have about 329 people in hospital.  I ask the Deputy please to stop saying that the figures are not coming down.  That is killing people saying that.  It is telling people that their efforts are not working.  The efforts and sacrifices that people have made have worked against a very virulent, dangerous and transmissible virus.  We have got the numbers down quite dramatically because of our efforts.  Meanwhile, we are also vaccinating more and more people.  We have vaccinated the most vulnerable in our society, which is also working.  Serial testing in nursing homes is yielding a positivity rate of 0.18%.  That is how much the vaccines are working where they have been administered.  It is likewise with our front-line healthcare workers, where the vaccines have also worked.  That is the parallel process on which we must work.</p>  <p>  Believe me, I understand fully where Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is coming from.  Economically, however, it has been proved all over the world that the more effort there is to try to keep pressure on the virus, the better will be the result in the medium to long term.  The variant is a real problem.  That is all I am saying to the Deputy.  This variant just takes off, if it is given a chance.</p></speech>

It reflects the huge pressure the system is under and will be under.  Therefore, the work of family carers and the value of it should be all the more apparent.  They repeatedly ask who, if they fall sick or are left vulnerable, picks up their caring work.  The answer is the system would not be in a position to pick up that huge amount of work.  There was confusion within government or at least within Fianna F&aacute;il, with one Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy writing to some family home carers to say a decision had been taken by the Minister to afford this priority.  The Minister denied that stance.  I would like clarity and I would like the Taoiseach to confirm that family carers will be given the recognition and position they deserve.</p></speech>

It has been clear that the Government vaccination programme, as advised by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, was to vaccinate in the first instance those who are most vulnerable to the disease, namely, senior citizens over the age of 70, particularly those in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, which we have done, and then front-line healthcare workers, who are particularly exposed to getting the virus in the line of duty on a daily basis.  That was generally agreed, I understood, in the House.  I do not think it is a good way to go about business to try to pit one group against another and to say the Government is against one group or not recognising a group.</p></speech>

What will be the Taoiseach's strategy at that summit?  I agree with him on vaccine nationalism, which I do not believe in, and I also do not believe in vaccine ingredient nationalism.  However, I do believe in equity and fairness.  I ask, therefore, that tomorrow, while we all fight to keep supply lines open and vaccines being produced for us and for those who need them most throughout the world, we also fight to ensure there is equity and fairness in the distribution of vaccines and the honouring of contracts, especially by companies such as AstraZeneca.  Just a couple of hours ago, police entered a plant in Italy and found 29 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine there and available, potentially and probably to be exported to the UK.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach tomorrow ensure there is equity and fairness?  While we do not want vaccine nationalism, we have to protect our citizens in Europe and Ireland.  Will he ensure vaccines that were contracted will be honoured and that will be delivered on in the coming weeks before we have a change in circumstances whereby we allow vaccines to be exported <i>en masse</i>again?</p></speech>

From my understanding, they emanated from the Halix plant in the Netherlands and some of them had the potential to be used for COVAX, while some of them could have been heading for the UK or Europe.  There are two issues here.  The first is the failure of AstraZeneca to fulfil its contracts with the European Union.  I fully support all measures designed to ensure that AstraZeneca fulfils its contracts with the European Union.</p>  <p>  In addition, however, I am very strongly adhering and committed to the principle of keeping open supply chains.  That is the most fundamental way to guarantee supply, particularly in quarter 2.  I have had a series of meetings with the four key manufacturing companies, all of which, especially Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, are adamant that the supply chains must be kept open.</p></speech>

We run a real risk of increasing competition between countries and countries' nationalism when it comes to the vaccination programme.  We are not safe in this country until every country is safe, and we will not be free from Covid until every country in the world is free from Covid.  We can see the new variants coming into play and that will always be a risk for us, no matter how many people we get vaccinated in Ireland or in all the other countries of the EU and in the likes of the UK and the US.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach meets the EU leaders or talks to them tomorrow, I would like him to raise the issue of the vaccine waiver.  The director-general of the World Health Organization has stated it will be a "catastrophic moral failure" if we do not open the intellectual property rights and enable developing countries to develop vaccine themselves.  A number of Irish organisations have written to the Government in respect of this, such as Oxfam, Amnesty International and D&oacute;chas.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we will all become imprisoned in our own republics, so to speak, because of the potentiality of new variants over time.  COVAX is one vehicle to enable us to do that.  The European Union is, I think, the largest contributor to COVAX, and we have contributed <i>pro rata</i>to it and will continue to do so.  The United States is increasing its contribution to COVAX as well.</p><p>We need to be realistic and to work with the models we have to increase and refine production and manufacturing.  Right now, the supplies are increasing, the companies are getting better at what they are doing and more vaccines will potentially come on stream.  In that context, the world needs to work together to increase supplies to developing countries.  That is something Europe and the US are focused on and, indeed, China is doing some of that as well.

That is the formal Government position but the position on imported fracked gas and LNG is still confusing.  The Shannon LNG project remains on the EU's list of projects of common interest, PCI.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has stated there will be a separate policy statement on this but it is not clear, given that it remains on the PCI list, whether this confers on the Shannon LNG project special privileges for the company proposing the project, particularly since it has indicated publicly that it intends to file fresh planning documents.</p></speech>

I am not clear on the status of the current application, but suffice to say, our future is not in fossil fuels.  Our future is in renewables, energy efficiency and a whole new green economy that will emerge from that.

A week later, 300 of the estimated 1,500 housebound people in the country had been vaccinated.  There has, however, been a vacuum of information since then.  I cannot find out when housebound people across the west of Ireland will be vaccinated.  HSE management in the region cannot tell me nor can these people's own GPs.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and direct the HSE to provide these very vulnerable people with some idea of when they are going to be vaccinated?  Even an indication as to when the National Ambulance Service is going to be vaccinating people in a given county or region would be welcome.

As a national service, it has really stood up to the test of Covid-19.  I thank everyone who works for the service for what they have done for the nation.  In the context of those aged over 85, despite all of the noise, criticisms and so on, 99% of those older than 85 were vaccinated within the three-week target period.  That also needs to be said.  I will intervene with the HSE and ask that it come back to the Deputy in respect of those older than 85 who are housebound.  In fact, those older than 80 should now be included because we are moving into that age cohort.  I will ask the HSE to try to get figures for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Hard-pressed people and organisations, including business people, charities, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations and small businesses, are severely affected by payouts for minor injuries.  We see this effort by the Judicial Council to reduce payouts, but it is half-baked.  They are not to be reduced by nearly enough.  As we know, businesses are struggling anyway but, in light of the pandemic, it is all the more important that the Judicial Council uses its teeth and reduces payouts by much more.  The payout for a minor sprain to a person's thumb is now &euro;12,000 but in England it is only &pound;4,500.  In England, the payout for whiplash is only &pound;4,190 whereas here it is twice that.  We need to deal with this effectively.  The Judicial Council has to go back to work on this and the Government must intervene.</p></speech>

First of all, I welcome this change.  I believe it will lead to reduced insurance costs.  If the Deputy would like to avail of the opportunity, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, to talk to him.  He is overseeing the whole area of insurance reform and is applying himself with great energy.  It is a milestone and will bring the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, back to the centre stage.  PIAB will be the faster and cheaper route through which to pursue claims for all.  Over time, this will have a significant impact on insurance costs overall.</p></speech>

That registration is to be concluded by 30 November this year.  In light of the travel restrictions arising from Covid, which are affecting engineers, solicitors and those families who cannot visit solicitors or meet engineers, I ask that this deadline be extended for at least another five years.  Many people do not know that this process is ongoing, or should be ongoing, at this present time.  To give the land registry, solicitors, engineers and, more importantly, those people who use public rights of way the chance to register rights of way, I ask the Taoiseach to extend that deadline because it is not feasible to carry out what is envisaged.</p></speech>

Due to the size of the market and because we share a right-hand drive system, Britain has been the source of a large proportion of our second-hand vehicles.  The new situation means that, bizarrely, a car produced in Britain can enter the Irish market at no extra cost while a car produced in the EU before being traded in Britain incurs a further 10% customs levy on entering the Irish market, on top of VAT at 21% and vehicle registration tax.  This makes second-hand cars in this State the most expensive in Europe.  Will the Taoiseach commit to engaging with Revenue, the Department of Finance and our EU counterparts to see if this situation can be resolved in the interest of consumers and the businesses involved?</p></speech>

This is how the trade agreement has been interpreted, and not only by the EU.  We are engaging with the European Union with regard to a number of goods which have been similarly affected by third country status when traded from Europe into the UK before returning to the EU through Ireland.  That is the position.  It is not bizarre but one of the real foreseeable, predictable consequences of Brexit.  That is why I always felt Brexit was a very bad idea.  I believe many companies in Britain do not yet realise how bad an idea it is for many British jobs, companies and businesses.  This is the unfortunate reality of Brexit.  We will engage with the EU on these issues, but it is the reality of Brexit.</p></speech>

Operators in this sector are having a really difficult time.  I acknowledge the supports that have been put in place to date but much more is needed.  We also need to send out a very strong signal from Government through the extension of the period for which the 9% VAT rate will apply.  It is really important that, as more and more people in our communities are vaccinated - and I congratulate everyone involved in that exceptional work - we give an opportunity to the tourism and hospitality sector to safely engage with vaccinated customers, many of whom have a lot of pent-up spending power after the last 12 months, to try to turn the benefit of the vaccination programme into an economic benefit, particularly for the tourism and hospitality sector.</p></speech>

We have a vaccination programme under way.  When does the Taoiseach anticipate that the vaccination programme will form part of the process of reopening?  When does he see it becoming a feature from 5 April on?  The hospitality sector in Limerick includes publicans, restaurateurs and hoteliers.  They are severely anxious about the future of their industry, both in retaining the staff and skill sets they have, and more particularly when they will be able to reopen.

The Government has established an excellent tourism recovery task force that will oversee that process and try to determine how we carry out that valuable work.  We found out yesterday in an Oireachtas committee that hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and tour operators are represented on that group but there are no representatives from our thousands of pubs across the country and in our cities and towns or from our restaurants.  This sector is an integral part of our tourism offering.  One might argue that it is the reason thousands of tourists come to this country each year.  It is worrying that our pubs and restaurants have no voice on that tourism recovery task force.  I ask that this would be rectified.</p></speech>

West Cork is one of the top tourism spots in Ireland and it is particularly badly affected.  The lead-in to Easter would have been a boom time for the hotel sector, restaurants, pubs and caf&eacute;s.  They need further supports.  They are continuously in contact with me and they feel their voices are not being heard.  Their doors are not reopening and some of them may not reopen for months.  They need us to look at bringing the VAT rate for tourism back to 5% at this stage.  The Taoiseach might explain to us what packages are in place for these businesses that are in serious trouble.</p></speech>

We heard good submissions on the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, which has been the hardest hit sector across the economy, along with the arts and entertainment sectors.  That is because of the virus and not because of Government policy.  The variant has made it worse and more difficult for the hospitality sector more generally.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided unprecedented supports to the hospitality sector and to other sectors of the economy in underpinning them through very difficult times in the midst of a global pandemic, which has up-ended the industry and this sector.  Government will continue to look at what additional measures can be taken and we will work with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform with a view towards the medium term.  We have agreed to extend the supports until the end of June and we will see in the national economic recovery plan what specific measures can be introduced in line with task force recommendations around more medium-term guarantees that we can give to the industry and the sector.</p>  <p>  The EU is considering the digital green pass.  There are some differences of opinion among member states in terms of health advice and the utilisation and application of the digital green pass health certificate, which demonstrates that one has had the vaccination, to wider civil society in the conferring of rights to some over others.  That said, we will be part of that interoperability and these are issues we will discuss as the vaccination programme rolls out.  Suffice it to say that the nuts and bolts of such a policy are under active consideration, not just by Government but across the European Union.  It is not as simple as it has been presented.</p>  <p>  We are in a fragile state in terms of where the virus is right now.  The Deputies should bear that in mind in how we look forward.  We have made no decision on what will happen post 5 April.  That is the current position.</p></speech>

Last weekend, as happens every weekend, resources from the mid-west region are sent into the south-east to provide an ambulance service there.  The ambulance unit from the Thurles station spends most of the weekend in the Clonroche and Wexford area and servicing Waterford.  This means the ambulance station in Thurles is without its service.  This has a serious impact on response times to get to a patient when a call for an ambulance is made.  This is happening consistently and the HSE needs to put enough resources into the south-east on a constant basis as opposed to redeploying ambulance crews from the mid-west, which leaves that region without a proper service.</p></speech>

That entire region and its connectivity has been impacted by partition and Brexit.  What are the Taoiseach's plans for the shared island unit in progressing this, particularly the corridor?

The reason I ask is that the cost of the HPV vaccine is &euro;600.  Many families and women who do not qualify for a medical card because the thresholds are so low are under severe financial pressure.  Forcing them to pay &euro;600 for a medical intervention that is deemed necessary by their medical practitioners demonstrates to me that we have not learned from the cervical screening scandal and that we are not listening to women.  Can the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health to review the exclusion of the HPV vaccine from the drugs payment scheme and to liaise with national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, to ensure that women who are deemed to be a high risk can have it without pushing them into further financial stress?</p></speech>

This topic has been close to my heart for two years.  I have followed the evolution of e-scooters from clumsy lightweight vehicles to the position they are in now.  They encapsulate the latest technology and are robust machines, which are very safe on the roads.  I believe that they can be a real game changer mainly in our cities and towns, but not exclusively there.  Dublin Bus, for example, believes that the introduction of e-scooters has been a significant contributor to those commuters who need to travel an extra 1 km to get to the bus or when they leave the bus to go from the bus to work.  We could envisage that people would carry their e-scooters onto public transport, carry them off and make the final leg of their journey on them.  </p><p>I am aware that the Minister has flagged his intention to introduce legislation governing this and I want to make my contribution to it.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I would have strong views on the matter borne out of the experience of having dealt with manufacturers of the latest kit and seeing the technological advances in that regard.  We have seen that when e-scooters were introduced in a blanket manner in other jurisdictions, they ended up being banned in some cities and on university campuses because they became litter and became a nuisance.  </p><p>While not explicitly stated, the underlying intent of my Bill is against the blanket introduction of regulations governing the use of e-scooters in Ireland but rather favours the introduction of a local-authority-regulated and controlled sharing or hiring scheme, along the lines of DublinBikes, which has been really successful and has been introduced in other local authority areas.  These could be publicly or privately operated.</p><p>This is what has been done in the UK.  The authorities there have not legalised the use of e-scooters, but they have regulated for them on a pilot for 18 months.  At that stage, the public can decide if they really work very well and are safer than expected.  Their speeds can be governed through a local authority-governed share scheme.  Technology involving geofencing means that if someone uses an e-scooter along St. Stephen's Green and comes across a pedestrian area such as Grafton Street, the e-scooter comes to a halt.  It is possible to geofence e-scooters to prevent them going on footpaths, pedestrian areas or other areas on which they might be prohibited.  </p><p>However, if we introduce a blanket scheme whereby any individual can go out and buy an e-scooter, it is not possible to govern the speed of a privately purchased e-scooter and it cannot be geofenced.  In other words, it is not possible to determine where it can and cannot go.  Using geofencing will determine where someone can return their e-scooter.  There would be a number of geofence locations in villages towns and city centres.  If we have the blanket introduction of a purchase scheme allowing anybody to buy an e-scooter, they do not need to comply with specific standards and their speeds cannot be governed whereas with a shared scheme or a rental scheme their speeds can be governed at approximately 20 km/h to 25 km/h, as is done in most cities most cities that use them.</p><p>These pilot schemes have been so successful in the UK that a number of constabularies have ordered multiples of these to assist them in policing, particularly in towns and cities.  The Bill represents my contribution and that of my colleagues to the e-scooter debate.  We should introduce a pilot scheme for 18 months controlled by local authorities which would impose by-laws regarding speed and geofencing to limit where they can go, and apply health and safety standards.  </p><p>Evidence shows that 50% of people who used e-scooters in Berlin got up on a scooter for the first time.  We need to impose a certain number of restrictions and regulations on that.  That cannot be done if we introduce a blanket scheme that allows anybody to go out and purchase e-scooters.  I am convinced that if after a period of 18 months such a scheme were introduced, it would allow the public to have significant confidence in the scheme and to realise that it can add value to cities and towns.  They will then recognise that it is a smart mode of transport, represents micro-mobility at its best and very definitely plays its part in our climate action challenges.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400029#BB01100"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 by increasing the maximum sentence that can be imposed for the possession of a knife to cause injury to, incapacitate or intimidate any person. </blockquote>  <p>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a change to the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.  The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that section 9 of that Act states that it is a criminal offence for somebody to be found in possession of a knife for the purpose of trying to inflict harm upon another.  The purpose of the legislation is to increase the maximum sentence for that offence from five to ten years.  </p><p>Two years ago, when I was Opposition spokesperson on justice, my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I introduced a similar Bill for the purpose of trying to respond to what at that time was a very serious problem that was developing in respect of the possession of knives.  I regret to say that the problem continues to exist in our society.  Part of the reason for introducing the Bill two years ago related to the increased incidence of seizure of knives by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda had revealed to the then Minister that in 2016 it had seized 1,200 knives.  That increased in 2017 to 1,600 knives and in 2018 it increased again to 2,000 knives.  </p><p>Unfortunately, many people, I regret to say it is predominantly young men and boys, are carrying knives for the purpose of defending themselves.  Unfortunately, what occurs is that they get involved in a fight and somebody can become seriously injured or indeed fatally injured.  I also regret to say that the problem does not appear to be easing.  Not far from this building in January a boy was fatally stabbed and received significant prominence as a result of that terrible crime.  A woman was also stabbed in the vicinity of the convention centre in January and subsequently died a month later.  Last Monday evening, what can only be described as a large fight took place on Samuel Beckett Bridge in the aftermath of which a person was stabbed and suffered injuries.  </p><p>I regret that we have an ongoing problem in respect of the possession and use of knives.  Obviously, the solution to this is not exclusively in the criminal justice system.  We also need to recognise that we need to educate young men and boys in particular about the dangers of carrying knives.  As I have said, very many of them carry knives for the purpose of seeking to defend themselves, not intending to use those knives when they carry them out.  However, we learn through tragic experience that on a night when a knife is used, people can lose their lives through being fatally stabbed.  Part of the solution is in education and we need to provide more public information in respect of the dangers of knives and to warn people about the consequences that can arise as a result of carrying a knife out in the evening time or even during the daytime.  </p><p>We also need to look at the criminal justice process.  My view, which is shared by my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, is that the maximum sentence for carrying a knife for the purpose of trying to inflict harm on another person is too low and should be increased to give a court greater discretion when it comes to the imposition of a sentence.  Obviously, this will not be the only solution, but it sends a strong message to our community that it is unacceptable to carry knives.  </p><p>I have also had the opportunity to have a good discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne.  He is very interested in trying to target the issue of knife crime.  I know he has met the Garda Commissioner to discuss the issue.</p> <p>I have spoken to him and I think he intends to bring forward some legislative proposals to deal with this.  I welcome that and I hope that when they come forward, those proposals will be complementary with this Bill.  It is necessary that as a society we start to respond more vigorously and attentively to this ongoing problem.  As I said earlier, the purpose of the legislation is to amend section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.  If this Bill is enacted, the maximum sentence that could be imposed under section 9 of that Act will be increased from five to ten years.  For that reason, I seek leave to introduce the Bill today.</p></speech>

We agreed on the need for a cautious approach to the easing out of lockdown to avoid any reversal of direction.  We also discussed recent developments on the Northern Ireland protocol and concerns about rising tensions around it.  I stressed the need to de-escalate tensions and the hope that dialogue between the United Kingdom and the European Union would reach agreed outcomes on implementation challenges.</p>  <p>  I previously spoke by phone with First Minister, Arlene Foster, and the deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, on 25 January.  We discussed the latest situation on Covid-19 at that time and the measures being taken in response, including in relation to travel.  We discussed the similarity of approach across many of the actions we are each taking in response to Covid-19.  We also discussed the issue of new variants of the virus and the importance of genome sequencing in detecting their presence.</p>  <p>  I also met by videoconference with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on Wednesday, 13 January, when we also discussed the latest developments on Covid-19.  There was also had a very useful discussion on Covid- 19 between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting on 18 December, which was hosted by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, jointly chair Quad meetings which discuss the ongoing response to Covid- 19 and are also attended by the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  There is also regular contact between the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his Northern Ireland counterpart Minister of Health, Robin Swann, and between the chief medical officers North and South.  There is also regular engagement at official level on Covid more generally, including through a series of meetings of officials from the Irish Government, the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, which are co-ordinated and jointly chaired by my Department and the Cabinet Office.</p>  <p>  As part of my St. Patrick's Day programme, I was pleased to contribute to the virtual relaunch of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium, which also included contributions from the First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  This is an important initiative which will bring together the appropriate bodies North and South, and in the United States, to help in tackling cancer.</p></reply>

There are one or two areas on which I would like him to elaborate, if possible.  The Taoiseach referred to similarities in the approach by this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland in terms of restrictions and tackling the pandemic.  We are all aware that those similarities are about to change.  We need to question what level of formal co-ordination there is between Governments on this island when infection rates and hospitalisation rates in Northern Ireland are declining and its vaccination rate is at a much higher level than ours.  This week, mandatory hotel quarantine comes into force in this jurisdiction, but still there will be no mandatory hotel quarantine in Northern Ireland.  There are continuing concerns about the sharing of data North-South regarding travellers coming into this country.  My question is twofold in response to the Taoiseach.  First, what efforts can be made to have that formal co-ordination to ensure that Northern Ireland does not spread too far from the Republic and we have a repeat of elements that we saw in Border regions over the summer?  Second, what actions will be taken and what discussions will be had to ensure the measures or restrictions we have placed on travel in terms of mandatory hotel quarantine and so on are not undermined by the lack of action in Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

Shockingly, this has been done with the active lobbying of Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP.  For 200 years republicans have stated that London has no business legislating in any part of Ireland yet Sinn F&eacute;in has actively lobbied for this law to come into force in the North.  Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna have reversed the policy of the SDLP that goes back to John Hume and sought to actively campaign for the commissioning of this British abortion legislation.</p>  <p>  In every poll carried out in the North over the last number of years the majority of the people agreed that the issue of abortion should be decided in Stormont.  Even those in support of abortion agree with that.  Every time this vote has come up in Stormont, the representatives of the people of the North have voted against abortion being introduced into the North.  Even last week, the representatives of the people of the North of Ireland in Stormont voted against that extreme abortion provision from Britain that abortion should be made available up until birth in the case of disability.  We in Aont&uacute; are in communication with our legal advisers on whether we can bring a case in protection of the Good Friday Agreement against the Northern Secretary of State.  What has the Taoiseach done to defend the Good Friday Agreement and devolution on this issue?</p></speech>

The Labour Party MP, Stella Creasy, secured abortion rights for women in Northern Ireland while her Bill was passed through Westminster.  I want to know if the Taoiseach has raised with the First Minister and deputy First Minister the failure to implement this law and put those services in place.  We all know that the UK Government has moved to compel the introduction of such services in the North.  This is a critical issue for women on this island.  We all know the fight undertaken here to ensure we brought about change in this jurisdiction.  What discussions has the Taoiseach had on this issue and will he update the House in that regard?  We need to ensure that women and their health is protected in Northern Ireland as well.</p>  <p>  We all know that the plan in Northern Ireland is to have its population vaccinated by the end of July.  What arrangements will be put in place, or are planned to be put place, with regard to travel then?  Furthermore, has the Taoiseach had discussions with the First Minister and deputy First Minister on the vaccine green certificate that will be in place and how it will work on this island?</p></speech>

On that point of making sure there are no barriers in place in terms of vaccine production, distribution and roll-out, will the Taoiseach raise the temporary waiving of intellectual property rights so that can be carried out to full production levels?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400030#CC01600"><p>On the issue of provision of abortion services, it needs to be remembered that unionism can no longer be allowed to exercise a veto in the provision of these services for women yet that is what is happening.  There has been a blockage.  There is an active campaign by the DUP and others to prevent the commissioning of services that are necessary and to which women are entitled.  Everybody from every perspective needs to ensure that those services are delivered.  It would be astonishing if anyone who claimed to have any kind of republican instinct was underscoring a unionist veto to affect women's rights in such a dramatic fashion.</p> <p>I too encourage the Taoiseach and all others to use all influence to ensure that Robin Swann commissions the services and that unionism backs off from the truly shameful position it has adopted on this matter.</p> <p> Second, on the issue of vaccination, it is true to say that the North is significantly ahead.  The best approach, of course, is to have an all-Ireland approach in terms of efficient and safe vaccination.  I would like to echo the sentiment that we cannot have a repeat of the delays from Dublin in respect of data sharing.  Can the Taoiseach set out what his plan is and how he envisages a harmonisation of the vaccination programme and all other measures that will be necessary to keep us safe into the medium and long term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400031#DD00200"><p>On the issue of abortion rights in the North, anybody who is even vaguely interested in fighting for unity on this island would understand that the unprecedented movement from below of young people, particularly young women, unwilling to accept the control of their bodies and their right to bodily autonomy by the State was an all-Ireland movement.  There were busloads of women, other young activists and people who want a progressive future for this island who came down and campaigned for repeal and helped that fantastic social and political earthquake that was the repeal of the eighth amendment.  It was fully understood and very quickly reciprocated on an all-Ireland basis that young women, other young activists and people of a progressive mindset would go north of the Border immediately to say that the North must be next.  That is the way in which we can undercut the sectarianism brought by partition and unite people on a progressive basis.  It is really disappointing to hear anybody who considers himself or herself even vaguely associated with republicanism defending attempts to keep women in this country in the Dark Ages and working alongside the DUP in doing so.</p></speech>

I say to him that in terms of the alignment of restrictions between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we have been very much aligned up to now and will remain so until 5 April.  Indeed, that alignment may extend because, notwithstanding the progress that Northern Ireland has made on the vaccination programme, there may be a phased approach to the easing of restrictions there.  I make the point that, in essence, Northern Ireland has been part of the UK vaccination programme and we have been part of the EU-wide vaccination programme.  That is well known.  There has not been an all-Ireland approach on vaccinations for obvious reasons in terms of the source of the supply.  I do not know why that issue got raised just now because it does not make a whole lot of sense.  Ideally, it would be great, but we are not in that ideal situation.</p>  <p>  What would be useful is if we had alignment on mandatory quarantining.  I understand the Northern Ireland Executive might have said it has plans in this regard but I am not too sure where those plans are or how concrete they are in terms of realisation.  Obviously, it would be very important if there was alignment in terms of the mandatory hotel quarantining, and people coming through the North will be subject to that legal framework if they come into the Republic.  Deputy Richmond has raised an important issue in this regard.  I point out that there has been good co-operation in the regions between North and South, particularly in terms of the engagement between the councils in the north west of the country.  In phase 2, both local authorities, Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, issued localised leaflets to make the public in that region aware of the restrictions locally.  That is the type of practical co-operation on the ground that we should encourage around restrictions and in encouraging people to adhere to the guidelines that generally apply to the prevention of Covid-19.  We will continue to work and engage, particularly through the group of officials I mentioned, which meets on a regular basis, in consort with the Northern Ireland authorities, to iron out any potential issues or difficulties that may arise.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of the provision of abortion services, no one should have a veto, in my view, on general policy issues of that kind.  I have not engaged on that issue.  I have not had discussions with the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister, nor have they had discussions with me or raised the issue with me in terms of how it is being provided for within the North and in terms of the issue of devolution versus legislative initiatives from Westminster.  Neither of them has raised that issue with me at all.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we work with the British Government, as co-guarantor of the agreement, in upholding it.  Deputy Kelly asked whether I have had discussions on this issue.  I have not.  It has not been raised as an issue in the context of discussions we have had, which have been more in the context of North-South initiatives, obviously, and in terms of upholding the agreements that are in place and all of the commitments made there.</p>  <p>  As I said regarding vaccinations, the North and the UK are about a month ahead because of the different approach to authorisation, which is a key factor, and also the decision in terms of the interval period between the administration of doses.  There was a whole range of other questions but the Ceann Comhairle has indicated that my time is up.</p></speech>

There are many groups of people who are suffering with mental health issues, stress and anxiety as a result of the Covid pandemic and the restrictions.  One of those cohorts is made up of our young people and they are very significantly suffering.  There is a lot of lip service paid to supporting people's mental health but not a lot of action.  That the committee dealing with this area has not met since November tells its own story.</p>  <p>  There are more than 2,000 young people and families waiting, often for months, for a first appointment with a clinical psychologist at the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Last week, we proposed a measure, which will be voted on tomorrow, that would take a very significant amount of stress off young people.  There are many sources of stress for them but the leaving certificate examination and the question of access to higher education is a very significant one.  We proposed that the Government would do something simple like make places available for all CAO applicants, in higher education, further education and apprenticeship programmes, and remove the financial pressure and burden of fees.  The Government refused to do that.  There is all the talk about supporting people's mental health and what is going to change post Covid.</p> <p>However, in reality there has been nothing for our young people.  There has been nothing to support them through this extraordinarily stressful period.</p></speech>

I welcome this move.  It is something my colleagues, including Deputies Sean Sherlock, Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Ged Nash and Senator Ivana Bacik, have been pushing for many years.  We have been raising it for more than five years.  The sooner it is up and running, the better for everyone working in that sector.  The sooner we can get an employment regulation order in place to establish binding rates of pay, terms and conditions, etc., the sooner we would be taking a step in the right direction for all these workers.  The legislation to put this in place was put forward by the Labour Party.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has written to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, with this recommendation for joint labour committee to be established.  The Minister must apply to the Labour Court for this to happen.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the JLC will now be established by the Government and the relevant Minister to support these workers?  What is the timeline to put the committee in place?  Will the Taoiseach commit to this happening in the near future?  It is something of which we are highly supportive.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach knows, in September last year a fire at one of these camps left 12,000 people, including 4,000 children, destitute.  When will the commitment to evacuate 50 of these people, including children, be carried out?  Will he consider providing residency support for approximately 400 people who are trapped in these camps?</p></speech>

It raises a question mark around the urgency and order of priority being attached to children and younger people, especially in the context of the public health emergency.</p>  <p>  I have had conversations with community and voluntary organisations that provide support and mental healthcare and related services to adults and young people.  Those involved have been telling me loudly and clearly that access to care is a major problem.  The 2,500 children on the CAMHS waiting lists have been referenced.  We should bear in mind that almost 9,000 children are waiting for a psychology appointment as well.  Our spend on mental health is too low by international standards.  A paper authored by clinical and public mental health specialists in May last year warned us that we were facing into a tsunami of mental health need.  This is felt across society but it is felt acutely among our children and young people in particular.</p>  <p>  We have published proposals for emergency investment in mental health.  My colleague, Deputy Mark Ward, has put the initiative together to provide surge capacity for mental healthcare, to provide in an emergency way for talk therapies and to ensure that young people, children in particular, have quick access to vital emergency services.  I am keen for these proposals to be considered and for urgency to be attached to this area.  This is a difficult time for all of us, but, by God, some children and young people have had an extraordinarily difficult time.  We need to respond with all due urgency and priority.</p></speech>

This does not mean these issues came off the Government radar or anything like that.  In fact, the opposite is the case, especially in terms of mental health and education.  A number of specific meetings have taken place in the intervening period with the Minister for Education on the leaving certificate and with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris.  We had a Cabinet committee on education meeting and held a series of meetings with the Ministers for Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the leaving certificate and the return to school more generally.</p>  <p>  The position of Deputy Boyd Barrett is that we should provide places to everyone straightaway.  That is not achievable or doable.  It is simple to say that but it is utterly ridiculous and cannot be done.  We could create many difficulties with that approach too.  What we have done, however, is provide &euro;200 million for targeted places and apprenticeships as well as a range of training opportunities for young people who many not wish to pursue further or third level education.</p>  <p>  The further education colleges have got additional resources.  We have created thousands of additional places at third level as well.  The policy of providing a broad suite of opportunities for young people is key.  The idea that we simply open up the CAO system to everyone who wishes to do whatever they want does not work.  People need to think that through very carefully.  It does not make much sense to me and could undermine the well-being and development of young people in future.  I say this as a educationalist and as someone who knows a thing or two about education.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's approach to politics of giving people whatever they want when they want it is not grounded in reality.</p>  <p>  There has been reform in how the leaving certificate operates.  I support further reform of assessment and the modes of study and so on.  We need to create opportunities across the board in further and higher education and in a range of other areas that people wish to pursue.  One area where this is relevant is youth strategy.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, brought forward  the draft national youth strategy to Government yesterday.  It was very much focused on developing opportunities for disadvantaged young people, especially for young offenders.  One of the areas where we engage on a good deal is the past but we must be focused on the present as well especially on those children who are highly marginalised.  When we go through why they offend and get into offending, it is clear a range of background issues are relevant, including addiction and family issues.  This needs intense resourcing and supports.  That will form part of the national youth strategy.  This kind of work has been ongoing and the Minister of State has brought forward a comprehensive strategy in that regard.  Another area is school completion, which has been a passion of mine for a long time.  I believe we have to give every child born in the country an opportunity to complete second level education and we have to support and resource that.  This is something we are highly committed to as well.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised the question of early education and I agree this is a key priority.  There is a long journey yet to go in terms of equalising the comparisons between early education and the later years of primary education.  The Deputy referred to the joint labour committees.  The Government and the Minister are committed to progressing that to support the entire sector.  The age group from zero to three is key to the development of any child.  A child learns more between the ages of zero and three than in the remainder of his or her life.  That is something we want to progress.</p>  <p>  I was asked about mental health.  The Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 decided to provide even more additional resources to mental health, in particular to non-governmental organisations.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Mary Butler, has put major efforts into mental health.  She is an excellent Minister of State for that area and is working hard, especially in the context of Covid-19.  It is without question that Covid-19 is putting considerable strain and anxiety on young people.</p> <p>That is evidenced by the reports from mental health non-governmental organisations that help young people.  We are conscious of that also.  We provided additional resources this year through the national HSE service plan to deal with waiting lists for CAMHS.  We have provided additional resources in terms of mental health more generally.</p> <p> In terms of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question, I will revert to the Minister with responsibility for children in respect of that.  We are willing to do our part in respect of the commitments that we have made.  When we make those commitments, we have to fulfil them, and not just optically in the short term.  There has to be a comprehensive follow-through plan in terms of the well-being of those whom we assist to make sure it is sustainable for the individual children involved and we follow through on those commitments.</p></speech>

The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of the programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters.</p><p>There is significant work under way on the implementation of these commitments across Government Departments and agencies, including through regular discussion of these matters at meetings of the Government.  This is supported by the provision of over &euro;3 billion for housing initiatives this year, including funding for 9,500 social homes to be built as part of the overall delivery of 12,750 social homes; &euro;210 million for lending under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan; &euro;88 million across the serviced sites and the local infrastructure housing activation funds; and &euro;35 million for the cost rental equity loan scheme, through which the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently approved funding for the delivery of 390 cost rental homes this year.  The budget allocation also supports the continued delivery of housing supports in relation to residential tenancies, homelessness and the maintenance and upgrading of existing stock.</p><p>Significant progress is also being made on key enabling legislation for measures to increase the availability and supply of affordable, quality homes, including the Land Development Agency Bill, which has recently completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, and the affordable housing Bill, which is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny.  Legislative measures have also been introduced and extended to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants, although current public health restrictions will have an impact on housing output this year.  Work has also started, under the aegis of the committee, on a new multi-annual housing strategy, to be called &quot;Housing for All&quot;.</p><p>The committee operates in accordance with established guidelines for Cabinet committees and substantive issues are referred to the Government for discussion and approval.</p></reply>

I hear about all these grand plans, but I believe there will only be one additional council house in my area this year and we only got one or two last year.  All the rest is outsourced and now the Government is planning to outsource more through the Land Development Agency, LDA, and privatising public land.</p><p>I wish to raise the fraud that is the Residential Tenancies Bill 2021, which will be before the D&aacute;il today, in that it is a pretence by the Government that the latter will protect tenants from eviction during the pandemic.  Its protection is being extended to a tiny, limited cohort of people who have gone into arrears as a direct result of income loss due to Covid, but where everyone else is concerned, a green light is being given to landlords and vulture funds to evict people.</p><p>The Taoiseach may have read in <i>The Irish Times</i>or heard on radio last week the details of a case that I have raised with him and the Minister repeatedly.  It is a textbook case of tenants being mass evicted by vulture funds.  There is nothing to protect them.  How can the Taoiseach justify people being evicted into homelessness and the less safe environment of the homeless system on 5 April just because the 5 km rule is being changed when we still have a pandemic raging?  This is just one of the many examples of unscrupulous corporate landlords and vulture funds that are, for no other reason that profit, evicting into homelessness decent people who have always paid their rents.  The Government is going to allow it instead of doing what we are asking for as a minimum, that being, to extend the eviction ban until the pandemic has passed.</p></speech>

I met homeless people who told me that they felt safer sleeping on our streets than in private emergency accommodation.  I raised with the Taoiseach previously that the National Quality Standards Framework, NQSF, is not applied to private providers of emergency accommodation.  When I raised it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the D&aacute;il, he incorrectly stated that it was being applied.  Afterwards, Mr. Brendan Kenny of Dublin City Council confirmed to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that that was not the case.  Subsequently, the Minister gave national media interviews where he again insisted that the NQSF was being applied to private providers.  This is a serious issue.  Some private providers have been operating without fire certificates and a range of matters need to be addressed.  For example, there is a lack of independent inspections.  "RT&Eacute; Investigates" has also confirmed that the NQSF is not applied to private providers.  I have with me copies of reports from Dublin City Council confirming that.  I am happy to show and go through them with the Taoiseach or the Minister.</p>  <p>  When will the Government act to ensure that private emergency accommodation for homeless people is safe and up to standard so that people who are sleeping on our streets can avail of it?  When will the Government ensure that the NQSF is applied to all providers, including private ones?</p></speech>

There are 8,313 households registered as homeless and another 62,000 families on the housing list.  This is shocking, but just as shocking is the fact that there are 230,000 empty properties across the State.  It is not that there is a lack of housing.  Rather, there is bad housing policy.  Not enough public housing is being built on public land and the rents and prices paid for housing are ridiculously high and unaffordable.  The rent for an ordinary house in Dublin is &euro;2,500 per month.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may be aware that this situation is being exploited in our areas by far-right and fascist parties to blame immigrants rather than successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments, including this one, and the bankers and fly-by-nights that we bailed out consistently.  More than half of our health service is staffed by immigrants, yet the housing crisis is being exploited by those who claim that we must look after our own first.  That begs the question of who our own are.  Are they the one third of Deputies who are landlords?  Are they the bankers and fly-by-nights that we bailed out consistently?  Alternatively, are they the workers in our hospitals and home care settings who are doing so much to help us in the Covid era?</p>  <p>  The housing crisis is being exploited, but the blame for its continuation can be laid at the doorstep of successive Governments.  Instead of dealing with it, the Government is creating the LDA, which will basically give away public land to private operators and again fail to deal with the crisis.</p></speech>

The Government rejected that and instead adopted a piecemeal approach of banning evictions under certain conditions while the 5 km limit persisted.  Now we have the potential lifting of the limit, which poses the possibility of opening the floodgates on a large number of evictions.  Even worse, the Government's Bill that will be before the House today proposes to water down the protections for tenants who fall into rent arrears during the pandemic.  It is a move that Threshold warns will cause considerable confusion and distress to a significant cohort of private renters.</p>  <p>  What does the Taoiseach say to those who are looking at the possibility of the lifting of the 5 km limit and not thinking that it means they can go 10 km or travel across the county, but that they might be evicted as a result?  What will the Government do to avoid a wave of evictions?  Will it agree to extend the eviction ban beyond being linked to the 5 km limit?  Will it agree to adopt the approach that we set out previously to halt evictions and rent increases completely while the pandemic persists?</p></speech>

It states that Ireland is in breach of Article 16 of the European Social Charter.  What are the Taoiseach's views on this issue?  How will he address it?</p>  <p>  On the Residential Tenancies Bill 2021, to which reference has been made, we need to decouple the eviction ban from the 5 km limit so that when that limit is changed, it will not lead to the eviction of families.  Many Deputies have highlighted this issue.  What action will the Taoiseach take on it?</p>  <p>  On the Land Development Agency Bill, a principal concern of the Labour Party is that the Land Development Agency cannot sell off mass swathes of public land and ensure that 100% of the land is used for social and affordable housing.  There is real fear that parts of sites will be privatised and sold off for further and more expensive housing.  The Bill also strips away powers from councillors of all political leanings and none.  This is something with which I certainly do not agree.  Does the Taoiseach agree with it?  Does he believe that councillors should have this power stripped from them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400034#GG00200"><p>I refer to the finding of the human rights committee of the Council of Europe that sizeable numbers of local authority tenants live in inadequate housing conditions.  That is putting the matter very politely.  Some of the housing conditions are utterly deplorable and shameful in 2021.  The finding that the State is in breach of Article 16 of the European Social Charter in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation should not come as any surprise because, of course, it is not the first time that the State has been found to be in violation on these matters.  In fact, these violations are decades in the making.  The Taoiseach needs to give a response on these findings.</p>  <p>  On the issue of renters, it is very clear what needs to happen.  A full ban on evictions needs to be fully extended but, in addition, we need a decrease in rents.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a proposal to put a month's rental income back into the pockets of renters by way of a tax credit.  That should happen.  We also need a full rent freeze.  The manner in which renters have been literally left to their own devices - thrown to the wolves - by this Government and the previous one is absolutely astonishing.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government's shared equity loan scheme is clearly the wrong way to go.  The Taoiseach does not have to take my word for that because, as he knows, the Central Bank, the ESRI, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers and his own top civil servants have made clear that this scheme is the wrong way to go, will keep prices up and might even cause price inflation.  It will not make housing affordable.  I again ask that the shared equity loan scheme be removed from the affordable housing Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400034#GG00300"><p>The Deputies have asked quite a range of questions.  First, I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Government is not outsourcing housebuilding.  Some 9,500 of the 12,500 social housing properties to be built this year will be built by local authorities and approved social housing bodies.  There will be very large social housing provision this year in terms of building.  The Government is not outsourcing that at all, contrary to what the Deputy asserted.</p>  <p>  I also point out that there is no green light to evict people via this legislation.  It is wrong to suggest that there is such a green light.  The Deputy said the same things the last time this legislation was introduced in terms of the scale and how he presented the argument.  His predictions did not come to pass.  The Residential Tenancies Bill 2020 came into operation on 24 October.  As the Deputy knows, it sought to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants to support the Government's efforts to restrict the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of the virus while level 5 restrictions were in place.  There was very strong legal advice given to the Minister in terms of the parameters around which the legislation could be grounded and put into law free of any potential successful legal challenge.  That was an important aspect that the Minister simply had to take on board.  The legislation, broadly speaking, has proved to be effective and its extension is important.</p>  <p>  The target is for 12,750 social houses to be built this year.  Unquestionably, the three months of level 5 restrictions due to Covid has reduced output.  The Government has only been in office since last July but it has made very significant commitments.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to not one house being provided.  A significant number of voids were brought back in his council area under the dramatic initial programme taken by the Minister and funded by the Government last July.  It brought close to 3,000 social houses back into play, yet the Deputy comes in with propaganda about not one house being provided etc.  We will do everything we can to build social housing and get them built in 2021 at far higher levels.  Obviously, Covid has impacted on that.  The Deputies know that, but choose to ignore the impact of Covid on housing construction in the first three months of the year.</p>  <p>  On the issues raised by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, the Minister has established a homelessness task force.  He has regular meetings with the NGOs in relation to homelessness and in terms of the quality issue, but also the provision issue, particularly during the winter, when he was very anxious that we would provide as much capacity as we possibly could.  I take on board the Deputy's comments and the assertions of quite a number of homeless persons that they feel safer sleeping on the streets than in emergency accommodation.  We should not be in a position where people feel that way in terms of their accommodation.  I accept that point.  We are consistently trying to work to address it.</p>  <p>  In general response to some of the contributions that have been made, I make the point that ideology will not build houses.</p></speech>

It had been planned to hold this meeting in person in Brussels.  However, due to the continued high, and in some cases growing, prevalence of Covid-19 in a number of member states, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, took the decision earlier this week to hold the meeting by videoconference.</p>  <p>  The items on the agenda include Covid-19; the Single Market, industrial policy, digital and the economy; relations with Russia; and relations with Turkey.  Other current external relations issues may also be discussed.  We will also participate in a euro summit in inclusive format to discuss the international role of the euro.</p>  <p>  I welcome that President Biden will join us on Thursday evening for a discussion on the transatlantic relationship.  I discussed the EU-US relationship with President Biden and with Vice President Harris last week when I met with each of them on St. Patrick's Day.  On that occasion, I assured the President and Vice President that, if the US is looking to strengthen the transatlantic relationship, there is equally interest and enthusiasm on the European Union side to renew and reinvigorate that relationship.  I believe further that Ireland has a distinctive role to play in furthering the transatlantic relationship.</p>  <p>  In my contribution this afternoon I will address Covid-19; the Single Market, industrial policy, digital and the economy; and the euro summit.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will address relations with Russia and with Turkey in his closing remarks.</p>  <p>  Last week, on 18 March, I participated in a videoconference with Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, and with the Prime Ministers of Finland, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Malta.</p> <p>President Michel has held a number of such videoconferences in recent months in order to hold more informal discussions with smaller groups of leaders in advance of meetings of the European Council.  We had a good exchange that focused, in the main, on Covid-19 and digital policy issues.  All leaders were agreed on the need to significantly increase the production and delivery of vaccines using all tools available to us.  As the House will be aware, supply has become a real constraint in rolling out vaccines not only here in Ireland, but across the European Union, in large part as a consequence of AstraZeneca's failure to deliver on its European Union contract.  We also agreed on the important role that the digital agenda will play in underpinning the European Union's economic recovery once we overcome the current pandemic and we looked forward to discussing the various dimensions of the issue when the European Council meets.<br/><br/>I also took the opportunity to brief colleagues on my US engagements on St. Patrick's Day, including my meetings with President Biden, Vice President Harris and Speaker Pelosi.  The new US Administration is strongly supportive of international co-operation and I told colleagues that there is now a significant opportunity to strengthen the transatlantic relationship in areas of mutual concern, including Covid-19, trade and climate action.<br/><br/>Covid-19 has been a standing item on the agenda of the European Council in recent months and we will again take stock of the epidemiological situation across Europe when we meet tomorrow.  The incidence of the disease is increasing in many member states and additional restrictive measures have been introduced across the European Union in recent days.  This can be linked directly with the increased dominance of more virulent strains of the virus, as we experienced ourselves in the early weeks of the year.  While we now have one of the lowest incidences of the disease in the European Union, we, of course, remain vigilant.  Tomorrow we will discuss efforts to increase the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines and European Union co-ordination in response to the pandemic, including on new variants of concern. <br/><br/>In the face of challenges with the supply of vaccines, we should not lose sight of the scale of what has been achieved.  In less than a year, a number of highly effective vaccines have been developed, tested and made available to vaccinate against a virus that was completely unknown.  It is a remarkable tribute to science and international co-operation.  It is also important to recall that the decision that the European Union should come together as one to order and distribute vaccines has been a good one and very much in Ireland's interests.  While there have been frustrations, the cause is the limited supply at global level as manufacturers ramp up their production capacity to meet unprecedented global demand.  It does not bear thinking about how Ireland, as a small country, would have fared in a context where we were out on our own as the world's biggest countries competed and outbid each other for access to limited supplies.  The European Union has given us access to a portfolio of more than 2.6 billion doses.  Deliveries of vaccines will continue to increase as production ramps up and vaccination programmes will continue to gather pace in the coming months right across the European Union and beyond.  For our part, we have been administering vaccines as quickly as we can and will continue to do so.  In that context, it is vital that vaccine supply chains remain open.  I will make it clear at our meeting this week that I do not support actions that would disrupt vital supply chains and undermine vaccine production when the situation remains so fragile.  <br/><br/>Of course, the European Union must continue to hold to account those companies with which it has entered into contracts.  There must also be transparency as to the numbers and destinations of vaccines that are produced.  However, the pandemic is a global challenge and we must work together to overcome it.  Equally, the production of vaccines which rely on a range of inputs, from the elements of which they are constituted to the vials in which they are bottled, is a global activity, relaying on complicated and easily disrupted relationships.  Any interruption carries real risk to supply.  The world as a whole needs us to work together to increase production.  As the WHO reminds us, until all of us are safe, none of us is safe.  That is why we will continue our discussions on global solidarity tomorrow.  We need to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines across the globe.  Irish Aid recently announced a planned contribution of &euro;4 million to COVAX to finance procurement of vaccines for developing countries.  Ireland will also contribute &euro;1 million to the World Health Organization to support its oversight of the COVAX mechanism, ensuring fairness and transparency.  This is part of at least &euro;50 million allocated to global health by Ireland in 2021.  Ireland's direct support to COVAX complements a broader team Europe response.  The European Union has doubled its funding for the initiative from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion, to which Ireland makes a <i>pro rata</i>contribution.  When taken with the commitments of individual member states, this brings the entire European Union pledge to COVAX to &euro;2.2 billion.<br/><br/>During the videoconference, we will also discuss a co-ordinated approach to safe reopening of our economies and societies.  It will take some time before this becomes possible, but we have an opportunity to begin to plan for this together.  In the meantime, we must to ensure that the Single Market is protected and that the unhindered flow of goods and services continues, including through the use of green lanes for goods.  <br/><br/>As the House will be aware, the Government continues to advise against all non-essential international travel.  Restrictions on non-essential travel remain necessary and are reinforced by legal measures to protect public health and to mitigate the risk of new variants of Covid-19 entering the country.  For essential inbound travel, all arriving passengers, with very limited exemptions, must have a negative pre-departure polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test result, complete the passenger locator form and observe post-arrival quarantine.  At tomorrow's meeting, I will update my European Union colleagues on the introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine this week in Ireland.  The position on international travel will be kept under review over the coming months in light of epidemiological developments and the progress of vaccination.<br/><br/>On St. Patrick's Day, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for digital green certificates.  Our discussions tomorrow will touch on this issue as we look for the technical work to be progressed over the coming weeks.  While there is clearly value in having vaccination certificates for medical purposes, their use for travel purposes requires further consideration.<br/><br/>This week's meeting will also return to Single Market, industrial and digital policy issues, setting important political orientations for the ambitious legislative agenda being advanced by the Commission in this area.  We touched on these issues at the meeting of the European Council last October and adopted conclusions.  The need for a more competitive and resilient European Union is more evident than ever.  To achieve this, we need to set the right strategic direction for the digital transformation, unlock the Single Market's full potential, especially in the field of services, and ensure that the European Union remains a champion of open, rules-based multilateralism.  We will only achieve this by developing our own economic strengths, dynamism and competitiveness.  It cannot be about excluding others or taking a protectionist approach.  We need to work together to support research and innovation, develop technological capabilities and skills, and facilitate the development of a green and digital economy.  An open, well-functioning, competitive and innovative digital economy is essential for the European Union's future economic strength.<br/><br/>I welcome the digital compass proposals presented by the Commission on 9 March, setting the course for a digitally empowered Europe by 2030.  These include clear ambitions for digital skills, data and connectivity infrastructure, and for increasing the digital intensity of business and public services.  I also welcome the emphasis on addressing global challenges through strong international partnerships, including in particular the proposed renewal of the transatlantic relationship through a new EU-US trade and technology council.  The Commission's digital compass proposals are consistent with the emphasis placed by Ireland and like-minded member states on setting a strategic direction for Europe that is open, competitive and innovation-friendly.<br/><br/>On the question of taxation in the new digital economy, Ireland remains fully supportive of EU efforts to advance agreement by the middle of this year within the framework of OECD and G20 co-operation.  At our meeting, leaders will also express our support for the policy priority areas of the annual sustainable growth strategy published by the European Commission.  These will be reflected in national recovery and resilience plans being prepared by member states, including Ireland, ahead of the deadline at the end of April.  The recovery and resilience facility is the centrepiece of the next generation EU package agreed by the European Council last July and will be one of the main European Union tools supporting the economic recovery across the Union.</p> <p>The economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are serious, and employment levels are now well below where we want them to be.  The impact has also been highly uneven and presents particular challenges for young people and those employed in contact-intensive sectors.  It is important that we retain a clear focus on job creation and having the necessary supports in place to help these cohorts return to employment as quickly as possible.  Advancing the green and digital transitions will also underpin a growth path that is sustainable at both the domestic and European Union levels, supported by the right mix of monetary, fiscal and structural policies.</p> <p> The euro summit will set important orientations for finance ministers on ongoing work on the international role of the euro.  In December, we agreed that this international role should be commensurate with the global economic and financial weight of the Union.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will participate in his capacity as president of the Eurogroup, and I expect that we will also hear from President Lagarde of the ECB on monetary policy developments.  In his letter to President Michel on last week's preparations at the Eurogroup, key elements identified by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, include: a strong economic recovery, integrated financial markets and payments systems, and delivering on green and digital finance.  The international role of the euro in the coming decade will clearly depend in the first instance on how our economies recover from the impact of Covid-19.  A strong European recovery, which addresses divergences and prepares for the transition to a digital and green future, will help us achieve these broader, strategic goals.  If there is a common thread running through the issues we will discuss this week, it is our interconnectedness, whether that is in terms of delivering vaccines at scale and at pace, developing a green and digital economy, or advancing relations with external partners.  We will only secure our future health and prosperity by working together.  This is true of our actions within the European Union and of our engagement across the world.</p> <p> In his concluding remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will update Members on the discussions planned on the European Union's relations with two of our most important neighbours, Russia and Turkey.  Our consideration of these relationships will build on discussions we have had at a number of recent European Council meetings.  In this too, it is vital that the European Union engages in unity.  I look forward to engaging with my European Union colleagues at tomorrow's meeting of the European Council on all of these issues and will report back to the House in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400036#JJ00200"><p>The European Council meets this week at a time when the twin crises of the pandemic and Brexit call for a refocusing on what is required to meet these seismic challenges and to deliver solutions based on what has worked successfully in the recent past, that is, partnership, co-operation and solidarity.</p>  <p>  There is massive frustration and disappointment in Ireland and across the European Union at how the European Commission has handled the procurement and supply of Covid-19 vaccines.  The reality is that the EU has little experience of procurement.  It is not an EU competency and procurement is not carried out through the EU for other vaccines.  The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has acknowledged mistakes around the speed of procurement, which arguably member states might not have made if left to their own devices.  These mistakes have had consequences, in particular for smaller member states such as Ireland where supplies are nowhere near where they need to be, and where the initial stages of the vaccine roll-out are dangerously slow.</p>  <p>  In summary, there has been a failure thus far to deliver vaccines at scale or at pace.  The European Union must acknowledge and take responsibility for its mistakes, but it is the Government that is ultimately responsible for protecting the health of the Irish people.  The roll-out here has been marked by many problems.  For example, we still do not have detail on staffing for mass vaccination centres and there is no plan for preventing further delays to healthcare from redeployments that might be necessary for these centres.  We still have problems with deliveries of vaccine to GPs.  Missed deliveries and late deliveries with no warning are persistent and some GPs have received few or no vaccines.  Some have received double deliveries while others have received a box of leaflets instead of vaccines.  Vulnerable groups such as family carers, to mention one, are still left behind in the order of priority.  I raised that already this morning.  None of this is good enough.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to look seriously at avenues outside of the EU system to maximise supply, accelerate the stuttering roll-out and give health teams and professionals the very best chance at getting the job done.  Solidarity across EU member states is important, but we should remember that other states such as Germany and Denmark are now doing their own side deals and Ireland needs to seek out every opportunity.  The importance of having a certain supply of vaccines is even further underscored when one considers that further delays can be caused by unforeseen circumstances such as we saw with the recent suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  The people of the EU and Ireland need certainty and regularity of supply.  I note that the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is reviewing the Russian Sputnik V vaccine with the hope of approving it for use in the European Union.  That is very important work.  It is important that the EU continues to build a portfolio of safe vaccines from a wide range of sources in a way that enhances supplies in a fair way across member states.</p>  <p>  Procurement issues have slowed us down, so the focus now must be on maximising production and the EU must take leadership in the global vaccination effort.  We remember the mantra that nobody is safe until we are all safe.  It is not enough for the Government to sit back and point a finger at the EU, it is essential that we play an energetic role in positively contributing to the improvement of the EU strategy.  Unless our vaccination programme is improved dramatically then the virus will stay ahead of us and the reopening of society, the economy and people's lives will remain on hold indefinitely.  That is unacceptable given the hard road people have travelled since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Although Brexit is not on the cl&aacute;r for the upcoming Council meeting, I have no doubt the recent developments may be discussed informally by EU leaders.  Five years after Britain's vote to leave the EU - a decision resoundingly rejected by the people of the North of Ireland - the economic and political dangers have converged to present us with the true scale of what Brexit really means for Ireland.  The continuing campaign to undermine the Irish protocol is ill-conceived to say the very least and dangerous.  Attacks on the protocol, including the DUP's legal challenge, have been damaging and disruptive to the all-island effort to minimise the impact of Brexit.  These attacks are not in the best interests of workers, families and businesses.  They are dangerous ploys designed to divide and distract from the calamity of Brexit.  The decisions taken by the British Government at the start of March were also unhelpful.  At February's meeting of the joint committee, Michael Gove and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič reaffirmed support for the Irish protocol and the need to work together to deal with the issues that arise.  Incredibly, one week later the British Government went on a solo run, taking unilateral action in departing from the rules of the protocol and measures agreed by both sides.  This was completely unnecessary and undermined the work and the role of the joint committee.  Putting the joint committee on a collision course with the EU is short-sighted and counterproductive.  The joint committee was put in place for a reason and it needs to work.</p> <p> In the immediate aftermath of these events, I met dozens of members of the diplomatic corps in Dublin and London regarding the challenges Ireland now faces arising from Brexit and the fact we are now picking up the pieces of a Tory Brexit that is bad for Ireland.  It is clear to me that EU member states are watching events closely, that they understand why the Irish protocol is necessary and, most importantly, that they are resolute in supporting its implementation.  The protocol is vital for us.  It protects our all-island economy, it defends the Good Friday Agreement and it prevents the reintroduction of a hard border on our island.  It is right there has been near universal condemnation of attempts to undermine that protocol and that those voices of condemnation have been heard at home and internationally.  I welcome the statement issued jointly by US President Joe Biden and the Irish Government on St. Patrick's Day, which called for the good faith implementation of international agreements designed to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and which sought to underscore the importance of preserving the hard-won gains of the peace process.</p> <p> Instead of attacking the protocol, those who championed the Tory Brexit should own their decisions, turn away from narrow ideological attacks and join the good faith effort of making the protocol work for the benefit of everyone.  We must remember that these attempts to undermine the protocol are happening at a time of immense challenge for business and trade across the island, challenges brought on mainly by the disruptive approach taken by the British Government in putting in place its new customs regime.</p> <p> To face these challenges, the Government must be proactive and strategic in its response.  It must respond to the repeated calls from traders to update systems throughout the trading channel to avoid adding to the disruption.  It must also invest in key infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunities for the all-island economy that are becoming all the more apparent in the chaos of Brexit.  This is something recognised by IBEC in its submission to the national development plan and by EU Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič when he pointed to the potential of building capacity at Rosslare Europort as an alternative to the British land bridge for Irish companies trading to the Continent.</p> <p> Trade with Britain will remain crucially important, but there is now a need to enhance the strategy for Irish companies to diversify into new international markets to offset the disruption.  If Ireland is to respond successfully to the challenge of Brexit, there can be no question of a reduction in our allocation of the EU Brexit adjustment fund.  That is something the Government must impress on our EU partners at the Council meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400037#KK00200"><p>I always make the comment that five minutes is very short to make any meaningful contribution on European Council meetings.  I have noticed the European Commission has, most unusually for that institution, been belligerent and noisy in advance of this week's Council meeting.  The reason for that is obvious.  A new wave of Covid infections has erupted and the roll-out of vaccines remains painfully slow across the European Union.</p>  <p>  Here, we look at our nearest neighbour where more vaccines were administered each day last week than we have managed to administer in three months.  It is delivering 720,000 vaccines a day.  Proportionately, that would equate to 60,000 vaccines per day here.  The truth is we are nowhere near reaching that level of delivery.</p>  <p>  The Commission put its hands up in the early part of the pandemic.  There was no health competence within the European Union, as we know.  Things were slow to be organised in the face of the pandemic.  Co-operation in the initial months was not as it should have been.  All of that was gradually understood and acknowledged.  We were promised that lessons were learned and vast improvements would be delivered upon.  This has not happened.  Vaccine procurement, the Commission's single most important task, has been unacceptably poor.  Our purchase agreements and contractual arrangements have proven to be significantly inferior to those negotiated by the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>  <p>  Most amazingly of all, the EU has somehow managed to put itself, in the past week or so, in the position of being seen as the aggressor, threatening to stop the export of vaccines, when in truth since February more than 40 million vaccines have left the European Union to 33 other nations in total, including 10 million vaccines which were exported from the European Union to the United Kingdom.  That was one-way traffic, since the AstraZeneca vaccine cannot leave Britain because of its UK-first contract clause.</p>  <p>  There must be a process of accountability for this unacceptable state of affairs.  The promise solemnly given almost a year ago to do better has not been delivered on.  Those of us who remain strong supporters of the European Union must require its institutions to be accountable in the full measure of that phrase.</p>  <p>  For the past few days the Taoiseach has preached calm, no vaccine nationalism and no vetoing of exports.  It should never have reached this point.  There has been a failure of procurement, a slowness in authorisation and a communications strategy that has painted the most generous of national blocs as vaccine grabbers.  Meanwhile, the UK &ndash; and more luck to it &ndash; has administered more than 720,000 vaccines per day while European Union citizens patiently wait and watch the number of infections rise.</p>  <p>  The European project will succeed when we know we can depend on the competence of those whom we entrust with leadership and on our systems of political oversight to properly address the situation when that leadership and those solemnly given commitments fail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400037#KK00300"><p>I have said in the House before that Ireland, as a small country, had no choice but to be part of the EU vaccination process.  However, it has to be said the Commission's handling of this matter has been less than sure-footed.  Its approach from the start was slow and bureaucratic in terms of concluding pragmatic contracts and getting approvals for vaccines.  Maybe this is the necessary <i>modus operandi </i>for an EU comprising 27 states.</p><p>However, it is now apparent that the Commission should have been tougher with vaccine manufacturers and not have willingly accepted their commitment with regard to deliveries.  It seems the Commission lacked business acumen and did not have sufficient knowledge of the commercial realities of the world.  That said, I am not saying it should have engaged in what Boris Johnson called capitalism and greed.</p><p>The UK, US and Israel are way ahead of the EU in the administration of vaccines, yet the EU is the world's biggest producer of vaccines.  Up to last month, the EU had exported 41 million vaccine doses to 33 countries, including 10 million doses to the UK and 1 million doses to the US.</p> <p>Sadly, no vaccines were exported to the EU in return.  Ursula von der Leyen initially threatened to ban exports of vaccines from the EU to other countries that are producing their own vaccines and not exporting them in return.  A blanket ban on exports would be a mistake and would be counterproductive.  As vaccines contain many ingredients manufactured in many different countries, the interconnectivity of the global supply chains need to be kept open.  I welcome, therefore, the new proposals put forward by the Commission this morning.  However, we have a problem.  AstraZeneca has failed to live up to its supply commitments and, as a result, Europe has been left short.  The EU must now do everything possible to ramp up production in EU plants to ensure that the AstraZeneca company fulfils its commitments.  I also hope that the attendance of US President Joe Biden at the council meeting will help to improve the position.</p> <p> There is a problem in EU-UK relations.  The vaccine issue is one problem while the Brexit divorce has been quite nasty.  The unilateral declaration by the British Government to the effect that certain checks agreed as part of the Northern Ireland protocol would not be applied until at least October was wrong.  The Commission had to act and was right to initiate legal action against the UK.  It is in everyone's interest that the trade and co-operation agreement be implemented in full.  I believe that Ireland in its traditional role as a peacemaker should do everything possible to try to improve relations between these two blocs.   </p> <p> I also give a cautious welcome for the digital green certificate.  It is not a passport, nor is it a magic bullet and it is not foolproof against the importation of this insidious virus but the proposal should be actively explored.   </p> <p> I wish to put on the record my condemnation of the military coup in Myanmar and call on the EU to ramp up its response.  I would also like to welcome the imposition of sanctions on China by the EU for human rights abuses and the systematic oppression of the Muslim Uighurs minority.  I also note the 10th anniversary of the war in Syria and to request that increased humanitarian aid be given to that region. </p> <p> I believe the EU must consider imposing further restrictive measures on Belarus given the human rights violations taking place there.   Finally, I am worried about the proposal that the recovery and resilience fund for Ireland may be reduced.  I ask that the Minister might deal with that in his response. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400038#LL00200"><p>I am very grateful to the Taoiseach for his opening remarks and to the Minister of State.  The videoconference European Council that will take place on Thursday and Friday has a jam-packed agenda once again.  It will deal with a plethora of issues but I will raise just two.  First, President Joe Biden&rsquo;s attendance at the Council for the first time is a wonderful opportunity for a reset of EU-US relations.  The transatlantic alliance is so important as defined in the 20th and early parts of the 21st century but we cannot deny that the past few years have been extremely difficult given who was in office in the United States.  I have no doubt that when the Taoiseach and other Prime Ministers sit down with the President virtually they will raise many issues, many of which will be similar.  They will discuss the areas where the EU and US must work closely together in coming years, especially the next four years, including on the climate emergency.  The Taoiseach has an opportunity, which should not be missed, to state clearly the continuing need for US engagement and interest in the post-Brexit fallout on this island, dealing with the Northern Ireland protocol and protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  The US is the unofficial co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  Its continuing involvement and engagement, particularly under this President and administration is extremely welcome, but there is no point in us using the opportunity to talk about more general issues; rather we must push our case front and centre at every opportunity, as this and the previous Governments have done.</p>  <p>  The second issue, which will no doubt dominate the Council meeting and will certainly dominate the media&rsquo;s reporting, is vaccines and the ongoing stand-off between the EU and certain drugs companies.  This is not an EU-UK issue, despite how certain British newspapers or politicians would like to paint it.  It is very much an issue about a drugs company supplying the drugs that have been paid for by the European Commission and by Irish taxpayers through a joint procurement process.  I welcome the measures announced by the Commission this morning on the options that are available to it from a trading point of view.  It is not an export ban and should not be interpreted as such, even though certain people will leap on the opportunity to call it that and use it as yet another stick to wrongly beat the EU with, which they left some months ago.  We need the Commission to take a very stern and deliberate approach on two fronts.  One is to ensure the contractual obligations of drugs companies in question are met.  Only 30 million of a promised 90 million vaccines have arrived.  The schedule has been blown out of the water.  Two sinister causes for concern became apparent only today.  In a factory in Italy, 29 million doses of the vaccine were just stumbled upon.  Are they going to other EU member states, the UK, the US or elsewhere?  Are they going to an international distribution centre in Liege or are they bound for the European citizens who paid for them?  The second equally concerning question is whether the drug companies are selling the vaccines twice.  They have taken payment twice but they have not given delivery to all.  These are serious issues and we need strong action from the Commission immediately to ramp up production but also in the medium term.  What is to happen to drugs companies with lucrative businesses operating throughout the EU that fail to meet their contracts with the EU?  What will be the sanction?  In two or three years, when everyone is happily vaccinated, will the companies that misled the Commission, broke the terms of their contract and put the lives of so many Europeans on hold be taken to task for their failures and inaction?  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, it seems factors ranging from inexperience to the pursuit of domestic electoral gain mean the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine is being seriously hampered.  The problems at international level must be dealt with as quickly as possible.  We must be careful that Ireland does not become collateral damage, yet again, between the EU and the British Government.</p>  <p>  I felt compelled in the past week to call for the Taoiseach to assume direct responsibility for the roll-out of the vaccine in Ireland.  It has been evident for some time that the Minister for Health is not up to the job and as the individual responsible for his appointment, it falls on the Taoiseach to step up and sort this out.  I do not want to reiterate failures in the roll-out of the vaccine programme in this State; they are clearly evident to all.</p>  <p>  If the roll-out of the vaccine programme does not take place with simultaneous application around the world, we run the risk of the development of variants in countries that cannot afford the vaccine.  These are variants with the potential to develop immunity to the vaccines in which we have invested so much hope.  The EU cannot lose sight of the long-term implications of neglecting a universal roll-out of a vaccine programme.  The most effective way to do this is to ensure that the countries in need are given the means to develop the vaccine themselves at a cost they can afford.</p> <p>The EU must show humane leadership in its approach to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Greece.  I call on the Taoiseach, in respect of this meeting, to give a commitment to meet with the Irish medical staff on the ground on Lesbos, listen to what they have to say and take that message to the heart of the EU.</p> <p> A final area I want to touch on is the situation in Myanmar.  Although we are aware that the EU has initiated action this week against named individuals regarding the ongoing oppression of democratic protest against the coup which took place in the country, citizens of Myanmar are being murdered in the streets by their own military forces.  Several Irish citizens are also offering humanitarian aid in the country, despite the considerable risk that poses.  I stress again that Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council and a prominent member of the EU, must show leadership on this issue.  The reality is people are being shot down on the streets in Myanmar and Irish citizens delivering aid are afraid to speak out and address the issue.  Ireland cannot remain silent on this issue.  I urge the Taoiseach in his meeting to have this serious issue raised.</p></speech>

I wish that was all that was at stake here.  I think, however, we are paying the price for the lack of investment and co-ordination at an EU level in public health over many years.  The European Union was very late in negotiating contracts for vaccines and that has resulted from years of neglect in this area.  Before the pandemic, how often did ministers for health meet at EU level?  They met twice a year.  If we look at most other areas, and let us take agriculture as an example, the relevant ministers often meet monthly.  Holding meetings twice a year, however, was the level of effort that was put into co-ordination of health at EU level.</p>  <p>  Turning to health competences and public health at EU level, those aspects are very weak.  If we want collective structures to work, we must put in effort and resources to ensure that happens.  We must strengthen European health agencies, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and European co-operation on health and technology assessment.  We must also ensure we have much better co-ordination and a much better European health response mechanism for emergencies.  We must also have a European health insurance fund in place for rare diseases, because no one country can address these issues on its own.  In addition, we should have minimum healthcare standards across EU member states as well as EU competence in respect of transnational pandemics.  Those areas must be strengthened.  Regarding the EU budget for healthcare, last May &euro;9.4 billion was proposed for a new EU health fund.  It was cut to &euro;1.7 billion in July.  What is the position of our Government on that issue?  What size of budget are we supporting for EU healthcare funds?</p>  <p>  There is no question that popular support for the European Union is completely reliant on the big issues which affect people's lives.  The roll-out of the vaccines and how that process is being handled is going to affect for many years to come how people perceive the European Union and what level of popular support there will be for it.  At this stage, we are only a few steps away from a potential vaccine trade war, where exports of vaccines from the European Union would be suspended and supplies of vaccine ingredients into the EU could be blocked.  The result would be a lose-lose situation, and it is the last thing that we need in the fight against Covid-19.  We need an approach which will combat the vaccine nationalism that has already been very damaging.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been outspoken in saying that no barriers should be put in place which could hamper the production of vaccines.  I agree with the Taoiseach on this, but let us be clear about the position of the Irish Government regarding barriers to vaccine production and roll-out globally and the EU's position in that regard.  I state that because the position of the European Union and the Irish Government on this matter is that the Irish Government is not supporting a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights which would enable a speedier roll-out of vaccine production globally.  The Taoiseach is right to quote the WHO and state that none of us are safe until all of us are safe.</p>  <p>  However, we need that commitment to be extended to waiving intellectual property rights temporarily so that vaccine production and roll-out can be maximised globally.  We should not have the current situation where production is not at the level it could be if those intellectual property rights were waived.  We are in the midst of a global pandemic.  It is unbelievable that the reality of this situation has not hit home and that not everyone has grasped that the best way to fight a global pandemic is through maximising the global response to the virus.  If we are serious about doing that, it means waiving the intellectual property rights in this regard.  There is no excuse for this situation.</p>  <p>  Concerning our own narrow self-interest, I do not believe this approach of not waiving intellectual property rights will work out well because the biggest threat to us after we get our population vaccinated will be from variants which will still be spreading around the globe as a result of insufficient levels of vaccination.  Therefore, I urge the Irish Government to change its position on this issue and to take a leadership role in this area tomorrow at the European Council meeting.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Taoiseach's determination not to support an export ban on vaccines.  Such a ban would be short term and irrational.  It seems to be an attempt to deflect from proper scrutiny of what is really going on here.  The weakness of the EU response to the issue of vaccination since this time last year is what we must scrutinise and learn from.  It is from those lessons we should bring about changes for the future.</p>  <p>  Regarding the difficulties being experienced in the roll-out of vaccinations, AstraZeneca has undoubtedly played a disgraceful role in this regard.  The company has become the poster child for corporate arrogance in its approach to this situation and that is impacting citizens' lives.  However, we should not do something which will potentially result in further difficulties down the line in respect of an export ban and how that might impact on the vaccination roll-out and vaccine production.  Such an export ban could also impact on production more generally, not just in the European Union but in this country as one of the most open economies in the world.  Let us instead focus on how we can resolve the specific issue and ensure that, if we are hit by another pandemic, and we may well be, or by any other major challenge, the EU will respond more effectively, urgently and clearly than it has in this case.</p>  <p>  Some difficult decisions and discussion will arise regarding national competences and those borders and barriers we put in the way of sharing national competences.  However, that can be done as a consequence of what has been learned from this pandemic and it should be done.  I state that because this pandemic has shown the shortcomings of a country-by-country response.  On this island, we have seen the shortcomings of a response to pandemic management which has been based on two jurisdictions.  It is extraordinary that, 20 years ago this week, we were able to have an all-island approach to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, but two decades later we have been unable to do so during this Covid-19 pandemic.  Let us look back, therefore, at what was learned in 2001 and apply that approach to the rest of the 21st century.</p>  <p>  I wish the Taoiseach well.  It is important he holds his and Ireland's ground regarding an export ban.  It will not resolve the situation.  It is important we call out AstraZeneca on its appalling and arrogant behaviour.  It is also important, however, that there is self-reflection within the European Commission regarding its response, not just concerning the roll-out of vaccinations but also the pandemic generally.  The Commission should not seek to deflect attention away from that aspect of the situation.</p></speech>

Many people have spoken about vaccine nationalism.  My Green Party colleagues and I had a positive meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, regarding the issue of vaccinations for Palestinians.</p>  <p>This is a particularly vulnerable group, given the cruel and repressive occupation they are under, and we have seen the impact of vaccine nationalism there.  I urge the Minister to use the opportunity to raise this issue and to drive action on it with our EU colleagues.</p> <p> Recently, Avraham Burg, a former speaker of the Knesset, wrote a letter to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy that was signed by a total of 466 members of parliament from throughout the member states.  I was one of many Deputies who signed this letter calling to use the change of administration in the United States as an opportunity to re-engage in the issue of peace and ending the occupation of Palestine.  We cannot go on with business as usual.  There was a 185% increase in the number of demolitions in the start of this year compared with the start of last year.  Two Israeli NGOs, Ir Amim and Bimkom, have warned that significant demolitions are coming in al-Walaja, a precarious village with a long history I will not get into now.</p> <p> We need to find new ways of doing things.  One simple matter I ask the Minister to raise relates to the EU business advisory on potential legal, financial or ethical consequences for doing business in the Israeli settlements.  Ireland has published this business warning on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and several other member states have done something similar, but the EU's external action service has not done this.  This is a very simple ask.  There is generally good consensus among member states on this at least, if not on other actions.  I ask the Minister to raise the issue.</p></speech>

In 2017, the elected representatives of the Catalan people, in line with the pre-election mandate they had received, facilitated a referendum on independence.  That referendum, which was held on 1 October 2017, was met with a violent response from Spanish state forces.  Voters were physically attacked as they made their way to vote, in what were unprecedented scenes in modern western European history.  Despite this, more than 2 million Catalans voted for independence and the reaction of the Spanish state was excessive and destructive.</p>  <p>  The Catalan Parliament was dissolved and political leaders imprisoned - jailed, let us remind ourselves - for that heinous crime of organising a democratic vote.  Community leaders, political activists, even musicians have since also been jailed for participating in peaceful political activities.  The Spanish Government is even attempting to remove democratically elected Catalan representatives from their positions as Members of the European Parliament.  The actions of the Spanish Government have been disappointing, if not all that surprising, but it has been the inaction of the European institutions that has been most disconcerting.  If the events I have just described occurred in certain parts of South America or Asia, the outcry from EU leaders would be deafening.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland know about the consequences of powerful governments denying the right to self-determination.  More than 100 years ago, the people voted for independence and the British Government refused to accept that mandate, instead opting for violence, oppression and, eventually and ultimately, the partition of our country.  Its failure to accept the right to self-determination continues to have consequences, as the EU has learned following and as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  It is tragic that the Spanish Government has not learned from the mistakes of its British counterpart a century ago, but it is utterly shameful that the Union has allowed the Catalan crisis to fester.  It is shameful that not one EU leader has stood up for democracy, for human rights and for justice on behalf of people within the Union.  They cannot credibly lecture others on these matters while this situation continues within European borders.  In the absence of a semblance of leadership emerging from the figureheads of the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament, it is incumbent on Ireland to provide that leadership.  In acknowledgement of our history and experience of democracy denied and of peacebuilding and reconciliation, we are perfectly placed to stand up for the rights of our fellow Europeans in Catalonia.</p>  <p>  I urge the Taoiseach to use the opportunity of this week's European Council meeting to make that stand on behalf of the people, democracy and self-determination.  It is the very least our fellow Europeans should expect from this proud fellow nation.</p></speech>

It is a similar picture in most countries in the EU because the issue we face at this stage is primarily one of supply.  The immediate cause of this is the problems with AstraZeneca, which certainly seems to have sold its supply twice, to the EU and the UK, and then chosen to fulfil the ones it makes more money from, through its contract with the UK.  The Taoiseach's response to that today was to urge the pharmaceutical companies to fulfil their contracts.  It is the equivalent of saying to AstraZeneca: "You have signed this contract; pretty please, fulfil it."</p>  <p>  The deeper cause is what the head of UNAIDS, Ms Winnie Byanyima, described to an Oireachtas committee.  Big pharma is protecting its monopolies, technology and intellectual property and thus restricting the production of Covid vaccines.  It is vaccine nationalism, vaccine imperialism and, fundamentally, vaccine capitalism, and the EU is allowing this to happen.  The EU at the World Trade Organization, with the support, scandalously, of the Government, did not support the proposal to suspend the intellectual property on Covid vaccines in order that there could be generic production, and that AstraZeneca and all the other companies that have received more than &euro;5 billion in public funding for research could no longer restrict access to, and production of, these vaccines.  That is the way to deal with this crisis but it is a route the EU refuses to take.  Rather than dancing to their tune, it is time we stood up to these profiteers.</p>  <p>  Turning to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, it is really a success of spin over substance.  The Government is patting itself on the back for setting so-called ambitious targets but the elephant is the room is that these targets are mere political spin because of how far out the implementation dates are.  It talks about a 50% reduction by 2030, relative to a 2018 baseline, without saying what it will do this year, next year and in the lifetime of the Government.  It is making promises for a future Government that are inadequate in and of themselves.  They are even less ambitious than EU climate law.  The EU measures the reduction against 1990 and is heading for targets by 2030 of 55% or 60%, significantly more than the targets of the Government, but neither of those targets follows the science.  We need binding reductions of 10% a year to get to zero carbon by 2030.  That is what the science demands and it is what the environmental movement must demand too.</p></speech>

We are not afraid.  We shall not obey."  These were the cries that rang out on the streets of Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir at the weekend.  There were demonstrations of women and girls holding pictures of women who had died as a result of male violence and protesting against the withdrawal of the Turkish Government from the Istanbul Convention, which directs prosecution for domestic violence, marital rape and female genital mutilation.</p> <p>These women and girls and the men who support them were protesting in a country where femicide is a daily reality.  The number of femicides in Turkey has tripled since 2010.  There were 474 in 2019 alone.  Of course, it is a scandal that Turkey has withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention, but it should also be a signal to people campaigning for women's rights throughout Europe to step up the fight.  Doing so includes putting pressure on the likes of this Government, which continues to say the right things while starving organisations campaigning to combat domestic violence of the funding they need.</p></speech>

Listening to news reports these days, one will know that incidence of the virus is still at a very dangerous level throughout Europe.  At this summit, questions have to be raised about this whole area and an emphasis must be laid on the production, manufacture and distribution of vaccines.  Health systems across all of Europe need predictability in supply.  They cannot plan for vaccination programmes if there is doubt with regard to supply.  The citizens of the EU need a clear outline of the preparations being made to ensure an adequate vaccine programme is rolled out.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has questions to answer at the highest level.  When did it commence its purchasing and procurement programme and what is its strategy?  Why were agreements to deliver to the EU first not made with pharmaceutical companies?  Some of these companies have shown very bad faith in the way in which they have dealt with Europe so far.  Another question which needs to be answered or addressed is whether the EU has facilitated or, more importantly, ensured increased manufacturing capacity for these pharmaceutical products?  Everything points to the world facing different variants of this virus for some time to come.  We need short-term and medium-term planning to deal with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The EU cannot be accused of vaccine nationalism while it has allowed massive exports of vaccines to outside countries.  Indeed, it is preferable and essential to ensure the EU gets at least its fair share of vaccines.  I fully appreciate that, as the Taoiseach has said, supply chains have to be protected.  I do not believe in trade disruption.  Nobody benefits from it and the most vulnerable suffer the most.  However, I also believe that we, as EU citizens, need to get the best possible protection from this deadly virus.  We therefore need our leaders at EU level to ensure an adequate supply of vaccine and that the vaccine programme is given impetus and is rolled out more quickly.  All of us have spoken to constituents who have had the vaccine administered to them.  We have seen how much it has changed their lives and outlooks.</p>  <p>  I will mention one further issue.  I am sure that, in the discussions with President Biden on EU-US relationships, Brexit will come up.  It is absolutely essential the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is implemented in a practical manner and there is partnership with Britain to ensure the difficulties that exist are ironed out in a practical manner.  Trade disruption in Northern Ireland means trade disruption throughout all of the island.  We need to protect the all-Ireland economy.  It is essential the Northern Ireland protocol is dealt with in a practical way and those problems are eliminated.</p></speech>

Aviation is at its lowest point of all time.  It is very hard to see a recovery over the next 12 to 18 months.  Some people say it could even take three years for the sector to recover fully.  In recent days, we have seen the UK Government already start planning what its summer and its summer of international travel may look like.  We need a Europe-wide plan.  It took many months last year for European nations to devise and agree upon the traffic light system for international travel.  We now need to move at a far greater pace with the digital green certificate.</p>  <p>  There are three types of certificate involved.  The Minister of State has been forthright and good in advancing the Irish cause.  There is the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certification of Covid recovery.  This is the only way in which people will have confidence to board planes again as they will know the passengers in front of, behind and beside them are Covid free, that it is safe to travel and that they will not be bringing Covid from one country to another.</p>  <p>  People will say we are at peak Covid or just a shade below it.  Some will even say we are about to head into a fourth wave of Covid.  Some of that may be true.  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will advise us on that but the fact remains we need to strategise now for what the coming months will look like.  We may be at a very high level of Covid and may not be able to move outside 5 km of our homes, but people need to be able to dream and to plan and hope for a future this summer that involves being able to go beyond our shores and people being able to come in from other countries.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to advance this issue in discussions in Europe.  Now is the time to deliver this agreement.  Now may not be the time to implement it, but perhaps the time will be right in a few weeks, so we need to get it in place.</p>  <p>  A lot of the people who work in the aviation sector have to remain in current training.  This includes pilots and cabin crew.  They need a lead-in period.  They need governments to show them a plan to which they can sign up to.</p>  <p>  Finally, when he is in Europe, I ask the Minister of State to raise the idea of European governments buying stakes in the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Covid vaccines.  We have seen how the Norwegian Government has, time and again, taken stakes of up to 5% in private companies.  EU states need to look at this to gain some collateral in the large companies manufacturing the vaccines.</p></speech>

One of the most important things in the post-Covid world will be the financial response of the European Union and the eurozone to this crisis.  After the 2008 international financial meltdown, we pursued a policy of extreme austerity for ordinary citizens across the Continent of Europe.  This really hit home here in Ireland.  We cannot afford to do that to another generation of young Irish people and young Europeans.  It would be grossly unfair to a generation of individuals facing circumstances unlike any faced by any generation before them.  I stress that message.  I have a lot of faith in the Minister of State.  I believe he is very clever and has exceptional skills from his time working and studying.  I have every confidence he could relay that message to his European colleagues.  We cannot afford for European policies in respect of the financial response to Covid-19 to force another generation of young Irish people to the departure gates.  It would be an enormous failure on the part of this State and the part of the 27 member states of the European Union.</p>  <p>  We have to remember the damage done to governments across the European Union when we pursued these policies.  They caused a significant rise in very unstable political circumstances in what are normally very stable democracies.  We saw the rise of the far right and the far left, which is obviously of extreme concern.  Our financial response to the implications of Covid-19 is one of the single largest challenges the European bloc will face in the near future.</p></speech>

We are all worried about any chance of legal action with regard to the supply of vaccines or vaccine ingredients.  We all recognise that, as Dr. Ursula von der Leyen has stated, mistakes were made with regard to vaccine procurement.  There is an issue.  We are all aware that 41 million doses have made their way out of the European Union, including 10 million doses for Britain and 1 million for the US, while nothing has come back into the European Union.  We know there is a specific difficulty in respect of AstraZeneca.  It is fair to say the company has engaged in fly-boy capitalism and needs to be called out and brought to account.</p> <p>I accept that everything has to be on the table when it comes to a set of tools for the European Commission to do that.  However, the fact is we need a solution to this issue and we do not need a legal trade war with unintended consequences.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that there will be an opportunity to engage with the European Commission and possibly with US President Biden on the wider issue of vaccine supply.  A conversation is needed with the European Commission to the effect that the Government has a part to play in a wider conversation with the pharmaceutical industry to see what capacity there is on a worldwide basis to up the production of vaccines.  Everything has to be on the table, including intellectual property rights.</p> <p> I accept there is a cost factor to this, particularly for the so-called developed world.  We are hearing figures from &euro;25 billion to &euro;40 billion to vaccinate the developed world and that this will be a cost that will largely need to be borne by the developed world.  That is the cost of doing business.  There are other figures out there for what it would cost if not everybody throughout the world was vaccinated.  That would allow for strains to arise and to be imported.  The difficulty is that we need to ensure we miss nothing in capacity.</p> <p> I ask that the Minister of State come back to us on what conversations have happened, what information the Government has, what information the European Commission has and what engagements the European Commission has had with the entire pharma industry from the point of view of ensuring we are maximising supply.  Everything has to be on the table because we are talking about a cost across the globe of anything from &euro;1 trillion to &euro;9 trillion.  That is knockout stuff and it is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister of State to give us an update now and to provide a further update following the conversations with the European Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400042#PP00200"><p>There are a number of issues I would like the Government to raise at the forthcoming European Council meeting.  The first and most important one is that of the roll-out of the Covid vaccination.  As the Government knows but will not admit, we are way behind in getting vaccinations administered to the public.  We need help now from our European colleagues to increase the number of vaccines we are receiving.  What we are getting is simply not enough.</p>  <p>  I saw a statistic over the weekend that showed that on the previous Sunday we administered just over 300 vaccinations, while the UK broke its record again by administering over 800,000 vaccinations on the same day.  This statistic beggars belief.  The numbers speak for themselves.  More than 27 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine.  That is more than half the population.  Yet here in Ireland the latest figures show that just over 490,000 people have received their first dose of the vaccine and only just over 180,000 have received both doses.  From our point of view, it gets even worse when we look at the figures from Northern Ireland.  As of 18 March 2021, more than 710,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered in the North of Ireland.  This has resulted in a transmission rate of just over 58 cases per 100,000, while in the South our rate of infection is currently 148 cases per 100,000.</p>  <p>  The Government must realise there is something seriously wrong.  I have said consistently that we need to take an all-island approach to this pandemic and it is clear that we are not doing so.  The result of this is simple.  The North will come out of lockdown much quicker than in the South and this will result in much greater problems down the road.  The solution is simple.  We need more vaccines now.</p>  <p>  I urge the Government to make the strongest possible case at the European Council meeting.  There is no point saying after the meeting that additional vaccines are not available.  I note that after the Taoiseach spoke with US President Biden recently, he said that there were no spare vaccines available.  Yet the following day, the USA signed deals with Mexico and Canada to supply them with their surplus vaccines.  We cannot allow this to happen with our European colleagues.</p>  <p>  The public are growing tired and weary at this stage.  So many people have made great sacrifices and many have paid the ultimate price.  We need to support these people.  I am disappointed in the lack of clarity in the message the Government is putting out.  I am inundated with calls from constituents asking for information about the vaccines and when they will get them.  The Government needs to be more transparent and clear in its messages.  It can start by demanding more vaccines from Europe as a matter of urgency.  I ask that the Government to make the strongest possible case that the requirement for additional vaccines is critical at this stage and that more help is needed from our colleagues in Europe.</p>  <p>  On the Single Market, I urge the Government to make a strong case that the effects of Brexit are every bit as bad as we had all feared.  We were given assurances that the Northern Ireland protocol would protect not only the North but also the South from the effects of Brexit.  Sadly, this is not proving to be the case.  We are seeing the rising tensions in the North on the Northern Ireland protocol, particularly from the unionist side.  I understand that the Government must support Europe in this regard but it is vital that Europe understands the particular difficulties that we face on the island of Ireland as a result of Brexit.  Can the Government get assurances from our European colleagues that the Northern Ireland protocol will continue to be supported and that they will do everything in their power to put as much pressure on the UK Government to honour the agreements made under the Northern Ireland protocol?</p>  <p>  On the bigger picture of the EU Single Market, can the Government make the case and outline the importance of the lower corporation tax rate in Ireland and the importance it has to the continued growth of our economy?  We constantly hear of other European counties, particularly France and Germany, which see this as an advantage Ireland should not have and they make the point that we in Ireland have an unfair advantage in this regard.  Will the Government confirm to the House that it will fully support and defend our right to continue to support companies that choose Ireland as their base?  Again we hear many reports that these companies are paying very little in tax yet when we look at the figures this simply does not add up.  On top of this, we must not forget the thousands of people who are employed by these companies as well as the contribution they make through their taxes and PRSI contributions.</p>  <p>  I once more urge the Government to impress on our European colleagues the urgent need to increase the supply of vaccines to us.  We simply cannot be left behind in this process and end up playing catch-up in the reopening of our society and economy.  As I have already said, people have grown tired and weary at this stage.  The Government must now give the people some ray of hope and it can start by securing additional vaccines from our European colleagues.  This process must start immediately and at the forthcoming European Council meeting.</p></speech>

I want to pivot away from speaking about this in just the European context and to talk about the moral imperative that rests on us to show solidarity with low and middle-income countries.  In the words of Dr. Tedros, the head of the WHO:</p> <blockquote> 	I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries. </blockquote>  <p>Measures of progress on the sustainable development goals estimate that we have seen about a decade of progress on eradicating poverty wiped out by this pandemic.  Dr. Mike Ryan said that Covid-19 has served as an amplifier of global inequities and global injustice and has further highlighted how intrinsically linked health and human rights are.  Many of the countries I am speaking about have little or no ICU or even bed capacity, leaving their hospital staff with no choice but to turn away people in desperate need of help.  The well used phrase, &ldquo;Nobody is safe until we are all safe&rdquo;, has never been as true as when we talk about developing and distributing vaccines around the world.  This should be a key pillar of any discussion among our leaders about the Covid vaccine at the European Council meeting this weekend.</p><p>Ireland is well placed to champion any and all options that maximise the development and distribution of vaccines for those very countries.  This is not just about a moral imperative.  It is also in our interest to ensure that as many people as possible are safe.  We are already seeing the disruptions caused by coronavirus variants.  This will only worsen if we enter into vaccine escape.  We need to take full advantage of the facilities across the world to develop and deliver vaccines.</p> <p>A number of international initiatives aim to enact global solidarity against Covid-19.  Today marks one year since the WHO launched its ACT-Accelerator, the leading programme to tackle Covid-19 and speed up the global distribution of vaccines.  </p> <p> I am proud that our Government has supported and contributed to such initiatives, including Irish Aid&rsquo;s &euro;4 million funding for the COVAX facility and through our work in the UN Security Council, which unanimously agreed a resolution to strengthen international co-operation such as the ACT-Accelerator and within that, the COVAX facility.  Even these efforts will fall far short of what is needed, and the virus will remain rampant in many parts of the world with a risk of vaccine escape.  We are seeing campaigns spring up in reaction to the very practical barriers that are preventing low- and middle-income countries from using their own facilities to develop the vaccine.  These barriers mainly relate to knowledge and data, intellectual property and appropriate technology.  </p> <p> One initiative seeking to address these barriers is the Covid technology access pool, C-TAP, launched by the Government of Costa Rica and the WHO, a voluntary programme for sharing knowledge, data and intellectual property.  Another initiative from the governments of India and South Africa calls for a temporary waiver through the WTO of the intellectual property protections of the vaccine, an initiative commonly referred to as the trade-related aspects of intellectual property, TRIPS, waiver.  This idea is gaining support, with more than 57 countries in the WTO co-sponsoring it.  While solutions are rarely as straightforward as they seem, I believe it is fundamental that we continue to look at these options and find ways to empower vulnerable countries to do more for their people.  </p> <p> Internationally this country is good at partnerships.  The very essence of partnership is working together, not just making donations and handing out spare vaccines, crumbs from the table.  Ireland is well-placed, and the EU can do much more to demonstrate this international solidarity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400043#QQ00200"><p>In advance of the European Council meeting I want to speak about the Covid-19 vaccine programme and specifically the AstraZeneca vaccine.  This morning 29 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were found in a warehouse in Italy.  They appear to have come from the AstraZeneca Halix plant in the Netherlands, which is yet to be approved by the EU as a manufacturing facility.  Furthermore, it appears they were bound for the UK and not the EU.  AstraZeneca must be called out on that.  How did that happen?  How did they come from a manufacturing facility that was not approved?  How did they find their way to Italy?  How were these 29 million vaccines destined for the UK, which represents one third of the UK's order from AstraZeneca of 100 million?</p>  <p>  I have had an opportunity to look at the two contracts, the EU's contract and the UK's contract with AstraZeneca.  They are very different contracts.  Ironically, the UK contract appears to have been dated the day after the EU contract was signed - the EU one on the 27th and the UK one on the 28th - and yet they are completely different.  The UK contract specifically defines the supply line for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Schedule 2 on page 48 of the UK agreement outlines the UK supply chain.  It specifies three manufacturing facilities for the drug substance and two manufacturing facilities for the drug product, which I expect refers to the vials.  Furthermore clause 4.1 of the contract states that AstraZeneca shall ensure that its affiliates shall not use any other facilities beyond those listed in schedule 2.  However, paragraph 5.4 of the EU agreement just refers to best reasonable efforts to manufacture the vaccine at a manufacturing site located within the EU which, for the purposes of section 5.4 only, shall include the UK.  However, it does not mention specific manufacturing sites.  That needs to be clarified.  On anything relating to making orders, AstraZeneca's should be called out and the UK needs to define where the manufacturing facilities are.  </p>  <p>  Based on the contracts and what we hear in reports, it seems that the EU is paying &pound;3 per dose and the EU appears to be paying &pound;1.61, which is approximately half the price.  Furthermore, the UK appears to be able to revoke the contract whereas the EU may only withhold payments.  How did it arise that the UK contract was signed after the European contract?  I would have thought the contracts should have been common.  They should be absolutely down the middle.  We are trying to deal with a world pandemic.  This company was funded by EU taxpayers' money to do research with AstraZeneca.</p>  <p>  It is stockpiling and carrying vaccines across borders undercover from a plant in the Netherlands not approved by the EU to a warehouse in Italy destined for the UK effectively without informing the EU of what it is doing.  That is not acceptable and must be called out.  One really would question the motives of AstraZeneca in this matter.  This entire matter needs to be clarified.  There needs to be commonality of treatment for European citizens, including Irish citizens, as well as UK citizens regarding the Covid-19 vaccine.</p></speech>

She also stressed the importance of tests and contact tracing.  According to the Commissioner, tests are particularly important for member states that start reopening after lockdown.  The Commissioner also mentioned that more than 20 million rapid antigen test kits were bought and are to be delivered by April using &euro;100 million from the emergency support instrument, the Commission's financial aid to member states to address the Covid emergency.</p>  <p>  Another way to increase testing capacity is by using self-tests.  Some countries have started to use them.  What has the Government done to seek access to the emergency support instrument so the testing for Covid-19 can be ramped up in the coming weeks?  What efforts are being made in Ireland to roll out the self-testing option, which has been advocated by the EU Commission?  Why has there been no talk of this procedure here, which could assist certain sectors of the economy to reopen?</p>  <p>  Ireland's handling of an application for emergency EU funds has been completely shambolic.  Ireland has been in full lockdown for almost 200 days.  Ireland's unemployment rate is at 25% and our vaccine roll-out is floundering.  The level of support being offered to small and medium-sized companies is the lowest in the EU.  The country's childcare, tourism, hospitality, aviation and entertainment sectors are on the verge of complete collapse.  This week the Restaurants Association of Ireland warned the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht that 50% of restaurants will never reopen following the impact of the lockdown.  </p>  <p>  Europe needs to wake up and we need to be strong to let it know that.  I see vaccines being manufactured in Europe and given to non-European countries first.  Having heard that Europe is considering blocking vaccines going from Europe to the UK, the UK leader, Boris Johnson, for the first time is asking for us all to work together.  Why did he not ask that during Brexit?  He did not give a damn about us.  We see his co-operation, kindness and sweetness to us now all of a sudden when he realises that maybe we have one bit of a power hold over him.  It is time for us to step in and ensure that happens.  It is time for Europe to get tough.  Our country is closed for business and we are laggards in the roll-out of the vaccine.</p></speech>

I note what the European Commissioner said.  We have been feeble and inept in applying for funding.  Our small and medium-sized businesses have suffered more than anybody else.  We have received the second lowest level of EU supports; of the 27 member states, only one is behind us.  We are getting crumbs from the table.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the Taoiseach could not stay and listen to all our views this afternoon.  We need to take leadership in this debate.  We have had no leadership whatsoever.  We need to stand up and speak up.  We need to lead our people and give them some hope because they have absolutely no hope.</p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel has decided today that the lockdown plan for Easter should be cancelled and she accepted responsibility for it because she said it would not work.</p> <p>The WHO said lockdowns will not work.  We have had lockdown in Ireland for 200 days.  It is penal.  We all know what has happened with respect to the clergy even though the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, said in the House that there would be no penal summons.  It is shameful how we are treating our people.  They need to go back to work and school and to be allowed to live.  We must take a leaf from Ms Merkel's book.  We need to do more testing.</p> <p> There is a recovery fund of &euro;750 million available.  We need to apply for it and to get our fair share of it, not crumbs.  We need to insist on more testing and to allow people to work and live with Covid.  I sympathise with those who lost their lives, but people are weary, frustrated, angry and beyond boiling point with the ineptitude and messages every night from Dr. De Gascun and Dr. Ronan Glynn, who are household names now.  They roll out the messaging through RT&Eacute;.  It is media propaganda to frighten the people.  It is akin to the "To Hell and or to Connacht" that we had here during Cromwell's time.  The way this Government has treated our people is shameful.  There is a dearth of democracy.  There is no democratic accountability.  NPHET is running the country.  Since the Taoiseach took office, what NPHET says goes.  If it says jump, the Taoiseach says "How high?", and all the members of Government are nodding behind him and backing him up.</p> <p> Ministers need to go to Europe and get us our fair share of the vaccines and our fair share of what we need from Europe rather than pandering to Europe and being good Europeans.  I call for an end to the lockdown.  It is terrorising our people.  Let the people live.  I call for common sense and engagement with the Opposition leaders, who have not met with the Taoiseach since last November.  We have been shut out of the process.  As I said, there is a democratic deficit.  There is a lack of democracy and accountability to this House or, by extension, to the people.  It is shameful.  It is shambolic and it is time it changed because people will not accept this for much longer.</p></speech>

I have only two and a half minutes so I will focus on three topics.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is to come back to us on one item on the agenda for the Council meeting, namely, relations with Turkey.  Does he propose to raise the unilateral withdrawal of Turkey from the Istanbul Convention?  We are ten years on from signing it, which we struggled to do and had to be prompted to do.  It is took us some time to ratify that convention and now Turkey has unilaterally withdrawn from it, with no discussion in Parliament at a time when the figures there on domestic violence and violence generally against women have risen astronomically.</p>  <p>  I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed speech but there was an absence of any reference to Myanmar, formerly Burma.  Will that issue be raised in Europe?  As we speak, the figures are frightening.  As of 22 March, 261 people, including children, are confirmed to have been killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 2,682 people, and rising, have been arrested, and a total of 2,302 are still under detention.  Restriction of time prevents me going on.  There is a very serious situation in Myanmar, as the Minister of State will know.  I profess that I have a conflict in the sense that when I was Mayor of Galway, we gave Aung San Suu Kyi freedom of the city, which has since been taken from her.  There is an intimate connection between Myanmar and Ireland.  Myanmar secured its freedom in 1948, when we declared a Republic which became operational the following year.  I ask the Minister of State to make reference to that in his concluding remarks.</p>  <p>  On Cuba, I understand it is developing five vaccines and that one will be ready in July.  Has it occurred to the Government to think outside of the box and look to Cuba, an island that has been subjected to what I would regard as an illegal trade embargo for a long time, and yet has managed to keep the death rate from Covid at 0.6% and is developing vaccines?  I ask the Minister of State to address those three issues in his speech.</p></speech>

I would like to ascertain in advance of the Council meeting, and again following the meeting, what the Government's position is in that regard.  It seems to me the Government is, at best, lukewarm if not outright opposed to it.</p></speech>

Currently, Irish people are criminalised for leaving the country.  That is not unique in Europe, but I would expect it will be unique in Europe as the summer rolls on and plans are being put in place for people to travel safely.  Last year, people in Ireland believed they were prevented from leaving the country by guidelines, but they were not.  Social welfare recipients particularly were penalised.  There was a restriction to the right of freedom of movement and that restriction was not pursuant to the law as is required by European law, and so it failed at the first hurdle without ever looking at the proportionality of the matter.</p>  <p>  Across Europe, rights can be restricted on the basis of public health, but those restrictions have to be proportionate and necessary.  In Ireland, churches and all religious denominations are closed.  This morning, the Supreme Court in Scotland said it was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights as it was disproportionate to close the churches.  If it is disproportionate in Scotland, it is disproportionate in Ireland because we are bound by the same convention.  If Ireland is the only country in Europe where churches are closed, if we are the only country in Europe that is stopping people exercising freedom of movement, if we are the only country in Europe with half of our shops closed and the only country in Europe effectively locking people into their homes, then I suggest it is disproportionate.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach of this State said on radio in response to a question that we live in a liberal democracy.  Either he does not know what a liberal democracy is or the man is deluded.  I suspect it is the latter.  He promised that he would govern as a republican when he was elected Taoiseach.  There are many republican traditions, one of which is the tradition of Oliver Cromwell.  It is in that republican tradition he and the Government are currently governing.  Coming from Drogheda, the Minister of State, will be quite well aware of what the republican tradition of Oliver Cromwell is all about.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has asked me to speak on certain points.  It is traditional that after the European Council meeting I come here to answer questions, but I am happy to clarify some issues.</p>  <p>  We spoke on a number of issues at the General Affairs Council this week, including, for example, the digital green certificate.  It is not correct for Members to say the Government is opposed to it when the Taoiseach said here today that the Government is working on it and it supports the proposal.  That is what the Taoiseach said.  It is wrong of Members to come into the Chamber an hour later and misinterpret what he said.</p></speech>

It is an important proposal.  The Taoiseach wants to make sure we can do all of the work that is necessary on the technical side to ensure its availability, initially for medical purposes, but let us see where that goes.</p></speech>

That clears up that issue.</p>  <p>  On the Istanbul Convention, which was helpfully raised by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Barry, again, we have issued a strong statement on that matter through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  Also, at the General Affairs Council this week it was raised under any other business where everybody agreed to condemn the disgraceful decision by the Turkish Government to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention.  It is outrageous.</p> <p>Not only is the Istanbul Convention associated with Turkey in respect of its place of signing but Turkey was a party to it.  For that country to take such a retrograde step on the convention is absolutely outrageous.  That is the clear position of the Government and I share the concerns of Deputies Barry and Connolly in this regard.</p> <p> In regard to vaccinations, Deputy Connolly referred to Cuba and Deputy McDonald to Russia.  It might be helpful for me to talk about the contracts that have been agreed by the EU.  At the moment, there are four vaccines approved for use in the EU, namely, Pfizer, which is doing a fantastic job in getting supply out, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  I understand that CureVac and Sanofi are at the closest stage to approval and there are other vaccines, such as Novavax, in respect of which contract discussions are under way.  In addition, the European Medicines Agency is looking at the Sputnik V vaccine.  Everybody wants to find easy solutions to the issue of vaccines but there are no easy solutions.  Based on what Professor Brian MacCraith and the European Commission have said, particularly Commissioner Thierry Breton, who is a businessman and is currently going around Europe to answer the question Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; put by looking at everything and making sure every last facility is used to produce vaccines, we can safely say that vaccine supply is going to ramp up massively in quarter 2, which begins next week.  Professor MacCraith is on the public record as saying that a huge delivery will come in next Wednesday.</p> <p> In regard to what AstraZeneca is doing, we believe it has acted disgracefully in its dealings with the European Commission.  I do not know the exact position with the vaccines in Italy.  The situation is certainly disputed very strongly between the Commission and AstraZeneca.  When we talk about those vaccines going to Britain, we should not forget that they are also pumping up the Northern Ireland vaccine strategy.  For these and other obvious trade reasons, we have not advocated a ban on exports, as the Taoiseach very eloquently and sensibly outlined.  There is too much at stake in the interaction between member states and trade.</p> <p> The Taoiseach has gone through the issues that will be raised at the Council meeting and I have tried to outline some of those issues in a very general way.  EU leaders will take the opportunity at the meeting to discuss a number of external relations issues.  The focus this week will be on the EU's relations with Russia and Turkey.  In regard to Russia, because the meeting is being conducted by videoconference, that discussion will be taken as an information point only.  It is not expected on this occasion that there will be a detailed discussion on Russia.  Since 2016, the EU's engagement with Russia has been guided by five principles.  Implementation of the Minsk agreements in regard to the conflict in Ukraine is the key condition of any substantial change in the EU's stance towards Russia.  The other principles are closer ties with our former Soviet neighbours, strengthening EU resilience to Russian threats, selective engagement with Russia where this is in the EU's interest and increased support for people-to-people contacts and Russian civil society as a whole.</p> <p> We fully support the approach taken by the Union towards Russia.  EU relations with that country have been the subject of regular discussions at the Council in recent years.  When they met on 1 and 2 September last year, EU leaders condemned the assassination attempt on Alexei Navalny.  I urge some on the left in Irish political life to join in that condemnation.  Since then, things have worsened.  Mr. Navalny's imprisonment and the harsh treatment of protesters following his return to Russia, as well as developments such as the foreign agents law, have given rise to even greater concerns about the human rights situation and shrinking civil society space in Russia.  It is important, therefore, that our strategic relationship with Russia remains on the European Council agenda.  There will be an opportunity for detailed discussion among leaders when they meet in person in due course.</p> <p> The EU's foreign affairs Ministers, including the Minister, Deputy Coveney, discussed relations with Russia when they met in February and again when they met earlier this week.  Ireland's position then, as now, is that there can be no substantial improvement in EU-Russia relations until we see the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements in regard to the conflict in Ukraine.  EU sanctions against Russia in respect of Ukraine continue to be applied.  In December, leaders endorsed a new EU global human rights sanctions regime and Ireland supports the use of this regime against Russia in light of the serious violations of human rights that have taken place there.  At the same time, of course, we need to engage selectively on issues of shared importance and responsibility such as climate change, the Arctic and global health challenges.  We need to enhance people-to-people contacts and, more broadly, strengthen our engagement with eastern partnership countries as part of our overall strategic focus and in line with the five principles approach.</p> <p> In regard to the Sputnik V vaccine, the Government has been very clear that if the vaccine is approved by the EMA and can be manufactured, we have no difficulty with it.  However, we certainly are not going to provide a vaccine that has not been approved.  Members should also note that the roll-out of the vaccine in Russia has been incredibly slow and is way behind what we have achieved in this country.  In addition, in many countries in eastern Europe, it has caused political consternation when the vaccine has been introduced, particularly because it has not yet been authorised by the EMA.</p> <p> EU relations with Turkey and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean have been a recurring item on the European Council agenda in recent years and leaders will return to those issues this week.  It was agreed in December to consider this item in light of a report to be prepared by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles.  The report was published on 20 March and was considered by EU foreign Ministers when they met on Monday.  In December, EU leaders made clear that a positive political EU-Turkey agenda was on offer provided Turkey adopted a more constructive approach towards Greece and Cyprus.  From Ireland's perspective, it seems that Turkey has taken a more constructive approach in recent months, particularly in regard to the withdrawal of research vessels to port from disputed waters near Greece and from the Cypriot exclusive economic zone.  In these circumstances, it could be appropriate for the EU to send a positive signal to Turkey on the steps that can be expected if its constructive approach continues.</p> <p> However, the issue with the Istanbul Convention, on which I have commented, certainly is a difficulty.  The Taoiseach will be keen to hear the views of Greece and Cyrus on recent developments.  Our solidarity is always with them as the EU countries most directly affected by Turkey's actions.  We have always shown solidarity with them, as they have done with us, including, for example, throughout the Brexit process.</p> <p> I welcome the stated intention of the Commission to prepare options rapidly for continued funding for refugees and host communities in Turkey.  Ten years on from the start of the war in Syria, we cannot forget the people driven from their homes by that terrible conflict.</p> <p> It is appropriate that what is proposed now in respect of Turkey is an incremental approach.  All options should be kept on the table.  There are grounds to hope that this week can mark the beginning of more positive and co-operative relations between the EU and Turkey.  It will not happen overnight.  It might happen in time and, with good will, it will bring benefits to both.</p> <p> I thank Members for their engagement in this debate.  The Taoiseach will report to the House following the European Council meeting.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I will endeavour to answer Deputies' questions arising out of that meeting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400046#VV00100"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased to be in a position to bring forward the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021.  As Deputies know, the Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad and has been renamed the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021.  The Short Title has been changed to accommodate the Government amendments to the Bill that are for the purpose of amending the Judicial Council Act 2019 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 in respect of personal injuries guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council.  The Bill will help fulfil several commitments in the programme for Government, including extending paid parent's leave and providing adoptive leave for male same-sex adoptive couples.</p><p>The Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021 has several elements.  The first is to amend the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to extend the entitlements to parent's leave for each parent of a qualifying child from two to five weeks and to provide for this leave to be taken within two years of the child's birth or adoptive placement.  Covid-19 has had a serious impact across society and working parents, especially those who have had children during the pandemic and who have borne a heavy burden, often without the support of family and friends.  The extension to parent's leave and benefit is intended to provide them with an additional period of leave to spend with their children.  An important facet of parent's leave is to encourage the sharing of the childcare role.  I hope that this additional period of leave will support and encourage fathers in taking a more prominent role in the care of their young children.  I am aware that many parents have been awaiting the provision of this additional leave since it was announced as part of the budgetary process and I am happy that I am now in a position to take this legislation forward and make the necessary legislative changes.</p><p>The Bill also amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to enable adoptive couples to choose which parent may avail of adoptive leave.  In doing so, this will rectify an anomaly in the current legislation which left married male same-sex couples unable to avail of adoptive leave.  The proposals will also remove the presumption that the adoptive mother be the primary caregiver and permit families to choose the best option for their family.  Currently the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 provides for an entitlement to 24 weeks of leave for an employed adoptive mother or single adoptive father.  The 24 weeks start from the date the child is placed in the adopting parent's care.  An adoptive benefit is available to qualified parents.  An additional 16 weeks may also be taken but the adoptive benefit is not available for that period.</p><p>This Bill provides for all adopting couples, same-sex and opposite-sex, to be able to choose which of the couple should be able to take the adoptive leave.  The new provisions would enable either the adopting mother or the adopting father to be eligible to take adoptive leave once the choice has been made by the couple.  The parent who does not avail of adoptive leave is entitled to paternity leave.  This is a significant amendment for married male same-sex adoptive couples who were excluded from availing of this leave due to a legislative anomaly.  I am happy that we can now rectify this situation.</p><p>A further amendment made by this Bill is to the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to provide for an increase in the number of ordinary members of the board of the Child and Family Agency from seven to nine and for a number of consequential amendments.  The board of Tusla is tasked with overseeing the appropriate, efficient and effective use of resources with the aim of ensuring that the State meets its obligations to the safety, protection, well-being and resilience of children, families and communities in Ireland.  The members of the board are collectively responsible for leading and directing Tusla's activities within a framework of prudent and effective control as set out in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies 2016.  The work of the Tusla board places an extraordinary demand on the personal time of board members, who have to exercise a degree of flexibility to carry out board functions.  The committees of the board have substantial workloads and can be rendered inquorate in the absence of a member.  An increase in the ordinary members of the board will facilitate the work of the board.</p><p>The Bill also includes amendments passed by the Seanad which amend the Judicial Council Act 2019 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.  Deputies will be aware that the Judicial Council adopted personal injuries guidelines earlier this month which catalogue the level of damages it considers might fairly and justly be awarded in respect of varying types of personal injury.  I am pleased to note that these were introduced nearly five months ahead of the statutory deadline of 31 July this year.  These amendments provide for the manner in which the transition is made in the courts and by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board from the use of the book of quantum to the new personal injury guidelines.  Deputies will be aware that the guidelines reduce several personal injury awards and the guidelines are a cornerstone of the Government's plan to tackle high insurance costs.  The Government wishes to bring these into effect at the earliest possible date but also in an equitable manner.  The courts will use the guidelines for personal injury proceedings from the operative date of the measures except proceedings arising from an assessment already made by the board before the section comes into operation.  The board, from the operative date, will stop using the book of quantum and instead will use the guidelines when assessing claims.  It is fair to allow claims that have been assessed and those actions that have already been commenced before the courts to continue to be determined with reference to the book of quantum.  Any claims before the board which have not yet been assessed will be assessed having regard to the guidelines.  The book of quantum will no longer apply, ensuring an imminent impact.</p><p>Overall, the commencement arrangements have been considered from two viewpoints.  These include the urgency of reform to tackle high insurance costs and fairness for those who have suffered injury as well as those who are required to defend a claim.  I believe we have the correct balance.  The Minister for Justice will make the necessary commencement orders, one of which arises under this Bill and one under the Judicial Council Act, as soon as practicable after the enactment of the Bill.</p><p>I will now outline the main provisions.  Part 2 provides for the amendment of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 with section 5 replacing references to &quot;adoptive mother&quot; and &quot;single male adopter&quot; with a new definition for &quot;qualifying adopter&quot;, which is:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;(a) where a child is placed, or is to be placed, in the care of a couple (of whom neither is the mother or father of the child), with a view to the making of an adoption order, or to the effecting of a foreign adoption or following any such adoption, the member of the couple who is&mdash;  	(i) an employee, and<br /><br />(ii) chosen by the couple to be the qualifying adopter for the purposes of this Act, (b)in any other case, an employee, who is not a surviving parent in relation to the child, in whose care a child has been placed or is to be placed with a view to the making of an adoption order, or to the effecting of a foreign adoption or following any such adoption&quot;. </blockquote>  <p>In practice, this means that adoptive couples may choose which of the couple avail of adoptive leave, regardless of gender.  This will remove any presumptions as regards the gender of the primary caregiver.  Section 5 also provides for definitions of &quot;qualifying adopter&quot;, &quot;surviving parent&quot; and &quot;adopting parent&quot;, which give effect to the proposals as set out above.  Section 6 provides for the adoptive parent to have an entitlement to paternity leave if not availing of adoptive leave, which is also set out in Part 7.</p><p>Part 3 inserts a definition of &quot;adopting parent&quot; into the Parental Leave Act 1998.  Part 4 provides for the consequential amendments required to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide for the payment of the relevant benefits as a result of the proposed changes in this Bill, including their extension to the self-employed.</p><p>Part 5 amends the Child and Family Agency Act to provide for an increase in the number of ordinary members of the Tusla board and for consequential amendments.  The Tusla board currently comprises a chairperson, a deputy chairperson and seven ordinary members.  Under the provisions of the Bill the number of ordinary members will increase to nine.</p><p>Part 6 provides for amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 consequential to the provisions of Part 2 of the Bill.  Part 7 amends the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 to provide for an entitlement to paternity leave for the parent not availing of adoptive leave and amends the definition of &quot;relevant parent&quot; to reflect the proposed amendments in Part 2.</p><p>Part 8 amends the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to provide for an extension of the entitlement to parent's leave and benefit for each qualifying parent from two weeks to five weeks and to extend the period in which parent's leave can be taken to not later than two years after the birth or adoptive placement of the child.  This Part also amends the definition of &quot;relevant parent&quot; to provide for entitlement to parent's leave and benefit to an adoptive parent or parents and the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.</p><p>Part 9 amends the Judicial Council Act 2019 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 to provide for the operation of personal injuries guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council and to provide for related matters.  The Schedule sets out the consequential amendments to the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 which are a necessary consequence of the amendments in Part 2.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the provisions of this Bill and I thank them for facilitating it being debated as a priority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400047#WW00100"><p>I welcome this legislation and, in particular, the long-awaited increase of three weeks per parent of parent's leave and benefit.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge and commend the work of the Extend Maternity Leave campaign group, which has fought hard for additional supports for parents, in particular new ones, since Covid hit this time last year.  When debating this legislation, it is important to acknowledge all of the parents who had a baby before or during Covid and who have been left in a difficult situation.  They have not had the level of support from family and friends that would normally have been available to them.  Parents, and mothers particularly, have faced significant difficulties at the end of their maternity leave.  They have been put in the position of having to choose between taking unpaid parental leave, which was the only option in many cases, or returning to work and leaving their babies, who were just six or seven months old in some cases, with a minder.  On top of all of that, many cr&egrave;ches do not accept children under one year of age.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a number of points about this legislation.  They have already been raised with the Minister, including during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  It is unfortunate that he has not tabled amendments to the Bill.  The points have not been heard or taken on board.</p>  <p>  My first point relates to parents who have a baby through surrogacy.  I was not aware that they were excluded entirely from all paid parental supports until it was brought to my attention by a number of parents in recent weeks.  Having a baby is difficult enough for parents who cannot conceive and go on to choose surrogacy.  Whatever way someone brings a new baby into the world, not to have that entitlement or paid support to spend time with the baby is shameful.  The Minister needs to consider this matter because these parents are being excluded.  That is wrong.</p>  <p>  My next point has been raised by lone parent organisations, including One Family and Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK.  There is an assumption in this legislation that a family has two parents, but that is not always the case.  Like the lone parent organisations, I ask that the lone parent get the entire ten weeks of paid parent's leave.  Whether a baby is born into a family with two parents or one, that baby should not lose out on the additional support from a parent in his or her first year of life.  Will the Minister consider this proposal?</p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue that has been brought to my attention by a mother who had her baby prematurely in October 2019 just before the leave was introduced that November.  Is there any flexibility for parents who should have had their babies from November 2019 onwards but whose babies were born prematurely?  In this case, it was a high-risk pregnancy and birth.  The additional leave would be welcome to parents who had a baby prematurely.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister encourage employers to allow for flexibility around the minimum of six weeks notice that parents have to give in order to take parent's leave and to top up this leave where possible?  People have experienced difficulties in taking up the scheme.  I assume that is because it provides just &euro;245 per week, which is a large drop in income for some workers.</p>  <p>  I wish to reference the EU work-life balance directive, which must be transposed by Ireland by June 2022.  It will allow for nine weeks of parent's leave and benefit.  The budget in October will be the last possible opportunity for the Government to ensure that we meet the directive's obligations.  It will be embarrassing if we do not.  When an additional four weeks of parent's leave is announced in the next budget, we must not have the same delays that we have seen with the scheme so far.  This parent's leave scheme was announced a long time ago and was spoken about last summer, but parents had to wait almost a year for it to be introduced.  There were issues.  For example, systems had to be set up in the Department of Social Protection.  When this badly needed benefit is being introduced, it should be implemented as quickly as possible and the systems should be ready to go.</p></speech>

I will be focusing on sections 30 and 31, which pertain to the new personal injuries guidelines.</p>  <p>  L&eacute; r&oacute;-fhada, t&aacute; na comhlachta&iacute; ar&aacute;chais ag glacadh l&aacute;mh ar chustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; maidir le costais ar&aacute;chais.

Beidh na comhlachta&iacute; ar&aacute;chais ag s&aacute;bh&aacute;il airgead ar chostais.  Beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag moladh go nd&eacute;anfaimid cinnte sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo go mbeidh laghd&uacute; ar chostais ar&aacute;chais do na custaim&eacute;ir&iacute; ar fud an St&aacute;it de bharr an laghd&uacute; costais do chomhlachta&iacute; ar&aacute;chais.</p>  <p>  The personal injuries guidelines were adopted by the Judicial Council on 6 March.  They will replace the book of quantum that has, until now, been used by the courts and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to determine the level of awards for personal injuries.  They are a function of the Judicial Council Act 2019, whose passage through the Houses Sinn F&eacute;in supported and facilitated.  We did so for a clear reason, that being, to provide regularity in the level of personal injury awards and, in so doing, reduce the cost of insurance for motorists, homeowners and businesses.</p>  <p>  Sections 30 and 31 of the Bill provide for the early coming into operation of these guidelines.  Under the sections, the courts will use the new guidelines for all proceedings coming before them from the commencement of section 99 of the Judicial Council Act except in cases where an assessment has already been made by the PIAB and then rejected.  They also provide that the PIAB will use the new guidelines when assessing claims.  That is fair and equitable.</p>  <p>  Since these guidelines were adopted and published, the insurance industry has already begun to backtrack on its commitments to reduce prices for consumers.  That is not acceptable.  The industry cannot be allowed to move the goalposts.  It has tried to do so on spurious grounds using bogus arguments, such as the claim that it will take time for the new guidelines to work through the system.  That is nonsense.  At the finance committee in July 2019, the CEO of Allianz Insurance was crystal clear.  He stated: "when we price insurance, and we are pricing insurance for the next 12 months, we have to set out our premium on the basis of what we expect to happen in terms of the number of claims over that 12-month period."  There we have it.  The basis is not claims in the previous 12 months, but what will happen in the next 12 months.  At the finance committee three months later, the CEO of Zurich Insurance told us that we should expect prices to fall as a result of new guidelines on personal injury awards.  He stated that, if there was a 50% drop in awards for soft tissue personal injuries, "It would be quite reasonable that if that were to happen and insurers had reduced their prices, with all things being equal and somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should ask us a lot of questions."  He told us that we should expect prices to fall by at least 20% in respect of public liability.  That was straight from the horse's mouth.</p>  <p>  These guidelines provide for reductions beyond that.  They go much further than just soft tissue injuries.  We cannot let the insurance industry off the hook.  The new guidelines will significantly reduce the cost of claims for insurance companies.  These savings must be passed on to their customers in the form of lower prices - no ifs, buts or excuses.  The D&aacute;il must hold them to account.  That is why I have tabled an amendment to the Bill for Committee Stage.  It will require the insurance industry to provide information to the Central Bank for each of the next four years detailing how the new guidelines have reduced the cost of claims, what the cost of claims would have been had the new guidelines not come into effect, and how the insurers have passed these savings on to their consumers, with an annual report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Only then would we be able to see not only how these guidelines have reduced the cost of claims, but how and if the insurance industry has passed the savings on to its customers.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to hold the insurance industry to account and will be asking the D&aacute;il to support our amendment on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The Labour Party is delighted the Bill has cross-party support.  It has been eagerly anticipated and it is a good thing that it is finally here.  I can state without qualification that it is a good step to where we need to go in terms of how we approach parental leave and, as a State, respect the need newborn children have for the care of their parents.  It will enable the State to allow parents, as much as it can and in as supportive a way as it can, to dedicate that precious time to their children.  The provisions of the Bill which resolve the anomaly in respect of same-sex male parents are also most welcome.  It is a wonderfully progressive step.  I commend the Minister on bringing that forward.</p>  <p>  However, a matter that needs to be examined is that one-parent families continue to remain outside the discussion in terms of how we deal with parental leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and the whole debate in that regard.  They are still not brought into the tent as much as they ought to be or given the respect that is needed.  My wife and I have one child and I know the challenges involved in being a parent and how difficult it is.  I cannot even comprehend having to do it on my own or my wife having to do it on her own.  The State still needs to play catch-up on that issue.  It is to be hoped that in the not-too-distant future there will be more opportunities for Bills to address it.</p>  <p>  I also wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 introduced by the Labour Party in the Seanad last week.  It addresses the issue of reproductive leave for people who have had early-term miscarriages or are in need of IVF treatment.  This is an area that has not been spoken about.  One could even say it has been taboo.  However, it is an area and an issue that impacts many parents and prospective parents.  In the case of miscarriages, early or otherwise, there are emotional and physical tolls that are unquantifiable and that needs to be reflected in leave and legislation.  I ask the Minister to look at that Bill.  It is to be hoped that the Bill will be up for debate in the Seanad in the next couple of weeks and that we can see progress in that area.</p>  <p>  As a result of the way in which society is structured at the moment and the culture that exists, many people have to delay starting a family in order to dedicate time to their careers.  This particularly affects women.  In order to further their career, they delay starting a family until they reach their mid-30s and that is leading to more people having to go down the IVF route.  However, there is nothing in legislation to reflect that reality.  I have difficulty even finding the right language to speak about this, so I hope I am capturing the issue correctly and striking the right tone because it is something on which we really need to focus.  I refer to the work of Labour Party Dublin City Councillor Alison Gilliland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation on this issue.  The Government really needs to look at that work and build on it because it is another area in which there is a gaping hole.</p>  <p>  Overall, the family leave element of the Bill is positive and a good step forward.  The Labour Party is very happy to support it.  I am sure that when the Minister is looking across the House for Bills and amendments in the next couple of weeks, he will look at Senator Bacik's Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 which deals with this area.</p>  <p>  I refer to the unrelated amendments that were made to the Bill.  I must put on record that it is bad legislative practice for this to have been done.  I know the amendments came from the Minister for Justice, but there have been several justice Bills on the Cl&aacute;r of the D&aacute;il in recent weeks.  There has been ample opportunity to add the provisions contained in the amendments to a justice Bill rather than tacking them onto a family leave Bill such as this one.  It raises questions and suspicions in respect of why this has happened.  Everyone living in this country knows that we are being fleeced in terms of insurance.  I know the amendments in question are technical but, ultimately, when we go downstream from them we are in the space of the insurance industry, the cost of insurance and how regular people are being fleeced week in, week out, year in, year out by the insurance industry.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the insurance industry has called for many things, including the removal of the requirement for two senior counsel, the abolition of juries, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, the Judicial Council Act and the change to the book of quantum.  It has always said that if the next measure is brought in, premiums will go down.  When that happens, it states that if the next measure is brought in, premiums will go down.  Then the next measure is brought in and, again, there is another ask.  What will the next ask be?  Premiums are not going down.  It is not just about motor insurance, house insurance and the very visible insurance premiums.  People may not link the issue of insurance with the hidden costs they are paying.  Why do we have the highest prices in Europe for concert tickets?  It is because of insurance costs.  It feeds into absolutely everything, including the cost of doing business, hiring people, work, building a home and everything else.  It is an absolute cartel, and a cosy one at that.</p>  <p>  Prior to this debate, we had statements on the EU and rights within the EU in advance of the European Council meeting.   We have the Common Market and all the rest.  We have benefited from it.  If I wish to buy a Hoover, a fridge or another household appliance, I benefit from the Common Market.  However, we do not have a common market when it comes to insurance.  Why is that the case?  It is because we have a cosy cartel that is running insurance and keeping costs high.  Like many other Deputies, I have no faith that premiums will go down as a result of the change to the book of quantum and the Judicial Council Act because the insurance industry will find another ask of this Government or the next one.  It must end.  Pressure has been building.  I commend Deputy Doherty on his work on this issue in recent years.  I refer too to the work of the Labour Party and our finance spokesperson, Deputy Nash, on the issue.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a role to play here.  It is lauding itself or being lauded for standing up to stockbrokers.  What about standing up to the insurance industry?  Week in, week out and year in, year out insurance companies are getting away with fleecing the Irish people.  It is an absolute scandal.  I do not wish to have to speak on this issue in the context of the Bill.  Insurance is not the responsibility of the Minister, who has brought forward great legislation that will help many people.</p>  <p>  I will finish on that point because that is what the Minister deserves.  I commend him on the Bill.  I hope that we can build on it.  It is very welcome and a big step.  The Opposition always asks for more, but this is good legislation.  I say "Well done" to the Minister.  The Labour Party is happy to support the Bill.</p></speech>

It is very progressive legislation.  It will ensure that every child gets the best possible start in life.  It supports parents to spend more time with their children.  As the dad of three children aged five and under, I really cherished the early days when our children came home from the maternity hospital.  There were added benefits in that regard because, like most women shortly after giving birth, my wife was absolutely exhausted in those early days and needed a significant amount of help.  It is great to have dads available to provide such help.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides for a lot more beyond that.  It amends the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to increase the duration of paid parental leave from two weeks to five weeks.  That too is very progressive.  Each parent will be given an additional three weeks of paid leave and that period can be taken within the first two years after birth or adoptive placement as the case may be.  Another very progressive feature of the legislation is that it will amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 in order that married same-sex couples can avail of adoptive leave.</p> <p>This was an unfair anomaly that will now be addressed.  I was able to take time out of work, albeit a very short period of a couple of days, to spend time with my kids after they were born.  That opportunity was denied to many and I am glad this anomaly will now be cleared up and addressed.</p> <p> On a slightly related topic, I will address the issue of a lack of social workers to deal with adoption applications.  My understanding is there is a significant backlog at the moment, with many children who have been in long-term foster care awaiting adoption to a loving home.  Many of those people are now nearing the age of 18 when they will become adults and will, thereby, potentially fall outside the net of adoption.  The acute shortage of social workers has been brought to my attention by several families in Clare who have taken up the call and the cudgels for children in need.  Such foster families got calls from the HSE and Tusla late at night and over weekends asking them to take in vulnerable children.  They have done that and shown those children love, affection and care in abundance.  Everyone wants to formalise that arrangement and adopt those children but the lack of social workers makes that impossible.  Cases that one would hope would take a few months to conclude are dragging on for years to the point where the child concerned is becoming an adult and falling outside the net of adoption.</p> <p> The Adoption (Amendment) Act of 2017 was great legislation and there are many progressive elements within but it will not have real and meaningful effect unless we have enough social workers to enable all of the elements of that legislation to be fully fired up and working.  At the heart of this are families who love and care for children they have fostered.  We had multiple debates in this Chamber about the mother and baby home saga and heard time and again that people yearn for a sense of belonging and a feeling of being a part of a family unit.  We need to look at this issue.  Perhaps the officials from the Minister's Department can make a note of this issue, look at where the shortfall is and seek to address it.</p></speech>

Paid parental leave is absolutely key and vital.  People often talk about the element of existing parental leave that is unpaid and it is unrealistic for many people to avail of it because it is unpaid.  It is important that any leave given is paid leave.  We welcome that.</p>  <p>  I will echo some of the points made by previous speakers, in particular my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, relating to surrogacy.  That is a vital and important piece to add.  It is becoming much more common and more people are availing of it, which is fantastic, but parental leave also needs to be there for those people.  We also need to think about lone parents.  I welcome the fact this leave is being put in place but we should see it as a first step.  We must do a huge amount more around the extension of maternity, paternity and parental leave.  In all of this debate, we must focus on and remember how difficult it is to parent alone.  That is a key element to this issue.  I support the calls for leave to be doubled for anybody who is parenting alone.  That is one way to recognise the difficulty of the role of a lone parent.  We cannot ever forget that in this debate because it is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400049#YY00300"><p>The Social Democrats also welcome this Bill.  It is an important step towards facilitating work-life balance and giving the supports families need to take care of their children.  Many parents will breathe a sigh of relief when they see this Bill is before the D&aacute;il and it is hoped they will soon see the effects of the legislation on the ground.  Parents have been waiting for this for a long time and particularly in light of what has happened over the past year.  There has been a lot of anxiety about when this leave was going to become available.  I, too, commend the work of the Extend Maternity Leave group which has done enormous work in keeping this issue at the forefront of all of our minds.</p>  <p>  I will focus on the entire system.  There was a missed opportunity when implementing or bringing this Bill to the D&aacute;il because reform of the parental leave system was not examined.  It is a confusing system and there are many different provisions and elements to it.  Parents have for years had to navigate a confusing and convoluted system of parental leave entitlements in this country.  Year on year, the Government might drip-feed an extra week here or an extra two weeks there, adding to an ever-burgeoning legislative framework.  New parents today need to analyse what is available to them.  The provisions come under maternity benefit, maternity leave, paternity leave, parent&rsquo;s benefit, unpaid parental leave and various other supports.  It is quite a complex system to get one's head around.  There was an opportunity to streamline that system and invest in it properly.  The drip-feeding and baby steps we are taking on the issue are not giving the needed certainty and security to families.</p>  <p>  We are seeing more and more additions to this long list of leave.  When they are combined, these supports are still far behind our European counterparts in both paid and unpaid leave for parents.  Although it affects both men and women, the consequences apply disproportionately to women.  That has contributed to a low uptake in these supports by both parents, under-representation of women in the labour market, the gender pay gap and the burden of care falling mainly on women.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there is a large gap between the end of paid leave and the beginning of subsidised preschool in Ireland, which currently stands at 138 weeks.  The Social Democrats brought through legislation to increase unpaid parental leave which has closed that gap somewhat, but when it is compared with the 86 weeks in France and 115 weeks in the UK, there is still quite a substantial difference.  Closing the gap is crucial because families are forced to pay exorbitant childcare fees to cover the time between the end of parental leave supports and early years education.  Some women end up having to reduce their hours or leave the workforce entirely as a result of not being able to afford childcare fees while others remain in their jobs in the hope that their incomes will surpass childcare fees at some point and it will be worth their while staying and working.</p>  <p>  The confusing parental leave system, lack of paid parental leave and the gap between parental leave and the start of early years education present huge barriers to parents.  It has also contributed to the overall lack of certainty facing families in this country.  Each year, parents are drip-fed parental entitlements depending on the Government that is in place.  To be cynical, how much leave is given sometimes depends on where we are in the electoral cycle.  I acknowledge the Minister inherited this system and it is good to see he is aiming to improve it, but a week's leave here and two weeks' leave there is not what families need.  Parents and families need much more certainty and investment in this area.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has magnified this level of uncertainty.  Parents have become childminders, teachers and parents while working on top of all these incredibly stressful demands.  Women, in particular, have found juggling these aspects of the pandemic all too much.  Many have used up parental leave when they never intended to use it just so they could manage childcare while schools were closed or focus on their family&rsquo;s needs during lockdown.</p>  <p>  I welcome the additional three weeks as a result of budget 2021 but there was a lack of clarity as to when parents could claim this, the time limit for claiming the payment and whether the payment would be backdated.  There had been an expectation the payment could be claimed from January or early in the year onwards, but it now seems it will be April before it is available.  The added confusion at a time when parents are dealing with huge levels of uncertainty is not helpful.</p>  <p>  What families need most at this difficult time during the global pandemic is certainty.  Furthermore, the myriad legislation covering this area makes it unclear what people are entitled to as it keeps changing year on year.  Families find it difficult to plan around childcare, schools and for other children in the family.  This is not what paid parental leave legislation should be about.  It should be about clarity, certainty and creating a supportive environment to help families manage their already stressful work-life balance.</p>  <p>  The Government had an opportunity to streamline this process and I have put forward an amendment for Committee Stage which encourages the Minister to conduct a policy and budgetary analysis on a potential further extension of leave under this Act from five weeks to nine weeks, as is required under the EU directive, and establish a timeline for that provision.  The reporting mechanism will also ask the Minister to consider the degree to which the directive requires further transposition into Irish law and to present a timeline for its full implementation.</p> <p>That is the certainty families need.  When people sit down to work out their annual budget, they need to know whether they can afford to have children, how that would be facilitated and if it would be feasible for them.  Having that clarity would certainly help.</p> <p> To address the disruptions caused to family life during the pandemic, I have also proposed within the amendments that the time limit of parental leave would be increased from the proposed two years to three.  This would go a long way to bridging the gap between parental leave and the start of early education.  In France, for example, claim periods often end when universal primary school starts.  As the gap between the end of all parental leave and the start of primary school is still quite wide in Ireland and presents a barrier to women returning to work, three years is the perfect number as the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme begins for most children when they reach the age of three.  In my amendment I propose that we give an extra year to parents to seek that leave.</p> <p> I also wish to briefly address the issue of parents parenting alone.  That is a big gap area that I have mentioned to the Minister previously.  When developing the Bill and policy in this area it is too often forgotten that families come in all different shapes and sizes and that our policies need to reflect that.  I proposed these recommendations in the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth on the basis of consultation with various groups.  It was a missed opportunity to not recognise that the policy must be child-centred.  Children will benefit from having their parents involved, whether that is one parent or two parents.</p> <p> We must also address the gender imbalance, but in the case of people parenting alone, the provisions should apply to them.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider my amendments and support parents as they navigate the global pandemic.  I also hope that he will support women and gender balance, support children in their development and provide a work-life balance for families.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Gannon.</p></speech>

They are entitled to the exact same time at home as those in any other family dynamic.  Consistently in society, one-parent families are the most vulnerable at-risk group.  They are at risk of economic disadvantage and all of the crushing human aspects that go with poverty.  There is much of merit in the Bill but the most disappointing aspect of it is that it will not impact fairly on all children.  If we were taking a child-centred approach to the Bill, which we should do, the children of one-parent families would be treated in the exact same manner as other children.  By that I mean they should have the exact same entitlement to time at home with a parent.  The fact that is not being provided is beyond lamentable.  That is the case for a number of reasons as it punishes children in a family situation that are already at greatest risk.  I understand it is a difficult issue and there are complications in this regard, but if we are taking a child-centred approach to the Bill then the children of one-parent families need to have the exact same time at home with a parent as any other children.</p>  <p>  We also introduced an amendment to make provision for a parent to apply for a maximum of ten weeks parental leave in the case where one parent is unable to care for a child due to severe illness, hospitalisation or incarceration for at least 104 weeks.  That would be a massive bonus to one-parent families who are already living with great economic difficulties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400050#ZZ00300"><p>I am delighted that we are continuing to extend and expand the entitlements that are available to parents in this country.  This Bill will entitle parents to an extra three weeks of paid parental leave and create more time for adjusting to the challenges that a new addition to the family brings.  It will mean five weeks leave paid by the State for every parent to be taken before a child turns two.  All children deserve the best start in life and this Bill will support 30,000 parents to spend more quality time with their young children, something all parents will appreciate.</p>  <p>  However, the research shows that when it comes to taking time away from work to care for children, it is still mostly left to mothers.  Despite the fact that benefits and leave have increased for fathers in recent years, uptake remains low.  Figures published by the CSO last year found that almost half of fathers entitled to paternity leave did not avail of it.  Many fathers fear the effects that taking this leave may have on their career, especially those working in small companies.  Parental leave must not fall victim to this same pattern.  Starting a family and spending quality time with one's children is a right which should never be looked on as a barrier to progressing one's career or profession.  I call on all employers to support parents within their organisations and to encourage them to avail of the full parental supports available to them.  Both mothers and fathers need to be assured that they will not be at a disadvantage for taking the time out that they rightfully deserve.  Being a parent is never easy, but the last year has been especially challenging.  I welcome this family leave Bill and the support it will give to parents across Ireland.</p></speech>

While not directly naming the group, the Bill gives leave to parents whose child is born through a surrogate in Ireland.  That is a big step in the right direction for the many families that have children born through surrogacy as an alternative to adoption or perhaps due to health issues where they are unable to physically have their own children.  It is also relevant for same-sex families who may choose to have children through surrogates.  Surrogacy is expensive and complex, but the outcome hopefully is the same as for any other parent, that is, a baby born into a loving family.  All parents should have the right to leave to care for a baby.  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, for the work she has done in this regard.</p>  <p>  I believe we can do more with the Bill.  I support what Deputy Gannon said about it not doing enough for lone parents.  Overwhelmingly, as we know, the burden on lone parents falls to women.  As my colleague, Deputy Higgins, stated, the bigger issue in the long term is to provide equality between parents in taking leave.  Parents should be able to avail of a four-day or three-day week.  I look forward to the day when a man who has just had a second baby, where both children are under three, looks for a four-day week from a commercial organisation, just as many women have been doing for years.  There has been an impact on their pensions, promotional opportunities and their ability to participate fully and to use their skills and experience in the labour market.  Society is the poorer for losing all of those women who have been so well trained and who are so professional and experienced.  That is the only way to address inequality in the commercial and professional sectors.</p></speech>

It is a very important Bill for parents of young children to allow them time to bond with their child, regardless of whether they are the birth parent or adoptive parent.  This past year has been incredibly difficult for new parents.  They have had to do without the support of family and friends on whom they could normally rely for assistance when welcoming a new member to the family home.  Parent and toddler groups were not able to meet.  New parents could not rely on their own parents, siblings, neighbours or friends to help out or give them some respite, which would be the case in normal times.</p>  <p>  One criticism I could make of the Bill is the time it has taken to bring it to this Stage.  I am aware of numerous mothers who were scheduled to return to work after their maternity leave was finished, but due to the restrictions in operation they could not find childcare.  In addition, the restrictions led to smaller quantities of children being catered for in childcare facilities and family members were not available to provide childcare.  There was an existing issue pre-Covid regarding childcare for children under the age of one that needed to be addressed.  Many mothers are being forced to take additional unpaid maternity leave even though they are not in a position to do so financially but they have no choice because they cannot return to work.</p>  <p>  I welcome the removal of the anomaly surrounding the gender of adoptive parents.  Parental leave is now open to adoptive parents regardless of gender.  What is being proposed today is welcome but a lot more work needs to be done regarding the early childcare sector to make childcare more available and more affordable to parents and to improve the pay and conditions of those providing childcare, many of whom are highly qualified, with degree-level qualifications, yet are expected to work for not much more than the minimum wage.</p></speech>

More than 30,000 people signed a petition in support of that and the issue was debated in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>Unfortunately, because of the long and many delays before this comes into effect, the majority of those people who were campaigning then will not be able to benefit from it.  They also correctly view this as the Government saying it is doing this in response to their campaign when in reality it was part of the programme for Government and was planned in advance.</p> <p> Obviously, I welcome the extension of paid parental leave from two to five weeks.  I also welcomed the provisions extending adoptive leave to male same-sex couples.  That is a long overdue correction of discrimination against gay men in this area.</p> <p> I want to raise three problems with the Bill.  The first is the rate of parent's benefit, which is too low at only &euro;245 per week.  The second is the fact that the various forms of paid parental leave should be extended to at least a year.  The third is a point which has been referred to, namely, the discrimination against the children of lone parents.  Both parents should be entitled to take this up as a basic equality measure for a group that has been discriminated against.</p> <p> In regard to the first issue, the Government's estimates give the game away.  It estimates that the Bill will result in a cost of &euro;22 million in a full year and will support up to 39,000 parents.  There were just under 60,000 births in 2019, which means, therefore, that the Government is banking on over 60% of parents not taking up parent's leave.  The main reason why they will not take it up is because the rate of pay is so low, at &euro;245 a week.  That is &euro;105 a week less than the standard rate of the pandemic unemployment payment which provides a basic, but by no means comfortable, replacement income level.  It is a mere &euro;42 a week more than the poverty level jobseeker's benefit.  For a family with two children where both parents are on maternity benefit or parent's leave, they fall well below the poverty line of &euro;525 per week as calculated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p> <p> The &euro;245 rate is the same rate as paternity and maternity benefit.  The higher rate of maternity benefit of &euro;262, which was the rate applicable to 90% of women prior to January 2014 when it was cut as part of the bank bailout and austerity measures, has still not been restored eight years later.  That is how much Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party value women and families.</p> <p> A survey by the Trades Union Congress in Britain in 2017 found that Ireland was the worst country in the EU for decently-paid maternity leave, which it defined using the EU definition of at least two thirds of normal wages.  By contrast, a payment of &euro;245 equates to only around a quarter of average wages.  The only other EU countries not to offer decently paid paternity leave were Britain and Slovakia.</p> <p> As a result of the rate being so low, wealthier parents can afford to take parent's leave but many working-class parents who still have to pay rent or a mortgage, as well as all of their other living costs, cannot afford to take time off to be with their babies.  This reinforces sexist gender norms.  If only one parent takes the leave, it is overwhelmingly likely to be the mother because women still earn much less than men, on average, and because mothers are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave compared to a paltry two weeks paternity leave, and so almost always end up being the primary carer from the very beginning.</p> <p> Leave on full pay should be available for all forms of parental leave, including maternity, paternity, parent's leave and parental leave, which is currently completely unpaid.  Parents and working class people generally want properly paid parental leave.  A January 2019 RED C opinion poll carried out for Early Childhood Ireland found that 59% agreed that parental leave benefit should be 66% of pay, with support for this being higher among women than men presumably because men assume women will take it.</p> <p> The opposition to this is coming from right wing governments and employers.  According to the CSO, 46% of women on maternity leave in 2019 did not get any top-up from their employer and therefore only received &euro;245 per week.  The levels vary dramatically based on sector.  For example, almost all of those working in public administration and defence received a top-up, whereas 61% of women working in accommodation and food services did not get any top-up.</p> <p> The second point is the period of paid parent's leave.  The total period of paid leave per parent per child should be extended to at least the first full year of each child's life.  Ideally, it should be the first two years.  This is already available in Sweden, Norway, Japan, Austria and Germany, among other countries.  Even after the additional three weeks parent's leave provided for in the Bill, a mother will only be entitled to 31 weeks paid leave per child and a father to seven weeks.  This is nowhere near enough, especially considering the fact that many cr&egrave;ches no longer take babies aged under one year.</p> <p> Again, parents and working-class people generally want this.  Another RED C survey found that 70% of people agreed that all parents should be financially supported to stay at home with their child for the first 12 months of the child's life, i.e. paid maternity and parental leave should be extended from six to 12 months.</p> <p> Finally, the Bill discriminates against lone parents and their children by not allowing them to take both parent's entitlements.  This is a group that has long been discriminated against in this country.  The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019, which this Bill seeks to amend, specifically states that the leave is per parent and cannot be transferred between parents.  We would generally support the leave not being transferable in order to encourage more equal parenting between the genders.  However, in a situation where one parent is parenting alone and there is no prospect of the other parent taking the leave the lone parent should be entitled to both parent's leave, i.e. to ten weeks' leave rather than five or should alternatively be able to nominate a second recipient other than a spouse.</p> <p> This is how the situation is handled in more progressive European countries such as Sweden.  In light of the latest round of shocking revelations about the mother and baby homes and forced and illegal adoptions in this country, it would be a fitting response to begin to treat lone parents and their children equally to other families in this respect.</p> <p> The Bill as drafted means that a lone parent family is only entitled to five weeks parent's leave, or &euro;1,225, whereas all other families are entitled to ten weeks or &euro;2,450.  How is that fair or equitable?  How does that cherish all of the children equally, in particular in a situation where lone parents already suffer the highest levels of poverty and deprivation in this country?  I hope the Government will be open to accepting amendments on those points to remove the discrimination which currently exists.</p></speech>

It is important.</p>  <p>  Just this week, Chambers Ireland and UNICEF Ireland issued a call to action for more family friendly workplaces.  They launched a guide adapted from a document released by the International Chamber of Commerce and UNICEF which includes measures that business leaders can take to achieve short and long-term positive impacts in the workplace.  In the guide they state that by giving working parents the time, information, services and resources that they need to cope with crisis, family friendly policies and practices can make a critical difference and also make an important contribution to wider social protection.</p>  <p>  The Bill proposes, among other things, to increase the duration of parent's leave, as well as the associated entitlement to parental benefit, from two to five weeks to enable couples who have jointly adopted to choose which member of the couple avails of adoptive leave.  These are very welcome measures.  We all deserve to be able to care for ourselves or our loved ones at a time when they need us.</p>  <p>  Across the House we all agree that we need to strive for a better work-life balance.  The Government promised in the programme for Government that parent's leave would be increased from two to five weeks, to be taken in the first 24 months of a child's life, increasing from 12 months from the time of the child's birth or placement with parents in the case of adoption.  This is the Government's commitment to delivery.  I agree with the committee's recommendations on the Bill.</p>  <p>  I have raised the importance of work-life balance.  There is no doubt that Covid-19 has been a struggle.  However, if we can take some positives from it, we have seen how much better working from home has been for so many families.</p> <p>Home school has been a challenge but the bonds families have developed will last forever.  There is no reason we cannot keep business going and provide employees who are parents with time to focus on health and family and there is no reason this attitude cannot apply beyond pandemic times.  There should be work-life balance in all workplaces, not only where people work from home.  Many retail, manufacturing, warehouse and delivery staff cannot work from home.  Many in non-essential retail and hospitality have lost their jobs and incomes and their experience has not been positive.</p> <p> In other countries such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Demark, where gender equality has been on the political agenda for many decades, there are father-friendly leave policies, the countries in question are father-care sensitive, and there are high levels of compensation for loss of earnings.  These countries apply a leave quota on a use it or lose it principle, which is paternity leave of nine weeks until the child's second birthday.  This comprises post-birth leave of three weeks, which runs simultaneously with the mother's leave, and paternity leave of six weeks, both of which have high compensation for loss of earnings.  Swedish parents have a verb, to vabba, which describes being at home temporarily on 80% pay to look after sick children.  This benefit is available until children reach 12 years.  They are doing more and we need to do more.</p> <p> We need a plan to make more father-friendly policies and increase incentives to encourage more fathers to take up parental leave.  We also need to do more for one-parent families, and while the measures for adoptive families are welcome, we have to provide more supports for single parents.  These are, in the main women, and they find it very difficult to maintain full-time jobs and arrange childcare.</p></speech>

However, we should not forget the backdrop which led to the Government's U-turn.  In the early days of the pandemic, mothers attended prenatal appointments alone.  Many gave birth without the support of their partners.  I commend the work of Agnes Graholska and the other parents in the Extend Maternity Leave 2020 campaign.  They ran a petition which to date has in excess of 30,000 signatures.  They did this despite having newborn babies at home, somehow managing to create, build and drive a national campaign on this important issue.</p>  <p>  Last July, Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward proposals to extend maternity leave from six to nine months for mothers whose maternity leave claims expired from March to November, if they wished to avail of it.  This took account of the public health emergency.  Parents of young babies found themselves facing particular challenges and there was an added difficulty in securing childcare for new babies.  The Government's response was to kick the can down the road.  The pressure has been kept up and we are finally seeing action.</p>  <p>  We need to go further.  Ireland lags behind many European countries in maternity leave.  It is vital we give babies and their parents the best possible start.  I am sure we will revisit this topic as we strive to bring our maternity leave entitlement into the 21st century.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400052#BBB00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and thank the Minister for being present.  I welcome the legislation.  It is a very positive development.  It is a response from Government on foot of the campaign that was run last year for the extension of maternity leave for women who were on such leave when Covid-19 initially kicked in.  They had been losing out on part of the maternity leave and this provision was introduced in response to the impact of Covid-19 on families.  I welcome the provision as a result of that, it is a positive development.  The extension of paternity leave up to five weeks for each parent will be of huge benefit to many parents.  The longer term plan is to extend it to seven weeks in coming years.  When he responds, I ask the Minister to elaborate on why provision has not been made in the legislation to extend it beyond the five weeks by statutory instrument if the Government intends to increase the leave further in the years ahead rather than having to come back and introduce new primary legislation.  There will be support right across the House for that were it the Government's intention.  Intention is one thing, legislation is something very different.  We have the legislation before us.  Surely now is the time to deal with that.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has highlighted many issues in the childcare sector.  For front-line staff, whether in healthcare or those in shops, other public services or vital private services, childcare has been a vast problem over the past 12 months.  While there has been some tinkering at the edges of this, there has effectively been a table tennis match between the Minister, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health, with no one prepared to grapple with this issues for front-line staff who have been left in a very difficult situation of trying to juggle childcare while also delivering vital front-line services in our health sector and communities at the same time.  It is to be hoped we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel on this particular variant of this virus but that should not be a reason to ignore the fundamental problem of the delivery of vital childcare services for front-line workers.  We need to put a far more robust system in place.</p>  <p>  That is one side of this issue.  Many of us attended the protest in Dublin last year about the terms and conditions under which many childcare workers in Ireland work.  I have spoken about this in the House before.  Staff in shops who pack shelves with baby wipes are paid more than qualified childcare workers who use those very same baby wipes in cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities.  There is something fundamentally wrong if the people who we charge with and on whom we put a huge level of responsibility in minding and educating our children, who play such a vital role in their development at a very early stage in life, are paid less than someone stacking shelves in a supermarket.  That needs to change.  The Minister has spoken of a new funding model for the childcare sector and examining its workforce development, but we need to move from report after report into action.</p>  <p>  If we want to use a pilot for the living wage, the childcare sector is an important place to start.  It could be a very useful template.</p> <p>We have all seen in the last 12 months how important the childcare sector is to a long-term sustainable economy.  We are not going to have a sustainable sector in that area, however, unless we have proper pay and terms and conditions for the staff working in it.  As staff gain experience and qualifications, we have seen that they move out of the sector and take their education and training with them.  A great deal of investment has been put into that training and education by the people concerned, their employers and the State, and yet they move out of that sector and into probably a completely different area.  The result is a loss of knowledge and that skill base and this is leading to many childcare facilities having ongoing struggles with proper staffing ratios.  Prior to the onset of Covid-19, many such service providers told me about the difficulties they were experiencing with recruitment.</p> <p> Before I finish, I come back to the fundamental basis of this legislation, which is to support young families and address our existing childcare challenges.  We must look at this matter in far more comprehensive terms and not just at preschool services but also at the provision of after-school services for many parents.  We must also look at this issue from an economic perspective and in the long-term sustainability of our economy.  Female participation in the workforce must be increased and more women must be encouraged to move up the payscales and management structures in our businesses and organisations in the public and private sectors.  They can only do that if they have access to reliable and cost-effective childcare, which does not exist now.</p> <p> Turning to our older people at the other end of the spectrum, the Joint Committee on Social Protection provided a detailed submission to the Commission on Pensions.  In that document, the committee made reference to the issue of the birth rate in Ireland.  It is not as stark a problem here as it is in many other European countries.  Many of those countries, however, have put in place extensive supports for young couples and families to help them rear their children from an early age.  We can look at the best practices in some of those other European countries and learn from some of the mistakes they made.  Rather than waiting for this issue to become a crisis for our economy in the longer term, let us support families today.  Let us start putting targeted supports in place now and not start panicking in ten or 20 years about a situation which may by then have gone beyond the point of no return.  Now is the time to learn from what is happening in other European countries.</p></speech>

Like most Deputies, I wholeheartedly welcome this change as I have been contacted by many constituents regarding just how important this leave is for them.  The campaign slogan, #EveryWeekCounts, really captures the importance of this change.  Unfortunately, every week this change has been delayed has also delayed precious weeks for family bonding.  It has taken far too long to debate this legislation, but I am glad finally to see it being progressed.</p>  <p>  This Bill also amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to enable adoptive couples to choose which parent may avail of adoptive leave.  In doing so, this will rectify the oversight in the current legislation which left married male same-sex couples unable to avail of adoptive leave.  This Bill goes a long way in rightfully taking steps to recognise that families come in many different forms and that the family is the fundamental unit of society and is inviolate.  One such family unit needing protection is that of families with children who have been born through surrogacy.  I understand that this Bill offers some limited protection to some families in this regard.  I would appreciate if the Minister could seriously consider this aspect and if he could also clarify what other work is being done regarding parental and maternal leave for parents who have children through surrogacy.  I commend the Minister on his Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400053#CCC00300"><p>I am delighted to have some time to speak about this Bill.  It is important that we have proper legislation in this area and it is too late for many people.  The flexible working patterns which have existed are interesting.  Cross-country comparative research on parental leave shows that in Ireland there remains a substantial gap between the end of leave, including the merging of paid and unpaid leave entitlements and early childhood education care entitlements as well.</p>  <p>  We must have a broad suite of facilities that will suit shared parental leave for both parents.  It is also important that we look at our European counterparts.  A case has been made regarding the levels of attendance at formal services for children under the age of three and that being in line with the average situation throughout Europe.  We know how important and how much of a huge step it is to bring a child into the world.  Both parents are needed in a supportive role.  In the olden days, what prevented that was that women got all the leave and the men got none.  Now, however, both parents will have to get leave.  For adoptive parents especially, it is vital that we have a situation where it is possible for them under this Bill to get their proper entitlements to leave.</p>  <p>  The Bill sets out to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to enable couples, regardless of sex, who have jointly adopted to choose which member of the couple will avail of adoptive leave.  It also amends the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to increase the duration of parent's leave, as well as associated entitlements to parental benefits, from two to five weeks.  That is very important, because goodness knows time flies so fast.  It can be a tiring and difficult time and there can also be issues with births, so parents need that kind of time and space.</p>  <p>  This legislation also amends the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to increase the number of ordinary members of the board of Tusla from seven to nine.  I have been very critical of Tusla in the past and I am still critical of that agency in many respects.  I do not know if increasing the board membership by two will achieve the kinds of changes required.  It is in the Bill, but to digress a small bit the whole conception and creation of this Tusla organisation was rushed.  Certain sections of the HSE were just hived off to set up Tusla.  The agency has much to learn and there are many shortcomings in the organisation.  I have cases brought to me regularly concerning families who are very dissatisfied.  I am also often contacted by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who end up as a baby-sitting service on weekends when Tusla is not available.  Cases reported at 3 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. on a Friday evening necessitate members of the Garda getting involved and that is rough justice.  It is not proper.  Therefore, there are areas in Tusla which need to be examined.</p>  <p>  The Family Leave Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021 follows on from the general scheme of the proposed parent's leave and benefit (amendment) Bill 2020, which thankfully was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration in February 2021.</p> <p>The Business Committee is constantly asked to schedule Bills without pre-legislative scrutiny.  Thankfully, this was not one of them because it is too serious and too important, and pre-legislative scrutiny was vital.<br/><br/>While the Bill will provide for changes to the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019, the change of the Title from &quot;Family Leave Bill&quot; arises due to the inclusion of measures to amend the Adoptive Leave Act 1995.  The Bill digest states: </p><blockquote>	By means of background, family leave policies are intended to bolster and support gender equality.  They are also important policy instruments for supporting child, maternal and paternal health and well-being, birth rates and various labour-market outcomes, such as increased women&rsquo;s participation in the labour market and reduced gender pay gaps.  </blockquote> <p>That is very important because childcare is a very female-orientated profession.  I was chairperson of a board that looks after childcare and was involved in its set-up.  There are many issues.  We must be ever cognisant, when we are passing legislation such as this that looks fine and dandy, of respecting the employer's perspective and look at it where they are coming from.  I am an employer myself, although, because of the nature of the business, I employ mainly male workers.  We must consider the impact that legislation such as this will have on the ability of employers to abide by it.  It is better to use the carrot than the stick, with encouragement rather than regulation, to make them do what they should.<br/><br/>It is important, like with other Bills, that there is some assessment of how it beds in.  While pre-legislative scrutiny looks at one end of the process, we must also have post-legislative scrutiny.  Deputy Pringle tabled important amendments to another Bill, which came before the House two weeks ago, that would have provided for time-sensitive reviews of the impact of the legislation.  For the Bill before us, too, that will be necessary because we need to see how it beds in and how employers can cope with it.  It is one thing for the public service, given that the pay does not come from the employer's fund but rather from the public purse, but for small employers and small businesses this can have unintended consequences.</p></speech>

This is a move in the right direction at a time when so much negativity has been shown to mothers and babies in this country by the Government.  Adoptive and single parents should get leave to experience the same joy of having a loving baby in their lives and the Bill will provide for this.  While this country is slowly improving in respect of parents' rights, we are still laggards in comparison with other European countries and need urgently to look into how to make respectful changes.</p><p>The Bill digest states:</p> <blockquote> 	Ireland&rsquo;s (family) parental leave policies, including Parent&rsquo;s Leave, are influenced by the broader policy framework set out at EU level. Of particular importance here is <i>European Council Directive 2019/1158 </i>on work-life balance for parents and carers, adopted in April 2019.  The Directive repeals Council Directive 2010/18/EU (discussed in the main body of the Digest) and provides, among other things, the following: ten working days of Paternity leave, paid at no less than the level of sick pay; two months of non-transferable (between parents), paid Parental leave; five days of annual carer&rsquo;s leave; and, flexible working patterns.<br /><br />A cross-country comparison of parental leave ... shows that in Ireland, there remains a substantial gap between the end of leave (including merging both paid and unpaid leave entitlements) and Early Childhood Education and Care entitlement.  This is the case even given the levels of attendance at formal services for children under the age of three are in line with the average seen in EU Member States.  To date in Ireland, research has shown that the uptake of all forms of parental leave, excepting Maternity Leave, has been mixed.  From the research literature [assessed by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service], the challenges of taking parental leave (including paternity leave) relate in the main to the following: low compensation levels (difference between the rate paid for leave and an individual&rsquo;s typical net income) act as a strong disincentive to taking leave; lack of flexibility in the timing of leave; ... and, eligibility criteria (e.g. employment length) ... Parental leave varies on four main dimensions in EU countries: length; whether it is an individual or family entitlement; payment; and flexibility ...<br /><br />In Ireland, parental leave (unpaid) has a duration of 26 weeks, while Parent&rsquo;s Leave has currently a duration of two weeks (paid), proposed to rise to five weeks under the provisions of the Bill.  Leave is an individual entitlement that cannot be transferred.  The one exception is when parents are employed by the same employer, in which case they can transfer a maximum of 14 weeks of their Parental leave entitlement to the other parent, subject to the employer&rsquo;s agreement.  Both parents can take this leave at the same time.  It is not possible to transfer entitlement between parents currently under Parent&rsquo;s Leave. </blockquote>  <p>I agree with my colleague Deputy Mattie McGrath in respect of employers.  Employers are suffering too and we have to take that into account.  It is difficult for them to get the replacements for the periods people may be off work and there has to be a fair deal for them as well.  It cannot just be one-way traffic all the time.  Women in particular, as the ones who bear children, have suffered for a long time in this country.  Stay-at-home mothers, under a Labour Party Bill a number of years ago, have suffered severely and this is an opportunity to put something right for these people.  I will fully support the Bill.</p></speech>

I do so bearing in mind that during the most recent general election campaign, one of the most prominent issues for many people in my constituency and nationally concerned the challenges facing young families who are starting out trying to secure childcare, with all that entails.  When we move beyond the current climate of Covid-19, it will be very important for the Minister and all the members of the Cabinet to focus on identifying and addressing many of the specific challenges with childcare.  That would be a very prudent step for the Government to take.</p>  <p>  I say that because when one speaks to people who work in the sector or are affected by it, there is a general consensus regarding all aspects of childcare that people are deeply frustrated and unhappy with the current level of services provided.  Ireland has a modern economy but we still face many challenges dealing with the gender pay gap, and it will take many years for that to be resolved.  Nevertheless, this is one issue that will ensure there is not discrimination against women in order that they can secure childcare and that they will be enabled to return to work.</p>  <p>  My mother worked throughout my childhood and I feel very proud of her for doing so.  I hope that one day every person born in the State will have the same opportunity, whereby they will be able to enjoy a full career if they wish to do so.  In addition, for those parents, whether male or female, who decide to remain in the home to provide support for their children, it is critical that we acknowledge the work they do and the importance of that from an economic standpoint.  For parents who decide to remain at home, there is a stigma in many cases but they provide a specific service and that has to be recognised from an economic standpoint.</p>  <p>  When I was going into politics, this was one of the issues I greatly underestimated, perhaps because of my age.  Naturally, it is not an issue that people of my age group are immersed in, and perhaps I am guilty of that, but now, as many people who are a few years ahead of me are starting out in their family lives, I see that it is an issue of great concern.  That is particularly the case now that many young people get an education, whether through doing an apprenticeship or going on to institutes of technology or universities or to undertake FETAC degrees, and unfortunately, they can be in a significant level of debt by the time they enter their late 20s or 30s and are starting a family.  We have to do everything we can as a modern, dynamic economy to ensure we cover as many bases as possible, while also remembering that people in working in childcare need the full support and attention of the Department and the Government.</p></speech>

It shows we are moving forward and being positive, which I welcome.</p> <p> I do, however, have a number of issues with the Bill, which I will outline.  First, the rate is too low.  A lot of families, if they decide to take parental leave and especially if they decide to take the full ten weeks, would be down a considerable amount of money during that time.  This will be a barrier to some parents taking this leave.  That is something we need to improve and work on.</p> <p> A number of people have contacted me about this Bill.  It was promised last summer and again in October.  It is now the end of March and it will probably not be in until April.  Families have missed out on this over the past year.  Will it be backdated for those people?</p> <p> Children of lone parents are discriminated against under this Bill because they will only be given five weeks with their parent while the children of families with two parents will have ten weeks with their parents.  That discrimination against certain children needs to be addressed.  The provisions should have been child-centred.  This Bill discriminates against the children of lone parents.</p></speech>

This legislation will help every child to get the best possible start in life, allowing parents to spend more time with their children during the first year of their life.  This Bill seeks to amend the Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to increase the duration of parent's leave during which benefit is paid from two to five weeks.  Each parent will be given an additional three weeks of paid leave and the period in which this can be taken will be extended to the first two years following the child's birth or adoptive placement.  This legislation will also apply in respect of children born since 1 November 2019.</p>  <p>  Parent's leave benefit is paid at the rate of &euro;245 per week.  It is expected that this investment in parental support for children will cost &euro;28.6 million this year and &euro;22 million a year thereafter, supporting up to 39,000 parents.  As the Minister will be well aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has proven particularly difficult for parents over the past 18 months.  I encourage all Deputies in the House to support this Bill.</p></speech>

I am delighted to see it on the agenda and I give full credit to the Minister for bringing it forward.  It is an ambitious and modernising Bill which addresses many of our societal failings as a country.  It is only right that Part 2 rights so many of the wrongs done to adoptive parents.  I will, however, raise some concerns, but before I do so, I welcome the elements in Part 8, which extends parental leave.  This is extremely welcome and will give many parents the opportunity to spend those formative months, that most important time, with their young children, but issues clearly remain.  How many people are still taking that leave?  How many young fathers are taking paternity leave?  How many parents of either gender are taking parental leave to its full extent?  This is a challenge to those of us in this House.  How many new or young parents in this House will take the full amount of leave available to them?  Is it conducive to a modern career in politics?</p>  <p>  Even though this Bill is aspirational and provides for this leave, there are still practical obstacles.  Deputy Gould referred to the rate at which the benefit is paid, which is understandable, but how many employers actively encourage employees to take the full amount of parental leave available?  Employers who stand in the way of this or who simply do not encourage it are absolutely missing a trick.  Parents of any gender or persuasion who are able to spend as much time as possible with their children in those vitally important early months will be a more productive asset in the workforce and in society.  We need to see these very welcome moves and extensions coupled with a real and dynamic campaign from Government, working with employers, trade unions and representative bodies, to ensure the leave is actually taken.</p>  <p>  I will go back to the challenge faced in this House.  How many party leaders or party Whips are insisting that Deputies and Senators take leave, rather than simply pointing out it is available if Members want to take it?  This is in their interests as well as in the interests of Members and of politics as a whole.</p>  <p>  The final concern I will raise is that I believe the Bill could have been a bit more ambitious.  Believe it or not, I am going to agree with Deputy Gould for the second time, this time with regard to the rates for lone parents.  While it is great that this Bill modernises provision for adoptive parents, in a number of years' time we will be back here looking again at the provision for lone parents.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute briefly on the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021, which is before us today.  Sometimes, the Government brings forward Bills with which one cannot disagree.  Often, they are very belated but welcome nonetheless.  This is one of those Bills.  A simple change of definition, from "adoptive mother" to "adoptive parent", is making a tremendous difference to many people's lives.</p>  <p>  On 22 May 2015, 62% of us voted to say "Yes" to enabling same-sex couples to get married.  The Yes Equality campaign and the LGBTQI+ people who shared their stories changed the country for the better and we made gr&aacute; the law.  After May 2015, many people thought everything had now improved for same-sex couples and families.  Unfortunately, the reality was many same-sex families were left in limbo or left behind when it came to parental rights, recognition and legal standing.  The wonderful families with same-sex parents were sidelined while the Government claimed the glory for how modern and inclusive Ireland now was.</p>  <p>  During the campaign, the No side tried to make children and families an issue, whereas the reality was separate legislation was needed.  The Children and Families Relationship Act 2015 was introduced to deal with many of the legalities around same-sex parenting and the various ways in which same-sex couples may become parents.  This Bill, the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021, will correct an anomaly in legislation to allow provision for male same-sex couples to avail of adoptive leave in the same way as everybody else.</p>  <p>  It is quite a substantive and comprehensive Bill which proposes many amendments to a number of intertwined pieces of legislation.  The Bill will make provision for male same-sex couples to take adoptive leave and adopting couples will be able to choose which parent avails of the leave.  The Bill also increases the time allowed for parental leave from two weeks to five weeks and the qualifying period from one year to two years.  These changes require amendments to the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 and the Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019.  The Parental Leave Act 1998, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the Workplace Relations Act 2015 are also amended.  There is also a change to the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to provide for an increase in the membership of the board of the Child and Family Agency, up to nine ordinary members from seven ordinary members.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, because of Covid, we will not have a census this year, so we do not have a current picture of family make-up around Ireland.  In 2016, the census showed us there were 6,034 same-sex couples in the country.  That was an increase of almost 50% since the previous census in 2011.  Of the 6,034 same-sex couples counted in 2016, 43% were female and 57% were male.  At that time, the vast majority, almost 80%, of same-sex couples were cohabiting without children.  Some 10.9% were married without children while just 9.8%, or 591 same-sex couples, had children, 182 of those couples being married.  At that time, that was probably more to do with the increase in the number of same-sex couples in the older age groups and the legalities of the time.  By the time of the 2016 census, the number of same-sex couples aged 50 or over had more than doubled while the number of such couples in the 25 to 49-year-old age bracket had increased by 46%.   The number of same-sex couples aged up to 24 years actually reduced in those five years.  Does the Minister know how many families will benefit from this Bill when enacted?</p>  <p>  As usual, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has produced a very useful Bill digest.  I note this Bill was committed to in the programme for Government and it underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the relevant joint committee.  The financial implications of the Bill are estimated to be around &euro;28.6 million in 2021 and &euro;22 million in 2022.  These costs are described as not significant in the digest.  It always amazes me how the significance of the cost implications of legislation depends on whether a Government Bill or an Opposition Bill is involved.  I agree that the benefits far outweigh the costs here but the Minister's self-serving position on the cost implications of Bills on the Exchequer must be noted.  Such a Bill, if put forward by the Opposition, would be considered too costly.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s parental leave policies are influenced by EU policies.  The EU directive on work-life balance for parents and carers, European Council Directive 2019/1158, was to be transposed into domestic law by August 2022, but there has been an extension until August 2024 for some provisions of the directive to be implemented, which probably means it will be 2030 before our Government transposes it at all.  One of the reasons for such policies is to address the gender gap in caring responsibilities.</p> <p>While Ireland now has paid paternity leave, the take-up has been quite low.  This is reportedly due to the difference between the payment and usual salaries, with many employers not providing the top-up.  That is something we need to tackle as a society.  I have heard other Members talk about the difficulties for employers in terms of parental leave and leave.  Employers need to recognise that they also have a responsibility and that it should not only be the State that does this.  We should provide for that in law.</p> <p> In the Bills Digest the table on parental leave across EU states, under the section "Incentive for Father to take up", the majority of countries listed state "No", that there is no incentive for fathers to take up the leave.  As has been stated, that is because fathers predominantly earn higher incomes and therefore they cannot afford to take the leave as well, which is an issue that will have to be addressed.  If employers have to top up wages while that is happening, that would make a significant difference.</p> <p> There are many other issues to be addressed if we are serious about supporting people to become parents.  I want to mention lone parents as well.  Mothers or fathers parenting alone are playing two hugely important roles in their children's lives with half the support, resources, time and energy.  If we want to improve outcomes for children, then we must look at those who are more likely to live in poverty or deprivation.  Unfortunately, single parent families are the most deprived families in our society and we have to recognise that there are many families in that situation that should be supported with adoptive leave as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400056#FFF00200"><p>I thank Deputies across the House for their support for this legislation.  It was noticeable from the contributions that we all recognise the challenges  families have faced and face, particularly the challenges new families face.  Those first months after the birth of a child are always a challenging time but Covid has magnified every single challenge in society.  The measure we are taking today is a small recognition on behalf of the Government to all parents of children born from 1 November 2019.  A number of Deputies spoke about parents missing out on this.  Any and each parent of a child born since 1 November 2019 will benefit from those additional three weeks and any and each parent of a child born following the passage of this legislation and its signing by the President, hopefully some time next week, will benefit from five weeks of paid parent's leave going forward.</p>  <p>  Aside from that recognition for parents who have had a child during the last year and parents going forward, it also addresses that discrimination against male same-sex married couples when they seek to adopt.  It provides all future adoptive couples with the right to decide which member of the adoptive couple takes the adoptive leave.  It removes the assumption that it would be a woman in a mixed gender couple taking up the leave, it provides for additional members for the Tusla board and it addresses the personal injuries guidelines.</p>  <p>  I would like to take the chance to address some of the issues Deputies raised during the debate.  First, I want to talk about surrogacy.  Contrary to what some Deputies said, I confirm that commissioning surrogate parents can avail of parent's leave in situations where the father's name is on the birth certificate or is recognised as the father.  In that case, both parents will qualify for this parent's leave.  Most surrogate parents will qualify for the leave and benefit provided for under this legislation.</p>  <p>  It has been noted in a number of the contributions that there is a significant gap in the law in this country when it comes to surrogacy.  Yesterday, I brought to Cabinet a report done by the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Conor O'Mahony, on the issue of surrogacy, on the gaps in the law in Ireland and on proposals on how we could address those gaps.  That has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and I have no doubt many Deputies will seek to look at that report.  It is a valuable contribution to this area.  There is a Bill within the Department of Health addressing some of these issues but we all understand that there is a need for legislation to address issues around surrogacy and at all times to do so from a child-centred point of view.</p>  <p>  Deputies spoke about the continued implementation of the work-life balance directive and Deputy Pringle spoke about some elements of that.  There is an obligation on member states to transpose that directive by summer 2022.  We have an extension for certain elements of it to summer 2024.  Included in the areas we have an extension for is the obligation contained within the directive to provide for nine weeks of paid parent's leave.  We are up to five weeks.  It is my intention that we will achieve that nine weeks and that we will do so within the time period given to us.  That is subject to engagement with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at each budget.</p>  <p>  The cost of this per year is a significant investment of &euro;28.6 million and a valuable investment in supporting parents.  I want to see that continue to be extended out in further budgets.  That is my aim and I have said that publicly.  It is subject to resources being available but I will be engaging in each budgetary process to increase the amount of paid parent's leave we provide for each parent.  Future changes will be done by statutory instruments.  Legislation will not be required so that will allow it to be done more quickly.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies raised the important issue of lone parents and that has to be addressed.  I have met the National One Parent Family Alliance and we discussed this legislation and other issues.  Many Deputies rightly recognised that the risk of children living in poverty increases in the situation where it is a one-parent family.  This directive is clear that paid parent's leave cannot be transferable.  Those nine weeks we are seeking to achieve cannot be transferable between parents and we are seeking to implement and transpose this directive with this legislation.  We are going to correctly transpose this directive and the directive is based on the concept that both parents should be taking a parenting role and should be supported by the State in doing so.  Our hands are tied when it comes to not having the leave transferable between parents.</p>  <p>  There is a real need for us to recognise the vulnerability of one-parent families and I discussed that with the National One Parent Family Alliance.  There is a real need for Departments to be much more co-ordinated in their response to the needs of one-parent families.  In my Department, I am looking at the impact of the national childcare scheme, NCS, and how certain elements of that are creating difficulties for one-parent families.  Within the programme for Government, there is a clear recognition of the need to support one-parent families and in particular to look at the good work that was done in the last Oireachtas by the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Its report on the position of lone parents in Ireland was completed three or four years ago but it is still a good piece of work and that was recognised in the programme for Government.  Some provision was made in the budget to remove the &euro;425 weekly income limit on parents in receipt of the one-parent family payment, which was significant.</p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise who can benefit from parent's leave in this Bill because it is not just the parent of the child.  It is the parent of the child along with his or her spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.  It is not just the biological parent who benefits from this legislation.  That is an important flexibility that was written into the legislation in order to recognise the great diversity of family situations that exist in the country.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies spoke about wider issues of leave.  I recognise that Deputy Duncan Smith spoke about a Bill on reproductive leave from Senator Bacik that is before the Seanad and I will examine that.  We will continue to examine and look to expand the types of leave that we provide.  I have indicated what I hope to do in the future expansion of parent's leave.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will know, I am working on introducing a scheme of domestic violence leave, which will be important, particularly in the context where we know that poverty is often a constraint on individuals fleeing situations of domestic violence.  If we can provide them with some paid leave, even in that initial time when they first leave the family home, it gives a small element of support and I am looking forward to bringing proposals on that to Cabinet later this year.</p> <p>I have consulted social partners, trade unions and employers' groups in recent weeks and work on this area is ongoing.  </p> <p> Several Deputies spoke about the importance of what we are doing in removing the discrimination against same-sex male married couples who were not entitled to seek adoptive leave.  Deputy Pringle spoke very eloquently about this very significant step.  It was a lacuna and an anomaly.  It was not deliberate, but it should not have been in our law and it is important that we are able to address that by what we are doing today.  </p> <p> I will deal with a number of smaller points.  Some Deputies referred to Tusla not having enough social workers.  Deputy Cathal Crowe spoke about it in the context of adoption.  After a number of years where the number of social workers was falling, last year the agency had a net gain of 129 social workers.  It is currently undergoing quite an innovative scheme whereby it is looking to take on newly graduated social workers directly into an employment scheme, which I welcome.  </p> <p> There was significant discussion of childcare.  I assure Deputies that I am working very hard to reduce the cost of childcare, and improve the quality and availability of childcare.  As part of that quality element we are ensuring that our childcare professionals are properly paid.  As Deputies probably know, two weeks ago I wrote to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment asking it to begin the process of creating a joint labour committee, JLC, between representatives of childcare providers and the trade unions representing childcare professionals and use that industrial relations mechanism to introduce a wage scheme in that sector to ensure childcare professionals are appropriately remunerated for the amazing work they do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400057#GGG00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am grateful to all Deputies for facilitating debate on this urgent legislation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann so that it can become law before the Easter recess.  I also wish to record my appreciation to the Chief Whip and to members of both the Business Committee and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for enabling the Bill to be read a Second Time today.</p>  <p>  The Bill is a timely and proportionate response to the continued elevated threat and impact of the pandemic.  The time-sensitive nature of the legislation is an inevitable consequence of the constant reassessment of the pandemic and its evolving nature.  I thank Deputies for facilitating its passage in the same co-operative spirit that has enabled similar Bills to pass swiftly since the Covid-19 crisis erupted.  </p>  <p>  This is the fourth Bill the Government has introduced to protect tenants during this pandemic since I came into office.  The virus has mutated and challenged us in different ways, but we have responded to ensure that as best as possible the vulnerable are shielded from the unprecedented economic fallout.  Today&rsquo;s Bill is a further important action to safeguard tenants in the face of an ever-threatening pandemic.  </p>  <p>  In light of this prolonged challenge, I ask Deputies to pass the Bill to enable its early enactment to provide technical amendments to the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies Act 2020, PDRTA, to extend the application of its enhanced tenancy protections for a further three months from 13 April 2021 to 12 July 2021.  The Bill also provides for technical amendments to enhance the interoperability of the PDRTA with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020.</p>  <p>  Subject to the conditions and procedural requirements, the PDRTA currently protects tenants in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy from eviction and rent increases during the period from 11 January 2021 to 12 April 2021.  It is considered that the ongoing threats and impacts of the third wave of Covid-19 necessitate this Bill to extend the protections for a further three months until 12 July 2021.  The three-month time increase is a proportionate response balancing constitutional property rights and the common good.  While the numbers directly invoking this legal protection have been small, it has provided a strong safety net to vulnerable renters and sends a clear signal to the rental system that the State will continue to protect tenants.  In this context and because of strong direct financial supports, we have prevented turmoil in the rental system.  Deputies will be aware that thankfully less than 2% of tenancies end up in dispute, but these protections are required and proportionate, and we need to extend them up to July.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that these protections are separate and distinct from the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, which provides for a moratorium on evictions taking place, with limited exceptions, during a period of 5 km travel restrictions in an area specified in regulations made by the Minister for Health and during the ten days following the lifting of such restrictions.  In broad terms the protections are on separate economic and health grounds, respectively.  The Bill seeks to clarify that a 5 km travel restriction does not affect the legal obligation on a tenant to pay rent, nor should it ever have been the case.  Instead, tenants in circumstances where they cannot pay their rent due to the pandemic can move to avail of the separate protections under this Bill and I encourage people to do so if they have not already.</p>  <p>  This clarification is required as the PDRTA provides the necessary tenancy protections for any tenant in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy.  The Bill removes this duplication and potential confusion over obligations to pay rent.  Importantly, significant and enhanced State income supports are available from the Department of Social Protection.  I encourage any tenant who needs assistance to reach out early to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and to seek every available State income support.  For example, the enhanced illness benefit for Covid-19, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, rent supplement and supplementary welfare allowances can assist tenants to meet their legal obligation to pay rent.  The legislation similar to this that we introduced last August put in place permanent protections to help tenants who fall into rent arrears from the beginning by engaging at an early stage with MABS and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and that is working very well.</p>  <p>  I also encourage landlords to show forbearance and to afford tenants the time to stabilise their income through State support, if necessary.  It is in the interest of both parties to sustain a viable tenancy.  Overall, the State has rightly spent &euro;11.5 billion on Covid-19 welfare supports.  We have not been, and will not be, found wanting in supporting any tenants in difficulty.  </p>  <p>  At this point, the earliest expiry date for the current moratorium on evictions across the State under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 is 15 April 2021, which is ten days after the review date for the expiry of the 5 km travel restrictions.  The Government will consider this matter in light of public health advice in the coming days.  Regardless of that decision, this Bill will ensure protections are in place until 12 July for tenants economically impacted by the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  We recognise that lockdowns are especially difficult for some people and that low-income tenants are disproportionately employed in sectors that are severely affected by Covid-19, such as hospitality and retail.  As I have said, the State is here to help, and we will continue to provide immediate support to families and individuals in private rented accommodation under the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s rent supplement scheme.  The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  </p>  <p>  The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p> <p>The aim is to avoid any tenant going into rent arrears.  That said, the PDRTA complements and supports the provision of rent supplement and other State supports by providing time and security for tenants while engaging with State services in a bid to resolve any financial difficulty.<br/><br/>The Government also recognises that 70% of landlords own one rental property and 86% own one or two rental properties and that Covid-19 has given rise to financial difficulty for some of those mom and pop landlords.  The PDRTA provides the requisite and proportionate balance between the rights and obligations of tenants and property owners in a carefully calibrated manner, recognising the legitimate interests of both.  This strikes an equilibrium between property rights and the common good in the midst of a pandemic. <br/><br/>We have to continue to address the economic and social consequences of Covid-19, protect as many jobs as possible and ensure that families and businesses can manage financially.  The economic consequences of this pandemic are far-reaching, but the hit for certain sectors and for some tenants has been extremely challenging.  The emergency measures introduced by this Government have prevented systemic problems in the rental sector.  The rental measures proposed under this Bill will help further.  Other measures that we brought forward have worked and this an addition and extension to them. <br/><br/>I now wish to outline the provisions of this Bill.  The Long Title and recitals of the Bill describe our policy aims and the policy context in which the limited restrictions on landlords' constitutionally-protected property rights will serve the social common good for three additional months, to 12 July 2021.  The Bill is technical in nature and it contains three sections, with section 3 being a standard provision outlining the Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.<br/><br/>Sections 1 and 2 are the substantive provisions.  I have already given a summary of their intent.  Section 1 provides for a number of amendments to the PDRTA by updating various dates to reflect the extension under this Bill of the emergency period to 12 July 2021.  The proposed<b></b>amendments to the PDRTA provide, subject to conditions and procedural requirements under that Act, for its enhanced tenancy protections to continue to apply from 13 April 2021 to 12 July 2021 where tenants have been economically impacted by Covid-19 and consequently are unable to meet their obligation to pay rent and risk tenancy termination.<br/><br/>The remaining sections are outlined in the remainder of my speech.  The Bill is being introduced against the backdrop of the worst public health crisis in the history of our State and an economic collapse without compare.  It is incumbent on us all and the D&aacute;il to ensure that the protections that are rightly in place for the most vulnerable tenants are extended further to 12 July.<br/><br/>I thank Deputies for their attendance and their interest in this matter.  I look forward to the debate this evening and again tomorrow when we will resume Second Stage and take Committee and Remaining Stages as well.</p></speech>

He is tabling legislation that promises to protect renters.  What he gives with one hand, he takes away with the other.  The Bill extends protections to a small group of renters for a very short period of time.  Crucially, it removes protections from a much larger group of renters with immediate effect.  This would be unacceptable in normal times, but it is totally unacceptable in the difficult and dangerous times we find ourselves living in now.</p>  <p>  Section 1 of the Bill extends from April to July the ban on rent increases and evictions of tenants in arrears due to Covid-19 income loss and in receipt of a Covid-19-related payment.  Section 2, as the Minister outlined - my language would be a little more direct - strips all other tenants in rent arrears of the protection against eviction linked to the 5 km travel restriction.  Before I outline the problems with these two sections, I want to express in the strongest possible terms the dissatisfaction of many in the Opposition with how the Minister has handled the tabling of this legislation.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister requested that members of the housing committee waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  The committee met with officials from his Department on Monday last for a briefing in advance of making its decision.  We were not given a copy of the legislation.  Following some protestation from some members at the briefing, we were shown screen shots of the legislation on Microsoft Teams.  There was no adequate explanation as to the reason this legislation was not brought forward sooner.  We have all known for some time that these deadlines were approaching.  There was no explanation as to the reason protections for tenants in arrears due to Covid-19 income loss were being only extended for three months and no justification provided for stripping all other tenants in arrears of the protection against eviction.</p>  <p>  While Government Deputies and Senators were happy to accede to the Minister's request - they were remarkably silent on section 2 - the Opposition in committee were united that this was not an acceptable way to proceed.  We proposed a compromise that the committee would waive pre-legislative scrutiny for the Bill in respect of section 1 if the Minister would remove the controversial section 2 but, unfortunately, Deputies and Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party refused to support us.  Other Opposition Deputies helpfully proposed an emergency session during last week to deal with pre-legislative scrutiny, but that was also rebuffed.  While I am sure Government Deputies will justify their decision on the same grounds as the Minister has done today, namely, the need to extend the limited protections of section 1, they will also have to explain to their constituents who are renters in arrears why they are being stripped of vital protections through the provisions of section 2.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Minister got his way.  There was an equally split Government-Opposition vote in committee in public session last Tuesday.  The Minister, having got his way with the support of Deputies and Senators from Government in committee, is also trying to steamroll the Bill through the House.  Once again, we are dealing in the D&aacute;il with important legislation with limited time, particularly for Committee Stage debate and votes, with all Stages to be taken in the Seanad on Saturday.  This is not an acceptable way to deal with significant changes to complex legislation such as the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  Unfortunately, this is increasingly the way in which the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, does his business.  This is not the first time, nor the only time, when dealing with Covid legislation that the committee and the D&aacute;il have not been treated properly, in my view.  </p>  <p>  With respect to the Bill, I will now deal with the two fundamental problems.  With respect to section 1, extending the protections for tenants in arrears due to Covid-19 income loss and in receipt of a Covid-19-related payment is a good thing, but it makes no sense to extend those protections for only three months.  Many of the people who are availing of that protection will likely not be back in employment until the end of the year, if not next year, and, therefore, they will need those protections for much longer.  What the Minister also did not say was that according to the Residential Tenancies Board data, which it sent to me last week, only 407 tenants have availed of this protection since it was introduced last August and that is out of more than 200,000 tenants in the private rental sector who are not availing of the housing assistance payment, HAP, or the rental assistance scheme, RAS, and 300,000 tenancies across the private rental sector.  This Bill protects only a tiny group of tenants.  At the same time, section 2 removes protections for renters in arrears, many through no fault of their own.  The number then affected is likely to be much greater.</p>  <p>  Who are we talking about here?  We could, for example, have tenants who have not lost income because of Covid-19 and are not on a Covid-19-related payment but were hit with unreasonable rent increases in 2019 and 2020 by their landlords, rent increases which may be in line with the RPZ in the areas covered or higher than 4% outside of those areas, and are now falling into arrears.  The difficulty is that allowing a landlord to issue a notice to quit and pursue an eviction where such tenants cannot pay rent puts those tenants and their children at increased risk from infection with Covid-19 because they will have to start viewing properties and, therefore, will be moving about more than is required.  If they cannot find rental properties - we know this is an increasing problem - they could be forced into emergency accommodation, congregated settings, again putting them at even greater risk of Covid-19.  Therefore, the protections should not just be for those who are economically impacted but also for those who, as a consequence of losing their tenancy, could be at increased risk of infection in either of the situations I have outlined.</p> <p> This is not just my view or that of many Members of the Opposition.  Threshold wrote to the housing committee this week to say that section 2 of the Bill will lead to "private renters [being] evicted even when the moratorium is in place".  The letter from Threshold went on to say that this provision is "unnecessary and will cause considerable confusion and distress to a significant cohort of private renters".  The Simon Communities of Ireland, members of which work at the front line of our homelessness crisis, has stated in correspondence to Deputies: "Such a blanket removal of protections from a vulnerable group at a time of crisis is unnecessarily punitive."  Both organisations have called for the withdrawal of the controversial section 2 and better measures to deal with rent arrears.</p> <p> I want to be very clear on a particular point.  None of us in the Opposition is saying that if somebody has the means to pay his or rent and is wilfully refusing to do so, that he or should have any protections.  Of course people in that situation should not have such protections.  We are talking about groups of tenants who have fallen into rent arrears for reasons other than Covid-19 income loss and who continue to need protection.  If this Bill passes, they will lose protection and will be at risk of losing their tenancy and becoming homeless.  That is not something I can support.</p> <p> Threshold and the Simon Communities of Ireland are right that section 2 of the Bill is punitive, unnecessary and will lead to the loss of accommodation and to homelessness.  The section must be removed and I urge all Deputies to support the Opposition amendments proposing that removal.  Equally, section 1 is not strong enough.  Struggling renters need more than a few months to get back on track and I urge Deputies to support our amendments in that regard.  There is something very Orwellian in a Minister coming into the House and claiming that a Bill will protect renters when not only the Opposition but leading advocacy organisations for tenants and front-line homeless services say it does the very opposite.  Of course, Fianna F&aacute;il could never be trusted to stand up for renters and this Bill from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, proves once again that this is the case.</p> <p> In the time remaining to me, I want to comment on the wider issues in the rental market that are relevant to this Bill, some of which are in the news today.  The Residential Tenancies Board's latest rent index shows that rents continue to rise despite the pandemic, with a State-wide increase of 2.7% and a 2% rise in Dublin.  The commuter belt has seen an astonishing 5% increase in rents.  Nine counties show rent increases above 4%, including 8% in Carlow, 10% in Longford and 11% in Leitrim.  No matter what the level of increase, tenants simply cannot afford any rise at all.  This has to stop.  All the while, the disorderly exit of tenancies from the private rental market continues, with 20,000 lost since 2017.</p> <p> I see no evidence from this Government that it has a plan to deal with any of this.  We need greater security of tenure, greater affordability, a ban on rent increases and a comprehensive plan to secure the stability and sustainability of the rental sector for landlords and tenants alike.  I urge the Minister, in drawing up his forthcoming housing plan, to engage with the Opposition on ideas about how to do this.  Otherwise, he will continue the same failed policies of his predecessors in respect of the private rental sector that have led to a dysfunctional market which is putting increasing numbers of tenants at risk of losing their homes or having to pay ever increasing rents.</p></speech>

However, the ban provided for in this Bill is not the same as what was previously in place.  We in the Labour Party have always said that we will work constructively with the Government to do whatever we can to solve this crisis, keep people in their homes and allow them to have hope that they have a future in Ireland.  However, the stop-start nature of the eviction ban and the periodic need to produce new legislation to cover another few months is becoming intolerable.  The Minister mentioned that this is the fourth Bill to extend the ban on evictions.  Nobody here thinks that we will wake up on 31 July and Covid will be gone.  Even if everybody in the world was vaccinated by that date and Covid had disappeared, the impact of this pandemic will last far longer than any perceived ending or winding down of the virus.</p>  <p>  The protections that are required need to look beyond 31 July towards a longer-term view.  The time for these periodic legislative provisions is well and truly up.  My fellow members of the Business Committee and I see with increasing regularity that it is the time of year when the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is asking us to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on another residential tenancies Bill, and away we go again for another quarter.  We cannot continue like this.  It is dawning on people everywhere, including in this country, that the impact of this virus is going to last a long time.  Our legislation needs to be robust enough and take a sufficiently long view to account, as best as possible, for that reality.</p>  <p>  The protection of renters and the banning of evictions are key to that.  They are key to tackling the homelessness crisis and everything we have been experiencing for the past ten years.  The past five years have been particularly vicious, with people presenting at local authority homeless counters and having to go into emergency accommodation, which is generally provided in congregated settings.  We know that the virus lives, breeds and is most comfortable in such settings.  The eviction ban, when it worked at the beginning of the pandemic, was a good thing.  However, what is proposed in this Bill is not that.  The original protections are being diminished and stripped away and we cannot stand over that.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to remove the blanket moratorium on evictions of renters in arrears.  Prior to the pandemic, it was estimated that one in ten rental households had missed a rental payment due to financial difficulties.  We are in no doubt that this number has increased almost exponentially due to the impact of the Covid crisis.  The Government is now leaving he door open for anyone in private residential tenancies to lose the roof over his or her head.  The Minister has said that the measures introduced in the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 that encourage tenants to obtain services and advice from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and make arrangements with landlords have been a success.  They have not been a success.  He should talk to Threshold or any of the stakeholders and they will tell him that.  The take-up has been very low and the legislation has not provided any real solution for renters who are in arrears.  What has provided solutions and helped to protect people from losing their homes is an eviction ban.</p>  <p>  This Bill is being brought forward at the same time as the Minister for Finance is flagging, very clearly and unsubtly, that changes to the pandemic unemployment payment are coming down the line.  That payment will be reviewed again in June.  For renters in financial difficulty who hear certain language from Government and see kites being flown about the PUP being restructured and that we are living beyond our means, mid-summer will be a time of huge anxiety and worry.  People are concerned that they are going to lose their homes and this Bill does not give them any comfort.</p>  <p>  I again ask the Minister to talk to the stakeholders, including Threshold.  An example it gave of a tenant in difficulty is a man who has been renting his home for five years.  He works full time and never had a problem paying his rent until the landlord increased it by 50% even though the tenancy is located within a rent pressure zone, RPZ.  The tenant did not know about the RPZ rules and agreed to pay the increase.  Understandably, he began to accrue rent arrears and he was subsequently issued with a notice of termination.  This tenant is now disputing the unlawful rent increase and the notice of termination but he is not going to be protected under this legislation in seeing that process through.  Another man was working part time and living in his rental home less than a year when the agent claimed he had arrears.  He knew he was short on the rent one month but he has been told he was short on three occasions, which is not the case.  If this Bill goes through, that man will not be protected.  These are just two examples of God knows how many people who are not being captured by the system at the moment.  This legislation, as it is currently constructed, is very worrying from the perspective of protecting such people.</p>  <p>  Linking the ban on evictions to the 5 km restriction was a clear error by the Government.  It was given an opportunity to remedy it before Christmas by way of the Minister extending, by order, the applicability of the ban in circumstances of reduced restrictions, having regard to the current public health guidelines.  We will be making the same proposal in our amendments tomorrow and we hope the Minister will accept them this time.  The ban on evictions and rent increases introduced by the Government less than a year ago helped people and gave them certainty in a very uncertain time.  That certainty is being eroded and stripped back.  The Bill before us today does not provide certainty at a time when people are at their most crestfallen and low.  They do not know when this period of crisis is going to end.</p> <p>There are problems in respect of jobs and job security as well.  They now have the uncertainty of not having a roof over their heads to compound all of that at a time when we should be looking to a brighter future.</p> <p> The Minister does have a significant opportunity here to accept amendments tomorrow and to take a longer term view of banning evictions.  He could use Covid-19 as an excuse.  Rather than waste a crisis, he could use it as a reason to keep people in their homes and build the houses he wants to build and has committed to building, including social and affordable housing and everything else he has said.  We can keep people in their homes more by doing that.  It is about bringing the supply in so that we do not have people turning up at the Fingal County Council homeless desk in Blanchardstown or the homeless desk in other local authorities.  It is to reduce the number of people turning up at the centres of the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland or the Simon Community or ringing the Threshold lines.  All of these things will continue to happen.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to back up his aspirations on the supply side.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that.</p> <p> I wish to comment on a not-unrelated element of this.  I have been contacted by several estate agents in recent weeks to discuss what is going on in the housing market.  The problem is impacting younger buyers and those buying their first homes in particular.  This element of the market is going 10% or 15% above any of the trends in other parts of the market because people are going up against institutional investors.  It is especially tough for them since they are unable to view the houses because of the restrictions.  That is understandable in a way.  However, it is having this impact on the people who can least afford it.  They are being pressured by all this uncertainty into paying inflated prices.  We all know there is a correlation, and when house prices are inflated, especially at the end of the market made up of first-time buyers buying one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments or two-bedroom or three-bedroom homes, that ultimately has an impact on rental prices as well.  That is happening now.  I wonder whether the Minister is getting the same representations.  These estate agents are not happy about this.  They say these people are being pressured and forced into bad decisions.  They are going up against institutional investors and they do not have a hope of matching those investors.  It is an unfair playing field.</p> <p> This is all linked, as the Minister knows.  The Minister should use this as an opportunity to get more things right than wrong about housing.  Unfortunately, this Bill is balanced on the wrong side.  It can be improved with the amendments being offered by the Opposition.  I hope the Minister will look at them overnight and accept them tomorrow.</p></speech>

When the Minister was first appointed to Cabinet, I knew he was someone who would be a doer and who would try his utmost to help in all aspects of the housing crisis.  This is one key fundamental part of it and the Minister has my support in that regard.  I am vocal sometimes with regard to some of my views on the housing crisis but I imagine the Minister can appreciate the significant challenges that lie ahead of a new generation of first-time buyers in Ireland and people who are renting as well.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise a particular point that has not been heard much today.  It is something I came across and it is quite common in rural communities.  A person may inherit a home as a result of a bereavement in a family.  A person may accidentally end up with a house and end up renting it for income and to pay the bills and so on.  I have come across a couple of situations - I will admit they are limited - but they were severe and significant for these people as a result of the provisions made by the Government.  The tenants were involved in serious criminal activity.  They were blatantly refusing to pay rent when they were in a position to do so.  Yet, they were getting off almost scot-free.  I call on the Minister to put a little focus on that.  Often in politics there is a perception that all landlords are multimillionaires running around the country treating tenants poorly.  However, there are other situations.  In my constituency of Cork East there are some people who ended up in possession of a home, whether small or large, through a bereavement or inheritance and they have found themselves stuck in a couple of situations.  The tenants in these situations do all tenants an injustice and damage.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I wish to highlight that the protections we brought forward were a major benefit to many families.  It gave them certainty and a degree of security in what was a highly uncertain time for them.  These are the times we are going through now.  It is this aspect I wish to put in context.</p>  <p>  The Minister knows my views from the perspective of student renters.  I am heartened to hear he will continue to engage with the Union of Students in Ireland.  I hope he will meet representatives of the union soon.  I welcome the decision of An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to meet USI representatives to discuss their efforts to improve the situation of students throughout the country.  It is critical to listen to the message from USI.  In reality, many student renters in the country are dealt a cruel hand in terms of the landlords they experience.  Many such landlords are major pension funds that are investing heavily in student accommodation.  There are major landlords based within cities.  Few exceptions are made when people are going through highly difficult circumstances.  This is no direct criticism of the Minister but it is an area where I wish the Government had done more.  It affects people in rural communities like mine in the constituency of Cork East.  The tradition is for those who go on to higher education, whether apprenticeships, universities, institutes of technology or FETAC degrees, to move from home and rent in city centres.  They have been put in precarious financial circumstances and, frankly, do not have the money to meet the rents.  They end up being evicted and they are dealt with in a poor fashion.  I will finish on that point and appeal to the Minister to put a particular focus on that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400060#KKK00300"><p>This Bill strips away from renters many of their protections from being evicted.  It is unbelievable the Minister would include section 2 in the middle of a pandemic when, under public health guidelines, we should be trying not to put people out of their homes and having to look again for accommodation.  Yet, that could happen with this Bill.</p>  <p>  This is the fourth time the Minister has brought forward this legislation.  One question must be asked.  Why did he not bring in this legislation for 12 months?  Now, he has brought it in for three more months.  Everyone knows we are going to be back here in three months' time to extend it.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has called for a ban on evictions and rent increases until at least the end of the year.  That would help.</p>  <p>  A report out today shows that in Cork city alone there has been a rent increase of 4.5%.  People may ask why Deputy Gould and Sinn F&eacute;in are on about evictions and people being evicted.  The reason is that many people cannot afford the high rents they face.  There is so much more I want to say.  This is typical of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  When push comes to shove, they back the landlords over ordinary people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400060#KKK00400"><p>I agree with the comments of previous Deputies on the process around this.  There should be time for all legislation we know is to come up for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Too often with housing legislation the Minister seeks to waive that process.  I put it to him the members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage are all happy and willing to engage in thorough pre-legislative scrutiny of any Bills he wants to bring forward.  I would encourage the Minister to work with us in future rather than try to bypass that process, as he has done in this case.</p>  <p>  The single biggest achievement in stopping families going into homelessness since 2014, when there was a major increase in families and individual adults going into homelessness, has come in the past year when the ban on evictions was brought in as a result of Covid-19.  That was the single biggest achievement.</p> <p>If the Bill is passed without amendment, it will further reduce the protections for renters and increase the flow of families and individuals into homelessness.  The level of protection for renters during a pandemic in Ireland will be the same as the level in many other European countries at all times.  That is the only protection there will be.</p> <p> I wish to raise a point with the Minister.  Like other Deputies, including myself, I am sure he has examined the figures concerning the number of families that have entered homelessness during the past year and seen that the greatest decrease was during those months when the strongest levels of protection against eviction were in place for renters.  I am also sure that he has noticed that the highest peak in the number of families being evicted into homelessness was in August 2020 after he lifted protections for renters.  Why has he not realised the importance of these measures in protecting families from homelessness?  I received a phone call today from someone who was working in this field.  That person could not understand why the Minister and his Department, having seen the success of these measures in preventing homelessness, have not acted on them and tried to imbed them.  What are needed are not further extensions, but reforms that will protect renters in the long term and bring us into line with other European countries.  That is the approach that should be taken.</p> <p> I have a difficulty with previous statements by the Minister regarding homelessness.  When I was last in the Chamber with him, I asked whether the National Quality Standards Framework, NQSF, applied to all providers of emergency accommodation to renters who had been evicted into homelessness.  He stated that it did, including to private providers.  At a meeting of the housing committee the next day, however, Mr. Brendan Kenny of Dublin City Council confirmed that was not the case.  Despite that, the Minister repeated in national media interviews a few weeks later that these standards applied to all providers, including private ones.  Since then, "RT&Eacute; Investigates" has confirmed that the NQSF is not applied to private providers.  If the Minister would like to look at them, I have with me copies of inspection reports into homeless accommodation providers.  They confirm that he was incorrect when he told the D&aacute;il at the end of January that the NQSF applied to all providers.  Will he read these reports and consider the difference between the report for a provider that is subject to the NQSF, which is ten pages long, and the report for a private provider, which is just one page long and only contains a small set of questions?  Will he look into this detail and correct the D&aacute;il record, given that he was wrong in January?  I asked him previously to correct it.  He should do the House that courtesy.  We deserve correct information from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on these issues.</p> <p> In terms of rent arrears, approximately one in three households in the private rented sector, or 70,000, had insufficient income prior to the pandemic to meet the minimum costs of living after meeting its housing costs.  That figure comes from the ESRI.  Rents are well in excess of what a mortgage would cost in most parts of the country and sharp increases in rent have been a key driver in increasing the number of people who have been evicted into homelessness since 2014.  We need long-term measures that will address this issue and bring us into line with other EU countries.</p> <p> The complex set of rules and limited protections that have been introduced have not worked well.  There has been a low take-up.  The Minister does not have to take just my word for that.  Threshold has stated that uptake of the scheme established by the Act has been low and that it is complex and provides no significant solution to tenant indebtedness.  Threshold is concerned that many private renters will not be able to avail of the protections afforded by the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 and could be lawfully evicted during the pandemic.</p> <p>The Minister and his Department are taking a mistaken approach in section 2 of this Bill.  The Simon Communities in Ireland have stated that the section does not live up to the Bill's preamble, as it allows some private renters to be evicted even at the peak of a Covid wave if they are in rent arrears, and that such a blanket removal of protection from a vulnerable group at this time of crisis is unnecessarily punitive.  Will the Minister consider withdrawing section 2, which has been strongly criticised by organisations that work with renters and people who are experiencing homelessness?</p> <p> We need to recognise that finding a new home during the pandemic has not become any easier over the past while and that removing these protections will lead to an increase in homelessness.  Over the past year, homelessness figures show a strong correlation between decreases in the number of families becoming homeless and the introduction of protections for renters.  The number at risk of homelessness is far greater than the small cohort of people who are registered for protection against eviction on grounds of rent arrears.  We need to put in place solutions for this cohort of renters and their landlords and consider a combination of measures, for example, a rent arrears fund to help clear arrears.</p> <p> The Minister is proposing a cut-off point of 12 July under the Bill.  A later cut-off point would be much better, as it would give the Minister and the Department time to introduce much-needed long-term reforms and improvements in the sector.  The Minister has committed to trying to improve conditions in the sector.  The programme for Government makes that commitment as well.  Why not start that work now instead of making rolling updates every few months?</p> <p> Preventing homelessness is cost-effective.  It also spares families and individuals the trauma of losing their homes and the negative consequences that flow from that.  We know that shifting away from emergency responses and into protecting renters and long-term solutions, for example, long-term accommodation, is a much better use of resources.  We also know that investing more in tenancy protection services, mediation, supports, debt resolutions and payment plans is a much better approach.</p> <p> I urge the Minister to accept some of our amendments tomorrow so that we can improve the Bill.  I urge him to take a long-term approach to improving security in this sector and driving down the number of people who are evicted into homelessness.  I also urge him to update the D&aacute;il record and withdraw his incorrect statement that the NQSF applies to all providers of emergency accommodation, including private ones, given that that is not the case.  He should update the record.</p></speech>

We are 19 days away from the current legislation expiring, at which point people will be at risk.  Government members on the committee made the decision to ensure that the maximum time was available to the greatest number of representatives in the House during this Stage as opposed to a smaller number of us carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny and either the current legislation expiring or this Bill being rushed through the House.  That is the context of our decision and I stand over it.  Far more Deputies will spend their time speaking against the Bill than for it.</p> <p>That is the nature of the allocation of speaking time in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> I am scratching my head a little on this issue.  I accept the bona fides of all Members who have spoken today on the Bill.  I presume it is not being used just to land another charge of negativity against the Government.  However, when one considers the renters who might not have the same protection under the Bill as they did previously, one should remember that as long as the 5 km restriction is in place, the protections will remain and we have no certainty yet regarding when the 5 km restriction will end.</p></speech>

Most people acknowledge the need to suspend international travel at this time as part of the State's pandemic measures, but it is also recognised that this puts significant pressure on an already crippled sector.  Aviation workers need financial support and protection during this time.  The sector also needs a survival and recovery plan to be put in place to help it to recover when it is safe to travel again.  I ask the Minister of State to outline her plans to support the recovery of the sector.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400062#MMM01500"><p>Legislation to provide for the introduction of the mandatory quarantine system recently entered into force.  Contractual arrangements have now been finalised and it is the intention of the Government to commence the operation of mandatory quarantine this week.  The Department of Health is leading this process, supported by officials from several Departments, including the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Transport, Justice and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and via input from the private sector.</p><p>Passengers who have been in one of the designated states within 14 days of their arrival in Ireland must complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a designated facility.  The 14-day period of quarantine can be reduced if travellers undergo testing on arrival and again on day ten and that testing does not return a positive for Covid-19.  Mandatory quarantine applies to all passengers travelling from designated states, regardless of nationality, and includes Irish citizens.  The aim of mandatory quarantine is to protect the population from challenges posed by new variants of concern.</p><p>Turning to the other aspects of the Deputy's question, the Irish aviation sector is critical to the economic development of the country.  It is a key enabler of international trade and business, including foreign direct investment and tourism.  However, it is clear that the aviation sector in Ireland and internationally is currently experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history.  Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels of activity.  Traffic in 2020 was down approximately 80% on 2019 levels and revenue has fallen dramatically.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector.  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the Covid restrictions support scheme, the credit guarantee scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, working capital scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021.  Irish airlines and airports have availed of more than &euro;200 million through these supports to date.  Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises.</p><p>As regards specific supports for employment, we have the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is a key component of the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The scheme has been extended to the end of June 2021.</p><p>In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021.  A part of this package, comprising more than &euro;21 million, is being provided to the regional airports programme, RAP.  The new RAP, which was published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025.  The airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport, Knock.  In addition, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports through a new one-year Covid-19 regional State airports programme.</p><p>The European Commission has approved under EU state aid rules a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread.  This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure, an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies.  The aid will take the form of direct grants.  Airports will be invited to apply for funding under the scheme shortly.  The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and make a recovery from the impacts of Covid-19.  The possibility that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021 cannot be excluded, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season.</p><p>My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis.  On 5 March 2021, I chaired a special meeting of the steering committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF.  The NCADF, which was established through a recommendation of the national aviation policy in 2016, brings together senior stakeholders in the aviation industry, mostly at chief executive level.  The meeting provided an opportunity for very constructive engagement with members of the committee, together with other senior leaders from Irish aviation.</p><p>It is clear from my engagement with the aviation sector that the priority issue for all those involved in the industry is that of planning to progress, as a matter of urgency, to the reopening of international travel as soon as circumstances allow.  To this end, a sub-group of the NCADF has been tasked with developing proposals for restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector.  It is anticipated that the sub-group will present its report to the steering group of the NCADF next month.  The work of the NCADF will inform Government decisions on the restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector, which will also have regard to developments at EU and international level, as well as public health advice.</p><p>The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy.  It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we remain committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity and to rebound quickly when circumstances allow.</p></speech>

I saw a communication sent within the company which offered staff here the opportunity to move to Manchester and base themselves there on local terms and conditions, that is, Manchester terms and conditions.  That is deeply concerning for those workers.  It has been said that this is happening because there is such uncertainty regarding the Irish response and commitment to the aviation sector.  It really indicates that those companies want a response from the Government that gives them a clear outline of what the future holds.  We know Covid is very difficult, but Air New Zealand got an investment of $900 million, while Air France got &euro;7 billion and Lufthansa got &euro;10 billion.  I ask the Minister of State to give confidence to workers in the sector that their position is secure and to outline in clear terms that a plan is in place for the recovery of the sector.</p></speech>

The airports and airlines have had access to that funding, which includes the temporary wage subsidy schemes and other supports.  As a result of the very difficult circumstances the aviation industry is experiencing, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021.  A part of this package, more than &euro;21 million is to be provided for the regional airports programme.  That gives those airports security and certainty around funding out to 2025.  Airports eligible for RAP supports are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport, Knock.  In addition, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports.</p>  <p>  It is important that I reiterate the supports the Government is providing and will continue to provide to the aviation sector.  We are in regular contact with the sector and the key stakeholders about the future of the aviation sector.</p></speech>

I mentioned the situation at Manchester Airport.  I refer to the operations at Shannon and Cork airports.  I raised this issue with departmental officials at a public meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communication Networks.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned in respect of the issue.  Workers in the sector are deeply concerned by it.  Does the Minister of State share that concern?  To what degree have the Department, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, assessed the impact of Covid on the sector?  What sort of aviation sector can we expect post Covid?  Has any empirical assessment been carried out in that regard?  What scale of lay-offs is the Minister of State expecting?  I believe everything needs to be done to support the sector, notwithstanding the challenges of Covid.  For example, there are proposals in respect of a German model of support for workers that has been advocated by unions in the sector but has not been taken up.</p></speech>

All Members understand the importance of aviation for Ireland as an island nation, including for foreign direct investment, tourism and connectivity as an island.  I chaired a special meeting of the steering committee of the NCADF.  My departmental officials maintain regular contact with the sector.  The NCADF was established through the recommendation of the national aviation policy in 2016 and brings together all the key stakeholders within the aviation industry.  That meeting provided a very constructive opportunity for that engagement around a roadmap for recovery at the appropriate time while obviously taking into account the public health measures and what is happening at EU and UK levels.</p>  <p>The Deputy can be assured that every necessary support will be given.  We are constantly watching and monitoring this matter.  There is considerable uncertainty in Europe today.  The numbers of people infected with Covid-19 have increased.  This is not just an Irish issue, it is a global issue.  I assure the Deputy the aviation sector is critical to the Government.</p></speech>

It is the only question.  What I have heard over the past five minutes has not given any comfort to me or any of the thousands of workers who are watching and concerned about the future viability of their livelihoods and lives.  I must ask again what is the view of the Minister of State on the future viability of the aviation industry.  The people also want to hear the view of the Minister for Transport on the matter and I would welcome that.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400063#NNN00500"><p>As I said earlier, the aviation industry is absolutely critical for Ireland and its foreign direct investment, tourism, economy and for the functioning of an island nation.  This Government acted quickly when the pandemic broke last year and offered a large range of supports.  The airlines and aviation sector have benefited from more than &euro;200 million of that suite of supports.</p>  <p>  This is, obviously, an evolving crisis.  It is going to take a number of years for the aviation industry to reach pre-Covid-19 levels of international travel.  That is the opinion of key analysts and is widely recognised and accepted.  It is critical we do everything we can and engage with all the stakeholders on a roadmap to that recovery when the time is right.  That is what I am doing with my officials.  We are meeting with the national civil aviation forum to work on that roadmap and pathway out when the time is right.  There is too much uncertainty.  As the Deputy knows, we have mandatory hotel quarantine starting this week in Ireland.  We have an epidemiological situation at European and international levels that is concerning.  We have done very well in Ireland in managing the virus but we have to ensure continually that we are monitoring it while preparing a roadmap for a route out when the time is right.</p>  <p>  There are supports in place and we will continue to engage with the sector, including our airports and airlines.  I hear the Deputy's concerns around employment and that is why we have put in place a large range of supports, including the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and commercial rates waivers for the airlines.  It is a difficult time and it is only through engaging with the key stakeholders that we will find that roadmap out.  It will not be an easy road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400063#NNN00600"><p>It will certainly not be an easy road.  It is a pretty desolate road at the moment.  We have consistently been calling for action.  The language is so familiar, as it has been for months.  The Minister of State mentioned the fact the EWSS has been put in place, as was the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was before that.   We are talking about a survival package, a recovery package that is going to protect jobs.</p>  <p>  Four Aer Lingus aeroplanes that would otherwise have taken off from Ireland will now be taking off from Manchester.  This has been flagged to us on the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks for a long time.  It is not going to be like the old days.  It will not be a case of rocking up to Dublin Airport to find someone has put a chain on the gates, saying all the jobs are gone.  It is not going to be one big event.  Jobs are going to go in dribs and drabs.  They will be shaved off.  That is what is happening.  When four aeroplanes that were resident in Ireland go, they are gone and the jobs will go with them.  Baggage handlers are going.  Fuellers are going.  They are going in ones, two, sixes and dozens, but they are going.  Their livelihoods are gone.  That is happening right now and there is deafening silence from the Government on the issue.  It is the same thing over and over again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400063#NNN00700"><p>I must remind the Deputy of the uncertainty we are facing.  We were all hopeful this time last year that we would be out of this pandemic within a number of months but that has not been the case.  As I said, the Government acted fast by putting in supports and those measures are still there, including PUP, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  All of those are also available to the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  I know many people have lost their jobs.  It is a really difficult time for many families.  We need to try to protect as many jobs as we can, not only in the aviation sector but in every sector.  That is done through the broad range of supports that are available across sectors, including the aviation industry.</p>  <p>  Working with the aviation stakeholders around what the recovery will look like is critical and that is what I am doing with my Department.  It is difficult to see what that recovery will look like now, when we are in the middle of the pandemic, but that work is ongoing and proposals will be brought forward over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The workers are asking for a safe return to travel, as we have all been asking for.  We want a roadmap back with clearly defined public health guidelines and milestones.  That is not easy, we know that, but the European Commission is working on a digital green pass, albeit there is a lot more detail to come on that.  The Taoiseach stated earlier he is supportive of that and it is offering some light at the end of the tunnel.  However, we need our Government to provide a proper roadmap.  We do not need Government Senators pouring honey into the ears of workers out there when the Government of which they are a part is doing very little to provide a roadmap.  Every single worker in the aviation industry, from the ground to the cockpit, knows they are going to be the last industry to come back.  They know that and have known it since the former Taoiseach made his speech in Washington last year. Those workers want and deserve a roadmap.  They also deserve supports because their jobs and livelihoods are going to be gone.</p></speech>

That is why I am engaging with the aviation sector, those who are at the coalface within the industry, around what that reopening will look like when the public heath advice is there.  Now is the time to be working on that and to protect as many jobs as possible.  That is the work I am doing with my officials within the national civil aviation forum.  There is a subgroup relating to bringing back proposals around what that reopening will look like.</p>  <p>  I must reiterate that it is a very uncertain time within a number of sectors.  We know there are going to be changes and this is a moving roadmap as to what recovery will look like.  In the meantime, we must try to support the industry as best we can and support that connectivity.  We must support our airports so that they are able to rebound as easily and quickly as possible when the time is right.  We must also protect as many jobs as possible, not just in aviation but in every other sector that depends on it.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that the Department is very aware of the challenges facing the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as it works hard to manage the backlog in the driver testing and theory testing service.  The driving test service is not currently operating as normal due to the impact of Covid-19.  Tests are only available, under level 5 restrictions, to essential workers. This has had a significant impact on waiting times.  RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extraordinarily difficult conditions.  The driving test is conducted in an enclosed space for a period of over 15 minutes, where physical distancing is not possible.  Given the significant risk to testers when conducting a driving test, the Government has deemed that the driver testing service should be available only for essential workers in level 5 Covid-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed.  While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the RSA is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5.  This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.  Following discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months.</p> <p>The process of recruitment is now under way.  However, it will take some time for people to be selected and trained.  These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers which I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020.  The provision of extra testers will not on its own suffice to address the problem.  One of the difficulties is with the capacity of test centres themselves, given limits on throughput due to Covid-19.</p></speech>

I read one document we had not previously seen in the media at the weekend, which outlined the concern in the RSA about the impact the backlog will have on road safety and insurance costs.  Those are real issues that need to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The limited capacity that is in place currently is not even being used at 100%.  It is being used at 75% because essential workers cannot get lessons in order to sit their test.  In effect, they are being held up earlier in the queue.  If they had their lessons completed, they could get a test.  That is an anomaly raised with the RSA.  Is that something on which the Minister of State has sought advice from NPHET and will driving lessons be allowed to resume on 5 April?</p></speech>

There is a limit to the number of tests that can be physically carried out each day due to the level 5 restrictions.  Even with the hire of extra driver testers, that in itself will not help the current backlog due to the time involved and the limitations on the throughput in the centres.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke that we are in constant contact with the RSA, which is working very hard to come up with ways to reduce the backlog when the level 5 restrictions are lifted in order to carry out more tests per day.  Overtime is being considered to allow tests to be carried out later in the evening and at weekends.  A number of measures are under consideration, but while level 5 restrictions are in place we are curtailed for public health reasons.  We are trying to keep everybody safe - the instructor and the learner as well.</p></speech>

The RSA has clearly said there is spare capacity currently as essential workers cannot sit the test because they have not completed their lessons.  I am not trying to make a meal out of it, but I ask the Minister of State to go back to the RSA and confirm whether what I have outlined is the case.  The issue of concern is NPHET's advice on essential workers being able to get their essential driver training, EDT, lessons.  I seek clarity on that because if lessons could go ahead then the full testing capacity that is available could be used.  I urge the Minister of State to follow up on the matter.</p>  <p>  The RSA sought 80 additional testers to address the backlog.  It outlined the difference 80 testers would make versus 40.  Will the Minister of State provide the extra 40 testers?</p></speech>

I have sanctioned 40 extra testers and they should be in place by the end of June.  Given the public health restrictions under level 5, there is a physical limit to the number of tests that can be undertaken.  I assure the Deputy that if more testers are required then more will be sanctioned.  We are in constant communication with the RSA on the matter.  Public health is our primary concern.  Every question the Deputy has raised relates to public health.  I accept that it is very frustrating for people who are trying to progress with their driving lessons and to get their test but the reason for the backlog is due to Covid-19 and trying to protect people.  The RSA and the testers have done a very good job on minimising the spread of the virus because of the protocols they have in place.</p></speech>

At the same time, it is recognised that there is a pressing need for Ireland to have the port capacity in place to exploit the opportunities presented by offshore renewable energy, ORE, with the programme for Government targeting a capacity of 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on 1 December 2020 and it outlined the potential for Rosslare Port to service the emerging offshore wind sector in Ireland and the scale of the investment in infrastructure needed depending on a number of options.  Rosslare is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with all investments funded from port revenues.  This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding.  Some of these ports are also examining the business potential of ORE.</p>  <p>  At my request, officials have commenced an assessment of options for the facilitation of ORE by the ports, including possible funding under the European recovery and resilience facility.  However, it was decided this would not be one of the projects going forward to Europe as part of Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan due to prioritisation of other more mature projects that are in line with EU timelines to maximise Ireland's overall funding.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to explore whether there is any other funding available to assist with the provision of ORE facilities at ports.  In particular, officials are currently engaging with the European Commission seeking changes to the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the next funding stream for 2021-2023 and also in an effort to influence the next trans-European network for transport, TEN-T, regulation so that green infrastructure projects will be included.</p></speech>

He said he understood that there was a much needed, urgent investment required for Rosslare.  He gave an assurance on the radio to Wexford people and to the country.  Rosslare is of national importance.  He said there would be significant investment in Rosslare Europort because it is strategically critical for the country and it would potentially be of benefit to the region to have the economic centre and activity.  Given that assurance, I cannot understand why we have not seen the money if it is an urgent investment requirement and why we do not have confirmation of the investment.  The port's traffic has increased by more than 500%.  We know it is Ireland's most strategic piece of infrastructure and that the investment has to come.  I ask for confirmation of when that will be.</p></speech>

The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is present and I can attest to his passion and commitment to ensuring this is rolled out.  Any funding provided to ports can only be a contribution towards the costs and would have to be in compliance with state aid rules.  It is envisaged that this would require a competition and it would then be up to the ports to apply for any funding that might become available after preparation of a comprehensive business case.  In this context, ports would have to engage directly with industry on specific requirements and investment costs.  My Department is also meeting with other ports and administrations to establish best practice in this regard in Europe.  We are looking at how other countries have done this.  There is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Transport, the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>In addition, there is direct engagement with the offshore renewable energy sector and other relevant stakeholders to explore the mechanisms of investment required for this infrastructure.</p></speech>

I appreciate the understanding she appears to have.  The reality is that the Carbon Trust has said that Rosslare Europort is the preferred port for an offshore wind farm construction base.  There is no competition.  It is the most strategic port.  With the knowledge and understanding that the Minister and Minister of State have, I am a little dismayed to think that the potential in Rosslare may be lost because this will ultimately go to the UK.</p>  <p>  If we do not give the urgent attention and investment required to Rosslare, we will lose the potential of billions of euro being invested in the Irish economy because we failed to prepare the most strategic preferred port for the construction of a wind farm base.  I cannot understand that we are discussing today the possibility that there might be a competition process.  There is no competition.  Rosslare is deemed to be the best port.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the funding will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

We have to identify funding streams, which is what the Department is actively doing.  We are engaging with the European Commission to seek changes to the CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for offshore renewable energy in the next 2021-23 funding stream.  We are also seeking to influence the next TEN-T regulations so that green infrastructure projects could be included in that.  As a sea port on the comprehensive network, Rosslare is eligible to apply for European CEF funding for transport-related infrastructure.  That work is ongoing in the Department to determine and identify funding streams.</p>  <p>  On competition, all ports are competing with one another.  We would encourage ports to work together.  Some boards have different strengths and abilities.  They could put together a business case.  It would be a competition and state aid rules would apply around that, but there is a lot of engagement taking place within the Department and with the industry because it is critical that we get the information from industry in respect of its needs and what it requires in order to roll this out successfully for Ireland.</p></speech>

The programme for Government climate action commitments represent an important step up in ambition, seeking to fundamentally change the nature of transport in Ireland and achieve a 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030.</p>  <p>  Targets and measures set out in the existing 2019 climate action plan will not be sufficient to meet this Government's increased ambition.  Therefore, work is under way to frame a new 2021 climate action plan.  This work will determine the nature and scale of additional measures required to achieve the step up in emissions reduction within the transport sector.</p>  <p>  Key targets for electric vehicles and biofuels already represent ambitious goals, but we need to do more right across the transport sector.  Continued investment, increasing capacity and improving access and quality across a range of sustainable mobility options and better managing the demand for transport will need to play a critical role.</p>  <p>  When agreed, the 2021 climate action plan will chart a course to reduce transport greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in line with our programme for Government commitment.  This will advance us towards the ultimate goal nationally and at EU level, which is to reach a near zero emissions mobility system by 2050.</p>  <p>  Work to reduce emissions continues apace even as we prepare the new plan.  The Deputy will have seen evidence of this in yesterday's announcement of the set of interim actions that we are committed to implementing even while the climate action plan 2021 is being developed.  It will ensure continued momentum of our emissions reduction effort across the transport sector.</p></speech>

One is the Connecting Ireland programme.  There are particular challenges in Ireland because of the spatial configuration of our communities.  We are unique in many respects, specifically the dominance of Dublin and the types of rural and sparsely populated communities we have.  Connecting Ireland is essentially a BusConnects programme for the rest of Ireland, as I understand it.</p>  <p>  Related to that, there will continue to be significant car dependency.  Our electric vehicle plan seems to be all over the place.  It is not delivering anywhere close to what it needs to deliver.  It needs fundamental reform in every way.  I ask the Minister to speak to those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-03-24a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021032400065#PPP00800"><p>Deputy O'Rourke is absolutely right to focus on Connecting Ireland as a key element in our transport plans.  To achieve the level of emissions reductions will involve everywhere and every place matters.  Connecting Ireland is critical to achieve the national planning framework objective of better balanced regional development.  The programme for Government committed to significant improvements in rural bus connectivity and public transport.  People do not have the level of services and access to public transport they deserve.</p>  <p>  TII, the NTA and my Department are examining specific measures, including moving to a testing and implementation phase where we establish new bus networks and ways of delivering rural bus connectivity.  That will involve the likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann, private bus operators, Local Link operators and getting the connecting element of this strategy right.  The advantage of such bus systems is that they can be rolled out relatively quickly.  Such a project will require significant additional resources and good planning to back it up in our towns-based strategy so that people can live in towns served by buses.  I will come back to the Deputy on his second question in a further reply.</p></speech>

On that point, at the climate committee yesterday we heard from Dr. Lynn Sloman who referred to a Swiss example of good rural public transport.  Built into it were performance and service standards that were binding.  That is the type of direction we should be moving in.  I will let the Minister come back to me on the point on electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  I refer to the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Personal Light Electric Vehicles) Bill 2021.  Does the Minister know how quickly that legislation will move forward?  We have done pre-legislative scrutiny at the transport committee.  When might we expect to see the amendments and the legislation enacted?</p></speech>

The joint committee did very useful and good work in its assessment of the climate Bill at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I was very aware of those hearings yesterday which were very useful and interesting.  I look forward to reading the committee's report on transport because in my mind it is the most challenging issue.  In the next four to five months, I will seek to work on a collaborative basis with all Oireachtas parties on how we draft this plan.</p>  <p>  The electric vehicle element is key.  I do not accept that it is not working at present.  The key restriction in terms of the roll-out of electric vehicles is the availability of vehicles from international suppliers.  That is starting to change as a variety of different car companies start to provide electric vehicles options across their ranges.  At the same time, we are using the carbon fund to invest in the ESB's fast-charging network.</p> <p>We will continue to look at other legislative measures and other financial mechanisms to ensure we get the charging infrastructure to match what will be a very significant ramp-up in electric vehicles.</p></speech>

I will happily come back to answer the Deputy's questions in the supplementary reply, if she does not mind me providing the baseline information which will inform other Deputies in the same way as the Deputy is informed.</p>  <p>  I share with Deputy Connolly the wish to see much improved active travel and public transport infrastructure and services in Galway.  It is a wish I have expressed to members of Galway City Council and Galway County Council in meetings I have had with them in the last year.  I think we are on the verge of positive change in the city and surrounding area, a change that will see a more sustainable and liveable Galway emerge.  That is why I welcome the announcement two weeks ago of over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding to improve Ceannt Station, transform the public realm at key city centre sites and deliver improved rail infrastructure at Oranmore which can enable compact development in the area.  I am delighted that my Department will assist with this transformation by co-funding works at Ceannt Station, at Oranmore and in relation to the proposed active travel network.  These are all positive developments and ones I look forward to seeing completed.</p>  <p>  These developments will complement the improvements planned under the Galway transport strategy, which looks to improve significantly active travel and bus infrastructure in the city.  The funding announced the other week in relation to the city&rsquo;s active travel network is hugely positive, while we are now seeing progress in relation to some of the key bus corridors in the city, like the cross-city link and the Dublin Road corridor.</p>  <p>  The successful development of bus-based park-and-ride services in the city is linked to the roll-out of BusConnects Galway.  It obvious to say that developing park-and-ride sites without developing improved bus infrastructure and services will simply fail.  If we are going to get people to make the switch out of the private car, the alternative needs to be fast, predictable and reliable.  At the moment I am sorry to say that is just not the case on many of the key corridors into Galway city.  Therefore the imperative is to roll-out BusConnects Galway.  Alongside that, the local authority will work in co-operation with the National Transport Authority and its park-and-ride development office to identify strategic sites for park-and-ride services.  More generally, I think that next year is an appropriate time to look again at the Galway transport strategy and review it, given that 2022 will mark its sixth anniversary.</p></speech>

Here we are in 2021.  The people were way ahead of us as they were in the request for light rail when they signed 24,000 signatures.  They are way ahead of us on climate change.  I am asking the Minister, and as a new Minister because I failed with the last Minister, and he acknowledged there was a failure, what knowledge he has of the progress being made in identifying park-and-ride sites in Galway city as a means of alleviating traffic congestion, given that it has been in the development plan since 2005.  Is he satisfied with the lack of progress given the ambitions we have and the obligations we have under climate change legislation to reduce our emissions?</p></speech>

It also suggests there may be opportunities for small-scale developments on the Moycullen and Headford corridors.  The strategy notes that existing rail-based park-and-ride facilities at Oranmore could be used but that its current capacity of 140 spaces is sufficient for the moment.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on progress, there is real frustration on all sides at the lack of progress in Galway across a range of sustainable transport initiatives.  It is critical that we develop the cross-city link and the Dublin Road BusConnects corridors.  They have just gone to a non-statutory public consultation.  It is critical that we get that back and then, as quickly as possible this year, go to seeking planning permission.  It is at that point, when we know we have planning permission, that we can start making specific decisions around park-and-ride services.  Advancing one without the other means we would not be certain of connecting the bus corridor with the park-and-ride service, which is essential for its success.</p></speech>

It is 16 years since we did that.  The people led us in proposing sustainable solutions to the traffic congestion in Galway.  We have been let down by management.  Councillors put it forward in my time and it has never been rolled out.  At this stage, there is urgency to it.  My privilege as Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not extend to the supplementary answers.  I look forward to reading about the sites being identified as it is all very vague.  This is a problem that we can deal with very quickly, namely to identify the sites.  Of course they have to be integrated into a sustainable transport system.  My preference is for light rail but that is just my preference, as it was among the 24,000 people who signed the petition to ask for a feasibility study.  It is all tied in together.  The city is destined to grow, as the Minister knows, by an additional 40% under the national development plan.  We should be planning strategically and sustainably and the most basic thing are park-and-ride facilities.</p></speech>

We will commission and deliver that.  It is best done within the review of the Galway transport strategy which is due next year.  It would also be done then at a time when, all going well, we will know whether we have got the planning permission through for the cross-link route.  That would be one obvious route which we could upgrade to the light rail options that a number of people in Galway are now presenting as having real potential.  To deliver that requires first and foremost political commitment from the local authority representatives and the D&aacute;il representatives in Galway because it will be a difficult decision.  It will require the reallocation of space and preference being given to public transport.  This would transform the city for the better, but it is never easy.  It is never easy to change from the current model to a new one but that is the key thing, both in the current public non-statutory public transportation phase and as we go into devising planning permission.  Getting local political buy-in, support and backing for the bus corridor options and for the active travel routes is what we need in Galway more than anything else.</p></speech>

Thousands of them had to take to the streets in September to demand supports and assistance.  Apart from a few changes they forced in the PUP, support for the thousands of taxi drivers has not been forthcoming from the Government.  Many of them face the prospect of having to replace their cars this year.  Where the hell are they supposed to get the money to do that, never mind for insurance, car repayments and so on?</p></reply>

I recognise that Covid-19 has had a profound impact on small businesses across the country, with the public transport sector being especially affected as public health restrictions have necessarily discouraged people from travelling generally.  Taxi and other small public service vehicle operators, who are particularly dependent on the hospitality and tourism sectors, have faced a particularly pronounced drop in demand and real challenges and difficulties in the last year.</p>  <p>  It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports with broad eligibility criteria for individuals and businesses which have been adversely affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>Many of these supports can be accessed by self-employed taxi drivers, including liquidity and investment measures, from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the enterprise support grant and the pandemic unemployment payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Self-employed recipients of the PUP, like small public service vehicle, SPSV, drivers, can also avail of the self-employment income scheme which provides for an income disregard for the first &euro;960 earned in a given eight-week period.</p> <p> I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV sector towards zero-low-emission vehicles and I have increased the funding available to the electric SPSV grant scheme from &euro;1 million in 2020 to &euro;15 million this year.  Furthermore, in view of the particular challenges faced by operators of older vehicles, I have doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to fully electric models.  Additional amounts are available for those switching to vehicles which are both electric and wheelchair accessible.  There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch earlier in the year, with over 200 applications received to date.  I believe that for many drivers there is a strong financial as well as environmental case to switch to such electric vehicles.  Operators of electric vehicles enjoy the benefits of lower running costs, lower tolls under the low emissions vehicle toll incentive and can use dedicated SPSV electric charging infrastructure at key transport hubs such as major airports and railway stations.</p></speech>

Regarding the &euro;15 million the Minister spoke of, let us consider those taxi drivers whose incomes have either been reduced to zero, for the 40% who have remained on the PUP because there is no work out there, or those others who have experienced a reduction of 60% to 70%.  Those drivers still have to make their car repayments and to pay their insurance.  How on earth would those people afford the &euro;25,000 in additional costs on top of the grant which would be needed to move to an electric vehicle?  How could those drivers possibly do that?  What is actually happening regarding that &euro;15 million is that the only people who will be able to apply for these grants will be the big taxi companies that have the resources, and not the thousands of taxi drivers whose incomes have been crucified and who are excluded from the CRSS and the Covid-19 business aid scheme, CBAS.</p></speech>

It is a significant cash support, which increases further if drivers are using wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  The uptake so far of 200 applications is a significant signal that this scheme is of real interest.  It is a combination of that much-reduced cost of these vehicles and availing of other enterprise and liquidity supports, which will allow the financing of the purchase of vehicles.  Taxi drivers are increasingly going to realise the savings that will arise from the fuel costs being a fifth of what they were previously and the maintenance costs being similarly a fraction of those previously.  The maths of the return from the use of these vehicles means that I believe there will be a significant uptake by the end of the year by exactly those people of whom Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about.  I refer to individual, self-employed taxi drivers who face real difficulty.  While the PUP, the income disregard and the ability to earn in addition to the PUP will help those in that situation, I think that &euro;15 million in grant payments, backed up with financing and liquidity, will be a way out of this crisis for those drivers.</p></speech>

He spoke of a taxi driver who looked for a loan from the bank of &euro;5,000 and was refused.  Why was that?  It was because when the banks look at the situation of the taxi industry as it is now, they know there is no work and no income.  As a result, they think that those applying for even &euro;5,000 loans must be joking and they are refusing to loan even those amounts.  How then are the individual taxi drivers supposed to get &euro;25,000, which is the amount needed to buy an electric, wheelchair-accessible vehicle costing about &euro;50,000?  The grants are only at about &euro;20,000, so these drivers cannot manage to do this.</p>  <p>  On top of everything else, they have clocked up debts for car repayments and similar costs.  An extension has not been rolled over for those whose cars will no longer meet the ten-year rule this year.  Therefore, the grants are not enough to sustain people and the vast majority will not be able to access the grants and make up that sort of difference.  What those drivers are telling me is that it is the taxi companies that will be able to afford these costs and it is those companies that are applying for those grants.  The taxi representative groups are also very dissatisfied with the taxi advisory committee and do not want to be part of it because they cannot get their message directly through to the Minister and his Department. </p></speech>

Taxi drivers in Cork are telling me how hard they and the industry are finding this situation.  They cannot cope.  They need more supports from the Government.  On the replacement of cars after ten years, there was an extension to that rule for the year, but it must be extended again.  How can taxi drivers replace cars which are ten years old right now?  The Minister made the point that some 200 taxi drivers have availed of the grant.  If there are 20,000 taxis and 200 grants have been taken up, that is 1% of the total.  The Minister is here saying how great the Government's actions are for taxi drivers, but what I am hearing from taxi drivers in Cork is that they are struggling and are finding this situation hard.  Hospitality and taxis were the first sectors to close and they will probably be the last to reopen.</p></speech>

The ultimate way to get this industry restored is to see a return to normality in the coming months, with the roll-out of the vaccines and the lifting of restrictions, subject to the virus not taking off again, allowing business to come back.  That is the first key thing that must happen.  When I talk to taxi drivers, they recognise that no matter vehicle they might have or whatever arrangements there may be, there is no business or demand for these services.  That is probably the most important aspect of this situation.</p>  <p>  I am convinced that during the summer this situation will start to turn and we will start to see demand return.  Such a development will then also give taxi drivers wondering what to do next the ability to switch vehicles.  The scrappage scheme does not just apply to a vehicle of a certain age, it depends on the number of miles which a vehicle has done.  It concerns vehicles at the end of their lives and a wide variety of taxi drivers will be able to avail of this taxi scheme.  That is the best approach to dealing with a vehicle coming to the end of its life and also the best approach to supporting the wider industry.</p></speech>

That is the number of applications, however, and they have not all drawn down the grants yet.  If they were all to draw down &euro;20,000, however, then that would be &euro;4 million out of a &euro;15 million fund.  I am confident and hopeful that we will allocate the full &euro;15 million.  It is still only a small percentage but it starts to develop the supply chain of vehicles.  We will then see costs further reducing because the requisite volume will exist.</p></speech>

It will be a full five years after I secured that commitment when I was in government.</p></reply>

As public transport is responsible for less than 5% of our transport emissions, in absolute terms, converting public transport fleets to low-carbon alternatives will have a limited impact on national emission reductions.  However, greening the public fleet does fulfil a strong leadership and demonstration role as we shift towards a low-carbon economy.  To this end, I am committed to continuing to green the public transport fleet and to making each public transport journey less carbon-intensive.  A comprehensive programme of work is already under way, with a strong focus on the pathway to zero emitting vehicles.</p> <p>The national bus fleet, which carries the majority of public transport passengers, is already moving to lower emission alternatives.  During 2020, a total of 280 diesel-electric plug-in hybrid buses were ordered.  A number of these vehicles were delivered during December and will enter service over the coming weeks.  A total of 100 such vehicles should be operational by May this year, with the remaining 180 vehicles to be delivered during quarters 3 and 4 of this year.<br/><br/>The NTA is tendering for the supply of single-deck, fully electric buses, the first of which will be introduced into town fleets this year.  In addition, further such vehicles will be assigned to other urban routes that are capable of being operated with single-deck buses.  In respect of the double-deck fleet, the number of manufacturers of right-hand drive double-deck buses is very limited, which has impacted the development of such vehicles.  The NTA is satisfied, however, that the available product is now mature enough, and capable of a sufficient range, to allow the purchase of double-deck fully electric fleet for some urban routes.  Accordingly, a tender process has commenced for the purchase of double-deck, fully electric buses, with the first order expected to be placed later this year and the first vehicles under that order arriving towards the end of next year.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>In terms of heavy rail, we are expanding electrification through the DART+ programme, which will ultimately mean about 70% of journeys in any given year on the rail network will be on electrified services.  In the interim, we are continuing to expand rail capacity through the ongoing construction of the national train control centre and the manufacture of 41 additional carriages for the greater Dublin area commuter rail fleet.  I intend to commission a review of the rail network that will consider the potential for high or higher-speed rail, including the potential electrification of the interurban network.  As regards our light rail network, we have been expanding the capacity of the Luas green line with the ongoing arrival of 26 tram extensions and eight additional trams, all of which I expect will have entered service by quarter 2 of this year. We will also look at route options for Luas Cork, Luas Lucan and the preliminary design for Luas Finglas. This year, I intend to seek Government approval for MetroLink, a new largely underground electrified metro service in Dublin that is probably the largest public investment project in the history of the State.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in the most recent budget, I was delighted to announce an electric vehicle scrappage scheme to enhance the supports available for taxi and hackney drivers switching to electric vehicles.  I hope to see a steady greening of our small public service vehicle fleet over the coming years.<br/><br/>Collectively, these measures will see us progressively modernise and lower the emission profile of our public transport fleets, as well as creating an attractive alternative to the private car.  As the Deputy is aware, I am fully committed to a shift to public transport and active travel as a means of reducing transport emissions.  There have been some great additions to active travel infrastructure and our public realm in recent months, as local authorities have put in place emergency measures to support local communities and businesses through our current difficulties.  We want to build on these types of initiatives and support them through our commitment of &euro;1.8 billion over the lifetime of the Government for active travel.  This level of investment, along with our significant investment in greening public transport, will help improve quality of life and reduce the quantity of emissions and air pollutants from the transport sector.</p></speech>

The Minister, therefore, should pull the other one in that regard.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, the NTA and the Department sought a delay of 18 months on the implementation of the ban on fossil fuel buses, which they got, but the delay was extended for a further six months until the end of 2019.  Since then, 380 diesel-hybrid buses have been put onto our roads and into the city of Dublin.  In light of the fact that four people a day, many of whom live in the city of Dublin, die because of poor air quality in this country as a direct result of diesel emissions, is there not a responsibility on the Government in regard to its failure to deliver on this?</p></speech>

We have started that with the provisions to end the burning of smoky fuels throughout the country, which is probably the most immediately critical initiative to improve air quality and which I hope the Deputy will support.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct.  The switch to cleaner public transport vehicles and other measures to improve the flow of traffic in city and town centres throughout the country will be critical.  It involves a combination of measures, including the public transport fleet but also supporting the likes of the BusConnects projects.  We were talking about it earlier in respect of Galway but the same applies to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  While that fleet of diesel-hybrid buses will evolve to being one of fully electric buses, emissions are reduced significantly when they are given priority over a private traffic solution.</p>  <p>  There are a variety of ways in which we can address the issue.  The Deputy is correct to say there are black spots in Dublin, particularly around the public transport stations such as Heuston Station and on the quays.  We need specific solutions for those areas, which will be included in the clean air strategy.</p></speech>

Turning to the Bill the Minister published yesterday, which I welcome, section 6 makes specific reference to cost-effective actions in the context of climate change.  This comes back to the fundamental problem with the public sector expenditure code, which I had to spend a long time to get implemented by the Government.  Would the Minister not agree that the fundamental problem here is that until now the NTA has chosen to buy buses based on the purchase price of the vehicle rather than its whole-of-life cost?  As he said earlier, electric engines require much less maintenance than diesel ones.  If we looked at the whole-of-life cost of buses, we would have an awful lot more electric buses in our fleet.  The difficulty is this is being replicated throughout the Government.</p></speech>

We are at the cutting edge of what is happening.  It would be different if we had a bus transport system characterised by low, single-deck buses but we do not.  In most of our cities, the large public bus transport fleets are double-deckers and up to now such vehicles were not available.  They are becoming available, which is why we are switching to them and will purchase them in large numbers at the same time that we are now purchasing single-deck electric buses for those cities and services where single-deck bus services apply.  The issue is changing and evolving quickly, and as soon as electric vehicles become available, we will switch to them.</p></speech>

Cobh is a town of 13,000 people and is in desperate need of a significant and substantial upgrade to the access road into and out of the town up to the N25 near Tullagreen House.

Works on those roads are funded from councils' own resources and supplemented by State road grants.  The national development plan, NDP, as it stands provides for the gradual build-up of funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network, with some limited investment in road improvement projects.  The NDP is under review.  The aim of the review in the transport sector is to align policy with the Government's priorities as set out in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  If any transport project is to be considered for funding under the revised NDP, it must be appraised for compliance with the public spending code as revised in December 2019.  An important change to the code is the introduction of a requirement for a strategic assessment report, SAR, for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.  The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.  The purpose of the SAR is to examine the rationale for potential policy interventions and ensure the strategic fit of potential projects and programmes with Government policy, particularly the national planning framework and the national development plan.  A common cause of problems with projects is a failure to clearly specify objectives and desired outcomes at the outset.  The introduction of the requirement for a SAR is designed to guard against this and ensure early engagement with, and scrutiny of, potential public investment projects and programmes.</p>  <p>  Regarding the R624 specifically, my Department has had some engagement with Cork County Council following the submission of an initial project appraisal in 2019.  In this context, the public spending code project appraisal requirements have been explained to the council.  As the council has indicated that it is proposing to appoint consultants in connection with the proposed scheme, my officials have proposed a meeting between the council and the Department's strategic research and analysis division regarding the preparation of the SAR relating to the scheme.</p></speech>

We need to get this project included under the NDP to ensure it will be allocated the necessary funds.  There is a strong case for why Cobh should receive this investment, particularly factoring in the standard and quality of the current road and recognising that the island is serviced by exceptionally good public transport, which will be improved with the CEMAT strategy.  We have to acknowledge that the road that is in place is very old.  We are dealing with a bridge in Belvelly that was built in the 1800s and is in terrible condition.  It has to closed frequently, which leaves the island cut off, something that is completely and utterly unacceptable in the 21st century.</p>  <p>  We are desperately in need of this investment.  I encourage the Minister to continue to engage with all stakeholders involved.  Perhaps he will be able to give us further insight into what he will be doing in his engagement with Cork County Council, the local authority leading this project.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right; one of the key issues here relates to that bridge and the fact that there have been a number of incidents in recent years, including flooding, as a result of which the bridge has had to be closed.  It is a very old bridge in quite an exposed position, as are other sections of the roadway.  The key question relates to the solutions to that problem.  Widening of the bridge is not appropriate given its historic nature.  I presume that looking at alternative crossing points will be one of the key considerations of the consultants and the county council.  As I have said, this issue is slightly separate to that affecting the longer section of the road.  This is where the strategic appraisal will kick into gear.  This will identify the key issues to address, what benefits it is possible to achieve and what is likely to be the best technical approach to solving the problems that exist.  I hope that process will be completed speedily.</p></speech>

We have to bear in mind that Cobh is in a very strategic location in Cork Harbour.  It is also one of the leading destinations for cruise ships not only in Ireland, but in Europe.  Hundreds of thousands of tourists arrive into Ireland through Cobh.  The historic nature of the town also attracts a lot of visitors to the region.  This road is unfortunately holding back this great island from reaching its full potential.  It is a beautiful and scenic place which many people want to visit but the issue of the access road is deterring a lot of investment in housing, enterprise and business, and is preventing potential tourism from being attracted into the region.  We have to look at this in the strongest possible terms.  I encourage the Minister to do all he can to support investment in this infrastructure.  Although the town is already well served by public transport these problems are still chronic and need to be addressed.</p></speech>

The area is critical and Cobh is a very important destination and an historic location.  There are other investments being made which I will mention when answering a later question.  These relate to the development of greenways and urban development support for Cobh and the surrounding area.  As the Deputy said, there is other transport infrastructure in the area.  The rail service to Cobh has been a great success and may benefit from the upgrade of the line from Midleton to Cork and continuing on to the other side which we are looking to carry out.  This has the potential to further enhance the attractiveness of the Cobh rail services.  The rail review we are conducting will give us the opportunity to again look at rail connectivity to the likes of Marino Point, which historically was of real strategic benefit.  We should be looking at those options and at developments in the industrial estate in Marino to see what sustainable transport solutions could be implemented to support those sorts of investments.</p></speech>

He is right.  Since the question was asked, we have published both the original EY report and the second report, the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions, JASPERS, review.  These two reports provided critical answers to some of the questions asked about the western rail corridor.  If I can widen out the question, the further review we are going to be doing, the national rail review, is needed because the questions we have asked to date did not take a sufficiently wide vision of the network effects or of the benefits of filling in gaps in our network or using existing underutilised assets.  Considering these matters is one of the purposes of the rail review.  In that regard, I see the potential connection from Athenry to Claremorris as being of significance or relevance not only for the likes of Tuam, Claremorris, Athenry or Galway but, as the Deputy has indicated, also for this wider strategic assessment of the entire western rail corridor.  From my perspective, the western rail corridor starts right down in the likes of Waterford and runs from there to Limerick Junction, through to Clare and then up to Galway and Mayo.  A connection right along the west coast and down to our southern ports allows for the potential long-term use of rail infrastructure.  We will have an informal meeting of the transport ministers of the Council of the EU in the coming weeks - I believe it is next week - and the key issue on the agenda is how to revitalise rail including rail freight, rail commuting and meeting long-distance transport needs with rail.  In this wider strategic review, I am looking to think big and to think broadly about the situation ten, 20 or 30 years down the line.  That connection between Athenry and Claremorris might have impacts right along the rail network which would justify it in a way the JASPERS and EY reports did not.</p></speech>

I also expect that the Minister will proceed with the railway line into Foynes.  It is a great pity that the railway line connecting Waterford to Rosslare in Wexford was recently closed because, with the new European direct routes, it would also have been a vital link.  The Minister is dead right however; it is all about a network.  We do not have a railway network in this country.  We have a radial network out of Dublin.  That is essentially the way the powers that be, particularly those centred in Dublin, look at the railway lines.  While I welcome the review, can the Minister tell me how much time will be wasted on this review, going around on the same old thing, when the system does not want to give the west of Ireland anything?</p></speech>

System change is what we need to address the climate crisis we face.  Part of that system change relates to transport.  To go back to the earlier question, how do we go from releasing 12 million tonnes of carbon a year to releasing 6 million tonnes?  One of the ways to do this is to change the entire transport system towards sustainable modes.  The key direction in this is set by the national planning framework.  That is the strategic systemic change we need.  It talks about balanced regional development, compact development and decarbonisation development.  With regard to the transport system helping in that effort, the system will see the reintroduction of rail services on the Foynes line.  This will result in services to the port but also in the potential to open stations in the likes of Adare, Patrickswell, Dooradoyle, the Crescent and other locations <i>en route</i>.  I agree with the Deputy.  The network effect has to look at how we start to reconnect towns to cities using the rail network.  That town centres first policy is part of the national planning framework and it is Government policy to back that up.  The rail review is not just the system kicking the can down the road.</p></speech>

We would have the port but not the connecting railway lines while we are talking about decarbonisation.  Does it take an awful lot of study to do that?  The Minister did not answer the question.  For how long is this rail review to go on?  There is a great trick in Departments.  The Minister is told the Department will do a review and then the Department makes sure it goes on and on until the Minister is gone and cannot make a decision.  How long will this rail review take?</p></speech>

We first looked at extending it to Derry or Limerick, or both.  The conclusion of the western rail corridor analysis was that we needed to go wider and to look at the network effects.  It concluded that we needed to look at whether there are underutilised lines that we could return into service and whether we could reverse the dramatic decline in rail freight that has occurred in the last 20 to 40 years.  This will be done and at the same time we are looking at a review of the national development plan.  The rail review will come after that.  This is part of a Government which has deliberately set itself in the course that we will reverse the traditional spending ratio so that it will be 2:1 in favour of public transport rail-based systems over road because that is the correct strategic development for the west as well as for the rest of the country.</p></speech>

Since that funding stream was abolished, there has been a huge dearth in and lack of activity to bring local improvement scheme applications forward.  Unfortunately, there is a huge backlog in applications now.  There is a much smaller scheme funded through the Department of Rural and Community Development.  If we are to tackle the backlog in the local improvement schemes nationally, the funding stream that existed in the past needs to be reintroduced and we need meaningful funding on an annual basis towards the local improvement scheme for each local authority.</p></reply>

The Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the local improvement scheme, LIS.  Under that scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads, that is, roads not taken in charge by local authorities, which meet the criteria set out in the Act.  A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases.</p>  <p>  Up to 2012, my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme.  However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the post-2008 financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop providing dedicated funding for the local improvement scheme in 2012 and there was no funding for the local improvement scheme in that year.  After that, from 2013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the local improvement scheme, local authorities could use a proportion of their discretionary grant for the local improvement scheme if they chose to do so.  The reason this approach was taken was that it was considered that councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme for non-public roads.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, given the nature of that Department's responsibilities for communities and rural development, assumed lead responsibility for the LIS and introduced dedicated funding for it.  In light of the significant funding being put into the LIS by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of my Department's discretionary grant to the LIS would no longer apply from 2018.  The context for this decision was the continuing budgetary constraints relating to the regional and local road grant budgets. </p>  <p> Project Ireland 2040 provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads but it will take some time to reach the level of investment needed to ensure that the public road network is being maintained adequately.  For this reason, funding continues to be directed primarily at the maintenance and renewal of the public regional and local road network, with some limited investment in road improvement projects.  I understand that funding for the LIS will continue to be available from the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2021.</p></speech>

When there was specific funding for the local improvement scheme, the Department conducted a rigorous examination, in conjunction with the local authority officials, to ensure the funding went to the particular scheme for which it was intended.  I am talking about roads that may have nine or ten households on them plus farms and perhaps some minor businesses as well.  It is a complete misnomer to talk about non-public roads.  The reason they are non-public is because there has been no State investment in them.  In the 2000s and in the late 1990s, there was a huge investment that was necessary and welcome in order to bring those roads up to the standard that the people deserve.  I mention the people living down the long laneway.  They are paying their taxes, contributing to society and working hard.  They are as entitled to have a road up to the proper standard as the person living in Dublin 4, Dublin 6, Cork city or anywhere else in urban Ireland.  We all fight to get public lighting and paths developed in towns and villages.  Our people in rural communities deserve to have a standard of road leading to their homes.</p></speech>

We all deserve that for safety and the maintenance of vehicle standards and so on.  I would argue that the involvement of the Department of Rural and Community Development in this is appropriate.  Similar to local authorities, its specific remit is for rural communities in particular.  These roads, by definition, tend to be where there might be a small number of houses in rural locations and they are non-public roads.  One can argue as to why that is so but they are roads that are not in the charge or responsibility of the local authorities.  One of the other reasons the Department of Rural and Community Development is well placed is that it is also involved in the community involvement scheme, which it has been ring-fencing funding for since 2017.  My understanding is that this role to permit local community participation in the repair of public local roads has been successful and has been beneficial to local communities.  It is also an area where the Department of Rural and Community Development has real expertise.</p></speech>

When Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the CL&Aacute;R funding was a top-up in addition to the local improvement scheme funding that came directly from the Department of Transport at that time.  We need to have investment to reduce, in a meaningful way, the huge backlog.  In my county of Cavan, our council is dealing with applications that were submitted in 2009.  With the present level of funding for the existing applications, it will take 35 years to repair those laneways.  That is not acceptable for any community and it is not acceptable for any individual or family living along a road in such poor condition.  I ask the Minister to ask the Department to review this matter again.  The funding that comes from the Department of Rural and Community Development is welcome but it is not near enough.  The Department of Transport is the main Department with responsibility for roads and I implore the Minister to take responsibility back and to put in place adequate funding.</p></speech>

Whichever Department is involved, be it the Department of Rural and Community Development or the Department of Transport, the decisions, applications and checking on whether money is correctly spent or whether the investment is the right one are all the responsibility of the local authority.  We have a real job of work to do with the local authorities but the key task we have is in maintaining the local public road network, where there are also real budget constraints and a need for investment in steady State maintenance so that road network is maintained in a proper order.  I have listened carefully to what the Deputy has said and I will talk with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, who has responsibility, and look to see what further measures may be carried out in co-operation between the Departments.  I want the Deputy to be aware that the constraints that are there in our roads investment spending are real.  Various Departments working together is the best way to solve this problem.  I will commit to work with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.</p></speech>

I raise one concern.  We will have a major challenge because we will have so many proposals for investment in both our rail and road networks and the rail investment in particular will be a multiple of the resources that are available.  To make the investments that we need to make work and to justify them we will need to ensure that our housing plans match our public transport plans.</p>  <p>  Last week, I looked at the strategic housing development applications for County Kildare in which obviously the Deputy has a keen interest.  In recent years, it seemed that there was little coherence between approval for large housing developments and proximity to public transport services, irrespective of whether they were upgraded.  Key to being able to afford the rail investment is ensuring that our housing is in the same location.  That applies across the country, but particularly in County Kildare.</p></speech>
