Tabharfaidh s&eacute; t&uacute;s &aacute;ite do thiom&aacute;naithe agus d'&uacute;in&eacute;ir&iacute; tithe, a bhfuil &aacute;rachas acu, ag laghd&uacute; costas.  Tabharfaidh s&eacute; ar comhlachta&iacute; &aacute;rachais a gcuid cleachtais a mh&iacute;ni&uacute;.  Cuirfidh m&oacute; Bhille deireadh le d&eacute;phraghs&aacute;il, cleachtas ina bhfuil a fhios ag comhlachta&iacute; na custaim&eacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; n&iacute;os toilteana&iacute; athnuachan a dh&eacute;anamh ar pholasaithe agus d&aacute; bharr sin, gearrtar praghsanna n&iacute;os airde orthu.</p>  <p>  Today is the day for this D&aacute;il to end the insurance rip-off.  Today is the day for this D&aacute;il to put consumers first and send a clear message to the insurance industry that the game is up in respect of exploitative practices in home and motor insurance.  For too long, the insurance industry has been able to price-gouge its customers.  Most people believe their insurance premium is based on how likely they are to make a claim and how much that claim would cost their insurer, but that is not the whole story.</p>  <p>  Last November, the Central Bank found that insurance prices had risen by 35% in the past decade despite the cost of claims falling by 9%.  All present know that insurance companies are engaging in a price-gouging practice known as dual pricing which they use to charge customers much higher prices than the actual cost of their policies.  It involves the use of complex models to identify customers who are likely to renew and then charge them the highest prices possible before they are tempted to switch to a competitor.  Instead of rewarding customers for their loyalty, the companies increase the customer's premium in the knowledge that he or she is more likely to renew than to switch.  That is the loyalty penalty.</p>  <p>  I refer to the case of Ray, for example.  He received a renewal quote of &euro;1,420 from Liberty Insurance for his car insurance, only to be offered a premium of &euro;680 for exactly the same policy with exactly the same provider when he went online.</p> <p>He was overcharged by 109% or &euro;740.  That is the loyalty premium that we, in this House, are going to ban.</p> <p> In September 2019, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank requesting an investigation into the practice of dual pricing, and after meeting with the Governor, the Central Bank agreed to carry out an investigation into the complaint I submitted.  In January 2020, the Central Bank began its investigation, and its interim report in December confirmed what we had said in our major complaint, that is, dual pricing is endemic right across the insurance market, affecting more than seven in ten Irish policyholders, many of whom are overcharged by hundreds of euro every year.</p> <p> While the insurance industry has been allowed to rip off Irish customers, action has been taken elsewhere.  Between 2014 and 2017, 20 US states prohibited the practice of dual pricing, including California, New York and Florida.  These bans were recommended by the American Association of Insurance Commissioners, which found that the use of dual pricing unfairly discriminated and called for the practice to be banned.  The association stated that "two insurance customers having the same risk profile should be charged the same premium for the same coverage".  That is the principle of fairness on which this legislation is based and built.</p> <p> The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in Britain began its own investigation into this practice in 2018.  It published its final report in September.  Its findings were stark and its solution was clear, that is, to ban dual pricing.  The British regulator found that in 2018 alone, dual pricing resulted in 6 million policyholders being overcharged a combined &euro;1.4 million.  It also concluded that dual pricing distorted competition.  While others, including the industry and, unfortunately, the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, have argued that a ban on dual pricing would undermine competition and deter new entrants, the British regulator, the FCA, found the opposite to be the case, that this type of price discrimination has a negative effect on competition while removing dual pricing would improve the nature and intensity of competition.  For the benefit of the Minister of State, I will quote the FCA, "This would mean firms competing in a more effective and innovative way, which should lead to lower overall costs for supplying insurance, more intense competition and ultimately lower average prices paid by consumers."  The British regulator has responded by announcing it will ban dual pricing this year.  Irish consumers deserve no less.</p> <p> This Bill will ban price gouging activity.  It will ban dual pricing by requiring insurance providers to use only rating factors directly linked to the risk to be insured so that renewing customers can no longer be charged artificially high prices based on their likeliness to renew, their economic background, their spending patterns or any other trait not linked to risk.  It will increase transparency in how a customer's premium is priced.  Whenever a customer receives a quote or premium from an insurance company, the insurer will be required to tell the customer the rating factor used to calculate the price and how much of that price is to cover the expected cost of claims, how much is to cover the cost of servicing and how much is to feed the profits of insurance companies.  This Bill will ensure that transparency.</p> <p> Crucially, the Bill will empower the Central Bank to draw up the regulations that will govern this ban, using the expertise of the Central Bank to remove this practice from the insurance market.  Some in this House may have concerns that the Central Bank, not the D&aacute;il, is best positioned to determine how dual pricing is removed from the insurance market and this legislation answers those concerns.  It will require the Central Bank to produce a code of practice which will assist the courts and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman where an insurance company has broken these new laws.  The Central Bank will be required to publish an annual report, assessing the industry's compliance with the legislation.  Where an insurance company continues to use price gouging practices against customers, the Central Bank will have the power to sanction them.</p> <p> The legislation will reduce prices for consumers who for too long have been ripped off by the insurance industry.  The FCA found that a ban on dual pricing in the British market would bring real benefits to consumers, saving them between &euro;4.8 billion and &euro;12.9 billion in the next decade through lower prices.</p> <p>Using a data set of 17 million observations across 6 million unique insurance policies, the FCA has modelled what a ban on dual pricing would look like.  It has found that a ban on dual pricing would reduce insurance premiums by up to 27% for homeowners who renewed up to ten times and up to 34% for motorists who have renewed for a similar tenure.  This legislation provides for the same remedy to ban this price gouging practice.  Its effects would be the same, that is, a reduction in prices for Irish consumers.  The Minister of State has again claimed that the legislation would prohibit discounts on insurance.  Let me be clear: he obviously does not understand the legislation or the price remedy to be introduced here or what is happening across the water, on which this legislation has been built.  It will do no such thing.  This legislation addresses the discriminatory practices of the insurance industry in the digital age.</p> <p> As the International Association of Insurance Supervisors has warned, the growing use of complex algorithms and the rapidly expanding ability of insurers to access more data creates risks for consumers.  It demands a response from legislators and regulators.  As the association noted in an issues paper in March 2020, pricing algorithms are being applied to new sources, including online media data such as web searches, online buying behaviour and social media activity accessed from third party sources, which includes search engine providers such as Google and social media platforms such as Facebook.  This reality was also underlined by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, the European regulator, in 2019 when it noted in a thematic review that firms are using new data sources for pricing and underwriting, including web searches, online purchases, social media activities, job career information, and bank account and credit card data accessed from third party sources.</p> <p> That is the vista before us.  The question is whether this is ethical or transparent.  It is definitely not.  This legislation responds to the risks posed by pricing models that discriminate and use personal data without the knowledge of consumers.  This legislation will ban dual pricing, end discrimination and bring transparency to the setting of prices.  It will radically shake up the insurance market and do so for the better.  It will increase competition and reduce the time and money customers spend switching.  Crucially, it will reduce prices.  This legislation will require the insurance industry to do what should be a given, that is, to price fairly and transparently.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Consumers' Association of Ireland and Brokers Ireland have supported the legislation.  I also welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing the legislation, but I am disappointed that it is putting a stay on it for nine months.  While the Government may delay this action, it will not hold it back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700005#C00200"><p>I thank my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy Doherty, for the painstaking work he has done in taking on the insurance industry.  He has done this in a hostile environment where those who fiercely defend the <i>status quo</i>allows the insurance industry to dictate how much and how often it demands money from policyholders.  Unfortunately, this has been facilitated by compliant governments that have adopted the role of spectator rather than legislator.  Insurance is a legal requirement.  Preventing policyholders from being robbed should also be a legal requirement.</p><p>Today's Bill provides the opportunity for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and others to stand up to the vested interests in the insurance industry.  It is time to make a stand for drivers and for homeowners who are being fleeced by price gouging.  Many of these are their elderly constituents or those who are already marginalised because they do not have the technological know-how, time or broadband connectivity to shop around.  They are depending on us to stand up for them by demanding transparency and fairness in the insurance industry.  They are depending on us to end the rip-off and wrestle the raw data from those who have fought so hard to protect the system that enables insatiable greed to run riot.</p><p>When I was on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I remember Dorothea Dowling fought so hard to get this raw data.  Dual pricing is just one of the practices that allow this greed to use the information on policyholders to extract the maximum amount of money from hard-pressed individuals and families.  A fundamental reform of the insurance industry is long overdue.  This Bill is another step by Sinn F&eacute;in in the right direction.</p> <p>Leave the party politics behind for today and put our constituents first.  It is time to abandon dual pricing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700006#D00200"><p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, on tabling this legislation and for his tireless work on this issue to date.  Since this Bill was introduced last month, I have been contacted by countless people in my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, where just last week a business owner had to take a High Court case to make sure that his insurance provider paid out on a policy.  What I hear from constituents is the same across the board.  They feel unfairly penalised, ripped off and that the lack of transparency in insurance policies is designed to inhibit them and to protect the insurance provider.</p>  <p>  The grossly unfair practice of dual pricing by insurance companies must end.  It is already banned in other jurisdictions and people here are entitled to that same level of protection and clear and transparent information.  The practice of insurance providers penalising existing policyholders and charging them hundreds of euro extra compared with new customers must also end.  Customers can clearly see this.  It is freely available on the insurance providers' websites.  If a person puts in his or her details as a new customer, the price offered is very different.  There is no reason for the extra charge to be applied to them except for price gouging.</p>  <p>  Providers must calculate premiums based only on the likelihood of a claim and nothing else.  Any adjustments must be clearly explained to consumers.  Insurance companies must use the same factors to calculate new and renewed premiums.  This is nothing new for other businesses.  There is no reason the insurance industry must be held to a different standard.  It must value and respect consumers who have stayed with it, often for years on end, but it does not.  I refer to a specific instance.  An individual in a rural town in my constituency had his insurance premium increased by more than &euro;1,100 in a year, which was not reflected when he went in as a new customer on the website.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank must be able to enforce regulations to govern the ban.  The code of practice needs to be drawn up and it has to be fit for purpose for the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and for the Courts Service.  The Central Bank must be given powers to sanction insurance companies that continue to use dual pricing and to rip off consumers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700006#D00300"><p>I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on his work on this Bill and his tireless work in holding the insurance industry to account.  It is in stark contrast to what this Government and previous Governments have done with the insurance rip-off that we have experienced across the length and breadth of the country.  Young drivers have been punished over recent years and it is an ongoing problem.</p>  <p>  This particular issue sees people being punished for their loyalty.  When they remain with a company and are loyal to that company, they are price-gouged.  It needs to be dealt with and this legislation deals with it.  I spoke to a constituent this week.  He told me that his insurance was &euro;785 when he got the price for renewing it, yet he went on the website and it was only &euro;550.  He drove only 22% as much as he would be in a normal year, because of the lockdown.  His argument was that surely his insurance, and the insurance of everybody, should have gone down because if people are not on the roads and not driving as much, then there will clearly not be as many accidents or claims, yet the insurance industry has pushed prices up.  It is a scandal.  I heard the Minister on the radio this morning, claiming that this legislation was somehow going to do the opposite and put insurance companies in a position where they would not be able to give discounts.  They do not give discounts.  They assault people to get more money out of them for a service they have provided previously.</p>  <p>  We need the Government to step up to the mark, not just for this legislation but for the whole insurance industry.  We need to deal with this in the round.  Ireland has a reputation across the world as being a country that is overpriced across many sectors, especially the insurance sector.  I welcome that the Government is not going to oppose this legislation.  However, putting a stay on it is like putting a stay on people trying to do better.  We cannot allow the insurance industry to continue to punish people for doing the right thing.</p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment, to deal with this issue right now and to sort out people's problems with regard to insurance across the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700007#E00200"><p>I commend Deputy Doherty on the work he has done in this area over a long period of time.  These are not new issues.  The issue of dual pricing and price gouging has been with us for a long time.  These are very unfair and, in fact, toxic practices that have been carried out by greedy insurance companies for a long time.  Deputy Doherty and others have shone a spotlight on this issue for months and years but the reality is that the Minister of State's Government has done nothing.  Customers are being ripped off every single day.  Car insurance customers, home insurance customers and small businesses are being ripped off.  In fact, a number of such businesses had to take insurance companies to court because the Government failed in its duty to protect them and to protect citizens.  People tell me all the time that they are being ripped off and ask me why the Government does nothing.  It is because the political will is not there and because the Government is protecting and shielding the greedy insurance companies.  People increasingly tell me that unless and until we have a Minister for Finance like Deputy Doherty, we will not see change on these issues.</p>  <p>  The reality is that this can be resolved with political will.  Over recent weeks and months, the T&aacute;naiste has posted a number of videos on social media in which he beats his chest and says that he will take on the insurance industry and deal with some of these issues.  Where is he today?  Where is the Government today?  Where are Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il today when they are putting a stay on this Bill, which could actually deal with these issues here and now?  They want to kick the can down the road again.  People will see that and they will see why.  It is because the Government does not want to challenge the greedy insurance companies.  </p>  <p>  Any number of people are being ripped off every day.  The Minister of State knows this because evidence has been presented time and again by an Teachta Doherty, by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and by many consumer organisations.  These people feel badly let down by Government parties that are simply not prepared to put the interests of ordinary consumers, customers and citizens first and are taking a back seat and allowing those people and small businesses to take court cases and to lead the charge, along with people like an Teachta Doherty, while the Government sits back and does nothing.  It is unacceptable.  The Minister of State should support and back this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700007#E00300"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:  	&quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the Insurance (Restriction on Differential Pricing and Profiling) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day nine months, to allow for greater analysis of the complex issues concerned following the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report on differential pricing later this year; and for such considerations to be taken into account in further scrutiny of the Bill.&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>At the start of this debate it is important that the House understands what differential pricing is and that it exists across many sectors of the economy, for example, in mobile phone plans and in gas and electricity tariffs to name but a few.  These are often found at different competing prices from multiple providers.  Even the concept of a student discount or using a money-off voucher at a supermarket can be considered differential pricing.  The Central Bank defines differential pricing in insurance services as customers with a similar risk and cost of service being charged different premiums for reasons other than risk and cost of service.  Dual pricing is one subset of differential pricing and comes into play at renewal stage, where there is differentiation between new and existing customers.</p><p>Differential pricing, including where it arises in the insurance sector, also has positive aspects such as discounts provided to new customers or to those who bundle multiple types of insurance products, such as car and home insurance, with the one company.  It helps to promote competition and can also encourage individuals to shop around across various providers.  Of course, it is a practice that can also work against consumers who may not be in a position to price different options.</p> <p>We will protect these vulnerable people.  However, the Government believes that this Bill is not the correct solution at this time and, in particular, those who do shop around would be negatively impacted as a result.</p> <p> I will make one point on all I have heard from all of the speakers so far, and it is something about which I remind people listening, which is that this legislation is about the restriction on differential pricing and profiling.  The people who have moved this legislation know that there would be seriously negative effects for hundreds of thousands of people if this law were to pass.  The entire debate coming from the people who propose this Bill speaks of dual pricing, not differential pricing.  The legislation is about differential pricing, which can have both very positive and negative impacts, and the proposers know that.  None of the scripts read here today have dealt with the issue of differential pricing.  Every speaker spoke about dual pricing and omitted to talk about differential pricing because they accept the point we have made.  If they had wanted to pass a Bill on dual pricing, they could have done so.  They chose, however, to propose a Bill on differential pricing.  Commentators and others may believe these are different issues but the proposers chose to pick one aspect that is not the subject of the Bill.  Dual pricing is not the issue before us here today.  It is one aspect of differential pricing and it would have been helpful to have had a debate and to have had the proposers talk about the benefits and downsides of differential pricing, which they chose not to do.</p> <p> There is a consensus that insurance affordability and availability is a key issue for society and that such insurance reform is a priority issue for this Government.  It is widely recognised that there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the costs and availability of insurance.  Based on the programme for Government, we have set out a range of commitments with clear timelines to reform the insurance sector in Ireland, including reducing the size of personal injury awards, increasing competition through new entrants and enforcement, and improving transparency.  We also want to minimise the need for costly litigation through reforming that system.  To achieve a whole-of-government approach, a subgroup on insurance reform within the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment would be the most effective vehicle to drive the implementation of these commitments.  This subgroup was formally established at the end of September 2020, is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and includes the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, McGrath, McEntee and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and me.  The subgroup published an ambitious action plan in December and sets out 66 actions to be achieved across Government.</p> <p> Differential pricing is one of the many areas of reform to be dealt with as part of the Government&rsquo;s action plan.  In this regard the Central Bank is currently conducting a review of the differential pricing of the Irish private car and home insurance market, which is due to be completed in the coming months.  In December, the Central Bank published an interim report showing that differential pricing is evident across both the motor and home insurance markets.  An analysis of the interim report showed that the practice may include both benefits and drawbacks to consumers.  It also suggested that there appears to be a penalty for some customers who remain with the same company and do not shop around or challenge their renewal premium, the so-called loyalty penalty.  Firm conclusions and recommendations will be made when the Central Bank report is finalised.  The Department of Finance will consider the outcome of the bank's report when further analysis is published and, in line with the action plan and programme for Government, we will act accordingly at that time.</p> <p> Turning to the text of the Bill itself, it contains a number of issues I wish to highlight to the House which need to be considered in this context and which have not been mentioned so far.  The Bill would legally prohibit insurers from offering discounts to consumers.  This would mean any price discount, whether it relates to joint policies between partners, family discounts, young drivers, linked to new customers or for any reason, would be banned.  Differential pricing would prevent insurance companies from overcharging but it would also prevent them from undercharging and giving discounts.  Dual pricing is a separate specific issue which we will also deal with but it is not the subject of the legislation before us today.  Differential pricing is, and this has been conveniently ignored.  The scripts that we have heard today have not dealt with the Private Members' Bill as published and that is being discussed here today.</p> <p> This Bill represents a considerable price control within the market and may adversely impact a number of customers rather than benefiting them.</p> <p>In addition, it may discourage consumers from switching between insurance providers and prices would rise for some customers.  I do not think this matter has been considered by the Bill, and it might reduce Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business for insurers providing insurance to other EU markets from Ireland.  Irish-authorised insurance companies currently write just under &euro;80 billion worth of insurance, with more than two thirds of that figure being accrued outside of the State.  Regarding non-life insurance policy premiums written, this type of business amounts to &euro;21 billion each year.  To put that amount into perspective, however, only &euro;4 billion of that figure relates to risk within the Irish State and policyholders within the State.</p> <p> The Bill, as drafted, will apply to all home and motor insurance policies written by insurance companies in Ireland, even where policyholders are elsewhere in the EU.  This would severely reduce Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and, potentially, cost jobs in a part of the financial services sector which employs approximately 30,000 people across the regions.  Linked to this, no other EU member state appears to have banned the practice to the extent this Bill is proposing, and we will have to await the view of the Central Bank of Ireland in this regard.  Furthermore, the requirement imposed upon insurers to provide details on rating factors, use and pricing policies, as set out in section 4 of this Bill, would be a major deterrent to possible new entrants to this area.</p> <p> In summary, we need to be careful not to give rise to consequences which would have a negative impact on the Government's intention to promote competition.  In addition, the Bill must also be considered in respect of how it interacts with EU legislation.  There may be a need to consult the European Central Bank, ECB, regarding the additional functions that could be given to the Central Bank of Ireland.  All these elements need further consideration to ensure that Ireland is complying with its obligation as a member of the EU.  Members of the House should consider that if this Bill is passed as it stands it has the potential to limit competition, increase overall prices for consumers and make Ireland an outlier in Europe in respect of how we deal with insurance.</p> <p> It is for these reasons that the Government is proposing to reconsider the Bill in nine months.  This approach will allow us to scrutinise the Bill further and provide the Central Bank of Ireland with sufficient time to produce its report on differential pricing.  Also during this period, in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I will promote competition in the insurance market to bring forward other non-legislative measures to tackle the negative outcomes associated with the current context and which have been highlighted in the interim report.  I already outlined my intention to continue to do this with the main insurance companies and Insurance Ireland.</p> <p> To conclude, Government interventions in a market is important as insurance is an area which needs to be firm and carefully considered.  The issues involved are complex and require targeted approaches, as laid out in the Government's action plan for insurance.  Our priority remains the implementation of the plan and the Government's insurance reform subgroup will give this issue the priority it deserves.  Any solutions brought forward by this House should be evidence-based and seek to protect the ability of all policyholders to get the best deal, whatever their circumstances.</p></speech>

I will pick up on something the Minister of State said.  He has chosen to engage in semantics, instead of dealing with the extensive research on this price-gouging practice.  Dual pricing, differential pricing and price optimisation refer to the same practice.  I am very disappointed by the Government&rsquo;s amendment, which is kicking the can down the road.  I did not hear the Minister of State talk about the reality here.  A reality check is needed here because drivers are being forced to pay these high prices, when in rural Ireland in particular there are simply no other options other than to drive for essential journeys.</p>  <p>  Dual pricing is wrong and it must be banned.  It has been banned in other countries and this must be done here also without delay.  What other industry targets customers for being loyal?  It is working out well for them because the insurance business is one lucrative business.  There is no denying this practice is happening, and we need the Government to step up to the mark to deal with this issue immediately, rather than simply kicking the can down road.  One man told me that he just got his car insurance renewal quote.  One company quoted him &euro;1,525, another company quoted him &euro;749 and another &euro;540.  Is there any reason to that?  Of course there is not, it is just a handy way for the big insurance companies to make a profit on the back of ordinary workers and families.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the costs are extortionate.</p> <p>A woman contacted me to tell me that her daughter is learning to drive and she said:</p><blockquote>	We&rsquo;ve been trying to get our daughter insurance quotes as a new driver.  We may as well not bother.  Who has &euro;5,500 to insure their child as a provisional driver to get experience?  Even when she passes her test it doesn&rsquo;t get much cheaper, it is &euro;3,500.  How on earth can insurance companies justify their prices? </blockquote> <p>Is Bille f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo at&aacute; curtha os comhair na D&aacute;la inniu.

While there may be claims to the contrary, it is without doubt that the vast majority of insurance companies operating in Ireland use dual pricing or differential pricing.  The loyal customers who do not shop around for better prices see their premiums increase year on year at renewal time, despite having no claims for the previous year.  While everybody is encouraged to shop around to get the best price possible for their insurance premium, it is a headache to have to do it.  It takes time and requires making countless phone calls or going online to fill in the information on various websites, which is not always an option for people who do not have access to a computer or are not computer literate.  Insurance companies are taking advantage of people who do not shop around, primarily older people who have been loyal customers for years.  Just because they do not check prices, it is not a fair way to treat people.  The practice of dual pricing must end.</p>  <p>  Different customers with similar risk and cost of service profiles are paying different premiums for reasons other than risk and cost of service.  This is happening with car and home insurance.  Insurance customers are being discriminated against and put at a disadvantage when trying to renew their insurance with companies that use the dual pricing method.  It is obvious that insurance companies are thinking of their own profits and not thinking of the welfare of their customer base.</p>  <p>  Many customers do not understand how insurance operates and they tend to do what is easiest without looking at what is the best value.  The insurance companies know this and take advantage.  Studies have found that there could be a difference of up to &euro;1,000 in prices quoted to the same person and for the same car, which is ridiculous.  Another study on home insurance shows the average premium charged was 29% higher for renewal business than for new business, despite the expected cost of renewal business being 6% lower than the cost of new business.</p>  <p>  There is clear evidence that customers are punished for loyalty and that the longer a customer stays with an insurer the higher the amount they pay in excess of what is required to cover the expected cost of the policy.  Customers are not being put at the centre of pricing decisions, which is basically exploitation.  It is about using vulnerable people to make money out of them.  Dual pricing must end.</p></speech>

It is long overdue and will be welcomed by all civil and fair-minded people.  For far too long, this dual pricing could be practised through deceitful and cunning methods designed for nothing more than cream-skimming off the backs of motorists and home owners.  It wilfully discriminates against clients through the use of big data such as: a postcode; where the person does his or her shopping; how many addresses the person has had previously; the person's sex, age and gender; the person's education; the person's Facebook likes; and the use of the person's personal credit card.  These are but a few of the cream-skimming techniques used by insurance companies to form personal discriminatory judgments and to charge maximum insurance premiums.  Not one of these criteria has anything to do with safe driving or home insurance.  No Government should be seen to support or be part of such price gouging.  This is exactly what we are dealing with here and exactly what one is agreeing to if this Bill is rejected.</p>  <p>  We should not have to wait for a Central Bank report to tell us what every ordinary person already knows and what every motorist in the State knows.  This malpractice must be stopped and this Bill will do just that.  It will protect the vulnerable, it will bring transparency to premiums, it will protect the bona fide insurance brokers, and it will put money back where it belongs, which is in the hands of struggling families.</p>  <p>  I am aware that every homeowner and motorist in Wexford will welcome the passing of this Bill, and so will their counterparts in every county in Ireland.  This is about putting hard-earned cash back into the pockets of struggling families who are being overpriced and ripped off by the unscrupulous methods of telematics, or in ordinary terms "big data".</p>  <p>  I will give a prime example of an 88-year-old pensioner from Wexford.  He uses his car only to do some short journeys such as going to mass and for errands for his neighbours in a small village.  He was quoted &euro;950.  This man does not understand computers.</p> <p>His son went online for him resulting in a quote of &euro;550, which was a reduction of &euro;400 or 42%.  This 88-year-old pensioner was lucky to have his son to help him; otherwise, he would have had to pay &euro;950.  This is just one small case in many rip-off cases that this Insurance (Restriction on Differential Pricing and Profiling) Bill 2021 will put an end to.  I urge all Deputies and Senators to support this Bill and give struggling families a break.</p></speech>

I listened incredulously to the Minister of State's speech.  He talked about underpricing and overpricing as if an insurance company would ring somebody up and offer them a product on which it would lose money.  I am absolutely incredulous that he stood here in this convention centre and said something like that.  The Government is talking about kicking the can down the road and protecting insurance companies over their customers.</p>  <p>  It is important to outline what is being proposed.  We propose to ban the use of dual pricing in home and motor insurance; require insurance companies to inform consumers of the rating factors they have used to calculate their premiums and the amounts to be paid as a result of each rating factor; require the Central Bank to draw up and enforce regulations to govern the ban; require the Central Bank to draw up a code of practice that can be used against insurance companies by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in the courts; and allow the Central Bank to sanction insurance companies that continue to use dual pricing.</p>  <p>  Everyone who has spoken today has outlined the experience of somebody in their constituency.  I wish to draw attention to two examples.  A young man who looked for insurance was first quoted &euro;1,900.  When he informed the company that he had Deputy Doherty on the case, it came back to him on the same day and quoted him &euro;1,290 for his insurance.  Another man who was with the same insurance company for seven years was quoted &euro;935.  When he demanded why it had gone up to such an extent, it was reduced to &euro;640.  That is not just two people's experiences; that is all our experiences.  When people get an insurance quote, the first thing they do is ring that insurance company to ask why it has increased to such an extent.  They demand a reduction in insurance premium because it is increased for no good reason whatsoever.  The reason is price gouging.</p>  <p>  It is important for the Government to defend the people and not the insurance companies.  I call on the Government to withdraw its amendment and to support the Bill.</p></speech>

It would be churlish of me not to recognise the significant contribution that Deputy Doherty has made in evolving policy on insurance in this country over many years.  We support the intentions of the Bill.  We appeal to the Government to drop its opposition to considering the Bill more immediately because there is an urgency to dealing with this issue for many thousands of people.</p>  <p>  The daylight robbery of consumers in the insurance sector is well known.  However, we know it is not a phenomenon unique to the insurance sector.  It is a problem frequently associated with phone and broadband contracts, the mortgage market and utilities.  That is why Labour's consumer protection Bill, which we published in December, focuses not exclusively on the area of insurance but also on other economic sectors.</p>  <p>  Last December's latest interim report by the Central Bank highlighted what many others already know, which is that most insurance providers in this country apply some form of what we call dual pricing.  Although this is shocking, it is not surprising given the repeated revelations about how the sector operates in this country.</p> <p>The loyalty penalty involved in this insidious practice is particularly galling.  It punishes ordinary customers, many of whom are older people, and demands that they pay more when the logic would suggest that, like in any other business, loyal customers ought to be rewarded, not punished.  This is a perverse situation in the extreme.  There is now clear evidence that the over-70s in particular are paying excessive prices for the renewal of their car insurance premiums, compared to other customers.  They pay up to &euro;1,000 more in some cases, where all other factors are equal.  A recent survey from<i>insuremycars.ie</i>showed astonishing differences in prices, such as a 74-year-old and a 76-year-old with the same risk profile being offered both &euro;534 and &euro;1,594 to insure a Peugeot 208 1.2 l car in my constituency of Louth.  There is something radically wrong when things like that happen.<br/><br/>Insurance companies have also been ruthlessly engaging in so-called price walking, wherein they incrementally increase prices every year for customers who automatically renew their policies.  Not only are loyal customers and those who are unable to switch being repeatedly ripped off, they are also, in effect, subsidising the lower cost premiums of new customers, who are often better off and represent a rich untapped seam for the sector.  Time and again we are told that competition in the market is always changing and that people always need to look at their options when renewing.  In reality, most people simply do not have the time, the resources or perhaps the full knowledge to keep up to date with changing market products and various complex offers.  This is usually the insulting best advice the State has to offer.  It tells people to shop around because there is plenty of value out there and that it is up to themselves.  For too long, the State has been missing in action on all of this.<br/><br/>As the Minister of State correctly pointed out, the programme for Government pledges to work to remove dual pricing from the insurance market but nearly eight months on we still have no concrete action.  The recent action plan on insurance reform was a golden opportunity to put the industry on notice that this practice will finally be outlawed in this country.  Another initiative, the reform programme, has long been an aspiration but is short on concrete action, with a final review due in September 2021 at the earliest and no timeline for legislation.  How much longer should ordinary customers have to wait for basic consumer protection?  That is the question most people are asking.<br/><br/>The Central Bank has been considering banning dual pricing since 2019, but what more is there to consider, given the evidence available to us?  We already know that the practice of dual pricing is rife across the home and car insurance sectors and the most recent of many interim reports provided what one stakeholder aptly described as &quot;No new findings&quot;.  It has just allowed for more dithering and more delay, with insurance firms laughing all the way to the bank.  What we need now is decisive action on dual pricing and radical reform of the insurance sector more generally.  We should not have to wait until the third quarter of 2021, as is being proposed, to even consider legislating to decisively deal with something that the dogs on the street know is a problem.  As Deputy Doherty pointed out, we are yet again playing catch-up.  The UK regulator has made an important intervention in this space and in the US some 20 states have outlawed the practice.  I remind the Minister of State that EU competition law is quite clear that a supplier is not permitted to operate dual pricing regimes.  What makes Ireland so special?  There should be no reason or excuse for delay.  The answer is simple.  Anyone renewing a policy should be offered at least the same price as any potential new customer and this insidious practice must be ended by law.<br/><br/>Despite the warnings and the evidence, we have a Government that repeatedly refuses to legislate and a regulator in the Central Bank that needs to be enabled to regulate.  In its reports, the Central Bank has warned about &quot;unintended consequences&quot;, such as a risk of stifling competition.  Does having to switch companies each year to maintain a similar price for a similar product represent fairness or fair competition?  This is not a problem unique to the insurance sector.  There is a more fundamental issue at play here, which also relates to utility bills, phone contracts and mortgage policies, as the Labour Party alluded to in our Consumer Protection (Loyalty Penalty And Customer Complaints) Bill 2020.  We are told time and again how much money we can save by switching and shopping around but let us look at the facts.  Half of Irish consumers never switch their energy provider, less than one in four has ever switched their health insurance provider and under 3% of people switched their mortgages over six months in 2019.  That is all.  In 2018, just 0.03% of customers switched the bank provider of their current account.</p> <p>There is a clear pattern here.  Many people do not switch, not because they do not understand why they should or because they are lazy, but because switching is difficult, time-consuming and many people simply lack the time, resources or knowledge to keep up with complex financial products and offers.  A series of ESRI studies have shown that financial literacy in this country is an issue; it is generally low.  There is also a clear class bias when it comes to switching, with disadvantaged groups switching significantly less overall.  The Government and the regulator expect citizens to be experts in insurance, mortgage and utility products while also working full-time, caring for their loved ones and dealing with all of the normal things that people have to do.  In short, all of the burden should not fall on the ordinary customer.  The State has a duty to the citizen.  If the market cannot be trusted to deliver fair pricing and transparency, as it cannot in this circumstance, we have a duty to legislate and to regulate to tip the balance in favour of the ordinary citizen.</p> <p> I welcome the thrust of this Bill.  It is a welcome contribution and call to action to level the playing pitch for insurance customers.  The rules of the game also need to be made fairer for consumers of other day-to-day subscription services that are routinely purchased.  The sale, marketing and servicing of other products in the telecoms, utilities and financial services areas demand our attention too.  Loyal phone, broadband and utilities customers often find themselves the victims of higher rates.  As I said earlier, the Labour Party would see offenders in this space brought to heel and made to introduce standardised and regulated customer services approaches that their custom and business should demand.  The shocking practices of, for example, Eir represent appalling levels of customer service.  As we know, its customer service levels have driven customers demented.  Companies must be made to handle customer complaints according to a regulated standard.  As it stands, consumer protection law does not impose a general obligation on service providers to establish a system for handling customer complaints or to abide by their own procedures as laid down and commitments that they may have made if they do not have such a system in place.  The Labour Party Bill would change that.</p> <p> On the substance of this Bill, we cannot afford another year of aspirational promises of reviews, interim reports and further delays.  We know the answer to this well-flagged problem.  Some of the answers are contained in this Bill.  Now is the time to act.  We can support business and stimulate our economy by addressing these inherent problems in our insurance sector.  This would make a huge impact on businesses' bottom line and assist them in the difficult days ahead for our economy.</p></speech>

The Social Democrats are happy to support it.  It is timely that it has come before us.  I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on producing the Bill, which deals with one of the very important aspects of the scandal that is our insurance industry.  While it is just one aspect, it is a very important one.  It underlines that there has been a huge amount of foot-dragging in regard to the glaring need for reform in the insurance industry, one that has been long-identified, with many promises made to do something about it.  A Minister of State was appointed supposedly to deal with this issue but little or no progress was made in that regard.  I welcome this Bill as this is an important aspect that needs to be dealt with.  I hope the Government will not oppose it, but will actively support and facilitate its early passage.</p>  <p>  The legislation being debated today is a no-brainer.  The issue of dual pricing is well known and widespread.  The Central Bank report published at the end of last year served to confirm what we all already knew, namely, that new customers are incentivised to switch providers with attractive entry deals while loyal customers are served price hikes each year.</p> <p>Dual pricing amounts to discrimination, particularly against older people and more vulnerable people, who are less likely to shop around and switch providers.  The so-called loyalty premium is, on average, costing customers who stay with their insurance providers approximately &euro;160 per year.  That is a significant amount of money in anybody's book.  The UK has already moved to introduce an outright ban on this practice.</p> <p> One has to wonder why the Government's insurance reform programme has been so slow and ineffective.  Despite knowing that dual pricing is a major issue, and having a report now that confirms this, the Government has already said it will not tackle this issue until after the Central Bank issues a final report this coming September.  One must ask why that is the case and what the justification is for such a delay.  The legislation on dual pricing is before us and is ready for the Minister.  I urge him strongly to take it on board and to deal, at least, with the particular aspect of very problematic industry behaviour that is provided for in the Bill.</p> <p> We in the Social Democrats have been very vocal in calling for reform of the insurance sector.  High insurance premiums add significantly to the cost base of our economy and that, in turn, makes affordable insurance fundamental to the long-term interests of the country.  It is a huge issue for both consumers and business.  The higher premiums go, the more they push up the cost of living.  Let us not forget the detrimental impact that astronomically high insurance costs had on the childcare sector at the end of 2019, when many cr&egrave;ches were facing permanent closure because one of their insurers dropped out of the market.</p> <p> The report upon which this Bill is based is part of a scope of work by the Central Bank to produce statistics and investigate the basis on which insurers have been increasing premiums.  However, the Social Democrats are not satisfied that the Central Bank is sufficiently consumer focused in its approach.  This is a problem that has been of concern for some time and it needs to be addressed.  The bank does not collect enough basic data, particularly in regard to premiums, and it is not active enough on issues concerning vulnerable customers, market concentration and market volatility.  We have been calling for some time for a new consumer affairs committee to be established, the sole focus of which would be outcomes for consumers.  Regulators should expect to have to answer far more regularly for their actions or, indeed, in many cases, their inaction.  Such a committee could play a valuable role in bringing about accountability as well as highlighting where there are gaps in legislation or deficiencies in powers that are available to regulators.</p> <p> Today's Bill deals specifically with dual pricing in the motor and home insurance sectors.  It is welcome in its own right.  However, everybody in the House is well aware that our insurance sector needs a much deeper reform programme to address problems right across the board, including health insurance, childcare insurance, public liability insurance and added issues in home and motor insurance beyond dual pricing.  I want to focus on health insurance in particular.  Approximately 45% of Irish people have private health insurance.  According to a consumer survey a few years ago by the Health Insurance Authority, 51% of customers pay more than &euro;1,500 per year for their health insurance, 73% of them have never switched provider and two thirds of those who have switched have done so only once.</p> <p> The Social Democrats are fully committed to the Sl&aacute;intecare plan for our health service.  We know, as everybody knows, that we are in desperate need of a universal single-tier healthcare system comparable to that of every other country in Europe.</p>  <p>That means ultimately eradicating the need that people feel currently to take out expensive private health insurance.</p> <p> Every day that goes by with the Government continuing to drag its heels in implementing Sl&aacute;intecare is another day with discrimination in our health service based on ability to pay.  We must eliminate cost at the point of access if we are to address inequality in healthcare in this country.  Everyone is signed up to that approach and what we need is action on that.  In the meantime, though, there is need for reform in respect of dual pricing within the healthcare area.</p> <p> I have mentioned the crisis that befell the childcare sector approximately one year ago.  It is a perfect example of how high insurance premiums can drive up our cost of living and force businesses to close as well.  Families with young children in this country face crippling fees for cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools.  This is due in large part to the cost of high premiums being passed on to them.  The problem may have temporarily quietened down as a result of Covid-19 shutting down cr&egrave;ches for much of last year, but it has certainly not disappeared permanently.  The Government needs to act to reduce the heavy burden of childcare costs on families.  One way of doing that is to tackle the issue of the cost of insurance premiums, ensure they are reduced and that the resulting benefit is passed on.</p> <p> We know that in the area of disability there is discrimination as well.  There is an issue in respect of insurance.  Another point I want to make pertains to discrimination, in effect, in the insurance sector.  Under the Equal Status Act insurance companies have an exemption whereby they can charge higher fees in respect of people with disabilities.  The Disability Federation of Ireland has flagged this as particularly concerning when it comes to employment.  The federation has seen several cases where people with disabilities had job offers rescinded when employers found out that hiring them would lead to an increased insurance premium.  This area needs to be addressed.</p> <p> Fundamentally, I warmly welcome this legislation.  It is an important part of the insurance scandal that has to be addressed and the Social Democrats wholeheartedly support it.</p> <p> In my remaining time I wish to make a comment on other aspects of insurance that are being addressed at the moment, including awards made and the book of quantum.  What is envisaged at the moment and what is being proposed by the Judiciary are wholly inadequate and will not address the fundamental issues relating to the level of awards that have been granted and the resulting impact on astronomically high insurance premiums for businesses and the public generally.  That is probably the most glaring aspect of insurance that needs addressing.</p></speech>

This Bill addresses one of the more obnoxious practices of the insurance industry, that of essentially punishing its most loyal customers for being loyal.  It is an outrageous policy and of course it hits at the loyal customer.  It also hits at the vulnerable customer who does not know how or feel confident to challenge an insurance company over increased insurance premiums.  It is a rotten practice and it should be banned.  That has happened in other countries but, of course, despite all the hand-wringing by those in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on this issue, they do not actually want it and they want to delay.  There will be reviews.  They need to wait for this, that or the other.  I am so bored with that story from the Government because it is a story we have heard for years.</p>  <p>  I remember I organised a meeting at the Red Cow Moran Hotel in 2017, when there was a particularly bad spike in motor insurance that threatened to run half the taxi drivers in the country off the road as well as hitting young drivers, punishing young drivers and so on.</p> <p>Then finance committees were looking into it, reports were done and there were lists of recommendations as long as one's arm.  What happened?  Nothing really happened and the insurance rip-off continues.  The Government does not want to do anything about it.  We heard from some of its spokespeople that the reason it is unwilling to do so is its unwillingness to challenge the market.  The spokespeople talked also of how it might upset competition.  That is the essence of it.  We must not upset competition, in other words, the private market.  We cannot do it because we might deter these vampire insurance companies, for that is indeed what they are.</p> <p> The insurance companies also lie straight out about the reasons for high insurance premiums.  We had all the nonsense about how it was all due to fraud and that the fraudulent public were ripping us all off.  Looking at the facts it can be seen that is not the case at all.  Since 2009 premiums are up 42% while the number of claims is down 42%.  Injury claims are down 20%.  The frequency of claims is down 40%.  The cost of claims per policy is down 3% but the profits of the insurance industry are running at about 9%, nearly double those made by the very profitable insurance industry in the UK.  The insurance companies have used nonsense and lies to justify price gouging and rip-offs.</p> <p> This has been serious not just for the young motorist and the loyal customer but it also has much deeper consequences because insurance covers so many other things.  Taking the example of childcare, half of childcare operators in this country nearly shut down at the end of 2019 because one of the two providers of insurance to the sector decided to pull out and the remaining one took the opportunity to jack up average insurance premiums from &euro;3,000 a year to &euro;9,000 because it had a monopoly.  As it happened, there was intervention, there were marches and so on and something was done about that but that is the way the insurance companies operate.  They have us over a barrel.  In spring of 2020 we had similar issues where they tried to take advantage of Covid and said they would not insure people in the context of Covid-19.  There was intervention but the fact is that this is where these insurance companies have us.  This extends to other areas of insurance such as home insurance.  I will not go into health insurance except to state that there should not be private health insurance.  There should not be profiteering from health.  The only reason we have it is that there is a two-tier system.  The public system is run down to bits and, out of fear, people are forced to pay extortionate amounts to private health insurance companies.  That is money being leached away from the investment in the public health system which we need.</p> <p> People Before Profit absolutely supports Deputy Doherty's Bill, but we must go further.  Insurance is too much of a rip-off, they have us too much over a barrel.  We need a not-for-profit State insurance company.  This has been done in places like Canada and elsewhere where insurance is not a rip-off and is done on a not-for-profit basis because it is too important to many sectors of our society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700016#O00200"><p>Listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, earlier I was struck by his focus not on the rip-off of ordinary people by the insurance companies, which is going on, but on the words "dual pricing".  He seemed to be very offended by the words and insisted we must call it differential pricing instead.  One may call it what one likes: differential pricing, flexible pricing, multiple pricing, variable pricing or indeed dual pricing, which is in fact what the Central Bank calls it.  The Central Bank uses the term interchangeably with differential pricing.  In a press statement on 14 December last year it said, "Dual pricing is evident across the private car and home insurance markets, where new and renewing customers are charged different premiums for reasons other than risk and cost of service."</p>  <p>  However, in plain terms, no matter what one calls it, it is a rip-off perpetuated by the insurance companies.  It is about insurance companies targeting those customers who they think are less likely to be able to shop around and hitting them with higher premiums.  Older people and more vulnerable customers are the most common victims.  The insurance companies do this using big data and obscure pricing models to make it so that victims do not even know.</p> <p>The Central Bank estimated that seven in every ten insurance customers are being charged more than the actual cost of their insurance as a result of this practice, thus netting the insurance companies more than &euro;180 million extra.</p> <p> Instead of a Government which covers up the practices of insurance companies and distracts from them, we need a left Government which stands up to the big insurance companies and bans dual pricing.  The simple truth is that the major insurance companies are ripping people off and the Government is letting them get away with it.  More than a year ago, the Central Bank highlighted that the average cost of motor insurance had risen by 42% despite a 40% drop in the number of claims.  What we have seen is a massive rise in profits of insurance companies.  Those same big insurance companies have caused crises in community centres and cr&egrave;ches by denying them cover.  In the case of small businesses hit by the pandemic, the insurance companies have dragged their heels and tried to avoid paying out.</p> <p> We cannot leave the insurance industry to those vultures.  It should be run as a public utility in public ownership and as a service for people, not an extortion racket for the insurance companies' investors.  This whole issue highlights the lie that the model of free market capitalism is somehow efficient.  For whom exactly is it meant to be efficient?  It is not efficient for the worker who may have to spend a working day each year shopping around, looking for different insurance products and trying to find the best possible price.  It is not efficient for older persons who may not use the Internet and are, therefore, left absolutely vulnerable to this complete rip-off without having any knowledge that it was perpetrated on them.  It is efficient only for the insurance companies which utilise the mass of information that should be at our disposal as a society and could be used to benefit ordinary people but, instead, is only used to rip people off.</p> <p> I refer to the increase in profits in the insurance industry.  Data compiled by the Central Bank show that Irish insurance companies made profits of almost &euro;3 billion between 2002 and 2016.  Profiteering is at the root of the massive jump in insurance premiums in recent years rather than the increase being down to the magician's trick the insurance companies try to pull of pointing towards fraudulent claims.</p> <p> I remember an interesting meeting of the finance committee at which the deputy governor of the Central Bank acknowledged that the presumption that encouraging more competition will automatically lower costs is an act of faith.  It is simply an act of faith that has no basis in fact or the evidence we have before us.  Instead of endlessly waiting for the invisible hand of the market to work its magic, the solution is for the State to nationalise the insurance industry and bring it into democratic public ownership to provide motor and home insurance as an essential public utility.  The State should assume the responsibility to provide insurance as an essential public utility on a progressive and non-profit basis that takes account of people's ability to pay and ends the systematic discrimination against many groups of people, including young people, older people and those on low incomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="11:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700017#P00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  The cost of insurance is always on people's minds, whether it be car insurance, home insurance or business insurance.  People do not know from year to year what their premium will be.  They have no stability in terms of the cost of insurance, whether it is home insurance or other insurance.  The idea that a person can go online to get a better deal when he or she gets his or her motor insurance renewal is fine, but those who do not have that access yet, such as some older people or those who do not have the right equipment to get online, accept the premium they get.  However, this issue of dual pricing and loyal customers paying over the odds for remaining with their insurer flies in the face of fair competition.  It needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  I know of community services and community groups that are trying to keep their insurance in place to protect themselves as community voluntary groups.  They are finding it more difficult year on year to insure the properties they hold on behalf of communities.  The pricing seems to be erratic; there is no sense in it.  The policies are complicated by the fact that different insurers offer different terms and conditions, so a customer needs to be an expert in insurance to differentiate what he or she is getting and to identify the best offer.</p>  <p>  I have received many phone calls about professional indemnity insurance.  It is very much needed by every business person, whether they be a sole trader or a big business conglomerate.  The cost of professional indemnity insurance is rising substantially.  From the point of view of the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who is present, he will see, and is seeing, increases in the cost of providing projects because of the increasing cost of professional liability insurance in the context of public sector contracts and similar situations where such insurance is required.  That must be borne in mind.</p>  <p>  I refer to public liability insurance and employer liability insurance, the cost of which is going erratically out of control.  There have been increases that do not match claims records or whatever.  Basically, every year, business people are holding their breath until they see what premium comes in on their insurance.  They get different premiums based on the risk they take on themselves.  Some of those risks are unacceptable and are putting businesses in jeopardy due to a lack of proper wholesome insurance.</p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of flood risk insurance.  I know of insurance companies that are refusing to offer flood risk insurance because there is some issue relating to flooding in a particular area even though the property in question may not have flooded in 50, 60, 70 or 150 years.  If a map now shows there is a flood risk in the area, the insurance companies will refuse to offer flood risk insurance.  This is causing problems for people who are trying to sell their properties to upgrade their homes and to have insurance as a safeguard for the future.</p>  <p>  It is important that we look at this issue and consider how can we best address it.  To be honest, deferring tackling this problem for six months or nine months is not the answer.  We need to tackle it head on.  The Government has been tipping around the edges of it.  Some Deputies may say that we need to have competition and make the market attractive for insurance companies to come in and trade here.  That is all very fine, but I believe that the Government and Members, as legislators, need to make sure that the cost of insurance is fair for the people who are paying for it.  Insurance customers need to know what they are getting and get it at a fair price in terms of money and risk.  This is something at which this House needs to look very seriously straight away.</p>  <p>  Consideration should also be given to the other element of the issue, that is, the claims scenario.  I compliment Peter Boland and the Alliance for Insurance Reform on their efforts to highlight all that is wrong in that particular area in terms of claims being paid out.</p>  <p>  Now is the time to open this issue up and have a serious debate about it.  We should ensure that the measures that are put in place are sustainable and do not have a negative impact on people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="11:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700017#P00300"><p>For how long have we been talking about insurance in Leinster House and the D&aacute;il?  How many years have passed in which Private Members' Bills, motions, discussions, questions and hot air have been produced <i>en masse</i>on the issue of insurance in Ireland?  What level of actual reform has happened in the intervening time?  One of the most frustrating things about being an elected representative in the D&aacute;il in the past ten years is comparing the level of conversation about the issue of insurance with the actual reform that has happened.  Any insurance reform in recent years that has come from Fianna F&aacute;&iacute;l or Fine Gael has been absolutely minimal.  There is a reluctance and a resistance within those two parties in terms of tackling this particular sector.</p><p>I laugh when I hear people talk about Fine Gael being the party of the free market.  The fact of the matter is that Fine Gael is the party of the dysfunctional market throughout Irish society, in market after market.</p> <p>I could mention the beef, housing or insurance industries.  Those industries are absolutely dysfunctional and there is nothing free about how they function whatsoever.  Fine Gael has stood over the dysfunction in the insurance industry for years, at a massive cost.  The instinct among Fine Gael representatives at the moment, especially around insurance and those other sectors I mentioned, is a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude.  There is an instinct in those political parties to sit on their hands and not interfere with those sectors, even if it is to reform them so they operate properly.  As a result, we had a situation whereby hundreds and thousands of businesses were on the edge of existence before the pandemic hit as a result of price gouging by insurance companies.  Businesses were unable to function.  Everything else in those businesses was working okay.  They had good customer relationships, products, marketing and communications and they were turning decent turnovers.  The price hikes that happened within the insurance industry were eye-watering.  I know of businesses in my own constituency whose insurance one year cost &euro;2,000 and was then hiked up to &euro;15,000.  Other businesses saw premiums that cost &euro;30,000 hiked up to &euro;150,000.  At the same time, the Government stood idly by and would not interrupt that behaviour.<br/><br/>The subject of today's Bill is to address an idea that turns business loyalty on its head.  The current regime says that the more loyal a customer is to an insurance company, the more that company will profiteer from the customer and the more the company will gouge from the customer.  Insurance companies take advantage of older people and make sure they take more money out of the pockets of those people.  As a result of that, we have seen insurance companies make enormous profits over the past number of years.<br/><br/>I pay tribute to Mr. Peter Boland and the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  Sometimes success has many fathers and many people have claimed ownership of reform in insurance here today.  The truth of the matter is that people such as Peter Boland have done considerable work around the country to try to bring this issue to the centre of the political debate and make sure that it is heard.  I pay tribute to people such as Peter Boland.<br/><br/>Aont&uacute; has been holding public meetings around the country and raising this issue, year after year.  Along with our colleagues in the Regional Group, we brought about the Private Members' Perjury and Related Offences Bill, premised on the idea that perjury should be illegal in courts.  That is something that the Government would not tackle at the time.<br/><br/>There was, thankfully, a recent High Court win for businesses, especially pubs, relating to business interruption insurance.  I invite Deputies to think about that as an example.  An insurance company took money from pubs and was not willing to pay them when the issue of business interruption arose.  It is incredible that FBD Insurance is today looking to shut down the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman from investigating cases that have been brought to that office.  A consumer protection body looking to be shut down by a private insurance company is absolutely scandalous.<br/><br/>On 20 February, a decision will be made regarding guidelines for payouts in the future.  I hear that the judges are mobilising against it and I caution the Government not to go down that route.  Irish payouts are already out of sync with international payouts in a range of areas and there need to be guidelines.</p></speech>

It is an immoral and indecent racket that is not justified in any way, shape or form.  I have been in business for 39 years; 40 years next year.  I am talking about myself but the same issues apply to all others, whether small business people, clubs in communities, hillwalking clubs or whatever they are.  We are all trying to do our best for the country but insurance companies keep ripping us off.  Why would they not when Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, have allowed them to do what they like?  Of course, those insurance companies get big financial support and it is all very cosy.  What is going on is a scandal.</p>  <p>  Young people are trying to get insurance and when they read the fine print in the contract, they have none.  During the pandemic, how many people had business interruption insurance?  There were many; nearly everybody had it.  I salute the four brave publicans who took a case to the High Court.  The Central Bank, of course, should have taken the case, like the public agencies did in England, and forced FBD Insurance, the company in that particular case, and all other insurance companies to honour the commitments for which their customers have paid.</p>  <p>  I remind every customer who has a policy that many of them have changed.  The wording of their cover changes when policies are renewed at different times during the year, for example, in August and September.  I urge customers to check it out.  The cover will have changed from what they had and they will find that the small print has changed.  Insurance companies are in the business of ripping people off, getting their money and paying out little.  Every business has to make a profit but the insurance companies are blackmailing, blackguarding, gouging and betraying people, especially the elderly who have shown loyalty.  I listened to Fran Curry's programme on Tipp FM this morning and some older people were talking about how their insurance premiums increased by a whopping 40% this year.  Those people do not have the ability to shop around because they do not have the IT skills and everything else.  Those people are being blackguarded.  There is no loyalty.  Insurance companies have deep pockets and have been aided and abetted by willing successive Governments for decades.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Doherty.  I have been listening to what he has been saying for the past number of years and it is 100% true.  The Government has failed to tackle this issue and that can be explained by a look at the Cabinet.  How many of them are self-employed?  I am self-employed and have vehicles parked at home which I am being charged full price to insure, as is the case for every self-employed person at the moment.  They are being charged full premiums.  Why has the Government not acted on this?  Fine Gael has been in government for nine years and it has failed.  The Cabinet does not have any self-employed people and does not understand them.  It does not understand what it is like to wonder, week after week, if the cost of an insurance premium is going to rise.</p>  <p>  I will tell the Minister of State how insurance companies work.  For companies and small businesses, premiums rise and customers do not know what is going to happen from one end of the year to the next, even if they have no claims.  I know a man who has been driving for the past ten years and whose insurance doubled when the premium for his car policy came out.  He thought that could not be right and went back to the insurance company, explained that he has never had an accident, penalty points or anything, and asked why his insurance premium had increased by 80%.  The insurance company told him that the statistics showed that he was due a claim.  The statistics showed that.  Four years on, he still has not had an accident or got penalty points but the statistics showed that he was due an accident and that is why the cost of his premium increased.  That is wrong.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to stand up and look after the people.  Nobody in the Cabinet understands insurance.</p></speech>

I appreciate very much the fact that he went on our own radio station, Radio Kerry, last week and gave a comprehensive and proper report on exactly what he is doing here today.  I am glad to support the Bill.</p>  <p>  This is a most important issue.  I see the number of people who are struggling.  People have to pay their insurance, whether on their vehicles, properties or businesses.  I have been paying public liability insurance for 35 years.  Some years it is easy, but more years it is tough to make up the money to pay the premium.  One has to pay it to keep one's doors open, lights on and wheels rolling.  One has to pay it. </p>  <p>  I feel sorry for young people who are given such a hard time by insurance companies when they start driving.  We have to get rid of the automatic assumption that because a person is young, be they a boy or a girl, and inexperienced when they start out, he or she will be a big insurance risk.  That is not always the case.  Young people can be excellent drivers.  They can be very careful and studious on the roads, doing their best to avoid accidents, the same as every one of us.  They are hit with thousands of euro of a cost.  Their vehicles might be reasonable to purchase but they are then faced with the massive cost of insurance.  We have to protect those people and work for them.  Anybody not supporting Deputy Doherty today will have big questions to answer in their constituencies.</p></speech>

I welcome any move to tackle the problem of some consumers being charged higher prices than others with a similar risk profile.  This adversely impacts more vulnerable consumers and older people.  All consumers deserve to be treated fairly when purchasing insurance.  It is essential that consumers and businesses should be treated fairly, equally and in a transparent manner, and not be harmed as a result of pricing models adopted by insurers.  Motor and home insurance are not luxury products.  Let us look at the way publicans have been treated.  They were shamefully dragged through the courts by insurance companies while they were on their knees and had paid insurance every year without fail.  They were loyal insurance payers.  While publicans were going bust, insurance companies were boasting about great profits, yet nothing was done by the Government.</p>  <p>  Then we have the young people who live in rural Ireland where there is no public transport.  They need to be able to drive to get to school, college and jobs.  These young people are being fleeced by insurance companies and charged astronomical prices.  The situation is compounded by the driver testing system, which is nothing short of a joke.  We cannot get tests for young people who need to be able to drive.  In the previous Government, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il backed Shane Ross's Bill and young people are now stuck at home thanks to that blackguarding, which is all it is, of young people.  It is time for the Government to stop backing insurance companies and to stop them robbing and denying young people a basic human right that we all had when we were young and able to drive a car.  The Government can stop crying crocodile tears for young people.</p>  <p>  In my remaining 20 seconds I wish to raise flood insurance in Skibbereen, Bantry, Roscarberry, Rathbarry and other such places that were flooded in August.  Some who had no insurance did not get the compensation package and in other cases people who had insurance who were flooded previously did not get money.  It is all a pure scam.</p></speech>

A 70-year old woman received a quote for more than &euro;800 when she went to renew her insurance last year.  Her son rang the same company to see what was the matter.  He was a big customer as he had a lot of vehicles.  He was asked if she was actually his mother.  They gave her the insurance for &euro;370 after.  Can one imagine that?  It was almost &euro;500 of a difference.</p>  <p>  Young drivers are paralysed before they get on the road at all.  What is happening is very wrong.  They are being charged &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 for their first insurance after doing all their driving lessons.  It is very clear what is happening to taxis, commercial drivers, passenger buses, hauliers, pubs, restaurants and hotels.  There is not enough competition.  Not since Se&aacute;n Quinn are we getting a fair crack of the whip for insurance.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the cost of claims, it has been said that the people of Ireland must have brass necks, but I say they have gold necks because a whiplash in Ireland costs approximately &euro;70,000 while in the UK it is &euro;7,000.  What is the difference in the necks here and the necks there?  The difference is that we are paying more for the insurance.  We are paying through the neck for it.  What is happening is very wrong.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to do something.  I have one worry about Deputy Doherty's Bill, which I will support.  Will the insurance companies listen?  Will they bring down the cost of insurance if we get rid of differential pricing or will they put it up?  That is my worry.</p></speech>

I thank him for bringing forward the Insurance (Restriction on Differential Pricing and Profiling) Bill 2021.</p><p>In May 2019 we saw the headlines: &quot;European Commission to investigate whether Insurance Ireland is operating a cartel&quot; in <i>thejournal.ie</i>and &quot;Insurers face millions of euro in cartel probe fines&quot; in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  In February 2021 we saw the headlines: &quot;Court rules pubs entitled to insurance over Covid closures&quot; on the RT&Eacute; website and &quot;Irish Pubs Entitled to Get Lockdown Insurance Payments from FBD: High Court Ruling&quot; in <i>insurancejournal.com</i>.  Just this week, <i>insurancetimes.co.uk</i>had a piece entitled: &quot;Irish policyholders aged over 70 experience 'inflated premiums' for motor insurance&quot;, which stated that there are &quot;staggering price differentials&quot; for drivers aged over 70 in Ireland.  Other media outlets were also covering the story this week, following a report published by<i>insuremycars.ie</i>.  Celine Clarke, Age Action's head of advocacy and communications said that the organisation has &quot;previously asked for actuarial data regarding the setting of insurance premiums for older drivers from Irish insurance companies,&quot; but it was told that the information was commercially sensitive.</p><p>In preparing for this speech, I was thinking about the origins of the insurance sector.  In fact, it is as old as society in some form or other.  Unsurprisingly, I came across the following sentences:</p> <blockquote> 	A number of insurance companies were started in England after 1711, during the so-called bubble era.  Many of them were fraudulent, get-rich-quick schemes concerned mainly with selling their securities to the public. </blockquote>  <p>Some things have not changed in a couple of hundred years.  I guess that there is little or no public trust in this sector, and despite some action, this and previous Governments have been very lax in regulating and sanctioning the sector.  Many of us know to shop around for insurance policies each time they are up for renewal.  People advise each other to get a number of different quotes from various providers and not to accept the initial renewal prices.  The differences are often stark.  Hundreds of euro can be saved by shopping around, and this obviously does not only apply to the insurance industry.  The original provider may then try to manipulate a customer into keeping his or her custom with it by throwing doubt over the extent of the coverage of cheaper options.  Often, even just by saying that one is shopping around, one can be offered a discount on one's initial renewal quote.  Shopping around is time-consuming and may be confusing.  A person needs to have a certain level of literacy, understanding and assertiveness to advocate for him or herself with these sectors.  That makes it all the more appalling that insurance companies are using profiling techniques in calculating their premiums, such as determining how likely a customer is to renew.  This is punishing a customer who dares to think that customer loyalty might be rewarded or that the company has their best interests at heart.  There are often discounts for shopping online or renewing online but what about the people who do not have that level of computer literacy or who perhaps do not even have access to the Internet at home?  The latter point has been highlighted recently.  Constituents in Donegal are especially impacted by differential pricing and profiling because we have one of the highest levels of forced car ownership across the country, according to the report, Identifying Hotspots of Transport Disadvantage and Car Dependency in Rural Ireland.  One could ask what hope we have.</p><p>This is a short but technical and very important Bill.  It will address some of the discriminatory practices of some insurance providers relating to pricing and profiling techniques.  The Bill addresses these issues specifically in the home insurance and motor insurance markets.  Section 5(2) provides for the Central Bank to issue a code of practice.  I would have preferred to see the wording &quot;shall issue&quot; rather than &quot;may issue&quot;, as we need to be as strict as possible in this area and also strict on the Central Bank.  Section 6 provides for the annual reports by the Central Bank, which should set out recommendations to ensure compliance with the Bill.  I welcome section 6(3) which states that the Minister shall lay a statement before the D&aacute;il to outline the reasons it is not accepting the recommendations of the Central Bank, if he or she does not.</p><p>I am pleased that we are discussing this Bill today and I hope the Government will accept it.  It is right to see the media coverage highlighting the many problems with the insurance sector, but there must be follow-up.  The sector cannot be allowed to discriminate against people in this way.  It is laughable to see Government messaging about certain issues that have already been highlighted by the Opposition.  We have good ideas and it behoves the Minister to listen to us and accept our ideas.  That way we would all be working for the betterment of the country.  Instead, there is a Government narrative of anything they can do, we can do better, or copying homework but putting a fancy Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael-Green Party logo on the top of the page.  The electorate sees through that and they see the spin and delay.  I welcome this Bill and will be supporting it.  I commend Deputy Doherty on his work on this matter.</p></speech>

We have discussed the issue of dual pricing and how wrong it is quite a bit.  Effectively, it punishes customers of insurance companies for their loyalty.  It is also important to point out that, in effect, it preys on people's vulnerability.  What frequently happens is that it affects people who have been with an insurance company for a very long time, who know that they must insure their car, home or whatever else, and they get a bill in the post.</p> <p>The only way to challenge that is to ring around or to ring a specific insurance company.  At any time, and particularly at this time, it can be hard to get to speak to anybody in these companies.  One rings up and is faced with an option of dialling 1 for sales, 2 for claims and 3 for whatever else.  A certain group in society find this difficult.  My parents were among them although they are no longer around.  There is a large cohort that finds this difficult.  It goes beyond insurance companies.  Right across services that are provided, people think that a customer service is providing a telephone line that people can sit at the end of, pressing a number for different options.  That is difficult for elderly people and for vulnerable people to do without getting confused.  That needs to be addressed.  That inability to demand a fairer quote is something that insurance companies prey on.  People give up.  They say that they could not get through and that they have to continue to insure their car, house, farm or whatever.  Multiple-peril insurance is another example.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p> I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming's, contribution where he said that the Government has concentrated on dual pricing and accepts that it is wrong but that differential pricing is not, and that that is a reason to oppose the Bill.  If we all agree that dual pricing is wrong, why is nothing being done about it by the Government, the Central Bank or anybody else?  There is consensus in the House that it is wrong for a variety of reasons but nothing is being done about it.  If the problem is differential pricing and the Government thinks that differential pricing is acceptable or offers benefits, can the Bill not be allowed to progress?  I appreciate that the Title of the Bill might cause a problem but can we not see dual pricing addressed?  Do we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the Government is proposing?</p> <p> We are now rightly told that childcare is essential to society.  It is indeed essential to the functioning of society, yet cr&egrave;ches which offer childcare find it increasingly difficult to get a range of quotes for occupier's liability insurance.  I see the Minister is shaking his head but I know that in the previous Government, his colleague, Michael D'Arcy, dealt exclusively with this issue, though not with much success despite his best endeavours.  He said that he went to various underwriters in the United Kingdom etc. and they were pulling out of the market because they were not interested in quoting for Ireland.</p> <p> There was a time when Fine Gael governments were not necessarily afraid to intervene in the market.  A Fine Gael Minister set up the predecessor of VHI because there was a need for a State company to offer health insurance.  I heard Deputy Boyd Barrett say that there should not be voluntary health insurance.  That is a slightly different ideological matter.  We all agree that childcare and cr&egrave;ches are essential and that, by law, they have to be insured.  Is it not time for the State to offer occupier's liability insurance by setting up a company to intervene in the market?  If the market is as skewed as the then Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, found that it was because of the unwillingness of various underwriters in the City of London to quote prices in Ireland then the State has to intervene and quote prices for occupier's liability in this sector and across other sectors.  The hospitality sector is closed for the moment and will be for an indefinite period but it will come back at some point and will need occupier's liability insurance.  The State needs to look at intervening in this.</p></speech>

I support the Government amendment moved by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  I will address some claims made by Opposition Deputies.  A claim has been made about action that has been taken elsewhere and action that has not been taken here in Ireland.  Those two claims are central to many of the political arguments put forward today.  I will conclude by addressing some points in Deputy Doherty's Bill.</p><p>I begin by addressing a point made about what has happened in the United Kingdom.  It is a point that has been made by many of the Sinn F&eacute;in speakers who supported Deputy Doherty's opening statement.  Let us be clear about what has happened in the UK.  I will read from the Financial Conduct Authority website because this set of facts has been entirely absent in what has been put forward in claims about what the FCA has done in the UK.  It is correct to say that the FCA has put forward proposals to deal with this issue and it referred to figures that were accurately quoted by Deputy Doherty in his opening contribution.  Let us look at what it will then go on to do, which its website states is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	The FCA is seeking views on its proposals by 25 January 2021. It will consider all the feedback and intends to publish a Policy Statement and new rules next year along with its response to the consultation feedback. </blockquote>  <p>When we are focusing on what is happening in the UK and claims of action being implemented in the UK, let us look at the reality of what is happening, which is that it has published proposals as outlined by Deputy Doherty, but these proposals are subject to public consultation and further feedback and will then lead to a policy statement with implementation of action next year.  That is not what we have heard from some Opposition speakers here today.</p><p>Another claim made by many Deputies is that other countries have acted.  Name the other countries that have acted.  Name the countries in the European Union that have implemented the Bill that many Opposition Deputies are supporting.  If a claim is being made regarding the need of the Government to act, on the basis of actions taken elsewhere, I ask those who are supporting this Bill to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the UK and to explain how this legislation has been implemented elsewhere.  If it has been, what are the effects of it?  I make these points because this is an issue that the Government and Central Bank are taking seriously, which is why we are not tabling an amendment to oppose Deputy Doherty's Bill.  We need to continue to engage on this critical matter.  Claims that are being made about the need for us to act on the basis of action that has happened elsewhere need to stand up to scrutiny and to be debated in the House.</p><p>We then move on to what we are doing in Ireland, action that has already been taken and actions that are yet to be taken.  Claims were made by many Opposition Deputies that nothing is happening.  It is worth acknowledging and making the case for what has actually happened.  Of the Government's interventions, a brief list would include the Central Bank national claims information database from 2018, the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018, the Judicial Council Act 2019, Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, and, working with Deputy Doherty, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019.  Action has been taken and action is to come.  All of this is included in steps that have been outlined by the T&aacute;naiste in a ministerial group that he is leading in the Government's action plan on insurance reform.  It includes itemised actions that will be taken to deal with the rising premiums and the high premiums that many face, especially small and medium-sized business owners and what it means for their viability and ability to keep their companies going and employ people, which we know about and we acknowledge progress needs to be made on.</p> <p>That is the reason these actions have been taken and the reason for the Government's action plan for the further steps we are going to take.  With regard to the legislation proposed by Deputy Doherty, I also acknowledge the focus he has brought to this issue.  I acknowledge the scrutiny he has brought in his analysis of what is, as I have said, a critical issue for many employers.  However, we have concerns about this Bill.  An acknowledgement of the Deputy's intent and of our commitment to act further does not prevent the Government from expressing concerns about aspects of this Bill and about what it could mean for those who will, in the future, need insurance policies that are more affordable than those now available.  We have three concerns.  The first is what this Bill would mean for the insurance companies operating in Ireland that offer discounts.  That is a serious concern of the Government which needs to be reconciled with the intent behind this Bill, if possible.  </p> <p> Our second concern is what the Bill could mean for new insurance providers and suppliers entering the market or for existing insurance providers when providing new services in sectors of our economy in which they do not currently provide services.  This is a legitimate and real concern.  I heard Deputy McNamara correctly make the point that there were only two insurance providers for the childcare sector at a particular point.  We saw the great difficulties this caused.  If we want more suppliers of insurance services in more parts of our economy, it is surely legitimate to make the point that we are concerned that this Bill could affect, or even prevent, that.  That is something the Government does not want to see happen.</p> <p> The final point relates to why we are not opposing the Bill but merely putting forward a timed amendment.  This is in acknowledgement of the work the Central Bank is doing and of the value of that work.  From a process point of view, this work bears more than some similarity to the kind of work happening elsewhere which has been praised by Opposition Deputies.  We believe it is appropriate that this work is concluded.  When we have an independent regulator overseeing the sector, a regulator that has produced a report which has been commended by the Opposition, it is appropriate that we allow its process to conclude before the Government takes further action.  Many Opposition Members will always create a narrative that the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, or I am standing by an elite and by those who, it is claimed, seek to take advantage of those who need insurance.  It is not a case of the Government standing with vested interests but a case of the Government recognising that work has already been carried out in respect of dealing with this issue.  This work is led by our Central Bank.  We should, and will, return to this issue when the Central Bank has concluded the process which it has itself initiated.  It is for that reason that, in conjunction with all of the action steps we have taken and all of the policies in place, the effects of some of which were debated today, the Government is committed to making progress on this issue, among many others.</p> <p> One fact, on which I will conclude and which was not acknowledged in today's debate, is that since the second quarter of 2018, insurance premiums in the motor sector have fallen in every quarter.  This shows the difference that competition and the right policies can make in this area.  It also reminds me of the need to allow our Central Bank to conclude the work it is doing.  It is equally important that we accurately acknowledge what has and has not happened in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I note that, in the Minister's contribution, he said that he has some concerns.  It is very regrettable that the concerns he outlined were only for insurance companies and providers.  Anyone watching this debate would prefer it if he had expressed even a small concern for customers.  That is what the Opposition has been speaking about today - the customers of insurance companies who are effectively being gouged.  They are not lazy; they have constraints on their time.  They may lack the capacity to do the shopping around the Minister says is so important.  They may not have access to the Internet.  They might find it very frustrating to spend an hour or more on the phone or they may simply believe that the insurance companies should be regulated to the point that the practice of dual pricing would simply not be allowed.  When the Minister came in, his concern was unfortunately only for the insurance companies.  They actually seem to be doing quite well.  It is the consumers at the business end of this issue who are being effectively ripped off.  We need to end the insurance rip-off.</p>  <p>  As I have said, in my own constituency in the north of County Dublin there are many areas that are not well served by public transport.  Young people and people with young families have no choice but to have a car if they are to get around.  The infrastructure to live their daily lives is simply lacking.  They are extremely busy.  They are not lazy or stupid; they just do not have the time to compare prices, shop around and so on.  They need this regulation so that they will not be at the mercy of the insurance companies about which the Minister is so very concerned.   They want fairness.  They want to know that when they take out an insurance policy, it will be fair and they will get a good price without having to spend hours and hours trying to outwit the algorithms used by the insurance companies.  They want to know that they will get a fair price.  That is what an Teachta Doherty has sought to do here today and that is what everyone has spoken about - fairness for consumers.  It is very regrettable that, when the Minister spoke, he spoke only about fairness for big multinationals and big insurance companies.</p></speech>

The bad news is that, rather than allowing the Bill to proceed to the next stage quickly, the Government has instead delayed its passage by nine months.  The fact that the Government did not oppose this legislation outright is testament to those who have highlighted the insurance rip-off in this country.  I commend all of those motorists, homeowners, businesspeople, childcare managers, community groups and others who have publicly told their stories of despicable practices and unjustified premium hikes by the insurance industry.  I thank all of those people who contacted their Government Deputies asking them to support this week's Bill to ban dual pricing.  I am firmly of the view that, without their efforts, the Government would undoubtedly have voted against this Bill entirely.  Anyone listening to the Minister will have heard somebody who is wedded to the <i>status quo</i>, who is happy to allow insurance companies to continue fleecing their customers, and who had to be taken kicking and screaming to the point we have reached today.  Above all, I commend Deputy Doherty, who has done more than any other single person to expose the price gouging and uncompetitive and downright reprehensible activities of the insurance industry.  He has also highlighted the inactivity, verging on outright complicity, of successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael governments.  Without Deputy Doherty's efforts, we would not have had the spotlight shone on these practices which have been such a burden on ordinary workers, families and businesses.  Without his tenacity, we would not have known of the lengths to which insurance companies will go to squeeze every last cent from their customers and, therefore, the Government would not have tackled these issues.  It is fair to say that without Deputy Doherty, many people would not even know what dual pricing is, let alone be part of this campaign to outlaw it.</p> <p>Let us remind ourselves that dual pricing is the mechanism that insurance companies use to fleece their most loyal customers, who are often their most vulnerable ones.  This practice will be banned because of the efforts of Deputy Doherty and of all those people who got behind this campaign.  The Government may be able to delay progress but it will not stop it.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I will deal with some of the issues put forward by Government spokespersons in their rebuttal.  To the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, I say that he is a year behind the time and needs to catch up.  The UK's Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, is not completing its consultation next year; it completed it on 25 January this year and is going to announce its final price remedy in the second quarter of this year, not next year.  This will come into effect four months from the date of the announcement, that is at the latest in October, and not next year.  This will be the third round of consultation.  The first report that it carried out did not seek to ban the practice.  After consultation with the industry, the second report found that the industry would not go far enough and the authority says now that there is nothing to do but to ban it.  It is now looking at the tweaks as to the implementation of the ban and not at the ban itself.  It will be banned in Newry, Strabane and Belfast later this year but here in this State, our Parliament or at least our Government are happy to allow insurance companies to facilitate this price gouging.</p>  <p>  On the Minister&rsquo;s second issue as to discounts, this legislation does allow for discounts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, made the same claim.  It is deeply regrettable that the Government does not understand the issue in terms of the legislation.  Section 3 of the Bill, for example, provides that rating &ldquo;factors [cannot be used] unrelated to risk other than for the addition of business expenses&rdquo;.  What are business expenses?  These are defined in section 4 of the Bill and the definition is actually lifted from the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 which says that these business expenses provide for commissions and acquisition costs in acquiring new policies, which can include discounts.  Dual policies, whether it is home or motor insurance, can also continue to exist where there are discounts there, as long as they are also provided to renewing customers and not just to new customers.  The Minister&rsquo;s arguments are falling flat.</p>  <p>  They talk about the issue in respect of new providers.  I put the evidence before the Ministers again from the Financial Conduct Authority.  Why is this important if it is coming from a different jurisdiction and is it relevant to here?  Of course it is relevant because the Central Bank and the FCA came to the same conclusion on the overcharging of motorists and homeowners with this practice because most of the companies operate in both markets.  The FCA found when it looked at 17 million different parts of policies, across 6 million unique policy documents, that this is actually going to increase competition.</p>  <p>  How does that work?  It works because insurance companies like Allianz, Aviva and Liberty have a huge amount of data on individuals.  Their pricing models are based on how likely it is that customer &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; will stay with a company or shop around.  If these customers are likely to stay, with all of the information that the companies have gathered and can purchase on the individual over the years, they can then push up the premium to exorbitant levels.  A new entrant cannot compete with that.  That is why there is a European investigation being carried out on data-sharing by the industry here in Ireland.  There have been dawn raids on the industry because they are operating like and have been called a cartel.  By levelling the playing field one is actually increasing competition, but the Government does not need to take my word for it, it can take that of the FCA which has looked at this issue right across the same insurance companies that are operating here.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said that this Bill would impact on childcare settings and providers that are not being covered any more.  The legislation does not deal with that but deals with motor insurance and home insurance.  I ask the Minister to read and understand the legislation, please.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, claimed that every speaker spoke of dual pricing and omitted to talk about differential pricing.  He went on to say that this is not what the legislation is about.  I drafted the legislation.  The Central Bank report which we are waiting for was commissioned at my request.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, did not raise this issue and neither did the senior Minister for years, despite the positions that they have held.</p>  <p>  The reality is - this is where the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, should stick to his script because these were unscripted comments of his - that dual pricing is a form of differential pricing.  My word does not need to be taken on this, one need only look at the Central Bank&rsquo;s report, and perhaps even read it.  What we are doing is restricting differential pricing by banning dual pricing.  For 77% of customers who are renewing home insurance and 67% of motor insurance customers, this will put money back into their pockets.  The FCA has estimated that this will benefit between &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;12 billion over the course of a decade by putting money into people&rsquo;s pockets, increasing competition and increasing transparency.</p>  <p>  I have already introduced legislation and I have worked with Government on it, but the Government has delayed it for two years and is pulling the same stroke here by delaying this important legislation.  I ask the Government to drop the delay and to allow us to proceed to Committee Stage with regard to some of the preparatory work that is needed.  I appeal to any person who is watching this, that the Government may try to delay us but will not stop us.  In the meantime, people should not accept their insurance renewal and should shop around because insurance companies are fleecing people.  Until the time is reached when we get the better of the Government on this issue and these practices are banned, the public are vulnerable to these exploitative practices.</p></speech>

They provide 19 million unpaid caring hours per week and they save the State &euro;20 billion every year.  They do their work looking after vulnerable loved ones with compassion and love and their value is immeasurable.  The challenges and the risks they face during the pandemic have increased dramatically.</p><p>I want the Taoiseach to listen to the words of Mike Molloy who cares for his mother who suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s: </p> <blockquote> 	I'm part of an army of hundreds of thousands of people in this country, the forgotten frontline if you like; who do what they do because of the most basic and yet the most beautiful of human emotions, Love. I am a Family Carer!<br /><br />We may care for different people. In my case it's my elderly mother who suffers from Parkinson's but even though the condition or vulnerability of the person we love is different, our daily lives are similar. From early morning to late at night we ensure that the person we love is well and safe.<br /><br />This is challenging at any time but the pandemic has made it nearly impossible. The gripping fear we have of the virus somehow managing to slip into our homes through the only few activities...grocery shopping and pharmacy deliveries, that we can and must partake in, is huge.<br /><br />We live largely like prisoners under some form of house arrest with people for whom the consequence of Covid can easily be serious illness or even death. </blockquote>  <p>Mike goes on to express the heartache and anger felt by family carers at not being given a place in the vaccine roll-out queue.  He powerfully outlines the reason why this needs to happen.  It is something my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has raised with the Minister for Health on a number of occasions.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has announced that the vaccine allocation groups are to be reconfigured and it is absolutely essential that family carers are given their place as part of this reconfiguration.</p><p>The Oireachtas Committee on Health has unanimously agreed to write to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on prioritising family carers for the vaccine because family carers are frontline health workers and deserve to be recognised as such.  Carers employed by the HSE are included in the rollout and it only makes sense that family carers are given their place too.</p> <p>Indeed, family carers have been prioritised for vaccination, as the Taoiseach knows, in the North.  It is high time that we followed suit.</p> <p> We have all had a tough year, but family carers have walked a particularly hard road during this pandemic.  I held a meeting with hundreds of them last week and they told me that the prospect of the vaccine is the light at the end of a long and dark tunnel.  They said that it was like a punch in the stomach to be told that they would have to wait to be vaccinated along with the general population.  They feel their lives and the clear risks they face do not matter.</p> <p> Yesterday the Taoiseach referred to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and described it as a "game changer".  Today, I am asking for a game changer for family carers.  This means ensuring they are prioritised for vaccination.  I ask the Taoiseach to give family carers the certainty they need and to confirm that they will have a place on the priority list to be vaccinated.</p></speech>

I have received very moving correspondence from Mike Molloy.  As Deputy McDonald said, he wrote the moving piece about a year trapped in fear.  It brilliantly and emotionally captured the enormous stress and strain being felt by family carers and those who care for their loved ones, which in Mike's case is his mother who has Parkinson's disease.  Obviously, because of Covid-19 and the ease with which it spreads, those carers must be extremely careful in their lives so that they do not in any way inadvertently spread Covid-19 to their loved ones.  The mobility of those carers is impacted.  The fear that their loved ones for whom they care will contract the virus is one they live with daily.  I empathise fully with the plight that Mike Molloy has articulated and conveyed so eloquently.  I share many of the sentiments which he articulated in that article in respect of the need for a global approach to vaccination and his hope that the election of President Biden will in itself bring a greater unity of purpose among the global community in that regard.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Irish context, Deputy McDonald knows the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, has given clinical advice on the cohorts and the sequencing of who is to get the vaccine first.  The first group included residents of nursing homes, the staff in nursing homes and front-line healthcare workers and that is where we directed the volume of vaccines we got in quarter 1, particularly the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was key.  The vaccines went to that cohort.  It is now being administered those aged over 85 years old.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has written to NIAC regarding re-examining that cohort and the sequencing of vaccination for those contained in the group.  My understanding is that NIAC will be responding to that query today regarding sequencing those people who in its view should be prioritised for vaccinations.  The overwhelming clinical view has been that senior citizens should be the first to be vaccinated because they are the most vulnerable.  Equally, however, the Minister and the Government have put that request to NIAC to consider the situation, because we are of the view that those who are immunosuppressed or have particular conditions, like Parkinson's disease and cystic fibrosis, should be prioritised.  Clearly, if those people contracted the virus they would be more vulnerable to severe illness and potential mortality.  We are awaiting the response from NIAC in that regard, and then the Government will consider further the sequencing and order in which vaccines will be administered.</p>  <p>  At the moment we are still very much dependent on volumes of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the cohort of those aged over 70 years old, in addition to low volumes of supplies of the Moderna vaccine.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is being used for the remainder of the front-line healthcare workers to be vaccinated.  That is where we are right now.  The volumes will increase significantly in quarter 2 and we are awaiting authorisation of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine.  I understand that may happen sooner than was originally envisaged, which would give us considerable hope.  I am not using the word "game changer" anymore.  I used a different word as Gaeilge last night to suggest that life should change with the higher volumes of vaccines coming in and that we should be able to deal in a more timely manner with the many people in the situation of Mike's mother who need a vaccine.</p></speech>

We must remember they carry out the work they do with little support, and in some cases with no support from the Government.  The work they do is unseen.  It is hidden away in the privacy of their family homes and they do not get to clock in and out.  It is a 24-7.  It is a commitment undertaken day in, day out and it is done with a spirit of love and care, as I am sure family carers have told the Taoiseach.  The risk they face during this pandemic is enormous.  It is just unacceptable that they have been forgotten again and have been left with the general population for vaccination as and when it is possible.  That is wrong.  I put it to the Taoiseach that NIAC is wrong to have left family carers in that position.  As Head of Government, what does the Taoiseach propose to do about this situation?  Does he agree that family carers must be recognised and that they need to be given their place of priority in the roll-out of this vaccine?</p></speech>

I did not think that the D&aacute;il on its own was going to decide on who gets vaccinated first, in a political way.  To juxtapose the vaccination programme so far with suggesting that 500,000 people are the "forgotten people" is wrong.  No one here wants to forget anybody regarding vaccination.  The Government's agenda is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, which is dependent on getting the requisite volumes of vaccines into the country.  That is our objective, like everybody else's in this House.  I am not forgetting anybody in respect of vaccination.  I do not think that charge should be made.  There can be wider political issues around supports for carers, and the Government has provided a whole range of supports for carers.</p>  <p>  Regarding the vaccination programme, however, of course we want to vaccinate those who have been prioritised on medical and age grounds.  Why?  We want to do that because the vaccines prevent severe illness and mortality.  The evidence base so far from doctors and public health clinicians is that senior citizens in nursing homes should be first and then the front-line healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 in their daily interactions on the front line.  Regarding many cases, we have said to NIAC to reconsider the cohort.  We have formally written to it regarding those people with conditions and those who are more vulnerable to falling victim to the virus in terms of severe illness or mortality.</p></speech>

He went on to say that he believed that, &quot;a robust approach to tracking the infection pathways of each case of Covid-19 backwards from the point of diagnosis [...] will help to suppress the [virus]&quot;.  It is quite extraordinary that is only talking about that approach at this point.  Some 12 months into the Covid-19 pandemic, the Taoiseach is talking about tracking down where the virus is being transmitted.  Some of us have been asking for that to be done for a very long time.</p><p>Retrospective tracking and tracing, of course, goes back 14 days, it establishes where the virus was picked up, whether it has come from abroad and if the transmission occurred in restaurants, family gatherings or workplaces, for example.</p> <p>It is absolutely essential information for the management of a pandemic.  NPHET called for that last August.  Who does the Taoiseach think is going to do that work?  It is essential work, but who is going to do it?  Public health doctors are the people who have the expertise to carry out this work.  We should, of course, have a properly resourced public health doctor service but unfortunately we do not have that at the moment.  Properly resourced public health doctors are an important part of any health service but in a pandemic they are absolutely essential.  Yet this service has been starved of funding for many years.</p> <p> Public health is the only discipline in our health service that does not have the grade of consultant, in spite of having exactly the same qualifications.  If the virus numbers are to be brought down and brought under control, a fully staffed, consultant-led regional public health team service is absolutely essential.  Will the Taoiseach explain what is the delay in addressing this issue?  Three major reports have recommended an upgrading of that service: the Scally report from nearly three years back; the Crowe Horwath report in December 2018; and last year's nursing home expert panel recommendation.   Everybody is saying it is essential that a properly resourced public health service is put in place.  Is it any wonder that doctors will not come back to work in that service here?  Is it any wonder that other countries are recruiting our public health doctors?  What will the Taoiseach do to resource this essential service properly?  The Taoiseach has been making promises for a very long time and yet no action has been taken.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when he is going to do this?</p></speech>

When the pandemic began, testing and tracing capacity within the country was virtually non-existent, in terms of the requirements to combat a pandemic.  It was literally built from scratch.  The Deputy is correct that for quite a number of years there has been a lack of resourcing of public health medicine in general.  The Deputy will know that from her own time in government as well.  I support what she has just said.  In my view, very rapid progress has been made in developing a testing and tracing capacity, and particularly from the summer onwards, so much so that our testing and tracing capacity more generally is up there in the top tier of the European Union member states.  It is a more independent workforce now than at the start of the pandemic when a lot of people were redeployed, of necessity, to engage in testing and tracing.</p>  <p>  In relation to public health, the resources have now been provided in the budget.  Resourcing has been provided to the HSE to recruit personnel and to double overall the staffing within the public health domain.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the need for a consultant-led approach to public health.  A consultant-led public health model is a priority of the Government.  There have been ongoing discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, and also involving the unions and the partners.  I hope that those would be brought to a conclusion quickly and that the process would conclude in terms of the consultant issue in particular.  The plan is to double the current workforce in public health, including an additional 255 permanent staff at an annual cost of more than &euro;17 million.  This was included in the &euro;4 billion allocated to Health for 2021 - &euro;2 billion for Covid and &euro;2 billion for non-Covid - which allows for the embedding of a permanent workforce in a number of areas into the future.  It is not just a pandemic era investment in public health; it is for the long haul.  Engagement has commenced with the Irish Medical Organisation.  There are issues, while doing this, so that we also reform the public health model in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  A lot of work has been undertaken by the Department and the HSE in terms of a detailed framework for the future public health model.  That, of course, includes consultant level roles.  That engagement has begun between the IMO, the Department and the HSE going back to January.  I have asked that this would be brought to a timely conclusion.  The Government is committed to doing this.</p></speech>

This has been recommended for 15 years.  Three major reports have recommended it.  Since last summer, various Government spokespersons have been saying that we are nearly there and nearly reaching a conclusion.  The Taoiseach drove public health doctors to the point of threatening strike action in January because of his failure to respond to this need and to actually take action on it.  That strike action was called off at the last minute on the understanding that the Government would actually deliver on its promises.  It still has not happened.  Is the Taoiseach going to force those doctors to the point of strike action again?  How long do they have to wait for action from the Government?  People are fed up with these promises.  This is an essential service.  It should, of course, be properly resourced.  It is critical that it is properly resourced when we are trying to respond adequately to a pandemic.  Will the Taoiseach give us a timescale on when agreement will be reached and when funding will be made available to upgrade those doctors?  They have the same qualifications as every consultant in every other discipline of medicine.  Why will the Taoiseach not do this?  Let us not have public health doctors going on strike in the midst of a pandemic.  It would be unforgivable.</p></speech>

This Government has decided to do that and this Government has allocated the funding.  The issue now is structure, framework and how it is done for the future.  It must be done properly with a view to making sure not only that we have a heavily resourced service, but also that we have a very well worked out and high-quality public health service into the future that is expanded significantly on what we have today.  Yes, the public health doctors are working under significant pressures and constraints right now.  Of that there is no doubt.  I thank them for the work they have been doing.  There is engagement with the unions and their representatives.  This will have to intensify.  From our perspective, and from my perspective as Taoiseach, this needs to be brought to a timely conclusion.</p></speech>

These houses are built to an exceptionally high standard by local builders in good locations.  From 2021 to 2022 Kerry County Council, under the stewardship of our CEO, Ms Moira Murrell, and the director of housing, Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, plans to deliver a further 278 units.  As of November 2020 there were 2,183 households qualified for social housing in Kerry, more than 80% of which are waiting for one-bedroom and two-bedroom style housing units.  Over the next two years more than 40% of Kerry County Council's new builds will be one-bedroom and two-bedroom housing.  Kerry County Council could do a lot more if given more resources.  It could construct further housing.  It could buy housing units that might become available from the private sector if they could be bought at a prudent and affordable price, which might actually be a lesser price than it would cost to build new.  In other parts of the country, one might hear other politicians from all sides of the House objecting to houses in their constituencies.  In Kerry, we need housing and we want it.  Our politicians are all of the one voice.  Our local authority members and county councillors, from all parties and none, are of the one voice.</p> <p>They want to take care of the housing needs of the people of Kerry which are immense.  In a county the size of Kerry to have 2,183 people awaiting housing is not the fault of our local authority.  Whenever the Kerry County Council housing department has been given funding, we spent it expeditiously and got value for money, either through purchasing or new builds.</p> <p> As I always say, Kerry is better than everywhere else.  We have better building contractors than anywhere else.  We have extremely efficient local builders and companies that employ local people which in turn generates money for the local and national economy.  I ask the Taoiseach to take into account that we must focus.  Great strides have been made on three-bedroom houses and other such family units.  We now need to concentrate on one-bedroom and two-bedroom accommodation in County Kerry to take care of the great need we have.</p></speech>

He knows that as a humble Cork man, I have always been a great admirer of the literary creativity and innovative character of Kerry people.  I have been in awe of the genius of the Kerry DNA for a long time, as a neighbour across the county bounds.</p>  <p>  The Government has a target of 255 direct builds in County Kerry and 70 leases for 2021.  If the Deputy can go back to Kerry County Council and it can do more, I will talk to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage who really wants local authorities to come back to him saying they can do more.  The more shovel-ready projects on housing there are, the more responsive the Government will be in getting them done.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right; the housing lists are too long.  Too many people are waiting too long for social and private housing.  It is a crisis that has been compounded by Covid, meaning that for the moment construction has slowed down considerably.  There is a big budget this year for housing.  We will be responsive to what the Deputy has just said regarding the capacity of the council to do more than the targets.  It is a target at the moment; the council allocation is not a capped at 255.  Last year the Minister cut through a significant amount of red tape by introducing a single-stage process with up to &euro;6 million which will help accelerate delivery.  It means that the local authority can devise projects up to that scale without needing to get sanction from the Department at every stage.</p>  <p>  Kerry County Council may have more capacity in terms of voids.  Last year the Minister allocated &euro;56.4 million to bring 3,607 vacant homes back into productive use across the country within the social housing stock.  That was the highest ever yearly spend on voids and the highest number of homes to be refurbished under the voids programme.  It was done under the July stimulus programme.  Kerry County Council got approximately &euro;991,000 under that voids programme.  That enabled the refurbishment of about 50 extra social housing units for the purpose of re-letting them out to individuals and families on the list.  We expect similar measures this year on voids across the country, including in Kerry.  Again, the Deputy could alert his local authority to that allocation.  We need to make up lost ground now because of Covid-19 which was unavoidable.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate the prioritisation the Deputy is giving to this issue.  We are open to any innovative schemes.  For example, I note that in some instances, houses are falling by the wayside for various reasons.  I do not understand why we cannot sometimes intervene to acquire a house and refurbish it.  It might have been idle for a year or two and getting into disrepair.  We have all passed them on boreens and roads throughout the countryside and they would make fine homes for people.  We are very much open to respond to initiatives from the local authority.</p></speech>

It certainly will be relayed to the management of Kerry County Council.  When we are talking about statistics, I like to humanise them.  We have 770 males and 422 females.  We have 336 females with a dependant and 98 males with a dependant.  We have 165 couples.  We have 298 couples with dependants or two or more adults with or without dependants.  These are all people who need housing and that is why it is right for us to raise the issue here today and to talk about it.</p>  <p>  I use the opportunity to thank several people who go above and beyond the call of duty every day in our local authority.  I refer to the people who work in our housing department, including the clerk of works who oversees projects on the ground, the engineers working in the housing department, and the ladies and men who deal with the processing of housing applications, disabled persons grants, essential repair grants and mobility aids grants.  They know every day when they answer the phone, they are dealing with a human being who needs help.  I thank the workers in the housing department in Kerry County Council.  I also compliment the private contractors, their foremen, workers, subcontractors and tradesmen who work to very high standards and whose work also deserves to be recognised.</p></speech>

Yesterday I met representatives from the industry to discuss the degree to which they have developed innovative approaches to safety in the workplace, particularly during the Covid pandemic.  The return-to-work protocol became the benchmark for other sectors.  The unions were particularly proactive in that regard and made a very positive contribution to that forum under the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, process which is a very good example of partnership.</p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about the need for one-bedroom and two-bedroom units.  At the moment we are making some progress in taking families out of homelessness, but overall the majority of those who are homeless are single people.  We need to accelerate very significantly the number of one-bedroom and two-bedroom units across the country.  That would help many single people or people with smaller households to secure housing.  There is a need for much more of that type of provision to deal with homelessness in an effective and critical-mass way and also then to deal with the wider issue of the social housing list.</p></speech>

Baineann mo cheist le taifead na fianaise at&aacute; scriosta.</p>  <p>  Just over a month ago the Taoiseach took a very positive step by apologising and for the first time taking a step away from the terrible disrespect, to put it mildly, that was shown to the mothers and children in the various mother and baby homes.  Trust is of utter importance and the Taoiseach's apology was the start of that.  Since then on every level that trust has been repeatedly broken, specifically regarding the evidence that was given on the audio tapes.  I raised this with the Taoiseach as have other Deputies.  I would like a very clear answer from the Taoiseach today as to why that evidence was destroyed.  Can it possibly be retrieved?  I ask the Taoiseach to publish all the correspondence between him or the Minister and the commissioners on this matter.</p> <p>Please do not tell me the commission is independent.  More than anyone else, I am acutely aware of the independence of the commission.  This has nothing to do with its independence.  It has to do with the way it works.</p> <p> Page 11 of the report states clearly that the commission destroyed the evidence and that this was always understood.  That may well be but based on what most Deputies have heard, none of those who came forward understood that.  Nowhere in any of the documentation that I carefully scrutinised before standing up here today is that made clear.  I tried to table questions on this through the system for ordinary D&aacute;il questions and they were ruled out of order.  I appeal to the Taoiseach today beart a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir a bhriathar and to take some meaningful action to give meaning to his apology.  I ask him, first, to tell us what exactly the commission has said in this regard; second, to publish all of the correspondence; and third, tell us how this could possibly have happened.  People came forward to give evidence, took their courage in their hands, believed in the system once again, or tried to believe in it, and are left now in a situation where there is no recording of their evidence.  That was done on the basis that the commissioners knew best and were trying to protect them, with no evidence that this was communicated to them in any manner other than the commission's word.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the commission says it guaranteed anonymity at the time and that, as part of that, it decided to destroy the records.  The commissioners are saying that they made that clear to the survivors.  However, I spoke to the Minister this morning and we noted that in the leaflets that were issued to the survivors there is no reference to the destruction of tapes at all or that tapes would be destroyed.  The Minister has written to the commission asking if it is in a position to retrieve the tapes or if there is some technological way of doing so.  He has not, to my knowledge, gotten a response yet.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the commission is engaging with the Data Protection Commission on this issue and parallel to this, the Minister is very anxious to be in a position to get the archives from the commission in order that he can accelerate access to personal information.  People may request their own personal information or the rectification of records and the Minister is anxious to facilitate that as quickly as we possibly can.  That is something that is part of this process as well.  The Minister was eager, prior to this emerging as an issue, for the archives to move over to him in order that he could give people access to valuable personal information, which is a very basic and urgent request, and for the right to rectification under Article 16 of GDPR to be vindicated and facilitated as well.  He is awaiting a response to that correspondence and I will speak to him about his capacity to publish it.  That is essentially what he has written to the commission about these tapes.  Meanwhile, he is working towards the legislation on information and tracing, which will be ready by the end of March or early April and the interdepartmental group will report on redress by the end of April.</p></speech>

A commission has destroyed evidence and yesterday the Minister told the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration that the commission has said there is no way of retrieving it.  Did he not make the Taoiseach aware of that letter?  Second, I am asking that all of the correspondence be published.  Third, we have again an imbalance of power.  We have the powerful telling the powerless what they think is in their interest and that they should be protected by getting rid of the tapes.  I see no basis for getting rid of the tapes.  In fact, all the tapes from a previous commission on child abuse were preserved.  At this point, there is absolute urgency.  As the Taoiseach knows well, the commission comes to an end at the end of the month.  We want clear answers.  I ask him please to stop giving me filling in pieces and specifically to tell me if the correspondence will be published and what action he will now take in view of the fact that the evidence cannot be retrieved.  People went forward, took courage in their hands and gave their evidence and now we have a summarised version of that evidence by commissioners who see nothing wrong with that.  The report was leaked and the Taoiseach promised an investigation into that but we did not get that either.  I am conscious of time but this is a really serious issue.  I ask the Taoiseach please to give straight answers and to stop telling me about anything else.  This is one specific issue.  How did this happen?  On what basis did it happen?  Did the commissioners look at precedents from previous commissions where the evidence was preserved?  I ask him please to publish the correspondence.</p></speech>

The commission decided to do this and I do not know why it did so.  It is making assertions that it did this on the basis that it guaranteed anonymity to those who came forward.  No member of Government was involved obviously in the commission's work, as the Deputy knows.  That is important, because the impression is being given that the Government could do something now about how the commission operated; it cannot.  What the Minister has done is written to the commission.  The commission is saying it is irretrievable but the Minister is still pursuing it from a technological perspective to see if it can be retrieved in some form.</p>  <p>  The decision was taken by the commission in advance of the publication and so on.  I will be very clear.  The Minister has written.  Unfortunately, there are limitations to what the Government can do here and the Deputy knows that.  The Government is very focused on what it has committed to doing as regards access to information, information and tracing legislation, reporting on the redress situation by the end of April and other matters.  The Minister is also engaging with the Attorney General right now to see what further measures can be taken and to see if he can indeed effect the retrieval of these tapes or a reconsideration of this matter by the commission.</p></speech>

This is now the sixth week where the D&aacute;il is sitting for half its usual hours.  Normally the D&aacute;il sits 33 or 34 hours a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and we are sitting for half that time.  That means we have no Taoiseach's questions, no Ministers' questions and instead of three Private Members' slots for dealing with legislation we have one.  Topical issues, Questions on Promised Legislation and Leaders' Questions have been reduced.  This is intolerable for the Opposition and intolerable that this continues.  To add insult to injury, for the second time in three weeks we have no opportunity for statements and questions to the Minister for Health on the public health response and the vaccine roll-out, which is the very reason we are reduced to half our normal time.  It is intolerable and this has to change.  The Government will produce a schedule to the Business Committee tomorrow.  According to the report of the Business Committee, the Opposition has registered its dissent for the third week in a row.</p> <p>The Government is not listening to the Opposition.  It is preventing the Opposition from doing its job in this democracy, which is to introduce legislation and hold Government to account.  That has to stop this week.</p></speech>

It is outrageous.</p>  <p>  I want to mention a specific item on today's order, namely, the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  We will discuss the substance of that Bill later, which I believe is a heist of the public land banks in the interests of private developers.  This Bill, which by any standards is probably one of the most important Bills that will come before this House in the foreseeable future, did not go through pre-legislative scrutiny and no waiver was sought from the Business Committee for a Bill that deals with the entire public land bank.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

We do not vote against the Order of Business every week.  We make our decisions week by week, but we feel that balance is not being struck and we ask that that be taken back to the Business Committee on Thursday.</p></speech>

It is clear the D&aacute;il is being used to stifle the Government's response and to make sure it is kept clear of any negative publicity in regard to what is happening.  There are genuine and legitimate questions that need to be asked and answered in regard to the Government's handling of the Covid crisis.  At the very least, we should be moving to a third sitting day for six or more hours.</p></speech>

We should be sitting three days a week to do that.  It is a bad look for the Government not to be allowing that level of scrutiny.  This is happening in a week where the Government has turned away journalists from press conferences and sought to change the ESRI's critique of its housing policy.  In the interests of proper accountability and scrutiny, the Government should respond and have a proper amount of time set aside for scrutiny and debate this week and in future weeks.</p></speech>

They are more important now in this crisis than they ever were.  Ministers are being insulated from accountability within this Chamber due to the lack of opportunity available to the Opposition to debate the crisis in areas such as nursing homes, vaccines roll-out, education and housing.  I appeal to the Government to support a return to a three-day D&aacute;il week.</p></speech>

We know how challenging these times are, but the Government is hiding behind shorter sittings and not enough debate on issues such as the Land Development Agency Bill 2021, the management or mismanagement of the Covid situation, the manipulation of figures and the situation with our schools, hospitals and front-line workers.  It is not good enough.  Surely, given the size of the Convention Centre and the cost in terms of D&aacute;il sittings here, the D&aacute;il could sit for a third day for, say, six hours rather than a long day.  We understand the health and safety guidelines, but this is a huge space.  People are asking us why we cannot meet here for longer.  Other people do not have the luxury of moving to a facility like this.  We should show leadership and allow for proper scrutiny and debate and Taoiseach's questions and answers.</p></speech>

It is a matter for this House what business is transacted here each week, but to be fair and reasonable, the Business Committee, over an extended period of time, has tried to address the sittings of the D&aacute;il conscious of (1) the public health advice, (2) the advice of our own health and safety consultants, and (3) the submissions we have received from the union groups representing the staff who support us here at all times.  Members of the Business Committee will be aware that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il produced a comprehensive report some weeks ago setting out why the reduced sessions were felt to be necessary.  It is at the end of the day a matter for the House.</p></speech>

That is not the case.  Some of those Deputies would be very quick to attack Government for ignoring public health advice and health and safety guidelines.  My understanding is that the Business Committee, collectively and irrespective of party, has been advised on public health grounds that this is the optimal way to proceed.  Please contradict me if that is not the case.  Please correct me if that is not the case.</p></speech>

It is not only Members but the people behind the scenes who lead to a D&aacute;il sitting happening.  There are far more people involved than just the elected representatives.  The public health advice has guided the behaviour of the Parliament in this issue.  That should be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  Numbers are still high out there.  Society is in a very severe level of restrictions.  There are still in excess of 800 people in hospital and significant numbers in intensive care.  Case numbers are still too high and there is a variant.  According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control report issued on Monday, the potential for the disease to spread is high to very high.  That is the context in which we are all operating throughout society.</p>  <p>  There will be a Cabinet committee on Thursday on Covid-19 at which we will engage with NPHET and it will make a presentation.  I have spoken to the acting CMO.  Our immediate priority is a phased return for education, but it will be phased.  We are talking about very limited situations after that.  That is where we are right now in terms of the Covid plan.</p>  <p>  This week's schedule provides for three debates on Covid.  Every week, it has been dominated by Covid.  The T&aacute;naiste will be here tomorrow for a debate on trade, employment, business and Covid, in respect of which 135 minutes are provided.  Earlier, at 10 a.m. there will be statements and questions and answers on drug and alcohol services, homelessness and Covid-19, which do need to be articulated and debated, in particular homelessness and Covid-19 and how it is impacting on the homeless across the board.  Today, at 1 p.m. the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be here for a debate on the agriculture, food and the fisheries sector and Covid-19, in respect of which 135 minutes are provided.  The Government has approached Covid every week on a thematic basis.</p>  <p>  On the Land Development Agency legislation, I acknowledge there are a number of new heads and significant additions to the Bill.  We need to get on with the housing agenda.</p> <p>The Deputy has taken a rather propagandistic position on the Bill, and that is his entitlement, but the country is screaming for new houses to be built.</p></speech>

We said at the Business Committee that all we needed was approximately an extra six hours in the week to accommodate the health debate we are looking for on the Covid-19 crisis, questions to An Taoiseach, Private Members' business and so on.  The Taoiseach refuses point blank to make any concessions because he does not want to be questioned.  He wants to shield himself.  That is the truth of it.

Will the Taoiseach acknowledge the real distress this dithering and indecision has caused for leaving certificate students and their families?  Will he confirm that we will have an announcement today, that it will bring the kind of clarity leaving certificate students need and that it will afford them the level of choice required after two academic years marked by disruption?  Will the Taoiseach also confirm what the plans are for the junior certificate and whether students and children will be returning to schools on 1 March?  There has been speculation and rumour on this and I suspect a date has been thrown out without any real substantive planning or even public health advice, although I hope I am wrong.  I hope the Taoiseach will answer me on those three matters of the leaving certificate, the junior certificate and the return to school.</p></speech>

I said this week that we want to bring clarity for the leaving certificate cohort of 2021 and that is the priority.  I recall the Deputy and her spokesman on education calling for consultation with all the partners in education on related issues as far back as January.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  She talked of the Government dithering and so on.  The Government is engaged in substantiative discussions with all the partners in education: students, parents, teachers and the management bodies.  Covid-19 has upended all our lives, nowhere more so than with education.  It caused disruption last year to the ordinary process of education in schools.  We successfully got schools reopened from September to December.  We have delayed the reopening of schools because of Covid-19 and the variant.  We will be giving that consideration in terms of the phased return of schools.  I accept it is vital that clarity is brought to the situation but the Government has rightly engaged in consultation with all involved.  We do not blame any sector.  This is difficult for all concerned because of Covid-19.</p></speech>

Those were announced this week but unfortunately there will be no debate on it this week in the House.  Monday's announcement, which should have been a good news story, has actually turned into a bit of a mess.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will know that Drogheda, which is Ireland's largest town and has a hinterland population of 85,000 people, does not have and will not be getting a vaccination centre.  Is it a coincidence that County Wicklow, which has a similar population to County Louth, has two centres and County Louth has only one which is in Dundalk?  I therefore ask if the criteria are that a Minister must occupy a seat in the constituency.  Some centres which were announced do not actually have any contracts at this point.  This is not a way to do business and I hope the Taoiseach accepts that.  My party colleague Councillor Conor Sheehan in Limerick has said the centre serving Limerick-----</p></speech>

The Health Service Executive has facilitated this.  Different HSE regions have presumably sent in their submissions from different locations.  The bulk of people, by the way, will be vaccinated in their GPs' surgeries when we get to the mass vaccination stage.  Obviously the vaccination centres will augment and supplement that.  There is no necessity for this to be turned into a political football either, to be fair to all concerned.  Representations are being made by people in different locations.  I think they will be taken on board.  There has been no ministerial involvement, or indeed Government involvement, in the identification of vaccination centres.  There is no necessity for it.  I am serious.</p></speech>

Their families and loved ones are still waiting for answers and justice.  The delay to the Stardust inquest commencing, which is due to the Department of Justice not releasing funds, is absolutely reprehensible.  Releasing funding to allow the legal team of the families to carry out research in preparation is essential.  We should be following the good practice established at the Hillsborough inquest.  Too many parents and survivors have died already without receiving justice and answers for their loved ones.  The Minister for Justice needs to meet and engage with the legal representative of these families to resolve this without any further delay.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice to meet immediately with the legal representative of the families to resolve the issues with funding so the inquest can begin?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in saying that everything we can do must be done to bring closure, if at all possible, to the families of those who died horrifically in what was the worst and most horrific event in my living memory as far as the number of people who died is concerned.  I remember well it happening, as a young person, and the sense of horror that spread throughout the country and the search for justice, the truth and answers.  Funding has been made available.  My understanding is that it may be the precise nature of how that funding has been allocated or the basis on which it is being allocated to legal firms.  I will pursue this with the Minister for Justice and ask her to respond to the Deputy.</p></speech>

That is higher than any other section of the population with the exception of healthcare workers.  On health and safety grounds there is now a strong case that leaving certificate students should be the last students back into the classroom.  Despite this, there are diehard supporters of the traditional leaving certificate who want to force students back to school next week, and if not next week then the week after.  Why?  It is to fit in with an exam timetable: week one, back in school; week two, the mocks.  Health, including mental health, is more important than exams.  The exams should be cancelled, the certificate given to every student and a place at third level offered to every student who wants one.  Students can then be brought back when it is safe to do so.  Given the variant and the high number of cases among the student cohort aged 16 years and over, why would the Government even entertain the idea of a return to class for leaving certificate students in the next fortnight?</p></speech>

Some students would like the option of sitting the traditional leaving certificate or as close to it as possible.  The Deputy has his views on the best model of assessment in educational terms but an emergency like this should not be used just to throw out a particular model.  We believe choice should be given and that is the basis upon which the Minister has engaged with the unions.  The unions are very committed to the traditional format of the leaving certificate and it is a position they have asserted on a continuous basis.  The Government's view is also that students require choice here and parallel options similar to what was provided last year.  There is not a place in third level for everybody who wants one.  Deputy Barry has articulated a wonderful catchphrase.  It sounds great.  However, in reality it is not possible at all.</p> <p>We will provide additional places, as we did last year, to try to facilitate students who wish to progress to training, apprenticeships or other forms of further or higher education.</p></speech>

The PSNI descended on that gathering in an extremely heavy-handed manner.  Its officers came down on the families affected by and survivors of that loyalist atrocity like a ton of bricks.  One police officer has been suspended and another has been repositioned.  The Chief Constable of the PSNI has apologised.  It is just another example of heavy-handed and political policing by the PSNI.  Many nationalist communities in the North of Ireland have experienced such policing in recent times.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP have intermittently raised this issue but there has been no recent reform of the PSNI.  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about this issue?  Has he called for root-and-branch reform of the PSNI such that the police force is acceptable to both communities?</p></speech>

What happened on the Ormeau Road was wrong, but there are mechanisms in place to deal with that and to hold those responsible accountable.  There is the ombudsman for policing and the Policing Authority and we should use those mechanisms rather than immediately reaching for the line of undermining confidence in the new policing structures because that has consequences too in terms of going backwards in relation to policing.</p></speech>

His party is continuing to support the project.  The equipment in the hospital will be obsolete by the time it is finished.  We are now being told it will be ready in 2024.

The tourism sector is on its knees and the Shannon Heritage sites are shut.  Commercial property faces its own challenge.  The fiasco yesterday involving the appointment of a man with no ostensible experience in any of these areas really undermines any claim the Government has of commitment to Shannon or the wider region.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700031#DD03300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide that regard be had by public bodies to the desirability of reducing socio-economic and other inequalities suffered by those in rural Ireland, to provide for the carrying out of rural impact assessments in respect of measures that are likely to have a significant socio-economic impact or effect on rural Ireland and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I am delighted to introduce this Bill as a Member who is lucky enough to live in rural County Roscommon and to represent rural towns and villages right across counties Roscommon and Galway.  The Bill is especially timely as, certainly for the first time in my lifetime, we are seeing a move from urban to rural.  People are leaving cities and moving to rural areas.  With that, we need to ensure that investment and services are put in place to support those people moving into rural areas and to sustain those communities.  We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity post Covid to get this right and that means a united approach with all key stakeholders on board to make this happen.  The Bill is about fair play and equality for rural areas.  It would ensure that all public bodies, including every Department, have due regard for rural areas by obliging them to detail and produce rural impact assessments on their measures and actions.</p><p>No Member of this House can deny that rural Ireland has been disadvantaged for many decades.  Many towns and villages never recovered from the 2008 crash.  Services were taken away, businesses were closed, jobs were lost and never replaced and towns became derelict.  The consequences of this neglect were highlighted by the EU Commission when it downgraded the west and north-west region from a developed region to a region in transition because, when it comes to investment in education, jobs and infrastructure, the region is at the bottom of the table.  That is not good enough.  It is not something that has happened by accident.  The region is in decline and that decline is set to worsen.  However, there has never been a better opportunity to address it.  Co-financing now available from Europe means that the EU will contribute &euro;60 for every &euro;100 we can pump into the west and north-west region.  I ask for support from all parties.  This is an opportunity for us all to show support for rural towns and villages.  The Bill is just one step along the way.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a similar Bill in the previous D&aacute;il but it was voted down by the two main parties - Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  As my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, stated, this is an opportunity to recognise that rural Ireland is developing and changing.  That is not happening because of Government policy.  Rather, it is happening in spite of it.  We need a co-ordinated approach to ensure we get a level of investment in place across rural Ireland such that it can be made sustainable for people to live and prosper there.  In the context of every aspect of Government policy, the agents of Government and the measures they put in place, we need a measure of the impact they will have on rural Ireland and those living in rural areas.</p>  <p>   School buses are a prime example in this regard.  Children who live in rural Ireland cannot get the same access to transport to go to school, which is the most basic need and right they have as citizens.  I recently dealt with a situation involving people who were looking for health services in rural Ireland.  A woman who had moved to Dublin six months beforehand told me how her son had looked for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  She said that if her child had got sick while she was living in County Leitrim, she would not have been able to get services for him.</p> <p>That is one of the issues we have across all parts of rural Ireland.  We do not have the services in place to the same level.  It is a mishmash of services and investment.  Investment is key to keeping our regions going and to getting people back living in rural Ireland.  I implore the Government to support this Bill and the principle of ensuring that everything is measured and rural Ireland gets a fair crack of the whip.</p></speech>

Rural Ireland is largely seen as an afterthought when it comes to investment but it is first in line when it comes to the withdrawal of services.  People in my constituency are sick and tired of being left without and told it is in their own interests.  The communities of Carrick-on-Suir and Roscrea in Tipperary have been told that long-stay convalescent beds are being torn away from their communities and their loved ones are to be looked after further from those localities at a time when the ability to travel around our county is virtually non-existent.  Those people are left without care in their communities or the available public transport to deal with the relocation of services.  This has happened at the same time as the X12 Expressway service has been discontinued.  A three-month guarantee is in place for the X8 Expressway route.  It is also the case that train timetables are not designed for the needs of towns in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our young people are also left isolated and for years have been denied the services they need to get on with their lives.  An example of that is the fact that Jigsaw has again been delayed in Tipperary.  Despite our continued appeals, all citizens in every community in rural Ireland have been continually ignored.</p>  <p>  I again thank Deputy Kerrane for introducing this Bill which seeks to address the unequal treatment of rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland must no longer be left behind and we ask the House to support the Bill.</p></speech>

It also provides that the Bill comes into operation six months after its passing.  Section 2 is an interpretation section and defines terms used in the Bill.</p><p>Section 3 sets out the social welfare principles as follows.  The social welfare system contributes to realising economic, social and cultural rights that are indispensable for personal dignity and the free development of human personality.  The social welfare system progressively achieves the commitments made in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 45 of the Constitution.  Social welfare is an investment in the people and is accordingly for the public good and general benefit.  The delivery of social welfare is a public service.  Respect for the dignity of persons should be at the heart of the social welfare system.  The social welfare system should contribute to reducing poverty.  It should be designed on the basis of evidence and should be progressively improved in ways that put the need of those who require assistance first and should advance equality and non-discrimination.  The social welfare system should be efficient and should deliver value for money.</p><p>This section provides that all those concerned with the interpretation or administration of the Acts, or performing functions under them, must have regard to the social welfare principles.  In addition, a court or tribunal in civil or criminal proceedings may take the social welfare principles into account when determining any question to which the principles are relevant.  However, nothing in this section of itself gives rise to a cause of action in respect of anything done in the administration of the Acts or the performance of functions under them.</p><p>Section 4 provides that a social welfare charter is to be prepared, published and, from time to time, reviewed.  The charter must set out what is to be expected from the Government and the Minister when developing social welfare policy; from the Minister, his or her officers and others when administering the Acts or performing functions under them; and from persons who apply for and receive assistance through the social welfare system.  The charter must reflect the social welfare principles as spelt out in the Bill and the Minister must prepare the charter within six months of this Bill coming into operation.  In preparing the charter, the Minister must consult the board and the persons who receive assistance through the social welfare system or their representative bodies, together with such other persons or bodies as he or she considers appropriate.  The Minister must lay a draft of the charter before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their prior approval and must make the charter publicly available by appropriate means.</p><p>Section 5 requires the Minister to review the charter within five years of its being made, and every five years thereafter, involving the same consultation process.  Following that review, the Minister must decide whether or not to make any changes to the charter and must lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out the consultation undertaken in carrying out the review, the reasons for the Minister's decision to make changes or not to make changes and, if the Minister has decided to make changes, a draft of the charter showing the changes he or she intends to make.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700032#EE01800"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to allow adopted persons the right to access their birth records. </blockquote>  <p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the Civil Registration (Right of Adoptees to Information) (Amendment) Bill 2021.  Its simple objective is to give every adoptee the right to unfettered access to their birth certificates.  This crucial amendment will seek to give adoptees access to their publicly-registered birth certificates and the reality is that all births have been publicly registered since the mid-1800s so there should be no more secrecy.</p><p>I was thinking about my own birth certificate as I brought forward this legislation.  All of us who are engaged in public life are used to dealing with constituents and we regularly tell them that they might need a copy of their birth certificates for this or that.  It is something that many of us, including me, take for granted and yet there are many people living throughout the island who do not have access to this basic human right.</p><p>The birth certificate is the first official document that we all receive and it authenticates who we are as citizens.  It is a human right for all of us to possess the document.  Accessing the document is as simple as contacting the births, deaths and marriages office in one's county.  However, this human right is not a right we afford all our citizens.  The small but important legislative measure I am introducing today will have an immediate impact for all adoptees and it is crucial that we bear in mind that not only is the right to identity a fundamental right under EU law and the Irish Constitution, but also in cases of unlawful family separation, the human rights violation continues until information is provided to restore a person's family and personal identity.  I strongly believe that it is false for the State to continue to argue that natural mothers generally do not wish their adult children to know their own identity and the notion that adopted people may cause harm in some way.  There simply is not any proof that is the case.  The reality so evident in the stories that have emerged since the publishing of the mother and baby home report clearly shows that mothers were often forced to sign the apposite declaration that they would never seek out their children.  It is important to stress that many people were given no other option or choice.  It is a fact that adoptions in Ireland during the 20th century were, by and large, forced and, in many cases, illegal.</p> <p>This must motivate us to do everything we can to rectify matters for adoptees.  In recent weeks, the outpouring of grief and distress from survivors of mother and baby institutions has been palpable.  They have barely shone a light on the cruel and inhumane treatment they suffered at the hands of church and State.  I would hazard a guess that there is no doubt in anyone's mind, except the commission's authors, that the State supported an inhumane regime of forced, illegal adoptions.  The cold, hard facts show that the State allowed children to be taken from their mothers and sent away.  This was the last time in some cases that either mother or child ever saw each other.  While it is true that some people went on to live prosperous lives in new countries with new families, and some went on to have families of their own and had careers and went to university, others did not.  It is important that we remember that as well today.  For many, it has been extremely difficult.  Many survivors have battled with the fall-out of inadequate State supports and suffer to this day.</p> <p> Despite their different fortunes, they all share one commonality; the desire to have unfettered access to their birth certificate.  Time and time again I have listened to survivors recount the impact searching for their information has had on them, even into adulthood.  So many of them have been given false information.  They were lied to, sent in the completely wrong direction and been made to feel like criminals.  The need for this legislation has never been so essential.  We cannot continue to keep apologising to women and children who found themselves in these horrible institutions without taking action.  We cannot continue to condone the impact of the coercive, closed and secret adoption system that was enabled and continues to be enabled by the State.  We must respect the human rights of individuals to manage their own identity and family relationships without further State interference.  My Bill seeks to address this great injustice.  I have continued the call for survivors to be at the centre of all that we do in this regard.  The legislation is survivor-led.  I appeal to all Deputies please to support the Bill, which is very simple and straightforward and gives every adopted person the legal right to their birth certificate.</p></speech>

From our large towns and cities to the most remote parts of rural Ireland, the effects of this deadly disease visited many families and communities.  The agrifood sector played a crucial role in keeping supply chains working, keeping the nation fed and driving food exports to ensure a balanced economy.  The sector is the largest indigenous export sector and drove exports of some &euro;13.2 billion in 2020 despite all the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.</p>  <p>  The delivery of essential services to farmers, fishers and the food and forestry sectors was prioritised by the Department and its agencies throughout the course of the pandemic.  The necessary steps have been taken to ensure that producers and processors can continue to operate effectively and keep supply lines open and that the Department and agencies can operate as effectively as possible.  A committee which I chair, and which includes senior leadership from the agrifood State agencies, which meets to monitor progress on the implementation of strategy, met five times in 2020 and Covid has been a standing item on the agenda.  The cross-Government response, the continuity of services to the sector, specific supports and the potential long-term impacts for the sector are discussed.  While the challenges have been great, I am proud of the efforts of everyone in the sector to keep the supply chains moving throughout.  We saw the rush for food at the start of the pandemic but the supply chain from farmers and fishers through to processors and on to the shelves remained intact.</p>  <p>  Irish food supply chains have continued to operate effectively to ensure continuity and security of supply of safe, healthy food for consumers at home and abroad.  In the context of the pandemic, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health and the HSE.  In ongoing engagement with the food industry since my appointment as Minister, I have emphasised that the health and safety of workers must be the absolute priority.  My Department is supporting the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant guidance in Department-approved food plants, including the specific HSE guidance for meat plants.  My Department also supports the HSE in the context of local outbreak teams, and the standing committee which oversees a programme of serial testing of workers at larger food plants and in other businesses.  The first cycle of serial testing at food production facilities started on 14 September 2020.  A further four cycles were subsequently completed, and a sixth cycle is currently in progress.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide any assistance requested by the HSE to facilitate this testing programme.  My Department is also collaborating with other State agencies, university-based researchers and meat plant operators in further studies of risk factors and enhanced measures for risk mitigation for Covid-19 in meat processing plants.  At a practical level, and on an ongoing basis, the industry is working to ensure that all the basic measures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus are being implemented correctly.  They include, for example, ensuring that workers are reminded on a daily basis of the public health guidance, in a range of languages, screening questions and temperature check on entry every day, social distancing in canteens and locker rooms and adequate PPE for all workers.  There is no room for complacency on the threat posed by Covid-19.  In the context of the virus it is vitally important that all our decisions and actions are led by public health advice.</p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of the country, especially in rural and coastal areas.  The Department is working with all the agrifood stakeholders to ensure that the sector, as our largest indigenous industry, is supported during these difficult times.  A number of supports were introduced in the past year including a scheme of aids to private storage under the CAP for certain dairy products, following a campaign by member states, spearheaded by Ireland.  I secured an 11% increase in the Department's budget in October for the current year, which I am aiming primarily at supporting farm families in the coming months.  Specifically, &euro;50 million was provided for a support scheme for beef finishers who were severely impacted by the economic effects of Covid.  I also brought forward balancing payments under the basic payment scheme, BPS, GLAS and the organic scheme and various practical flexibilities for applications for the main farm schemes.</p>  <p>  On the fisheries side, the Covid-19 voluntary temporary fleet tie-up scheme for fishing vessels was introduced under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20.  A support scheme for rope mussel and oyster farmers was also introduced under the same programme, which was co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Union.  Many of the horizontal supports available to individuals and businesses are also available to the agrifood sector, including the Covid-19 working capital loan scheme and the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, CGS, both of which are supported by the Department.  The Department and its agencies, in consultation with stakeholders, will continue to monitor the impacts of the pandemic on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves and to provide appropriate supports.</p>  <p>  Concern early in the pandemic that Covid-19 lockdown measures would lead to a significant reduction in food demand throughout 2020, thankfully, did not materialise.  Due to the pandemic, food consumption outside the home fell substantially, but this was somewhat although not entirely offset by increased consumption at home.  However, the lockdown measures did impact directly on primary producers in a variety of ways, from restrictions on marts and garden centres through to the sudden collapse of food service demand across Europe.  Teagasc has forecast that family farm incomes will actually be up across most farm systems in 2020, with the average farm income projected to be up by 6% on the previous year.  A key driver of this increase has been a reduction in animal feed, fertiliser and fuel prices, along with additional subsidy supports for beef finishers to alleviate the negative effects of Covid on the beef market.  However, I am aware that these reductions relate to last year and that there are concerns about increasing input costs in the current year.</p> <p>The CSO's first estimate of agricultural operating surplus for 2020 released last December is an expected annual increase of 14% to &euro;3.484 billion.</p> <p> It is worth noting that the agrifood sector is labour-intensive.  Producing, processing and distributing food requires the work and expertise of many different employees in various roles.  From the farmers who calve the cows, lamb the ewes and tend to the crops to the food processors, it takes a significant effort to produce the world class food which we are renowned for and enjoy.  The overall agrifood supply chain has proven remarkably resilient throughout the pandemic.  There have been some issues in meeting the seasonal demand for labour, for example in the horticulture sector, which relies on experienced seasonal workers, many who travel annually from eastern European countries.  I expect that because of travel restrictions this year, seasonal labour shortages may arise again.  Last year, the horticulture sector collaborated with my Department and the Department of Social Protection in a campaign to recruit unemployed people here in Ireland to fill some of these vacancies.  I hope that similar initiatives this year can be successful.</p> <p> Our seafood sector was heavily impacted by Covid-19 over the past year.  The pandemic affected the performance of all species with seafood exports declining by 10% in 2020.  This impacted individual fishers through low market prices for their catch or indeed no market at particular times.  For aquaculture producers, it mostly impacted the shellfish sector which suffered a 29% reduction in export values.  This sector is heavily dependent on the food service market and thus was particularly affected by lockdowns across Europe.  As outlined earlier a range of horizontal supports provided by Government have remained open to seafood enterprises throughout the pandemic.  Where specific financial supports were sought by industry representatives, proposals have been given careful consideration and support schemes made available.</p> <p> I will address alcohol and prepared consumer foods.  The Irish drinks sector has been especially impacted by the closure of hospitality and tourism across the world.  The prepared consumer food sector, meanwhile, has shown remarkable resilience at a time of severe disruption to its markets, for example in reorienting products aimed at food service for the retail market.</p> <p> After a period of cessation in the horse and greyhound industries, thoroughbred racing was permitted to resume behind closed doors on 8 June.  According to Horse Racing Ireland, continuing racing has been crucial to ensuring that trade in bloodstock has been able to continue.  That notwithstanding, bloodstock sales in the year were down 35% compared to 2019.  Point to point racing was also discontinued and the economic impact of the cessation will continue to be actively monitored.  The pandemic has compounded an already difficult time for the greyhound industry, with falling attendance and revenue already an issue.</p> <p> I commend everyone involved in the agrifood sector, including farmers and fishers, those who work in the food industry and those in logistics and retail, and thank them all for their efforts over the past year.  Their Trojan efforts ensured that our reputation as a leading exporter of food was maintained despite all our challenges.  I look forward to working closely with the entire sector during the year to come, when we are hopeful of a return to a more normal operating environment, as we look to the further sustainable development of our sector.</p> <p> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Heydon, will outline how the sector fared in international trade and some of the work we are undertaking to ensure our produce can continue to reach all corners of the globe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700034#GG00200"><p>As we are all too aware, 2020 was an especially challenging year.  While we had the expected uncertainty of Brexit, it was overshadowed by the unexpected Covid-19 pandemic.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has referred to the sector demonstrating its resilience, which has been remarkable.  The pandemic placed unprecedented stresses on food supply chains, with bottlenecks in farm labour, processing, transport and logistics, as well as momentous shifts in demand that could not have been predicted prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Many of these disruptions were a result of policies adopted to contain the spread of the virus, such as curtailments on the movement of people and social distancing.  However, food supply chains performed exceptionally well in the face of these stresses.  Grocery stores' shelves were replenished over time as stockpiling behaviour disappeared and the supply chains responded to the increased demand.  During the pandemic, the food service industry across Europe and beyond experienced a nearly total collapse in demand due to the temporary shutdown of the hospitality sector, especially during the early part of the pandemic in the first lockdowns across Europe and the world.</p>  <p>  While food retail demand increased, it did not offset the decline in food services.  This demand imbalance had significant consequences for primary producers and agrifood businesses.</p>  <p>  Regarding the economic impact caused by Covid, while domestic production was significantly impacted, the demand abroad for Irish food and drink products was disrupted.  The OECD stated that enough food is available globally but Covid-19 is disrupting supply and demand in complex ways, manifesting across the food system as impacts on agricultural production and incomes, shifts in consumer demand and disruptions to food supply chains.  This resilience of Ireland's agrifood exports in 2020 is also remarkable.  Despite disruptions to supply and demand, agrifood exports in 2020 were &euro;14.1 billion, compared with &euro;14.5 billion the previous year, a 3% overall reduction.  This is an extraordinary achievement when considering the challenges that food and drink producers have faced since March 2020.</p>  <p>  The export figures for 2020 were released last Monday by the Central Statistics Office.  They show that dairy and beef contribute &euro;7.4 billion to our exports, which is over 52% of our total agrifood exports.  Exports of dairy products exceeded &euro;5 billion for the second year in a row, with exports to more than 130 countries around the globe.  Despite the difficult year, dairy exports grew slightly, by about 1%, in 2020.  Beef, our second largest export category, was worth more than &euro;2.3 billion, down by 2% from 2019.  This was a particularly good result, considering that the food service sector was closed in many of our export markets for most of 2020.  Pigmeat, sheepmeat and poultry also contributed strongly to our exports, with &euro;1.5 billion of these meats exported in 2020, similar to 2019.</p>  <p>  With the closure of the hospitality sector across the globe, the beverage industry, especially Irish whiskeys and liquers, was impacted significantly, with total beverage exports down by about 15%, at &euro;1.5 billion.  Prior to the pandemic, Irish whiskeys and liquers had seen strong growth, especially in the US market.</p>  <p>  Fish exports were hit hard by the closure of the food service industry.  This had a substantial impact on the demand for species such as lobster, crab, prawns and oysters.  Transport issues also impacted on fish exports.  These factors resulted in live exports being down by 10% in 2020, to &euro;521 million.</p>  <p>  Live exports of animals were down by 25% compared with 2019.  The reduction in exports was due to a number of factors.  The peak time for exporting calves coincided with the start of the pandemic, resulting in much smaller numbers of calves being exported to continental Europe.  Pig exports to Northern Ireland were down by about 80% and the export of purebred breeding horses around the world was down by about 20%, a significant impact on the thoroughbred breeding sector.  Overall live animal exports were down from &euro;455 million in 2019 to &euro;340 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  The effects of the pandemic can be seen when examining the destinations of agrifood exports in 2020 with exports declining by 10% or more to those countries which suffered the most due to the pandemic, such as the USA, France, Italy, Belgium and Spain.  Exports to the UK accounted for 37% of total exports, down from 45% in 2010.  While exports to countries outside the UK and EU accounted for 31%, up from 22% in 2010.  These figures underline the dividend of a decade-long diversification strategy that has seen Ireland achieve a broad global base for its food and drink exports, which now reach in excess of 180 countries.  Exports to countries such as the USA, China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have doubled in value over the past decade, with significant increases in the value of exports to Africa and the Middle East in more recent years as new international markets come to the fore.</p>  <p>  The focus on securing new markets for Irish food while maintaining and enhancing existing markets is consistent with the overarching strategy for the agrifood sector jointly developed by my Department and sectoral stakeholders in Food Wise 2025.  In responding to the UK's Brexit vote in June 2016, there has been intensification of market access activity by the Department and its agencies.  This level of activity will continue as we work to ensure the development of Ireland's agrifood industry.  In December, I, as Minister of State with responsibility for new market development, engaged in a series of market development and promotional events in key international markets in collaboration with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, Bord Bia and the Irish embassy network.</p> <p>These were dairy-focused virtual events covering five key countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.  Bord Bia's research has identified these countries as having strong potential for growth in the export of Irish agrifood products.  Virtual meetings were also held with key customers in China, Japan, the USA and the United Arab Emirates.  I was very pleased to see that, in each of our meetings, the participation of both my Department's agricultural attach&eacute;s and Bord Bia's local teams was very professional.  Since my appointment as a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have become aware of how proud we can be of the Irish officials placed all around the world who wear the green jersey and fly the Irish flag and who do a fantastic job.  They are really talented people who put Ireland's case forward and open many doors for the Irish agrifood industry and its products.</p> <p> These virtual events also remind our key customers that Ireland remains committed to them and is able to supply foods in which their own customers can have confidence.  My Government's particular focus in 2021 will be on supporting our primary producers and agrifood and drink manufacturers as they trade through continued uncertainty to support jobs in communities throughout Ireland.  Also in 2021, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I will be working closely with Bord Bia on a series of market development and promotional events and ministerial-led trade missions to key international and European markets to further increase the footprint of Irish food and drink exports.  </p> <p> A further aspect of the food system that has changed due to the pandemic is consumer behaviour.  There have been dietary shifts, an increase in home cooking and a heightened awareness of food safety and food security.  With billions of people in lockdown, new behaviours have been forced upon consumers and there are real opportunities for food businesses here as a result.  Understanding consumer behaviour is a critical part of enabling businesses to plan ahead appropriately and to move forward with confidence post Covid-19.  It will be important to understand what behaviours are likely to stick and to emerge post crisis.</p> <p> I pay tribute to our farmers, fishers and food and drink producers for their heroic efforts throughout 2020 while dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic.  They faced many challenges on domestic and international fronts arising from the economic impacts of the pandemic, closures of food services and changes in consumer behaviour.  They rose to that challenge and I pay tribute to them for that effort.  We all look forward together to brighter days ahead.</p></speech>

Beidh deich mbomaite agam agus c&uacute;ig bhomaite ag an Teachta Mac Lochlainn.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss issues related to agriculture, particularly as they pertain to the many family farmers across the country who are incredibly fearful for what the future may hold and who are still wondering what the full outworking of the twin challenges of Covid and Brexit will be.</p>  <p>  Many people, even beyond the farming community, have looked on aghast at how our meat factories have dealt with the threat of Covid-19.  Were it not so serious I would have chuckled to myself when the Minister said there was no room for complacency with regard to addressing the issues pertaining to the processing sector.  I contend that complacency has been the hallmark of our approach to the very real concerns with regard not only to how workers are treated and the conditions in which they operate, but also the wider impact.  We know, because we have evidence and have seen it at first hand, that when outbreaks occur in meat processing factories, they have very serious repercussions for the wider community if they are not tackled and addressed very early.  It is particularly important, as we once again see the numbers in respect of community transmission finally reducing, that we do not repeat what has happened at least twice, which is that we have allowed the good work of citizens to be undermined by allowing outbreaks and clusters in meat factories to get out of control.  Why is there not an easily accessible resource to allow people to see where outbreaks are occurring and how they are being tackled?  Communities are relying on media reports to find out whether their meat factory has had an outbreak.  </p>  <p>  The Minister has mentioned serial testing.  He talked about six rounds of serial testing.  Any of the clusters reported publicly, and we can only rely on those public reports, have shown that, when serial testing has identified cases, it has identified them in significant numbers.  This shows that the serial testing in place is not working and that there is too much of a lag between one set of tests and the next.  Why are meat factories not asked to carry out regular serial testing of workers as they enter the plants to allow individual cases to be traced and isolated?  If this were done, everybody would win.  The factories could continue their work without fear of outbreaks.</p>  <p>  Last July, the national outbreak control team recommended that sampling be carried out at the locations of future outbreaks.  In six months, the Minister's Department has managed to carry out a single pilot study.  The Minister is now refusing to release that study.  He cites commercial sensitivity although we know the report has been shared with other meat factories.  This is precisely the type of action that raises concerns.  The national outbreak control team also recommended that legislation be enacted to allow Government to shut down meat processing factories.  That public health advice has been disregarded.</p>  <p>  Since the new year, there have been many new confirmed outbreaks at meat plants in several locations, which is again fuelling anxiety in local communities.  Despite this, the only new funding that will go directly into people's pockets that the Minister has announced since January was &euro;100 million in capital investment which will go directly to the meat processing plants.  Is the Minister putting any conditions on that funding with regard to how the meat factories treat their workers and the farmers who rely on them?</p>  <p>  The Brexit adjustment reserve was mentioned.  Many plaudits have been paid for the &euro;1 billion we may potentially secure.  Does the Minister have a figure for the amount of this &euro;1 billion that will go to Irish family farmers, considering that it was their stories and the threat Brexit presented to them specifically that strengthened Ireland's case in arguing for such a high level of funding?</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks, will the Minister be introducing new funding for those family farmers who need it most, as opposed to rebranded funding under the beef environmental efficiency programme sucklers, BEEP-S, scheme?  As I say, we have seen lots of rebranded funding but the only new funding for farmers is the beef finishers payment, which amounts to half what was given to the meat factories through the investment I mentioned.  Suckler farmers have not received any new funding stream.  Is the Minister planning to introduce any?</p>  <p>  I also have questions with regard to the need to regulate the meat industry.  The Minister knows my position, which is that we should have an independent beef regulator which would actually have teeth and which would be able to observe what is happening within the cartel which determines the prices factories pay.  Such a regulator would also be able to stop unfair practices, including nonsensical rules such as the four-movement or 30-month rules.  In response, the Minister has said that he will instead put forward a proposal for a national food ombudsman.  We do not yet know what teeth such an ombudsman would have.  If it is to be just another quango without specific powers to curtail the actions of the meat factories, it will count for nothing.</p>  <p>  Many who listened to the Minister when he was in opposition would have thought he felt strongly about the issue of Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  In January of last year, when speaking to the then Minister in the D&aacute;il he described the stalling of convergence as not acceptable.  He has since outlined that he will not proceed with convergence during the transition period.  That is extremely disappointing, particularly for farmers in his own county, the vast majority of whom would be better off with convergence.  There is an imbalance and unfairness at the heart of the CAP.  Most farmers are struggling to make ends meet yet a small number of corporate entities are drawing down very significant levels of funding.</p> <p>Is the Minister up to ensuring there is a front-loaded per hectare payment that would include specific supports like the suckler support scheme for which Sinn F&eacute;in advocates for those sectors that need it?  Most of all, is he committed to and will he accept an upper limit cap on the payments that any individuals or corporate entities can receive and is he up for the sort of CAP reform that will see a redistribution of payments to those farmers who need it most?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700036#JJ00200"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for his questions.  First, as to the situation of Covid-19 in the meat factories, this is something that the Government is taking very seriously and the meat factories have also responded very intensively to this issue.  As I said in my opening contribution, the welfare of employees and of people is the first priority in this pandemic across all sectors of society, and this is particularly the case in the agrifood sector, where workers and employees have been essential throughout that sector in keeping the food supply chain operating.  That has been especially challenging in the food processing sector and has required absolute attention as to protocols being put in place and followed to keep employees safe.  Part of that as well has been the adoption of serial testing in the food processing sector, which is one of the few sectors in which that has actually been happening.  There have been six rounds of such testing and there is a round under way.  We are working with public health and with the Health and Safety Authority to ensure that the highest of safety standards are applied, any breaches of which will be taken very seriously.  Anybody who comes across any such breaches should report these immediately.</p>  <p>  On funding for the agrifood sector overall, I point to the &euro;179 million additional funding that I secured in October in the 2021 budget.  That is an 11% increase on the previous year specifically dedicated towards supporting farm incomes, maintaining the schemes that were there, and delivering &euro;79 million in new funding for farmers for environmental measures and schemes.  Last night, at the Donegal IFA AGM, I announced the opening of the BEEP&ndash;S, the beef environmental efficiency pilot-suckler, scheme which will deliver &euro;40 million over the course of this year, up to &euro;90 per cow and calf pair, something which is going to be essential to the farming sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700036#JJ00400"><p>I raise two very important issues with the Minister under the fisheries heading.  First, as the Minister is aware, the tie-up scheme last year was seen right across the fishing sector as too little too late and there was a very low take-up.  The affected fishers right across the coast did not get the financial assistance they required.</p><p>The Minister introduced an aquaculture support scheme.  Will he revisit the whole issue this year, particularly in respect of the inshore fishermen, who have had a huge hit on the markets, as the Minister will know well from Donegal, and have been really struggling financially?  Outside of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, they have not received the support that they need.  Will the Minister revisit the financial supports for the inshore and the offshore fishing sectors and will he amend the Covid-19 aquaculture scheme?  I am aware that the Minister has been engaging with the IFA aquaculture section on this issue.  Will he amend and strengthen that scheme?  I am aware, for example, of fishers in Donegal who because they are only starting their sales in 2020 missed out on availing of that scheme.  This is a critical support and I ask that the Minister would revise that scheme in terms of the financial supports?</p><p>I also must raise with the Minister the reports carried in <i>The Irish Times</i>in recent days which are deeply worrying which refer to a very significant reduction in quota for our fishers by the European Commission.  Thousands of tonnes in quota loss have been mentioned and tens of millions of euros of EU funding may also be lost to the State.  The Minister will be aware that there is great alarm in our fishing sector at these reports.  I understand that the fishermen and the producers, especially in Killybegs, seriously dispute what is being reported.  They are deeply worried and there has been a significant hit on the quota.  The industry has asked the Minister to go back and to fight for additional quota and for burden-sharing and he has said that he will do that.  People are very suspicious as to why this reported additional huge cut to the quota is out now in the public domain.  Is there an attempt to silence the industry and to prevent fishermen from uniting together around our coasts to demand our fair share of the fish in our seas?</p><p>As to the issues in Killybegs, I am aware, and it seems very reasonable to me, that whenever a catch is weighed, the water would be deducted.  The water is essential for the sustenance of the fish to keep them fresh, to get them into the factories, and to be able to export them.  This is an industry that people have worked so hard to build.  My understanding is, and it is very reasonable, that there needs to be a removal of the water weight that is essential for the protection of the fish and to weigh it accurately.  They have devised a system there, which is of a National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, approved standard.  I am appealing to the Minister to intervene to ensure that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, reaches an agreement with the fishing industry there.</p><p>To summarise my question on this point, will the Minister appeal this decision, if it is a decision of the European Commission, to ensure there is no reduction in quota?  Will he defend the arguments the fishing community are making in Killybegs around this issue?  We cannot tolerate this as we need additional, not less, quota and I ask the Minister to intervene urgently.</p></speech>

This is particularly the case with the follow-through from Brexit with the potential for a tie-up scheme to try to support incomes in the short term and the time ahead.  I will also monitor the situation on our shellfish, our aquaculture and inshore sector.</p>  <p>  On the EU administrative inquiry findings, this dates back to an inquiry that was initiated in 2019 and the conclusion of that inquiry was communicated to me just before Christmas.  I have been assessing the findings of the EU Commission on that in advance of engaging with the Commission on its findings.  I am certain that this is something that we will be discussing further.</p></speech>

We are all receiving communications from the Beef Plan Movement where there is a clear ask for the appointment of an independent regulator.  It would be very useful for us if the Minister in his response could give us an up-to-date position as to where the task force is at present.</p>  <p>  On the status of horticulture, Bord na M&oacute;na has made a decision on harvesting peat.  As we move down the levels of public health guidelines and garden centres reopen and people begin to purchase compost again, will there be an adequate supply of compost and will we be faced with shortages?  Will we be importing compost as a consequence of decisions not to harvest peat, as articulated by Bord na M&oacute;na?</p> <p>I ask the Minister for his perspective on where stands that status at the moment.  We all agree that action on climate change is necessary.  If it means, though, that we are going to be importing things like coconut derivatives from third countries, then the question will be asked whether in real terms that is real action on climate change.  As people begin to visit their garden centres again, they will be wondering whether there will be an adequate supply of compost for the coming growing season.</p> <p> On the status of point-to-point racing, we know several meetings throughout the country have been cancelled.  I cannot figure out the logic of allowing racing to go ahead because of the importance of the racing and bloodstock industry, as the Minister said, but then disallowing point-to-point race meetings.  I would have thought that these two endeavours were complementary and dovetailed with each other.  If we can justify holding race meetings, then we can surely justify holding point-to-point meetings.  I am a Cork person and I live in Mallow.  There is a racecourse there and I recognise the importance of that aspect of the industry.  I would like also to speak, however, for the people who operate point-to-point racing.  Those meetings will begin to start from March.  They are not technically cancelled.  I am talking about places like Kildorrery, Dromahane and others which are vital to the local economy.  I would like an update on the status of those meetings.</p> <p> My last issue is one on which I do not necessarily expect the Minister to have a response.  A young woman is being detained by the Indian police.  Please forgive me if I mispronounce her name, but Disha Ravi is a young environmental activist protesting on behalf of Indian subsistence farmers.  We have a long history of protest regarding farming issues in this country.  It is inherent within the Irish polity and psyche to protest or advocate on behalf of farming interests or to do both.  I acknowledge Ms Ravi's activism and hope the Irish Government will, if possible, make its views known or register its disturbance at the fact that this young activist has been detained purely and only on the basis of her activism on behalf of environmental issues and to support subsistence farmers in India.  I put on the record of the House that Ms Ravi is an activist and that she is being detained.  I hope the Irish Government will record its protest with the Indian Government regarding this situation.</p></speech>

Turning to the beef task force first, it has carried out a good deal of work by bringing farm organisations and stakeholders together.  It has an important role to play in future as well and I will ensure it continues to work productively.</p>  <p>  Regarding the harvesting of peat, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has put together a committee to examine this matter.  I agree it would not make sense for us to be importing peat if such production were to stop domestically.  We must find a practical way of approaching this issue.</p>  <p>  On point-to-point racing, I have had many representations from Deputies and Senators on this issue, and I know the challenge the pandemic has posed for horses in training and for an industry which has great value economically.  It will be monitored and assessed in light of the public health advice.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's final point on the young Indian activist, I will certainly raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p></speech>

The past 12 months have seen unprecedented turbulence throughout the world due to the impact of Covid-19, while here we have also experienced Brexit and our nearest neighbour leaving the European Union.  In that regard, the people involved in the agrifood sector, the primary producers, the processors and all their employees have done excellent work over the past 11 to 12 months in ensuring there has been no shortage of supply and the supply chains have operated to a high standard during this unprecedented crisis.</p>  <p>  It is also heartening to note the latest Bord Bia report on export figures showed only a marginal decline of 2% in 2020.  Those figures demonstrate there has been huge growth since 2009 and an upward trajectory of growing exports in the agrifood sector.  Great credit is due to our primary producers, processors and all those involved in getting those products to so many markets.  We are all well aware that great research, product diversification and innovation over the years have enabled us to capture those markets.  I wish the Ministers well in their work in trying to ensure further diversification of markets.  It is interesting to note that approximately 30% of our exports go to the EU, 33% to Britain and 33% to other international markets.  It shows the diversity of the many markets we are sourcing for our products.</p>  <p>  One concern the farming community now has is the rising cost of things like fertiliser and diesel.  Farmers investing in their holdings to improve their farming infrastructure are concerned as well about the cost of timber and steel, which have risen and show no sign of stabilising.  Therefore, inn areas where there is investment under grant schemes, it may be necessary to revise the schedules of costings which have been approved in respect of farm work for grant purposes.</p>  <p>  There has also been a great expansion in the dairy sector since we succeeded in getting milk quotas removed.  The decision made to do that in November 2008, which came into effect on 1 April 2015, has been beneficial for this country in allowing us to expand our milk production greatly.  Concerns exist about beef prices, though, which unfortunately have fallen in recent times.  Going by last Friday's report, those prices have now stabilised.  It is still not adequate, however, and we need a much better return in that sector.  Thankfully, the global dairy markets are showing positive signs.  I think the last four or five auctions in New Zealand showed a continuous increase in prices.  We want that development reflected in returns to farmers as well.</p>  <p>  One of the major successes deriving from the Good Friday Agreement and the new political environment in this country since 1998 has been the development of the food industry and the agrifood sector on an all-Ireland basis.  That development has been for the good, and it has happened through major enterprises here developing businesses north of the Border.  Similarly, some Northern companies have also developed businesses here.  Let us look at one fact in this context.  Some 800 million litres of milk came south for processing last year.  More than 400 million litres of that total amount came to Lakeland Dairies in my constituency.</p>  <p>  In that regard, there is one issue I would like to see addressed and tweaked regarding the protocol and Brexit.  I refer to the fact that milk which comes here for processing is obviously processed along with milk sourced south of the Border.  Northern Ireland dairy farmers are obviously also working to EU standards, but if the need arises in future for the dairy sector to get price supports at EU level, there will then be a difficulty regarding products using milk sourced in the North because Northern Ireland milk will not be termed as being an EU product of origin.  This is one area which must be addressed and I sincerely hope tweaks can be made in this context to ensure, if EU supports are needed in future, they will be applicable to all products which leave our country.</p></speech>

I refer to legislation to cap how much farmers and landowners in general will have to contribute to nursing homes costs.  I ask the Minister to brief me, if there is time, regarding where that legislation stands now.</p>  <p>  Turning to the proposed new rural environment protection scheme, REPS, I would like to find out more about the pilot the Minister has been talking about for some time for farmers not in GLAS.</p> <p>I understand some 4,000 are farmers caught in this scenario and that the Minister is looking at a pilot scheme in maybe the late spring or early summer.  Perhaps he could provide a little more detail on where that is at.</p> <p> Before Christmas, a &euro;100 million support package was announced for the agrifood industry, specifically for the meat factories.  The point remains, however, and it has been made by other speakers, that beef prices continue to remain low.  They have stabilised somewhat but have dropped quite a degree over recent months.  The primary producer, who is the farmer, is asking why his or her price is at rock bottom when the support is being given to the meat processing plants.  What more can we say to them to allay concerns about this downward trajectory of pricing?</p> <p> The whole issue of rights of way is always a concern for landowners.  It is a boiling issue.  It is a fact that 30 November this year is the cut-off point for landowners and people who have rights of way across land to register them.  It does not deal with all scenarios.  I know of a number of scenarios in my county of Clare where graveyards are landlocked on someone's farm and where one must go across a gravel pathway.  There is no mechanism within legislation to provide for those kinds of right of way.  I have looked at initiating a Bill.  This needs to be looked at between now and November to secure the right of a person to cross a farm into a burial ground.</p></speech>

On the fair deal scheme, the Bill is due to come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this term.  The objective is to have it in place and operational by summertime.</p>  <p>  I have recently published the consultation on the new agri-environment scheme, which is closing on 26 February.  Already there have been some 1,000 replies to the consultation.  I would encourage all farmers to engage and give their views to help inform the nature of the scheme and ensure it is as practical as possible for farmers to implement, while also ensuring that we have output at the end of it for achieving the environmental objectives of the scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to downward prices, I am working on that and will be doing a public consultation shortly, as well as establishing a food ombudsman to try to bring additional price transparency into the food supply chain and to try to ensure farmers get a fair crack of the whip with margins.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's other point, my key objective is to try to support farm incomes.  I achieved an 11% increase in the most recent budget for this year so we can support farm schemes.  The Deputy mentioned the &euro;100 million for the processing sector.  That will be over five years, which is &euro;20 million per year.  It will be up to a maximum of 30% of grant aid.  It is about trying to ensure a sector that looks at new products and can add value, ultimately with the objective of maximising the value at farm gate and the return to farmers for their primary produce.</p></speech>

The Minister will have seen the billboards as he went through Longford on his way home to Donegal.  The campaign is promoted by the local IFA chairman, Gavin White.  The posters emphasise the diversity of the sector in County Longford with beef, sheep, chicken, tillage and egg producers all featuring prominently.  A number of the posters feature local farm families and serve to remind us, the consumers, that local farm families, farmers, neighbours and friends, depend very much on the choices we make when we go into our supermarkets.  Every Christmas, the vegan movement runs its poster campaigns, so it is great and reassuring to see local farmers coming together and telling their own story, which is a compelling story.  I hope the Longford initiative can be replicated in other counties.  There is certainly a sense of pride for us in Longford as we pass by the posters on the road.  We can see the Waters family from Gowlan in Killashee who produce our milk, and the O'Halleran's at Loughill in Keenagh, who produce our free range eggs.   These are our food producers.  These are our neighbours and our friends.  For us the consumers there is an instant and recognisable connection.</p>  <p>  I want to raise the case of a Newtowncashel sheep farming family, the details of which I forwarded to the Minister earlier today.  They applied for the sheep welfare scheme when it opened in 2017.  They duly received the action book and commenced recording the actions necessary to satisfy the terms of the scheme.  They chose scanning and foetal egg counting as their two targeted actions.  They duly carried out the scanning of the ewes completely but for various reasons they failed to get the egg count completed.  They correctly assumed that they would not qualify for the 2017 scheme as they had broken the terms.  However, when they went back in 2018, they were told an application had not been submitted and in each subsequent year in which they have tried to access the scheme, they have been told that they do not have an open application.  This is a Bord Bia quality approved family farm that routinely carries out all the key measures in that scheme.  It seems very unfair and unreasonable to exclude them from the sheep welfare scheme.  As the Minister will appreciate, it has resulted in the loss of considerable income for them over the past four years.  He will appreciate also that they operate on a very tight margin with minimal profit.  I forwarded the details to him this morning and I hope he can take it up with the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700038#LL00600"><p>The difficulties many farmers face at the moment have been well spelled out here.  The price they receive for their produce is one of the primary issues that needs to be addressed.  While I understand the Minister, and previous Ministers, have made the point that it is not the Minister's job to set prices or interfere in that, it is the Minister's job to ensure farmers receive a fair crack at the whip and there is fairness in respect of what they do.  They have not been getting that to date and they continue to not get that.  There needs to be a renewed effort in respect of that.</p><p>I wish to raise with the Minister an issue for people involved in the coarse fishing industry.  Many of them import bait from the UK to use here for many of the competitions and so on.  They have been told they cannot import that bait anymore.  Hundreds of thousands of euro worth of this maggot-based product is imported every year for use in that industry.  Recently, I received an email from the Brexit division in the Department stating:</p> <blockquote> 	I refer to your recent enquiry to this Division in respect of importing live fish bait.  I have been informed by the relevant Department Official that there are no harmonized EU rules for the import of insects for non-food use into the Union, so, in the absence of National Rules regarding the conditions for their import, it is not possible to import live fish bait into Ireland from a Third Country (e.g. UK) at this time.  Please feel free to contact this Division again if you require further assistance. </blockquote>  <p>Hopefully, when Covid goes and we get beck to normal tourism activity, we will have many tourists coming to Ireland who will engage in fishing competitions and so on.  That part, however, is going to be missing.  This issue requires the Minister's intervention to ensure it is sorted out.  This is a serious issue for many people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700038#LL00700"><p>I wish to raise a couple of issues on the processing of applications and appeals by the public, many of which have been languishing for months and years, paralysing farmers and operators in Kerry and grossly affecting their income.  Many constituents have contacted me regarding tree felling licence applications.  I inquired about the status of one licence in July.  I checked again in January and was told that it would probably be another nine months and to check back again in six months' time.  This was for an application that was submitted in 2019.  Lumber is being imported due to these delays.  This is not beneficial to the environment and it is devastating for the operators and the industry here.  The appeals process should be there for the people directly affected by the forestry operation, not for blanket objections.  Currently, 90% of appeals against Coillte applications go no further but must churn through the system.  I ask the Minister to get the multiple divisions of the forestry appeals committee up and running as was promised some months ago.</p>  <p>  Invitations to apply for aquaculture licences were issued by the Department in 2016.  In Castlemaine Harbour, more than 100 applications were received in Cromane, including from many people who had no previous association with the area.  The number of applications has apparently led to all of those being rejected due to concerns about the impact of such a large number of growers operating in an area of special conservation and a relatively small spatial area.</p> <p>Only 32 of these applications went to appeal and these have been in limbo for some years.  There is no means for these growers to engage with the Department and discuss their applications.</p> <p> The beef environmental efficiency programme, BEEP, is an invaluable programme of grant aid for small farmers.  Some Kerry farmers have contacted me, saying they have been denied the aid and have appealed.  On further inquiry I have heard that the Department has hundreds of appeals and it will likely take 12 weeks for any appeal to be reviewed.  The staff are working in unusual and difficult conditions due to Covid-19, but additional resources or a different system must be investigated so that small farmers are not put out of business.  </p> <p> Some constituents, including farmers and solicitors, have contacted me about the banks' proposal to impose negative interest rates on deposit accounts.  In transferring a family farm, in some cases where the farmer has deceased, moneys are being held in solicitors' clients' accounts.  They will be further punished by banks which pay very little tax.  This is totally inappropriate and pure greed on behalf of the banks, particularly in probate cases where the estate is being divided up.  I ask the Minister to have a word with the financial regulator to ensure this will not happen and that families who are waiting on money from their solicitors will not be penalised with further financial penalties.  </p></speech>

We have many challenging issues as a result of Britain being a third country and outside the Single Market.  Many of these issues are not easily resolved if resolvable.  I will look into it in detail.</p>  <p>  Deputy Daly asked about forestry appeals where we have had significant challenges.  We have increased the staff working on this.  We have 16 ecologists working on this now where we had only one previously.  We have ten additional forestry inspectors to try to deal with the backlog.  I also take the Deputy's points about aquaculture appeals and BEEP.</p></speech>

In the past year, farmers have worked extremely hard, but they have watched their income fall.  Some have suffered mental health issues.  There is a real threat to supply of machinery and parts and the knock-on effect will be felt by all of us.</p>  <p>  Beef quotes are being slashed each week, with some factories having cut back to a three-day week.  In some cases, workers are being flown in because it is an essential service and this in the middle of a pandemic.  Can the Minister confirm that proper public health protocols are in place with workers coming from other jurisdictions?  As Covid-19 does not know an essential worker from a holiday maker, what steps are being taken to protect public health when permitting essential workers to arrive here?  Do they need to have had a negative test?  Do they have to quarantine?</p>  <p>  I frequently hear from farmers that we need a food ombudsman.  I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, cannot regulate the entire beef sector.  Farmers want a fair price for their product.  In his speech, the Minister said that the Department is considering having a food ombudsman.  What powers would such a person have?  What is the timescale?  We need to get this right as this is something the farmers have been calling for.  There is unfair competition and below-cost pricing.  I am not satisfied that consumers know what they are buying sometimes because the labelling is not always clear.  Once again, the farmers are the losers.  Farmers just want everyone to be held to account.  One farmer said to me this week they will take all the rules and the measures if the regulations are enforced properly.  They would like to see that across the board especially in the export of live animals.  </p>  <p>  Irish farmers operate to the highest animal welfare standards in the world when exporting, but there is a threat that live exports will be banned.  Exporting livestock is vital in ensuring price competition in the marketplace.  What will the Government do to protect Irish farmers?</p>  <p>  I welcome the new two-day online specialised "clear customs" course for those directly involved in the agriculture import and export sector, created in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  However, much more needs to be done.  Only 56 businesses in Kilkenny and 50 in Carlow have taken up the support so far, which suggests that not enough people, farmers included, know about this support.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about point-to-point racing.  I have spoken to him and to Deputy Cahill about it.  This is a significant issue in my area.  We also need answers on the fair deal for farmers.  I ask the Minister to write back to me with answers to these questions.  It is important for us to look after our farmers who have kept this country going through a recession.  Now they are keeping us going through the Covid pandemic.  It is hard for everyone.</p></speech>

There is considerable concern in the point-to-point community.  As he will be aware, 37 point-to-point meetings took place In Ireland despite all levels of restrictions until 13 January when the sport abruptly ended.  Point-to-point racing is the starting point for many of our National Hunt horses.  The entire National Hunt breeding industry is now severely challenged and there will be a lasting impact on the industry, on sales, on breeding and on the livelihood of those involved in producing point-to-point horses if the season does not recommence shortly.  The sector needs clarity.</p>  <p>  As the Minister will be aware, horses cannot simply be put away on a shelf.  They need to be fed, trained and exercised.  Successful protocols were put in place to ensure the safe hosting of all these events.  It was no surprise that no outbreak of Covid was recorded in the hosting of any point-to-point events because they are all hosted in large open fields.  I have spoken directly to the Minister on this issue and have tried to engage with his officials.  I ask him to outline what he and his Department have done to ensure the safe return of point-to-point racing.  In the revised plan for Covid, will point-to-point racing resume at the start of March?</p></speech>

As he knows the public health advice must be put first throughout the pandemic.  That is the backdrop against which we are working.  I certainly understand and recognise the challenges closure has had on the point-to-point industry and the importance of that sector of the horse racing industry.  The Government will consider that against the backdrop of public health advice.  I certainly take on board the representations the Deputy has made on behalf of the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700039#MM00600"><p>I also want to raise the issue of point-to-point racing with the Minister.  That industry is at a critical juncture.  This is regarded as an amateur sport, but a significant amount of money is involved.  The cornerstone of the National Hunt industry is point-to-point racing.  Many small operators have considerable investment in bloodstock and point-to-point racing is their shop window to sell their horses.  The people involved are professional trainers even though they are amateur in name.</p>  <p>  All these horses are sold between February and the middle of May.  They need to be able to run them to have the shop window to sell these horses.  The only way they can get them sold is by running them in point-to-point races to show what they are capable of doing.  At the moment there are extra entries into races at racecourses organised by Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  Point-to-point trainers are doing that out of desperation.  That is not the window they need to sell their horses.  What they need is to have their horses jumping over a three-mile course to show their potential.  If these trainers are not able to sell these horses this spring, the customers will not be there to buy three-year-old horses in the sales next summer.</p>  <p>That will feed down into the yearling and foal sales next autumn so everyone in the breeding chain will be severely affected.  It will have a huge impact on our national hunt breeding, from which it might not recover.  People are ringing me every day who are under extreme financial pressure.  They have heavy financial commitments based on the possible sale of these horses.  While they obviously did not know what the horses would make, they knew they would sell them in the window between 1 February and the middle of May.  HRI has run horse racing perfectly within all the health guidelines.  Thankfully there have been no clusters at any of the race meetings it has had, and there have been three or four a week.  When point-to-point racing was running last November and December we had no clusters either.  I am confident that, with the proper protocols in place, the same will be true again.  I urge the Minister, for the sake of the industry and for these small men who are involved in national hunt breeding, to give consideration to allowing point-to-point racing to restart when making recommendations for 5 March.  It is hugely financially important and it is the small man in the industry who will suffer. </p></speech>

The court case in 2019 which removed the exemption from planning permission for peat extraction is having, and will have, a significant impact on the industry.  I thank representatives of the sector for highlighting this issue.  Theirs is a very important industry.  It provides employment and a safe, sustainable food supply for this country.  We need to expand our horticultural industry and we need to take any threats to it very seriously.  I commend the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in putting together a working group, which is bringing the horticulture industry together with environmental and scientific experts to try to arrive at some solutions.  It is clear that not only is this an urgent problem, it is a problem without an easy solution.  Representatives from the sector have acknowledged that they need to move away from peat as a growing medium but the challenge is how quickly that can be done.  The Green Party is playing its part in supporting our horticulture industry and trying to find a solution to this problem.  I reject the views of those who are trying to turn the issue of horticultural peat into another episode of a supposed culture war between environmentalism and agriculture.  There may be those whose political or business interests are furthered by such a culture war but we should reject it and spurn those who seek to spread division.  We should hear all perspectives because we need to find solutions that work.</p></speech>

I take on board the importance of the point-to-point sector in the overall horse racing industry and the financial implications of it being closed.  As I pointed out previously, that was done against the backdrop of the public health advice and the importance of keeping people safe.  That has led to very significant challenges but it will continue to be considered by the Government and the Cabinet as public health advice evolves.  I take on board the Deputy's representations and the impact this is having on the sector at the moment.</p>  <p>  Deputy Leddin outlined the issue he raised very well.  Peat is important for our horticulture sector and I welcome the process that has been put in place by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  As I pointed out earlier, it is important that we find a practical solution to this that will support our horticulture and the need for peat.</p></speech>

It is essential that, as the Minister and his officials plan for recovery, they remain focused on supporting small and locally sustainable businesses, farms and fishing communities, which are too often overlooked.  These groups bear the cost of the pandemic, climate change and Brexit, with little benefit from international trade deals.  There are three areas about which I want to ask the Minister.</p>  <p>  The first is the ongoing issue of Covid clusters in meat plants.  These clusters have been some of the worst outbreaks in the country and have had serious impacts on workers in the local communities.  While we are all aware of the poor treatment of farmers by this industry before the pandemic, we now have accounts from workers' organisations and unions revealing incredibly poor conditions for workers and a culture that resulted in many workers fearing coming forward.  There is an urgent need for immediate reform of the sector.  Unfortunately, the industry is still resisting calls for proper sick pay and it had to be pressurised into negotiating with unions.  What actions is the Minister taking to address these systemic issues in the sector?</p>  <p>  Second, my colleague, Deputy Cairns, highlighted how small-scale fishers have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus.  These families and communities need basic infrastructure.  Too many small piers dotted around our coastline and islands are falling into disrepair and lack basic amenities such as slipways.  They urgently need investment to preserve the livelihoods of local families and the practice of truly sustainable fishing.  This kind of fishing has existed in rural and coastal Ireland for generations.  It is more environmentally friendly and will keep families living on islands and in other coastal areas.  Funding for these piers comes from the Minister's Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, through local authorities.  What will the Minister do to ensure a more balanced recovery?  Will he ensure targeted funding is provided for small piers in particular?</p>  <p>  Third, the European Committee of the Regions recently proposed a comprehensive set of measures to foster agro-ecology in the European Union.  Agro-ecology reduces the carbon footprint of agriculture, fosters the recovery of biodiversity and increases the economic and social resilience of farms with healthy and accessible food.  It represents a type of sustainable agriculture that we need to support in rural areas post Covid.  What is the Minister's response to the committee's proposals, especially the development of short supply chains, small-scale processing of agricultural products and the reduction of VAT on organic, local and seasonal products? </p></speech>

As with every other sector of society and the economy, the safety of employees from danger and the risk of infection is absolutely paramount.  That is essential in the meat and food processing sectors in particular, given that their employees are designated as essential workers and therefore have had to work throughout the pandemic.  They have carried out tremendous work in ensuring that the food supply has been kept moving and every effort and step that can be put in place to protect them must be taken.  My Department has been working with public health and the Health and Safety Authority and there has been strong co-ordination in ensuring that the highest standards are in place.  The processing sector recognises the priority objective of keeping staff safe, although that has been challenging throughout the pandemic because of the fact that they have had to keep operating.</p>  <p>  As regards employee terms and conditions, like every other sector, these sectors must comply with labour and employment rights.  It is essential that that happens in every sector, including the processing sector.  Workers' rights are not directly a matter for my Department but the ESRI is conducting some long-term research in this regard and I have engaged with it on that.  Let me be clear that this is the same for all sectors of the economy where employment law applies and that is the same in the meat processing sector.</p>  <p>  We have many piers around the country.  Six of our larger harbours are designated and owned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The rest are, by and large, owned and operated by the local authorities and significant funding is provided by my Department every year to assist local authorities in keeping them up.  I will shortly be announcing a grant call for the year ahead to support local authorities in the upkeep of those piers.  That will be forthcoming soon. </p>  <p>  As regards supporting small local producers against the backdrop of Covid, the wider supports in the economy are available to everyone.  However, smaller producers have been particularly challenged.  I have been monitoring the situation closely to ensure supports are being availed of and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

I would like him to provide some detail on the outcomes from the beef task force to date.  I know it first met in December 2019.  What has been achieved to date for beef farmers through that forum because there appears to have been no progress on the two main issues that beef farmers have repeatedly raised, namely, the rules around the four movements and the 30-month rule.</p>  <p>  Last week, I met a group of farmers known as the Independent Farmers of Ireland Group, who cited that neighbour farmers are closing their gates and that they no longer feel it is right to encourage their sons or daughters to take on the family farm such is the hardship of farming, particularly beef farming.  The income is no longer sufficient to sustain a family, which is a really sad state of affairs.  It is clear we need radical action to turn that around.</p>  <p>  In regard to Meat Industry Ireland, I cannot fathom why the Minister will not agree to review the meat industry, down to its treatment of its workers as raised by numerous Deputies.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of the ongoing flooding of 1,200 acres of farmland in Roscommon due to Lough Funshinagh.  I would like the Minister to outline what engagement he has had with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and the OPW on this issue.  Will he ensure that on the back of this farmers will be supported?  This is not just about land and sheds, it is about livelihoods, farmers and their families, who are in a desperate situation as the flooding spreads day by day.  The situation is really grave.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could shed some light on the matter.</p></speech>

I contacted him during the week about the scallop industry in Wexford.  From 1 March, those involved in this industry are forbidden by the British authorities to land their catch at any British port.  This will wipe out the industry.  What does the Government propose to do about this?</p>  <p>  The current cut in quotas of 15% is completely disproportionate and leaves our fishers, including the Wexford fishers, with a bill of over &euro;45 million to pick-up.  What is the Government's stance on this and what does the Minister propose to do about it?</p>  <p>  My third question is on the charter boat industry, which is currently not eligible for the CRSS because it is not a bricks and mortar business.  Will the Minister work to include it in that scheme?</p>  <p>  My final question relates to inshore fishermen, who also have been neglected.  They are considered self-employed yet they are obliged to pay harbour and marine charges of up to &euro;2,000 or more.  They have suffered a huge drop in price at market because of the collapse of the French and Spanish markets due to Covid-19.  Will the Minister commit to the provision of assistance to inshore fishermen?  If SMEs are allowed an amnesty in their rates, surely inshore fishermen should be given an amnesty in respect of marine and harbour charges.</p></speech>

One of the main outcomes is the agreement in regard to a PGI grass fed beef standard application to the European Commission.  There is also an agreement, on which I have worked with the task force, to provide &euro;6 million in funding for the first time to support the development of a suckler beef brand.  There is more work ongoing, including on my proposal to develop a food ombudsman to bring transparency to the food supply chain.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Mythen's question in regard to scallops, a number of issues have emerged following on from Brexit, not only in relation to fish landings in Britain but other products too.  Many of these challenges are difficult to address but we are examining and teasing them out.  Where possible, we will try to reach accommodations, but the reality is that Britain is now a third country from the point of view of the Single Market and that brings real challenges and changes in relation to our previous relationship.</p>  <p>  On the quotas and the impact of Brexit, thankfully, there was an agreement and we avoided a no-deal scenario, but Brexit has brought challenges and a quota loss for the sector.  I am working to see what options are available to address it at European level and also at domestic level in terms of working with the sector to put in place supports to help it adust.</p></speech>

That was a foolish response and, at worst, negligence because as we all now know meat plants are epicentres of Covid infection, often leaving vulnerable migrant workers at risk and the communities wherein they are located at risk.  I continue to find bizarre the responses from every arm of the State in relation to this industry.  It is being treated with kid gloves and light touch regulation.  Where serious outbreaks of Covid-19 are concerned, this remains very difficult to fathom.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny recently asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other Departments a number of questions regarding an outbreak at a meat plant in Clondalkin, to which he received only a very cursory reply from the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  I recently put a question to the Minister's Department regarding an outbreak at an ABP plant in Cork and was told that the Minister had been assured by the meat industry representatives that where such workers are engaged the plant is compliant with regulatory requirements.  If we have not at this stage learned the lesson that we cannot trust at face value the responses of the meat industry, will we ever learn it?  Approximately one week ago, the HSPC produced updated guidelines for the meat industry.  I have read the guidelines.  They are very useful and there is a lot of good guidance in them.  How do we know the meat plants will enforce them?  Can the Minister tell me if there have been unannounced inspections of meat plants in the week since 10 February when those guidelines were published?</p>  <p>  In August last, the Minister for Health said there had to be changes and reforms around the practices in meat plants.  How do we know they happened?  How would the Minister know that?  The industry representatives will not tell him truth.  We know from the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland, SIPTU and others that the situation for workers remains very poor and without a sick pay scheme they remain fairly unprotected as they cannot take measures when they are sick that would protect them and the communities where they live.  At this stage, we need to do something about the fact that the industry is tooth and nail opposed to a sick pay scheme for these workers.  I appeal to the Minister to support such a measure.  Solidarity-People Before Profit will bring forth a Bill soon to try to get that measure moved forward.</p>  <p>  The Minister must behave differently to his predecessor whom I mentioned.  We cannot have Ministers being a shrill for the meat industry when abuses of workers and farmers are taking place on a large-scale basis, for which there is much evidence.  We need to make sure that regulations are enforced and that the Minister stands up for them.  I again appeal to the Minister to ensure that there are unannounced inspections at meat plants and that all of the regulations are tightly enforced, which needs to be proven to us.  The Minister should not take the meat industry at face value when it tells him something when it turns out not to be true.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700041#OO00900"><p>I would like to do a question and answer session with the Minister on the same issue raised by Deputy Smith.  The meat plants are once again major Covid clusters.  Of the 56 meat plants in this State, there are 29 open Covid outbreaks.  At the majority of the plants, there have been Covid cases in the past 28 days.  In the Larry Goodman-owned ABP Bandon plant, 70 of the 300 workers have tested positive for Covid.</p> <p>It is clear that the big beef barons are putting their wealth before their workers' health and the Government is letting them away with it.  To this day, the vast majority of meat plant workers still have no entitlement to sick pay and are working even when they should not.  It is like Groundhog Day and the beef barons are being let off the hook again.</p> <p> Last September, the Minister told the D&aacute;il that the issue of sick pay for meat plant workers was being addressed.  When I asked him about it last month, he promised to send on information but never did so.  He said today it is essential that every step is put in place to protect meat plant workers.  This is a step for which he and the Government are responsible.  Will he intervene now to ensure there is mandatory sick pay for all meat factory workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700042#PP00200"><p>In the meat industry, as in every other part of the economy, the welfare and health of employees has to come first.  The same rules apply to everyone in this regard.  All employers must take every precaution they possibly can to keep employees safe.  There is also an onus on the Government to work to ensure there is oversight and inspection in order to make sure those standards are being upheld.  As of 5 February this year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had completed 666 inspections on behalf of the HSA, including unannounced inspections in Department-approved food premises.  Those inspections are ongoing.  To be clear, they are in addition to inspections carried out by the HSA itself and also in addition to the 49 premises where the Department has a permanent presence.  As of 3 February, the HSA had completed 239 inspections of meat processing facilities since 18 May last year.  Plant inspection numbers include those connected with Covid-19 outbreaks.  Of the 239 inspections, 208 were unannounced and 31 were announced.</p>  <p>  Right across the agrifood sector, where workers have been designated as essential, there have been many challenges in regard to infection because of the increased infection levels in the community.  That makes it even more essential that the protocols are followed to the last in all settings, particularly the food processing sector.  The Government is doing all we can to ensure the oversight is in place and the standards are being upheld.</p></speech>

The Covid pandemic has certainly highlighted the need for a task force to look at terms and conditions and the whole structure of employment within the industry.  It is fair to say that there are very few workers in the meat industry who have not, sooner or later, contracted Covid.  The Minister might give us the figures in that regard.</p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise is the fact that last year was a disastrous one for coastal communities.  We saw falling prices for shellfish, the impact of the Covid crisis on tourism and also the fact that the environmental schemes are coming, or have come, to an end.  The Minister knows my concern about the new environmental scheme.  Small operators who earn a living from two or three sources in the west of Ireland need income support and they need it urgently.</p>  <p>  I would like to address the issue of fishing.  The reality is that the fishing industry was thrown under the bus by the European Union at the last minute in the Brexit talks.  I hear people saying that the deal that was done was better than a no-deal arrangement, but a good fishing deal would have been a hell of a lot better than a bad fishing deal.  I do not think there was ever any question of a no-deal arrangement.  It was always going to be sorted out at the eleventh hour, on the last day.  Fishermen do not want to get paid to tie up boats; they want to fish.  The industry is in crisis.  The Minister knows the problems in the shellfish industry and I have raised them with him time and again.  For example, the price of oysters, which are a delicacy and have to be sold fresh, has gone from something like &euro;9 per kilogram down to &euro;2.  It is a major crisis and the industry is not viable at the moment.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have to agree with Deputy Gannon regarding piers.  In his response, the Minister said that a lot of money had been given to pier projects.  In fact, what has been given would not wet one's tongue.  Surveys have been done of piers around the country - I funded one 20 years ago - and there is an incredible number of small piers used by the people who operate out of what we call currachs, that is, small open boats.  They are the backbone of the lobster, crab and other shellfish industries.  In a context where billions have been spent on big developments around the country, including the Luas, DART and so on, we need the funding for piers to be substantially increased.  In particular, Ros an Mh&iacute;l must get on the agenda this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700042#PP00600"><p>I would like to raise the issue of animal welfare, specifically equine welfare.  The majority of Deputies would come across situations where animals, particularly horses, are found in a decrepit condition, many of them emaciated and some having to be euthanised in certain circumstances.  The programme for Government calls for the continued robust enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and a review of the sentencing regime underpinning that legislation.  I very much welcome that, particularly in my own constituency where we have a considerable problem with horse and animal welfare.  Unfortunately, only 48 prosecutions have taken place nationally in the past three years, seven of them in Cork.  We need to continue to work on this issue and to promote enforcement of the legislation.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government also states that we need to prioritise equine welfare based on a robust traceability system, building on existing inspectorate supports throughout the country, and ensuring a consistent approach to dealing with horse welfare issues across local authorities.  I understand a new national animal welfare strategy is to be launched shortly, as per the response I received from the Minister in January.  When finalising that strategy, I ask that consideration be given to requiring local authorities to employ equine officers who would have the responsibility, and the proper enforcement powers, to oversee microchipping of animals.  If not, we will continue to have a system that allows for the mistreatment and abuse of animals and we will be wholly reliant on animal welfare groups and charities to take up the slack.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure that appropriate enforcement is undertaken in the future?  Will the Minister indicate when we will see the publication of the animal welfare strategy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700042#PP00700"><p>I thank the Minister for taking this debate.  I want to raise the issue of the damage that was done at Ballycotton pier last weekend.  I had the chance to speak directly to the Minister about it but I am asking today that he and his officials engage with Cork County Council to ensure the funding that is required for the repairs is given swiftly.  There is an urgency to this matter given the importance of the pier to Ballycotton as a village and tourist hub and for the fishing industry there.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about the situation in regard to point-to-point racing.  As the Minister is aware, my family is heavily involved in thoroughbred breeding and horse racing in Ireland.  However, I am speaking today on behalf of the thousands of people in Cork East whose livelihoods depend on the point-to-point industry, thoroughbred breeding and the training of horses for racing.  The damage that is being done by the decision of the Department to delay the return of point-to-point racing is significant, but we are not yet in a situation where it is irretrievable.  I ask the Minister to act urgently to allow the resumption of point-to-point racing.  As he has acknowledged, there is a very delicate ecosystem in terms of breeding and the impact it has on racing pedigrees and, later in the year, on sales.  We need to ensure horses are allowed the opportunity to run in order to build their pedigrees.  It is important that urgent action be taken in this particular area.  I ask the Minister to respond to that point.</p></speech>

At this time of year, ewes are heavy in lamb and sheep farmers are worried about increased numbers of walkers' dogs roaming off the leash on hills where they are a danger to sheep.</p> <p>Walkers are always welcome in the countryside.  Walking clubs have worked well and closely with farmers and landowners over many years.  Sheep farmers in areas between Macroom and Millstreet, for example, in Mushera and Clara, have been highlighting concerns to me about increased numbers of walkers and people rediscovering the countryside but with dogs off the leash.  That is a real concern for sheep farmers.  While the control of dogs is not a direct responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, sheep farming is.  I call on the Minister to liaise with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about ensuring that livestock are safe.</p> <p> Another issue is bovine viral diarrhoea testing for young calves.  When calves are born, farmers tag them, take the sample and send it in the post to Kildare.  Often, that is done by registered post.  Farmers are keen to get a result back in a timely fashion in case they want to sell on calves.  While they will hold the calves for two weeks, they want to know that they will have the result back in that time.</p> <p> There will be increased demand on the laboratories as we move into calving season.  It gets more intense and the laboratories will be used for Covid-19 testing as well.  We have to ensure adequate capacity is available for all these needs in those laboratories.  I call on the Minister to liaise with the laboratories to ensure they have adequate capacity and can deliver in a timely manner.</p></speech>

My Lovely Horse Rescue does extraordinary work in Clondalkin with horses which have been badly mistreated.  The volunteer work would be greatly helped if local authorities, like South Dublin County Council, had equine welfare officers.</p>  <p>  Irish food and drinks companies have always had an exceptional reputation at home and abroad.  This reputation is built on the standard of their products and the strength of their brands.  Every year, these businesses bring much-needed enterprise to our shores.  In 2020 alone exports of Irish food and drink were valued at &euro;13 billion to our economy.  However, despite the incredible efforts in the face of unprecedented challenges, this industry has been hit hard by the pandemic and the commercial pressures imposed by Covid-19.  Most notably, food and drinks companies rely heavily on brand ambassadors to engage in brand promotion.  This strengthens relationships with business customers, something that is particularly pertinent in supporting market diversification in our post-Brexit economy.</p>  <p>  Previously, the semi-state organisation, Bord Bia, provided funding support to food and drinks companies to help with these brand ambassador placements, but unfortunately this funding was withdrawn some years ago.  Once foreign travel is permitted again, these brand ambassador placements will be essential for rebuilding Irish brand reputations, renewing business relationships and bringing much-needed economic investment back to Ireland.  Will the Minister consider reinstating this funding as an emergency covid measure to allow food and drinks companies to employ ambassadors directly in key export markets once it is safe to do so again?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the importance of funding coastal communities, the importance of the new agri-environmental scheme and of funding piers.  I take his points on board.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the issue of horse welfare and the animal welfare strategy, as did Deputy Higgins.  There is work to be done on this and I take on board the Deputies' comments in that regard.  Deputy O'Connor mentioned Ballycotton Pier, which we discussed during the week.  I will certainly engage with him further on that.  He mentioned the importance of point-to-point, a matter he has made representations on previously.  I have addressed the matter in previous answers.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the importance of looking at what additional measures we can take to prevent dog attacks.  That is a matter on which I am engaged with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I take the Deputy's point on the importance of prompt laboratory response to tests as well.</p></speech>

I have three questions for the Minister.  Are there plans to vaccinate workers ahead of the spring surge?  Can the Minister tell us about those plans?  What engagement has the Minister had with stakeholders in that sector?  Is the Minister giving consideration to putting specific plans in place to prepare for all eventualities, including a scenario in which staffing levels may drop to low levels?</p></speech>

The Minister will have received correspondence from me.  There is a real problem with the part-time online courses.  We had a situation in Westport some weeks ago where the course was over-subscribed to the extent that there were hundreds of applications but only 200 places.  Applicants were accepted and then they were told later the same evening that they were no longer accepted but that they could be given a place in 2022.  What has the Minister put in place specifically to address this shortage of part-time Green Cert places?</p></speech>

Recently, I met representatives of the dairy sector and this issue was raised.  As the Deputy knows, the vaccination roll-out has been given strong and deft consideration by the national immunisation advisory committee.  Our roll-out and approach are based on the committee's considerations.  We have many priority and vulnerable categories.  Each is deserving in respect of the urgency of receiving a vaccine.  The position is likewise in the agrifood sector, where there are many essential workers.  The dairy sector has particular challenges relating to capacity at peak times and the importance of those workers is relevant.  The national immunisation advisory committee is aware of these issues and has taken them on board in its consideration of vaccination roll-out and prioritisation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised a query on which I have received many representations from County Mayo Deputies and Senators.  I have been engaged with Teagasc on the potential to put in place additional capacity for part-time and online Green Cert courses.  We will continue to engage to try to identify additional capacity because of the increased demand and because of the particular situation relating to over-subscription of the course being run in Mayo.</p></speech>

Can the Minister guarantee me that every young farmer who wants a place on a course to do a Green Cert online or part-time will be guaranteed such a place?  I need not outline to the Minister the implications for farmers in terms of income if that does not happen.  This is done both through Teagasc and the higher and further education colleges.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am not in a position today to give any guarantees around that but I have clearly outlined, as I have to Government Deputies who have raised this with me directly, that I am engaged with Teagasc.  I understand the position relating to the demand for young farmers to become trained and to avail of Green Cert courses.  We are keen to try to ensure demand is met.  I will continue to engage with Teagasc on the matter.</p></speech>

Beef prices are on the floor and beef finishers are facing significant losses, and in some cases ruin, in bringing their beef product to market, which they must do after all.  Farmers continue to engage in supplemental feeding and husbandry to deliver the premium grass-fed product that is the bulwark of our national beef exports and indigenous consumption.  Farmers are facing ruinous sales prices which leave them in no position to pay their suppliers now or to meet their own family income needs.  Despite national promotion of Irish beef, the next generation of beef farmers will not exist in this country because beef finishing as an agricultural activity is dying on its feet because of continuous producer price issues.  It is worth noting that like-for-like comparison of beef prices with UK factory prices sees Irish farmers receiving between &euro;200 and &euro;300 less per animal.  This situation cannot be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister's Department to recognise the present challenges facing the Irish beef sector and to introduce, as soon as possible, a new beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme to alleviate the hardships being imposed on the impacted farm families and to recognise the need to support this indigenous manufacturing sector.</p> <p> The second issue is the nursery training ground of our national hunt and thoroughbred racing industry, namely, the point-to-point sector.  Point-to-point activity has been closed for many months despite our national hunt and flat racing continuing successfully during the pandemic.  Point-to-point racing is vital to the national horse racing industry of which it is a significant component.  It provided more than &euro;45 million in export sales to the UK in 2019.  It supports veterinarian, farrier, horse transport and feedstock jobs in rural counties and with 66 courses around the country, point-to-point is the form of horse racing that most touches rural Irish society.  It is here also that the Irish horse racing financial model filters through to rural Ireland.  Point-to-point racing is inherently safe given it can be conducted with fewer than 40 people occupying a 60 acre space outdoors where all the protocols implemented on our racing tracks are fully in place and overseen by the same two governing bodies that control national racing.  The point-to-point season finishes at the end of May and I ask the Minister to please look immediately at allowing this safe activity to recommence, to allow the trade continue and to safeguard livelihoods and our hard-won horse racing industry which delivers wider benefits to so many.</p> <p> The third and final issue I raise is our forestry sector.  It is a hugely important indigenous industry but is also required to mitigate future national climate penalties.  The legislation passed in recent months, which we supported, has improved the output of licences but is not meeting the needs for new planting applications.  Timeframes for felling and new planting can be up to two years to process and the system is placing huge bureaucracy on farmers who, at the end of the day, are simply trying to harvest a cash crop at a future point.  The requirements for ecological and Natura surveys are becoming onerous and costly and will prove a deterrent to new applications.  In addition, the throughput of applications per annum through departmental offices is estimated at 4,500, yet new felling, planting and roadway applications are deemed to be running at 6,000 per annum.  It is only a matter of time before the system yet again becomes completely logjammed which will once more necessitate significant importation of softwood timbers and will ensure that Ireland completely misses our future afforestation targets, thereby incurring climate penalties in future.  We can be self-sufficient in this industry but bureaucracy is restricting our national ability to perform in this sector.</p> <p> I ask the Minster address these three issues and I hope he can do so as soon as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700044#RR00300"><p>I have written to the Minister on a number of issues, so I ask him to respond in writing and that he makes it a priority.  I have four and a half minutes to convey to the Minister that he is allowing the EU to destroy Ireland's fishing industry.  I want him to fight for the fishermen and women of this country, particularly those of the fishing communities in Kilmore and Duncannon who are dependent on the industry for their very survival.  From 1 April, Irish fishing boats will no longer be able to land their catch in UK ports.  This will leave them with increased costs of millions of euro due to having to go to French or Belgian ports and then transport their catch back to Ireland to be processed.  They will need to go hundreds of extra nautical miles and hundreds of extra kilometres to earn their living and help their communities survive, with added risk to life and limb.</p>  <p>  The Minister recently announced five extra landing ports in Ireland to facilitate foreign-registered vehicles.  He should display the same level of interest and support for Irish fishing boats which by absolute necessity must retain the right to land in UK ports after 1 April.  I would appreciate that.  Where is the common sense attached?  Why is there no mention of the carbon footprint we hear so much about on this particular subject?  What does the Minister intend to do because if it is nothing then he had better tell us that himself?  I saw the Minister on "Ear to the Ground" and was not very impressed.  We heard from Mr. John Lynch of the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation.  We heard also from Mr. Shane McIntyre and Ms Kathleen Ni Hea from Dunmore, County Waterford.  Like the fishermen and women of County Wexford, they said that they want to earn their livelihoods.  The last time I checked that was the right of every citizen in Ireland under our Constitution.  They expect this Government to uphold that right and not stand by while it is diminished, losing as much as 15% of their fishing quota, at a cost in excess of &euro;43 million.  Boat owners and the fish processors in these communities face ruin if the Minister does not step in and fight on their behalf.</p>  <p>  Another seriously important issue which has been mentioned many times in this debate is the national hunt sector.  It is in crisis and facing very grave consequences if the Minister does not devise a way to allow point-to-point to return in the next two weeks.  The impact of the Minister's decision to halt point-to-point, stating it is not an elite sport, shows a very poor understanding of the importance of the point-to-point industry nationally.  Halting the ability of horse owners and handlers to establish value by being able to run horses, sell them and then use the sales revenue to purchase three-year-olds for next season in Goffs and Tattersalls is vital to the continued prosperity of the national hunt industry in Ireland.  County Wexford is a world leader in point-to-point racing which employs thousands of people countrywide.  This is totally unacceptable.  Point-to-point proceeded successfully from October to December without incident.  It has a proven track record of being able to hold its events safely and behind closed doors.  Will the Minister confirm he will ensure this Government can come up with a remedy before its actions ruin another sector?</p>  <p>  I recently had a Zoom call with some of my farming constituents.  One matter that arises at this time of year is dog controls.  Will the Minister tell the House whether he endorses the IFA campaign on dog control, including the significant asks of the campaign such as mandatory microchipping and stronger regulations?  It not only protects farmers' sheep stocks but also protects dog owners from losing their beloved pets in any unfortunate incident which may arise.  It is important that this campaign is recognised as a shared benefit campaign.</p>  <p>  Lastly I raise something which came to my attention just this morning.  HGV drivers with valuable Irish produce such as pharmaceuticals and meat products are being held up and delayed with deliveries because they are now required to have a negative Covid test at nearly all borders in the EU, Germany and Italy included.  This morning there were in excess of 500 drivers sitting at the Italian border having to be tested.  The EU&rsquo;s response is most disjointed.  I ask the Minister to address this with his EU counterparts to make testing provisions widely available so drivers do not have to sit for days with Ireland's exports being delayed and devalued.</p></speech>

While being hit with Brexit and Covid at the same time it has managed to keep the food supply chain going in an admirable fashion.  Ministers should take responsibility for doing a good job in that particular area which I hope can continue.</p>  <p>  I agree with the points raised by Members on the horse racing industry.  It has likewise been beset by Brexit on the one hand and Covid on the over.  There is a need to attend to the point-to-point issue.  Also, access to the UK for the bloodstock industry is an absolute necessity.  I wanted to mention those points in passing.</p>  <p>  I mention also something a little more parochial related to County Kildare.  The sport horse sector, which is considerable in the county, proposes to upgrade its shop window and create a centre of excellence.  This is desirable and a great move on its part.  Unfortunately, however, the proposal is to move from inside the county to out of it.</p> <p>When I raised this issue previously, it was pointed out to me that it is only a matter of a couple of hundred metres.  My response was that is all the more reason it should not move at all.  I ask the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to use their influence to try to ensure that centre of excellence is located in County Kildare, adjacent to all the other racing, bloodstock and sport horse facilities that are readily available and where there are available sites.</p> <p> I wish to underline the importance of the issue of forestry felling licences.  It is not going well at the moment.  I know there has been an improvement, but there are still serious problems and people have been held up unnecessarily.</p> <p> On the issue of the peat industry, which was also raised by Deputy Leddin, we have, as the Ceann Comhairle well knows, a very healthy horticulture sector in County Kildare which depends on the peat sector for supply.  I hope a means can be found to allow that supply to continue on the basis that the horticulture sector is very close to being carbon neutral.  There are no miles involved in delivery of the products.  It would be a serious problem if we had to import from outside the country.  At this moment. the horticulture sector is looking forward to some reassurance which it is to be hoped can be brought to bear.</p> <p> Credit is due to all those in the industry and the agrifood sector in the context of the difficult year they have had to survive.  The industry has survived so far.</p> <p> Incidentally, on the issue of the meat sector and meat factories, meat factories all over the world have had difficulties in terms of outbreaks of Covid, but the owners have a vested interest in keeping their supply chain open.  Some people have suggested that the owners somehow want to close the factories down or operate them illegally.  In fact, they want to keep them open and keep supplying the market.  It is to be hoped that will continue into the future.</p></speech>

Farmers have raised several significant concerns with me in recent weeks.  First, there is the issue of the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme.  Many farmers are seeking an extension to 31 December 2021 for applicants who did not meet the 5% production reduction.  I understand the Department is engaging with the EU Commission regarding flexibility on the deadline.  I ask the Minister to provide an update in that regard.  It would be much appreciated.</p>  <p>  Second, we need to see meaningful action on the issue of realigning food prices with production costs.  There is significant frustration among farmers with regard to attempts by factories to bring down the price of beef and due to the increased production costs associated with finishing cattle.  There is significant concern in that regard.  We need to see accelerated measures and more action in this area to ensure Meat Industry Ireland is left in no doubt that the undermining of market conditions by meat factories will not be accepted.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the green certificate, I would appreciate an accelerated focus on this matter.  There was an allocation of further college placement courses for applicants by certain other Departments, such as the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I would appreciate feedback in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700045#SS00300"><p>I should be able to leave a couple of minutes for the Minister to reply.  The first issue I wish to raise is that of the harness racing sector.  I am referring to safe and professionally run harness racing that takes place on tracks throughout Ireland, particularly in my constituency of Cork South-West.  In west Cork, harness racing is a very popular activity which is the highlight of the summer for many people and brings a significant amount of vibrancy to various parts of west Cork.  Those in the sector have a simple request.  There is an application on the Minister's desk for some element of funding.  Obviously, a large amount of funding goes towards the thoroughbred industry and horse racing and that is fantastic and I fully endorse it, but the Irish Harness Racing Association is looking for just a small fraction of that funding.  I implore the Minister to look favourably on that application because it is a fantastic traditional sport that is enjoyed by so many.</p>  <p>  I raise the issue of veterinary medicinal products or licensed merchant products.  I understand that from January of next year farmers will require a veterinary prescription to access anti-parasitic veterinary medicinal products.  That will have significant implications.  Obviously, it will have cost implications for the farmer.  There are issues in terms of the access farmers will have to veterinarians, especially in peripheral parts of Ireland where they will not have the ease of access they will need.  There will also be animal welfare issues, as the Minister can imagine.  I understand there is a derogation that can be implemented whereby existing licensed merchants can continue to issue prescriptions for these veterinary medicinal products.  That would be of significant benefit to farmers going forward.</p>  <p>  I wish to echo the concerns raised by other Deputies with regard to point-to-point racing.  I would love to know the measures that will be taken to cushion the impact the cancellation of point-to-point racing has had on the entire thoroughbred industry.  The Minister should rest assured that it is having a significant impact on breeders, trainers and owners.  When can we expect point-to-point racing to return?  It is of vital importance throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Most Deputies who have spoken have raised the issue of forestry licences and the difficulties that still exist, including the bureaucracy and red tape and the length of time involved.  I know of a young farmer in west Cork who is now on his or her fourth attempt to get a forestry licence but the commissioner is still coming back for more information.  The House passed the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and the number of staff in the Forestry Service has been increased, but those measures do not seem to be working yet, even though they ought to be.  I would really like to see movement on this issue.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan touched on several issues.  One of the specific issues he raised was in respect of felling licences and the delays in that regard.  It was also the last point raised by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.  There has been a backlog in that area.  We are working very hard to allocate additional resources to try to reduce that backlog and get to a situation where there is a reasonable timeframe for responses to applications for forestry licences.  For example, we have 15 colleges now, whereas previously there was one.  There are ten additional forestry inspectors as well.  We also brought through legislation in October to try to streamline the process.</p>  <p>  Deputy Dillon has been in touch with me previously regarding supports for the beef sector and the issues around the BEAM scheme in particular.  I was glad very recently to be able to confirm an extension to that scheme such that 2021 is a new reference year to allow farmers who were struggling to meet the 5% nitrogen reduction criteria to opt for a new reference year of January to December should they so wish.  At least half of applicants are already on course to meet the 5% reduction and there is no change to their situation, but those in trouble have the opportunity to opt for the new reference year.</p>  <p>  Deputy Dillon has previously raised with me the issue around green certificate courses and the challenges in that regard in County Mayo in particular.  It is a matter on which I am engaged with Teagasc in terms of trying to increase the capacity for online part-time courses to facilitate those students and the demand that exists.</p>  <p>  On the representations of Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to harness racing, it is an issue on which he has been in regular contact with me.  I recently facilitated a meeting with the Irish Harness Racing Association to discuss the potential for funding.  It is a matter I am examining and on which I will revert to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  On prescription-only veterinary medicines, I am aware of the concerns in the farming community and the licensed merchant community regarding the changes that are due on 1 January 2022.  There is a stakeholder group working to try to find a practical way to implement the requirement and address those concerns.</p>  <p>  I take on board the Deputy's representations regarding point-to-point racing.  The issue of the importance of the point-to-point racing sector has been raised by several Deputies.  I have taken those points on board.</p></speech>

It has led to a serious situation.  I am calling on the Minister to commit to the setting up of an independent regulator for this sector, separate to the ombudsman.  I know that when he was in opposition, the Minister called for an independent regulator and I stress to him that there is a need for it.  Many of the agreements that were made on the beef task force are now being reneged upon by factories.  It has come to my attention, for example, that there was an agreement that factories would confirm prices to farmers by text or email but they are not doing that.  There was another agreement to put weighing scales into factories and that has not been done.  It was also agreed that notice would be given to farmers of any changes to weight and that is not happening either.</p>  <p>  It is evident that there is no honest trading in the supply chain and that there is not a sustainable model in terms of the meat factories and supermarkets.  We need to come to grips with that because it is the reality and fact of the matter.  We need to deal with that matter.</p>  <p>  We are facing an unacceptable situation that constantly disadvantages farmers.  It is leading to a situation where beef and suckler farmers are exiting the sector and opting for dairy.  This will lead to animal welfare issues as calves will be abandoned by those beef farmers who are leaving the sector and going into dairy.  The Minister needs to take this on board.</p>  <p>  The only way forward is to put in place an independent regulator because the factories are not playing ball.  At the end of the day, the producer who is producing high quality beef is not being treated fairly.  I call on the Minister to resolve that issue.</p>  <p>  We need legislation quickly for the horticulture sector.  Ireland is the only country that I know of which is recklessly presiding over the loss of up to 17,600 jobs.  We were supposed to have a just transition but that did not happen.  We urgently need legislation to be brought in.</p></speech>

However, not one cent of those taxes will go back into the agriculture sector to help reduce emissions.  Agriculture sector farmers will pay &euro;80 million a year towards carbon tax.  More than 2 million calves will be born in Ireland this year, on top of the 2 million that were born last year.  Some 27% of those calves were not exported.  The UK Minister has not ruled out taking in beef from the US.  South American beef is not the answer we want to hear for Europe.  The UK is our biggest market for food exports, amounting to &euro;4.5 billion.  The cost of feed for animals has risen by 25% with recent EU import duty.  Some 10,000 acres of tillage has transferred to dairy farming this year.  This has a knock-on effect on the production of straw.  Farmers are being asked to mulch straw back into the soil and are competing with mushroom growers who have no access to peat.  At the same time, EU regulations are demanding that the national herd is reduced by 5%.  All of these things have knock-on effects.</p>  <p>  There must be a market and means for transporting live animals.  This is extremely serious.  What is the Minister going to do about the surplus of calves?  The Minister said that he would be the voice in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il and would answer all of these questions for farmers.  I hope he will not let them down on this matter.</p></speech>

Something has to be done about this.  There has been enough talk about it but, unfortunately, there has been no action.</p>  <p>  Our fishermen were sold out in the recent Brexit negotiations.  Small fishermen are finding it difficult.  The Minister is doing his best on the pair trawling issue and I compliment him on that.  It is something that was dealt with unfavourably in a certain way in the judicial system that is currently being reviewed.  I hope there will be an appeal on that issue because fishermen are hurting when they see every type of fish in their bays being swept up.  There are fishermen operating out of small piers.  They have made contributions of investment into small piers in rural areas.  I will give the example of Coornagillagh in Tuosist.  If a certain small amount of money was put into that pier, it would make a massive difference to the local fishermen using it.  On behalf of fishermen in Coornagillagh and every other small pier in Kerry, I ask the Minister to look at that issue.</p>  <p>  On the issue of dog attacks, I am thankful to Radio Kerry and the farmers in the west of Dingle with whom I dealt recently and whose sheep were attacked by dogs.  We want to send a clear message that walkers coming on holiday are more than welcome when they are allowed to come, but we do not want dogs to be allowed to roam free and do damage.</p>  <p>  On the forestry issue, the licensing situation is totally chaotic, as has previously been debated in the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister, for God's sake, to do something inside in his Department to free it up so that people will be able to plant trees, cut trees, make roads and harvest.</p></speech>

They are worried that many farmers will not even qualify for those schemes and that much of the funding would go to administration.  Subsidy payments from the EU are, and were supposed to be, compensation for farmers for producing cheaper food for the consumers of Europe.  Payments are not a gift.  Eco schemes, it appears to many, are to satisfy dreams, paralyse farmers and deprive them of finance they badly need.</p>  <p>  The cost of feeding and fertiliser is another issue.  Another issue is dog control in places like Shrone.  Walkers with dogs that are not tied up are worrying sheep in those places.</p>  <p>  I also support the calls for felling licences to be speeded up and pay for the horticulture sector.</p></speech>

That is a simple question with a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer.</p><p>While in opposition, the Minister stated he would change the 30-month and four-movement rules.  Is he willing to do that?</p><p>Does the Minister intend to bring in a sucker welfare scheme?  I voted on a motion that the Minister brought to the previous D&aacute;il seeking to bring in such a scheme.</p><p>The price of beef has plummeted all of a sudden.  It is as well to tell the Minister straight out that there is speculation that some of the retail operators have told the factories to pull back to three days a week because there will be a shortage of cattle later, and the longer they hold back to three days a week, the more of an opportunity there will be to flood the market.  This needs investigating but the task force is not sitting.  Will the Minister get the chairman of the task force to sit at least once a month?  Farmers only hear what happens a month after the task force meets and they need to be able to see what happens live.  That is important.</p><p>A farming group came to me the other night.  Deputy McNamara was also involved.  That group of independent farmers is meeting all politicians.  They are seeking a Zoom meeting with the Minister.  It is not that they are looking to go face to face with him.  They are looking for a Zoom meeting and the Minister has not come back to them on the matter.  Will the Minister give them that Zoom meeting?</p><p>I will turn to carbon tax.  Am I correct in saying that if I am a fisherman going out in a boat, I do not pay carbon tax?  I would agree with that.  Is that also the case for a boat bringing people over and back to England?  Is it a fact that if I am providing a service such as the <i>L&Eacute; Aoife</i>, I do not pay carbon tax?  Yet a contractor going in to a farmer has to pay carbon tax.  Is that fair?  A new document from Europe is out at the moment relating to exporting and the movement of cattle.  Anyone who reads it will realise that the writing will be on the wall in the next ten years.  Will the Minister put the boot in on that matter?</p><p>It was agreed that cattle would be weighed going into factories and that the opportunity would be there for farmers.  It was never done.  There is another major problem for the marts and the pedigree stock owners who sell in the marts, that is, the top 20% generally goes to the UK.</p> <p>There are stipulations at the moment that the cattle have to be quarantined for 40 days.  Has the Minister contacted his English counterpart to resolve this issue because it is causing major problems?  Could the Minister send me an answer to all of the questions, one by one?  I want to let Deputy McNamara in.  I do not want an essay; I want straight, blunt answers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700047#UU05200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  A simple argument underpins this Bill and our broader approach to addressing the housing crisis.  It is that the State has to step up to the mark to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent using all the means at its disposal.  A good home provides shelter, stability and a safe location.  It should be the launch pad for life's adventures and a refuge from its storms.  The bricks and mortar of a solid home are the cornerstone of a good life.  Owning one's home or having a cost-rental unit is the surest route to achieving those modest but vital aims.  However, an ongoing affordability crisis has reduced home ownership rates to historic lows and increased the age of the average first-time buyer by almost a decade to 35 years of age.  Ireland has plummeted from being a world leader to below the EU average rate of home ownership.  For an entire generation, owning their own home is slipping through their fingers as they pay unprecedented levels of rent or languish at home saving every cent they can.  A generation is caught in a rent trap and the Government and I want to give them hope and to reverse the decline.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, LDA, is an important step change in how we address the housing crisis by ensuring we make the most of all State lands to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent and take a strategic land management approach to the future.  If the central promise of democracy is that each generation will be better off than the last, the current housing crisis represents a fundamental threat.  In an era where the waves of dangerous populism are hitting the shores of established democracies, we need to keep our democracy strong and vibrant.  The housing crisis creates an unstable system of haves and have-nots that reaches deep into the fundamentals of our society.  Building a system that gives each citizen a clear stake in its prosperity is a Government priority.  The struggle to boost home ownership levels and provide cheap, reliable reasonable rent is a core part of that effort to ensure politics delivers for all, including working people.</p>  <p>  I am committed to pragmatism over dogmatism and ideology and will leave no stone unturned in addressing the housing crisis.  The LDA is part of a comprehensive set of measures.  In 2021, backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State, we have the most ambitious social housing programme on record and we will start building new ladders of opportunity for young people caught in a rip-off rental market.  It involves a sweep of proposals, not a silver bullet fantasy with more than &euro;620 million of affordability measures alone.  We are introducing a new equity scheme where the State will take a stake in one's home, lowering the mortgage costs, bridging the affordability gap and activating supply on existing planning permissions.</p> <p>There is a new affordable purchase scheme with the State directly building affordable homes at scale on State-owned land.  There is a retained and expanded help-to-buy scheme and our first ever national cost rental scheme with tenants getting keys this year, 2021.  Today's Bill is an important part of those measures that has the dual goals of fully utilising State-owned lands to tackle the housing crisis and leading in strategic planning to build affordability into our housing system.</p> <p> I will address both legitimate concerns and unfounded criticisms around the Bill to dispel any uncertainty and directly tackle any misinformation.  Our politics needs to be better and our citizens deserve more than tired dogmas and empty slogans.</p> <p> One is that the Land Development Agency will pay market value for State land which will drive up house prices.  This is not true.  The LDA will pay the affordable land value, not the full market value.  The value is effectively set by the Minister for Housing, Local Government, and Heritage, which is me, by requiring a specific percentage of land to be used for affordable housing at prices the Minister will also set.  The State bodies and agencies covered by this affordability requirement process are set in the Schedules to the Bill.  The Valuation Office sets the specific price based on that affordability process.  In Dublin city, for example, I expect this to be 100% social and affordable, so the land price will be minimal.  The market value process in the Bill is in keeping with EU state aid requirements but it is fundamentally shaped by the affordability requirement.  It is important to note that often land will not be transferred to the LDA at all as it will develop it on behalf of councils or other State agencies.  I expect this to often be the case with local authorities as we can already see in Shanganagh and other sites under the control of the Land Development Agency.</p> <p> Another criticism has been that the Bill is the same as the 2019 version.  It is not.  This Bill reflects the priorities for the LDA in the new programme for Government and also takes into account the report and recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the initial general scheme of the Bill in the last D&aacute;il.  There are a number of key changes to the original land development agency Bill published in 2019 and I will cover some now.  There is a complete flexibility on affordability requirement with 100% social and affordable in suitable areas.  The original Bill fixed it at 40% with 60% private.  There will be clarity on transfer of State lands and first refusal for the LDA in this Bill but it was not in the 2019 Bill.  There are clear compulsory purchase order powers in this Bill but there were none in 2019 Bill.  In this Bill, the LDA is subject to freedom of information and enhanced Oireachtas committee accountability, an important measure which was not included in 2019 Bill.  There is a stronger commitment to sustainable communities and best environmental practice.  There is greater clarity on EU state aid compliance.</p> <p> Another criticism has been that just 50% of developments will be affordable and the LDA is backdoor to privatisation.  This is completely untrue.  The 50% is a baseline requirement in the Bill to act as a guide.  The Minister has full flexibility to set affordability to up to 100% affordable and social.  Rather than apply a rigid one-size-fits-all approach to everywhere, this flexibility helps to future proof the Bill and gives me and any future Minister the scope to adapt to the specific needs and circumstances of an area.  In cities like Dublin I expect it will be 100% affordable and social but in some regional towns it might be more suitable to allow for private development to ensure tenure mix.  We need real affordability and flexibility for local needs, not old, untrue privatisation slogans pretending to be policies.</p> <p> Another claim is that there is a weak definition of affordability in the Bill that will drive up prices.  That is not true.  The Bill defines affordability as being below the median market rate.  This broad definition is in place to allow me to set specific rates for each geographic area by regulations.  This means the Minister sets out what is an affordable price to buy or rent based on each area.  This flexibility will accommodate local needs and is a key feature of the Bill rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.  It also ensures future changes do not need to be made via a slow legislative process.</p> <p> Another comment made is that the LDA is bypassing local councils to get council land.  That is not true at all.  The first refusal for the LDA would only arise where the local authority has decided not to develop the lands for its own functions.  Section 183 of the Local Government Act will not apply to avoid duplication of processes arising which could delay the delivery of homes on local authority lands.  Section 183 remains in place for all other land disposals.  Bypassing section 183 will only be used in limited circumstances where agreement on lands is not possible.  The majority of the LDA's work will be in co-operation with local authorities, which will maintain a central role in delivering housing.  This is an important point.  Local authorities will remain at the heart of providing homes it is my intention that the LDA will complement that work by providing services to build large, complex sites.  I understand concerns about this provision and will review it annually to ensure it is working as required to speed up delivery but I am committed to avoiding delays and getting homes built.</p> <p> Ultimately, the heart of this Bill is about ensuring that State lands do not lie idle in the middle of a housing crisis.  That is something that all of us should be able to agree on.  It is incorrect to state that the Bill has weak compulsory purchase orders powers that will undermine its strategic land management role.  The Bill includes ransom strip compulsory purchase order powers unlike the original Bill, which had no such measures.  This will allow the LDA to negotiate with landowners where necessary and to force compliance with its strategic plans should that be required.  The CPO powers are in keeping with EU State aid rules and best European practice of similar agencies elsewhere, such as Freiburg in Germany that only uses compulsory purchase order powers in extreme circumstances.  As the National Economic and Social Council has noted in its comprehensive work on the need for a Land Development Agency, the possibility of compulsory purchase order use is generally a sufficient basis to encourage negotiation and agreement between landowners.</p> <p> It is not true that the LDA and its subsidiaries are not accountable or transparent.  The LDA will be fully accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, and will be subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  The LDA's board will be recruited through the State boards process and the board members will have the required mix of qualifications.  The accounts of the LDA and its subsidiaries will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its records will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  Prior ministerial consent will be required for the LDA to borrow, establish subsidiaries or enter into capital commitments.  There is provision for ministerial direction to the LDA regarding strategic priorities.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to extend the Register of Lobbying.  It is my intention that the chief executive of the LDA and his or her senior executives would be designated public officials under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, when the register is extended.</p> <p> I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  There are 10 parts to the Bill.  Part 1, preliminary and general provisions, sets out the purpose of the Bill as well as providing key definitions for the Bill.  Section 2 outlines the purposes of the Bill which in summary are to increase the supply of housing in the State.  Section 4 provides the definition of relevant public lands and relevant public bodies which are key definitions for this legislation.  Relevant public land is all land in a town with a population greater than 10,000 that is owned by a relevant public body.  A relevant public body is a body listed in either Schedule 1 or 2 of this Bill.  This part also provides that the Minister can issue directions to the LDA regarding the performance of its functions.</p> <p> Part 2 deals with the establishment of the LDA as a designated activity company under the Companies Act.  It will also facilitate a &euro;1.25 billion equity investment in the LDA from the NTMA's Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  This Part also deals with the establishment of the board, appointment of the CEO and staffing matters.  Section 13 sets out the functions of the LDA.  The main function of the LDA is to develop and manage relevant public land and, where applicable, other lands for the provision of housing for the public good and in the public interest.</p> <p>Section 14 provides that the LDA will provide services to local authorities when requested by such authorities to assist in the development of large-scale multi-tenure sites for housing and urban developments in population centres of more than 30,000 people.  This will assist with the construction of increased amounts of affordable and social housing on local authority-owned sites and underpins the strong collaborative working which we have already seen between the Land Development Agency and local authorities to date.</p> <p> Sections 17 and 18 provide that the LDA will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Oireachtas.  This is important as it will ensure transparency and accountability regarding the work of the LDA.</p> <p> Section 20 deals with the staffing of the agency and also provides for the making of a superannuation scheme by the LDA.</p> <p> Part 3 deals with the funding of the LDA.  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 will be amended to provide for the capitalisation of the agency through an equity investment from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, of up to &euro;1.25 billion.  The LDA will also be able to engage in borrowing up to a limit of &euro;1.25 billion.  Ministerial consent will be required for that LDA borrowing.  The initial shareholding in the LDA will be &euro;100 million, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform holding shares to the value of &euro;99 million and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage holding shares with a value of &euro;1 million.  Part 3 also provides that the LDA will not be able to enter into capital commitments above a certain level without ministerial consent.</p> <p> Part 4 provides that the LDA will be able to form subsidiary designated activity companies, DACs, for the purposes of carrying out its functions.  These subsidiaries will be subject to the same level of governance and accountability as the LDA parent company and their published accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The formation and winding-up of such subsidiaries will require the consent of both the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in addition to the ministerial consents for borrowings and capital commitments by the LDA and its subsidiaries.</p> <p> Part 5 deals with the dissolution of the existing LDA and the transfer of its functions to the new entity.  Part 6 deals with financial reporting and the public accountability of the LDA.  The accounts of the LDA and its subsidiaries will be prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  The LDA will also submit an annual report to the Minister for the group entity, including any subsidiaries.</p> <p> Part 7 deals with the establishment of a public lands register and arrangements for the acquisition of land by bodies to the LDA.  Sections 48 and 49 provide that the LDA will establish a register of relevant public land to identify land in urban population centres of over 10,000 people that may be suitable for housing.  This register will be publicly available on the LDA's website.  Public bodies will be required to co-operate with the LDA and the LDA will be able to request information from such public bodies in respect of relevant public land.</p> <p> Section 50 provides that the LDA will report periodically to the Government with regard to land on the register and will include information on such lands assessed by the LDA to be fit for use for the purposes of this Act.  Under section 52, the Government, having considered such a report, can direct that land of a Schedule 1 public body can be acquired by the LDA.  Section 51 provides that where a relevant public body is seeking to dispose of land it must offer it for sale to the LDA in the first instance.</p> <p> Section 53 provides that where the LDA is acquiring land from relevant public bodies under this Part, it will be acquired at market value, taking into account the fundamental requirement regarding the development of houses on public lands under Part 9.  In effect this is an affordable land value which in reality will be a minimal price.  Section 56 provides that where the LDA is acquiring land from a local authority under this Part, the provisions of section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 will not apply.</p> <p> Part 8 deals with compulsory purchase powers for the LDA.  It is intended that the LDA will primarily purchase private lands for site assembly purposes through agreement with landowners.  This Part provides that the LDA will have appropriate compulsory purchase order powers to purchase ransom strips of land where required for the purposes of its public functions.</p> <p> Part 9 deals with the provision of affordable housing on relevant public land and former relevant public land.  There will be a requirement for a proportion of housing provided on relevant public land to be made available for affordable housing by the agency or any other developer acquiring such land.  Under section 73, the Government may exempt certain relevant public lands from these provisions where the land is owned by a body that is required to act in a commercial manner.</p> <p> Section 75 provides that the Minister may set a percentage of housing higher or lower than the 50% level as set out in section 73 and may also set different percentages for different geographical or administrative areas, having regard to a range of housing-related matters and the achievement of the purposes of the Act.  This will allow the percentage to be varied up or down to take account of local housing needs and market conditions.</p> <p> Section 76 provides that houses provided under this Part shall be priced below the prevailing market price or market rent.  It also provides that the Minister may prescribe a price or method for calculating the price and may set different prices for different geographical or administrative areas.</p> <p> Part 10 deals with amendments to other Acts, including adding the LDA to the list of State bodies empowered to act as a development agency under the Planning Acts, which will permit it to develop planning schemes and enter into agreements with parties to develop strategic development zones.  It does not confer any planning consent role on the LDA.  This Part also provides that freedom of information legislation will fully apply to the LDA from the day of its establishment and also provides that records held by the dissolved LDA body will continue to be subject to such legislation.  This will ensure the transparency of the LDA's operations.</p> <p> Every Deputy is keenly aware of the scale of the crisis that confronts us.  This is a state stepping up the mark.  We have a moral obligation to put in place practical policies.  We cannot let ideology get in the way of solutions or let one party's perfect be the enemy of the common good.  I have directly addressed the criticisms of the Bill as best I can.  I am confident that the LDA can play a major role in getting affordable and social homes built on State-owned land that is currently not in use.  I call on all Deputies to support the Bill and to make sure we use every tool at our disposal to get bricks and mortar on the ground.</p> <p> I look forward to our debate on the Bill.  I hope Deputies will appreciate its importance and the need to enact it as soon as possible.  I am sure they will.  I will seek to respond to any specific questions and engage further on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700049#WW00200"><p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Gould.  A deceit is beginning to creep into a part of our debate on housing which suggests that the policy of the new Government is in some way different from that of its predecessor.  In fact, when one looks at the evidence it is very clear that we are seeing more of the same.  Budget 2021 was a clear example.  There was just an extra &euro;124 million for an additional 593 social houses above the existing Fine Gael commitments and a paltry &euro;35 million extra for 390 extra cost-rental homes.  No extra funding was provided for the serviced sites fund.  The &euro;50 million in pre-announced funding allocated for this year will only deliver 90 genuinely affordable homes for working people to purchase.  The direct total spend on the direct delivery of affordable homes by the Government this year is only &euro;85 million.  That is in stark contrast to the total spend by the Government this year on initiatives that are essentially developer or landlord supports, which is in excess of &euro;1 billion.  This means that 11 times more is allocated to private sector-led initiatives than to the State, through its agencies, to directly deliver affordable homes for working people.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Bill 2020, with which the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently dealing, is in a similar vein.  Although some aspects, such as the serviced sites fund and cost-rental housing, are welcome, they are not the initiatives of this Government but initiatives which have had a long, slow and, at times, painful gestation.  It is interesting that almost half of the money that will be spent this year on the mechanisms outlined in the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 are to be spent on private sector supports as against the direct delivery of genuine social and affordable homes.  Just as those private sector-led initiatives failed under the last Government, so they will fail under this one.  The Land Development Agency is filled with those problems.  The Minister is right; as I have written on many occasions, his Bill includes substantial textual changes to the first Fine Gael general scheme.</p> <p>The fundamental flaws which were identified in the Fine Gael predecessor Bill and which were outlined in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government remain in this legislation.</p> <p> It is not true for the Minister to say that somehow this is not undermining local authorities.  That is exactly what it is doing.  If we had a local authority-led approach to public housing delivery, we would not have a Land Development Agency.  We would be funding, staffing and supporting those local authorities to deliver the social and affordable homes families want.</p> <p> The Minister is correct that there will be sites that have 100% social and affordable housing and I will discuss one of those in a moment.  I am not convinced, however, that we are not going to see large volumes of public land used for unaffordable open market priced homes.  In fact, the core delivery mechanism of the Land Development Agency, once it moves beyond a small number of local authority-owned sites, will be joint ventures through subsidiary designated activity companies, DACs, with private equity investors and private developers.  For them to be involved and to bring cash to the table, they are going to want the profit returns of unaffordable open market prices, such as we have seen, controversially, in O'Devaney Gardens and the deal, thankfully rejected by Dublin City councillors, on Oscar Traynor Road.</p> <p> The core problem of the joint venture model is that it pushes up development costs and prices, affecting not only the open market priced homes but, crucially, the so-called affordable homes which I will come back to a moment.</p> <p> This is the central flaw of the agency.  I dispute the Minister&rsquo;s contention that this Bill deals with the substantive concerns of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage through pre-legislative scrutiny.  A small number of these concerns have been dealt with but the majority have not.  I am reminded of the description of the Land Development Agency by the now Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, when he was a member of the joint committee as the lead Opposition spokesperson, when he rightly criticised it as a "Del Boy" model and indicated his party would not be supporting it unless there was profound change.  To mix my metaphors slightly, the Minister is increasingly looking like Arthur Daley, trying to sell a clapped-out second-hand Fine Gael car with a lick of paint but with the same dodgy engine.</p> <p> Two examples are a case in point.  Shanganagh Castle in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area is the first.  In 2017, councillors from all parties in that local authority unanimously agreed for a public housing development on that land comprising 597 social, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes.  The problem was that the Government at the time refused to fund it.  The land, in fact, sat idle not because the councillors did not want it developed but because Government refused to support it.  Only in 2020, as a result of Fine Gael pushing the Land Development Agency, was a planning application submitted, albeit by the council and not the LDA.  Construction will commence this year, although, unfortunately, rents will be beyond the reach of many working people, which will be &euro;1,000 for a one-bed unit and up to &euro;1,300 for a three-bed unit.  Single people and couples on modest incomes will still find that a struggle to pay.  We still do not know what the house prices will be.  The LDA cannot tell councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council what the price will be and the tragedy of Shanganagh is that if the Government had funded it when the councillors unanimously agreed to move ahead, it would have proceeded and families would be living in homes today that would have been eminently more affordable than what is on the table.</p> <p> In the same local authority area we have the former Dundrum Central Mental Hospital, now called Dundrum Central which has the potential for 1,300 homes.  It is HSE land currently being managed, as far as I understand, by the Office of Public Works.  Unless the Minister can confirm to us today, and if he does I will be very glad to hear it, I do not believe that this will be a 100% social and affordable housing development.</p> <p> If one looks at the affordability definition in the Minister&rsquo;s Bill, it has to be something lower than the median price at a particular location.  What was the median price at the end of last year for a two-bedroom apartment in that specific location?  It was &euro;557,900.  The Minister is correct, and I will talk about this in a moment, that the LDA will pay the market value, depending on what that is going to be on the site.  The real issue, however, is that will be more than the existing use value before the LDA became involved.  It is hard to see, let alone with the unaffordable open market priced homes, that if this site is developed, even with these affordable houses, how it will be made affordable.</p> <p> That is why I think this is the wrong approach.  We have mechanisms to deliver public housing on public land.  They have existed for a century and when they were funded, supported and staffed by Government, they did a good job.  They are called councils and we should return to that model.</p> <p> I will run through a number of key problematic aspects of the Bill.  I will take issue with the Minister&rsquo;s presentation of those, and we can take that discussion further.  Part 4 of the Bill not only sets up the LDA as a designated activity company, DAC, but specifically allows for the creation of subsidiary DACs.  These will be joint ventures, sometimes between different public agencies and the LDA.  Others will be between equity investors and developers.  They will not be subject to Freedom of Information Act, FOI, requests.  The very final section of the Bill does not make reference to the subsidiary DACs and unless that is amended, it is a glaring omission.  While they will be subject to the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is not in the same way as with NAMA.  These are look-back audits and investigations which do not provide adequate transparency or accountability in real-time.  They will also not be subject in the same way that local authorities are to the public spending code or to the lobby register.  I am so concerned about the lack of accountability and transparency that today I launched a transparency initiative called LDA-watch to provide greater public access to information about this project.</p> <p> Section 53 deals with market value.  The Minister is right that what will happen is that land will be sold at the market value for the use that it is going to be put to and if there is a percentage of social or affordable housing, that will affect the value.  Likewise, if there is a percentage of open market, that will also affect the value.  What the Minister did not tell Deputies is that this value will still be higher than the existing use value of that land which sits on the books of the existing State agency.  The LDA will be paying more for that land than the value of the land on the books of the agency that is disposing of it.  That will have an inflationary impact on the value of land, will push up development costs and will result in increased prices both on the so-called affordables as well as on the unaffordable open market prices.  That is why Deputies in the Minister&rsquo;s own party are deeply concerned by this.</p> <p> Section 56, which is the stripping of section 183 powers from local councillors, is an appalling attack on democracy.  We know what it is for.  There will be occasions where central Government and the LDA will want access to certain local authority land but because councillors will be unhappy at the price to be paid to rent or buy in those developments, they will want the council to develop it.  This is a mechanism of denying councillors the right to be able to say in respect of public land, such as Oscar Traynor Road, that not only must it be 100% public but that the affordable rental and purchase must be genuinely affordable for working people.  This is removing a key power of local councillors and, I suspect, it is not just with an eye to the Oscar Traynor Road lands but also to the local authorities lands in Limerick and elsewhere.</p> <p> On the section 59 compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers, the Minister is factually incorrect.  When we had a presentation on the general scheme of the Bill from the Department officials when this was a Fine Gael Bill, we were told very clearly that there would be limited CPO powers for the non-commercial aspects of the LDA and that these would be ransom strip powers.  All the agencies supporting active land management, from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to the Housing Agency say that it must have full comprehensive CPO powers and it does not.  It has the same limited powers NAMA had and that were in the original general scheme, which means it will not have the crucial active land management function intended in the first instance.  It will also have no negotiating power when seeking to access land and will only be able to develop such land in partnership with the State agency itself.</p> <p> The single biggest weakness in this Bill, and this is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien and Fianna F&aacute;il because this is their inclusion in the Bill, is that for the first time in the history the State we have a definition of affordability.  In fact, the word &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; is referred to in this Bill probably more than any other.  The problem is that the definition is absolutely meaningless because, as the Minister said, the definition in section 76 is below the prevailing market price to buy or rent.  To buy means below the median purchase price of a new home.  That would mean a price of &euro;460,000 in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency last year, with the average rent in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, index of &euro;1,800.  If we pass this Bill, anything below that which is decided by the Minister will be legally defined as affordable.  That is an absolute travesty.</p> <p>We should not be linking our definitions of affordability to market prices, but to the ability of working people to pay a fair rent or a fair price to purchase.  Section 77 of this Bill gives the LDA development agency status and the power to draft and submit proposals for strategic development zones, SDZs, subject to the approval of such designations by the Minister.  There is a complete bypassing of the local authorities, however, which could choose to go to the board.  Local authority-led strategic development zone processes are more democratic and transparent and produce a better result.  That is not the outcome of anything in this proposal.</p> <p> Before I hand over to Deputy Gould, I must say I always find it amusing when the Minister laments the decline in home ownership.  Governments led by his party, particularly during the years of the Celtic tiger era, oversaw the most dramatic decline in home ownership because of the way in which our housing system was managed.  That decline slowed somewhat but continued under governments led by Fine Gael.  Nothing in this Bill convinces me that trend is going to be in any way reversed.  Equally, I find it ironic when I hear the Minister talking about the housing crisis as if it is some force of nature and not something which he and his colleagues created when they were last in government and have tacitly supported through confidence and supply over the last four years.</p> <p> The reality is that there is a better approach.  Let us transform the LDA into a powerful and active land management agency with real CPO powers, a real budget and whole-of-Government support to use our public lands to the best strategic purpose.  The LDA should not be involved in residential development, however.  That aspect should be the responsibility of our local authorities, based on local need and local democratic decisions.  If the Government wants to increase the supply of housing, it should not waste its time with the LDA.  It should double capital investment in public housing on public land and deliver the 20,000 social and affordable homes promised in the election manifesto last year, but which it has since abandoned.  In the context of Covid-19, the Government should focus on increasing the building of turnkey housing and ensuring developments like that on Oscar Traynor Road are fully public, social and affordable and led by our local authorities.  They did that in the past and they can do it again in the future.</p></speech>

The Minister is making comments about the site now, but if he wants to know the real facts of the situation he should know that for 20 years this site has lain idle under governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  If I had received the support of the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael eight years ago when I sought the development of this site, we would now have houses on it and people living there.</p>  <p>  The whole issue with the LDA, this Minister and this Government is that they have failed to support local authorities and to invest in building houses.  I live in Gurranabraher, which is a housing estate built by Cork City Council some 80 years ago.  We know many such estates were built by local authorities around this State.  This Minister and this Government, however, now want to take the power away from the local authorities.  I welcome the development of the St. Kevin's site, but I want to see that development undertaken for social, affordable and affordable cost rental housing to allow people, especially those with young families, to have a start to buy a home.  I say that because the housing crisis in Cork is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage yesterday, I asked a question about the expected affordable rates for the cost rental housing at the St. Kevin's site.  I was told those rates would be between &euro;900 and &euro;1,100.  I will explain to the Minister that most of the people whom I know in Cork looking for affordable rental housing will not find those rates for one-bedroom and two-bedroom housing to be affordable.  I listened with interest to the Minister when he said that we must build sustainable and safe communities for people.  We all have that aspiration and we want it to happen, but then I look at the LDA's non-existent public consultation.  To educate the Minister a bit, the St. Kevin's site in Cork has only one entrance and exit, no access to public transport, no cycle lanes, and no investment in infrastructure, and that is because the community I represent in Cork North Central has been disadvantaged for years by governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.</p>  <p>  If we are going to undertake this development, let us do it right by putting in the infrastructure and making the resulting housing provision truly affordable.  I say that because we were told at the presentation I attended that up to 40% of the site could be private housing.  We want details and clarity regarding how much social, affordable and affordable cost rental housing will actually be delivered.  I fail to understand why there is so much secrecy and why this information will not come out until after the planning permission has been approved.  The Minister talked about transparency.  How can we have transparency in a process when we will not find out the details until after the planning permission has been approved?</p>  <p>  Turning to other issues I want to raise, the Minister talked about local government.  This Bill will remove powers from local government and from democratically elected councillors of all parties and none.  Those councillors were given a mandate and it must be respected.  Local government powers have been eroded under this and previous governments and this endeavour is only more proof of that happening.  I believe that local authorities are the bodies which should build social and affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  We are in the middle of a crisis where people are looking for hope.  People want to see light at the end of the tunnel.  I want to support a Government which will bring that about, but I do not think that the Minister is doing that and I know this Government is not.  People need hope.  I have been sending emails regarding the details involved in this initiative back and forth to the Land Development Agency for several weeks.  I have been seeking even an estimate of how many social and affordable houses will be delivered.  I conclude by stating the housing crisis needs innovative and ambitious solutions, but the LDA has not delivered one house yet and I do not believe that this Bill will speed things up.  We must build houses now and invest in people.</p></speech>

Significant aspects of the Bill are to be commended, but other elements act as red flags and present a considerable challenge to us in the Labour Party as to whether we ultimately feel that this Bill will be fit for purpose.  I hope the Government will take the opportunity to listen to our constructive criticism of the Bill, as well as accepting our support for aspects of it, and will use this debate as an opportunity to consider how best we can collectively amend the Bill so that we can legislate for an LDA which will do what the people of Ireland need it to do.</p>  <p>  Let us remind ourselves of why we are here and what problem this Bill is intended to solve.  We are in the middle of a crisis involving housing, homelessness, social housing, rental affordability and unaffordable house prices, as the Minister knows.  Will this Bill help us to solve these problems?  Will this Bill help us to solve the housing crisis and to keep it solved?  We can break down that question into two main parts.  The first concerns whether we need an LDA.  The second part of the question then, if we agree that an LDA is needed, is if this Bill will deliver the LDA we need.</p>  <p>  The answer to the first part of the question is yes, we need an LDA.  The concept of an LDA is a good one.  The former Deputy, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, proposed a development bank to develop public housing on public land.  This structure subsequently became known as a land development agency and is Labour Party policy.  There is a large amount of public land, and a properly constituted LDA could help the State to utilise that land to provide an increased supply of public housing and create a mechanism for proactive management of the State&rsquo;s land to help to solve the housing crisis and deliver more social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The next question is whether this Bill gives us an LDA which will clear the social housing lists, lower private rents and increase the supply of houses that people can afford to buy.</p> <p>The answer to that question, with the Bill as it currently stands, is maybe.  In truth the effectiveness of the Bill will be entirely dependent upon the policy of the Minister of the day and his or her Department, whoever that may be.  And therein lies the reason for concern.</p> <p> We have serious concerns that there is a real danger under this Bill that the LDA could end up as a mechanism for the wholesale privatisation of large tranches of public land with a subsequent windfall profit for private agents while delivering only a bare minimum of 10% public housing and only 40% of moderately discounted housing  labelled &ldquo;affordable&rdquo;, with the remainder sold at a price the market will bear.</p> <p> An example of this concern in the Bill is at section 73, which seems to guarantee that 50% of the housing will be affordable, but actually provides no such guarantee because section 75 states that the Minister may set a percentage of housing higher or lower than that set out in section 73 and can also set different percentages for different geographical or administrative areas.  Essentially, the seeming protections in the Bill of the 50% affordable housing aspect provide no such protection.</p> <p> The second area of concern is the concept of market value of the land and the subsequent price paid for the housing built on it.  The Bill mentions the concept of market value but the CEO of the LDA, Mr. John Coleman, has told the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that &ldquo;the land will transfer at a value, taking account of the affordability requirement.  Effectively, the value will be reduced to facilitate the delivery of affordable accommodation on the land.&rdquo;  So, we have a mechanism where land can be acquired at anything down to zero cost, depending on the project.  Section 53 of the Bill provides that where there is a dispute, &ldquo;The Minister shall prescribe the manner in which the market value of relevant public land shall be determined".</p> <p> Another concern is in section 76 which states that any housing prescribed under section 73 must be below the prevailing market price or market rent, but it makes no prescription as to how far below the market price or rent the housing will be.  </p> <p> In section 55 we have a provision for disposal of land by the agency, again  with ministerial consent, where it "is no longer required by it for those purposes or the performance of those functions."  Presumably this is when the houses are built or no more houses will be built.  It is presumed that the agency will make disposals to the private sector including but not limited to private individuals and commercial entities as well as to local authorities, approved housing bodies and other public bodies.</p> <p> What we have here is a series of provisions that allow the agency to acquire land at prices to be effectively determined by the Minister, to deliver a level of social and affordable housing determined by the Minister, and then to dispose of much of this housing to private entities, again at prices approved by the Minister.  This is an extraordinary level of power.  It is a power to deliver housing for the public good, but also the power to deliver a considerable transfer of value from public to private ownership in deals that will have no remedy until after the fact.</p> <p> Effectively, the LDA is there to create deals that deliver housing.  In discussing the Bill, we need to ask ourselves what level of scrutiny there is on these deals?  When we look at it, beyond the Minister, there is a serious lack of democratic accountability.  We find that far from adding control or checkpoints to the process the Bill explicitly removes the role of local authorities in scrutinising any of these deals regarding land acquired from the councils.  This removes a level of public scrutiny at a crucial stage in any project on local authority land.  At no point in the process does anyone outside the agency, the Minister and the Department get to scrutinise these deals end to end to ensure a sense check on whether we are delivering value for the people from public landbanks.  These are landbanks that were explicitly protected by the Labour Party from the planned privatisation by Fine Gael after the 2011 election.</p> <p> This deficit of scrutiny brings us to the nub of the matter.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are two parties with a long history of delivering for the private sector.  In Fianna F&aacute;il in particular we have a party whose toxic relationship with private interests in this sector crashed the economy, collapsed the housing industry and destroyed capacity to build houses, resulting in the current drastic undersupply.</p> <p> Part of the function of a land development agency is to try to break the boom and bust cycle by providing a steady predictable stream of projects on land it has acquired and a steady stream of public housing to act as an anchor against future housing bubbles.  In an ideal world one would not need to involve the private sector in the delivery of these houses.  In the short to medium term, however, some level of private sector involvement is inevitable.</p> <p> The local authorities have been at the receiving end of a lot of the blame for the failure of the State to build adequate public housing.  The truth is that the local authorities have long since been removed from any real decision-making power or capacity over public housing and we have a Department that has been institutionally reluctant to support any large direct local authority building on public land.  Fine Gael took strategic housing development legislation, apparently almost verbatim, from the vested interests.  The Minister will excuse me if I suggest that such a massive change in the way we manage public land, and particularly local authority land, will require a great deal more democratic scrutiny than is currently provided for in this Bill.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to fix loopholes in this Bill.  As it stands, there is a serious concern that these loopholes could facilitate a wholesale rip-off of the public sector by private interests at the whim of any Minister who has been captured by private housing interests.  I am seriously concerned about the absence of approval by democratically elected bodies such as the D&aacute;il or local authorities.  This need not be the case.  As the work progresses it will be inevitable that a few standard templates will emerge.  While the first few deals may attract considerable attention, as time goes on a level of standardisation will hopefully emerge and analysis of the success and failure of previous projects will allow for a relatively easy and public process of evaluation.</p> <p> We have discussed how the Bill provides for the acquisition, development and disposal of public land, but just as important for the long-term success of the agency will be the acquisition of additional private land.  The LDA will have the power to acquire private land at scale again at market value.  With a bit of imagination the Bill could provide an opportunity to deliver on the recommendations of the Kenny report to allow land to be acquired at a current use value rather than at inflated speculative prices.  In order to be truly successful, the LDA will need to be able to acquire land to be developed at reasonable costs and for us no longer to be dependent upon the whims of private entities.  This is a missed opportunity to provide a mechanism to make redundant the tactics of speculative acquisition, hoarding and flipping of sites by companies who make planning applications but never build houses and whose only objective is to create an artificial shortage of suitable sites that they can exploit through inflated sale prices.  This is the very issue that caused the last housing bubble and crash and if we are not careful it will also cause the next.</p> <p> We are in favour of a land development agency with significant power to acquire public and private land with the express intention of working in partnership with local authorities to deliver public housing on public land.  We want a far tighter definition of what success looks like and a far tighter scrutiny of the value delivered on an ongoing basis, and we need far tighter democratic protection from the exploitation of the agency for the private sector at the instigation of the Minister.</p> <p> Ultimately the success of the Bill will depend on whether we get enough social houses built to start clearing our housing lists and will depend on whether we get rents down to levels that mean we no longer waste billions of euro on short-term private rental at exorbitant rates.  The success of the Bill will depend on whether the houses built are not just technically &ldquo;affordable houses&rdquo; or technically &ldquo;cost rental&rdquo; houses but are houses people can actually afford to buy or rent, and that we do it without pouring public cash without scrutiny into the bank balances of private entities.  The best way to prevent the housing scandal of the future is to legislate now for the proper scrutiny of the key decisions that are made by the LDA as they are being made.</p></speech>

We need to be real about what has happened in this State in the past so that we can make the right decisions now.  I would absolutely challenge what Sinn F&eacute;in has said about houses, the private sector and local authorities.  The fact is, that between 2011 and 2017 NAMA offered 6,640 houses to local authorities up and down country.  These houses were built and empty and ready for occupation but the local authorities just took 2,500 of them and rejected all the rest.  In Dublin alone, the four local authorities were offered 2,000 fully completed homes.  They took 776 of these, which was 38%.  The 12,024 houses that were offered to the Dublin local authorities then went to the exact people the Deputies are talking about, to the vulture funds and to those who exploit the people who live in the houses now.  That is the reality of what has happened in the past.  Local authorities did not step up to the mark and they did not do the job.  They did not have the capacity to do their job in most parts of the country.  This legislation will aggregate all the land that local authorities and State bodies have and it will consider areas of population greater than 30,000, specifically, to say "What can we do, how can we effect change, how can we make sure this land is built on, and how do we make sure we meet the needs of our communities?"  Yes, of course we need affordable housing and social housing.</p> <p>We need to look at people who are earning but cannot get into the market because properties in the city centre are occupied by wealthy people, bankers, those working for vulture funds and so on.  The Land Development Agency should build homes and apartments in cities and major town centres for teachers garda&iacute;, nurses and other middle income people who can go in there if they have the qualification and if they are essential workers, because they cannot otherwise compete in the marketplace and they cannot pay the rents.  We should also look after them.  We need to ensure that we designate sites for them.  Apartments and appropriate supports should be in place for them.</p> <p> We also need to look after older people in our society.  The Land Development Agency should ideally get land that would suit older people and build energy-efficient housing to reduce their carbon footprint.  It needs to ensure that older people find it attractive to move from their existing homes, which are far too big for them in many cases, into smaller, more appropriate and better located properties.</p> <p> Considerable action is needed.  We need to end the diatribe against people who work to make a living.  If local authorities can work with people to reduce what the State must pay, why not work with private enterprise?  What is wrong with working together to reduce the cost for everybody?  That makes sense.  I will make a further contribution on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The Land Development Agency has one key priority which is to increase the supply of social, affordable and sustainable housing.  The agency will utilise State lands to build social and affordable housing while creating sustainable communities.  The agency is already working on nine sites across Ireland to develop 4,000 homes in co-operation with local authorities.</p>  <p>  Shanganagh in Shankill in my constituency is a perfect example of this where the Land Development Agency is working with the local authority there.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approved a partial transfer of land of the site to the LDA.  The Minister has now allocated &euro;18 million and almost 600 units will be delivered with planning permission already in place.  The development of that site is under way and we will see bricks and mortar very soon.  That site will contain 200 social homes, 91 houses for affordable purchase, and 306 cost rental units, which is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Based on what I have heard from constituents, they are eager to apply to the scheme.  They have heard about affordable housing for many years but have never been able to apply.  This unlocks that potential.  It is beyond me as to how anybody in this House could suggest they would not support affordable housing after spending years of talking about affordable housing.  These cost rental homes will provide an affordable option for people whose earnings are above the threshold for social housing support but who struggle to rent.  As the Minister has outlined in his contribution, those people, whom we have all met, are trapped in the rental market.</p>  <p>  For years those in Opposition parties have spoken about affordable housing and other housing solutions to assist garda&iacute;, retail workers and other workers, hard-working people who struggle to pay the existing rent for the houses they are in at the moment.  This project will deliver for workers, not only in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire but throughout Ireland.  The simple message from the people who attended meetings such as the one I hosted with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and councillors Justin Moylan and Michael Clarke is that they just want homes built.  They want practical solutions and an end to the endless ideological debates about housing.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency Bill is good news for people who are currently renting.  We need to provide a solution for those people.  We gave a commitment that we would do that, and this Bill does just that.  The Land Development Agency has long-term Government funding and access to State-owned lands and the industry experts to support such innovation.  Ultimately, it is about providing affordable and social homes for rent and purchase.  I welcome the Minister's clarification addressing genuine concern about the Bill.  I call on all Deputies to support the legislation and help to end the housing crisis.</p></speech>

Public homes should be built on public lands but at prices that are affordable to the public.  It is not a difficult idea to understand.  Local councils in the past built most of Dublin's houses and we need to get back to that.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in this model of delivering affordable housing for families.  We will not stand back and allow the Government sell off our public land to the highest bidder to build homes that no one can afford.</p>  <p>  My constituency of Dublin Bay North needs affordable housing.  Families are desperate and the Government is making it worse week by week.  The proposal for the Oscar Traynor Road was proof of that.  The original plan was to gift a huge parcel of public land to a developer to return an amount of public housing that was just not acceptable.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage needs to cop on and wake up.  The proposed houses would have been out of reach and totally unaffordable for constituents who grew up in the area, who have families in the area, who want to live in the area and who want to contribute to the great community I represent.  Councillors from all parties and none have now put forward a new proposal that has the support of the local people and will deliver affordable and cost rental houses for people in the area.</p>  <p>  The Government's policies are failing these people.  We need a step change.  The Minister needs to listen to the experts and take on board our constructive opinions and advice.  The ESRI believes that the shared equity scheme will increase house prices and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform shares that belief.  This is absolutely bonkers.  This housing crisis is not helping anyone and is making people desperate.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to work with the Minister to solve this crisis but he just will not listen.  He cannot keep dismissing us at every turn.  We are telling him about constituents who are asking us to plead with him that they want their families to live in these areas and that they want to put a roof over their heads.  If the Government cannot deliver on this, then the Minister will have failed and society will have failed.</p>  <p>  The Bill before the House will remove our local councillors' powers to vote against plans which they believe are not in the best interests of their communities.  This is not democratic.  It takes away local decision-making from those who know their areas best.  I cannot stress this enough.  This is an attack on all parties.  We do not believe the Bill will deliver affordable housing on public land.  The Minister still has not even told us what he believes the cost of an affordable home is, which in itself speaks volumes.</p></speech>

I would not say that except that a few weeks ago during questions and answers with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, he created a scene when one of the Opposition spokespeople left.  He seemed to think this was an incredible slight against him and against our Chamber.  It is ironic that he has left and will not hear directly the issues of concern that I want to raise.  I know a Minister of State is present, but to be fair to him, his responsibilities relate to heritage and biodiversity, and he does not have responsibility for housing.  Therefore, I believe it is appropriate to raise that matter.</p>  <p>  We need a strong Land Development Agency.  We need strong active land management and we need strong compulsory purchase order powers for that Land Development Agency to ensure we can build a good and consistent supply of affordable and social homes.  Unfortunately, this Bill fails to do this.  Once again, the Bill fails to provide the kinds of safeguards we need to ensure public lands will not end up in the hands of private developers.  In addition, there are no safeguards to ensure homes built on what are now public lands will not be sold off to international investment funds and real estate investment trusts, REITs.</p> <p>If the Minister is sincere in the comments he made at the start of the debate, and I have no reason to think he is not, he has the opportunity to bring forward amendments to this Bill, to change it, bring in safeguards and close down avenues for privatising public land, the selling of land and sales to international investment funds.  He can do that.  It is within his gift to address the concerns we have raised.  He said in his opening statement that this is not a back door to privatisation but he failed to give any meaningful assurances on that or any details of substance.  There needs to be actual action to close down those avenues in this Bill and to stop that happening.</p> <p> The Minister said that this is a different Bill from the Bill drafted by Fine Gael in 2019.  If it is a different Bill, why did we not get pre-legislative scrutiny on it?  He cannot have this both ways.  Either it is the same Bill and we do not need pre-legislative scrutiny or it is a different Bill, in which case why have we been denied pre-legislative scrutiny?  The Minister cannot have it both ways.</p> <p> I welcome the Minister's statement that lands owned by Dublin City Council will be public lands, and if acquired by the LDA or if there is LDA involvement, 100% affordable and social homes will be the outcome.  That is a very welcome commitment.  However, why is what is what is good enough for Dublin City Council not good enough for people in other areas of Dublin or, indeed, other areas of the country?  If the Minister feels there is a need for flexibility, why does he not set the baseline as 100% affordable and social homes with some element of flexibility or adjustment from that baseline?  Why set the baseline at just 50% affordable homes?</p> <p> Housing that is affordable to buy or rent remains beyond reach for many families.  During the election campaign this time last year, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, promised 50,000 direct build social homes and 50,000 direct build affordable homes.  Where are those homes?  We have been told by the Minister that we are only going to see 530 direct build affordable or cost rental homes this year.  That is just a 1% delivery of what he promised he would do in government.  Instead of getting those direct builds, there is an over-reliance on private developers, which build homes at costs that are simply out of reach for most people.  New homes provided by private developers are sold at about twice the build cost, with land, professional fees, levies, taxes and developers' margins and profits accounting for the rest of the costs.  Construction costs in Ireland are significantly higher than in other countries such as France and Germany.  In the Netherlands, for example, construction costs are 18% lower than in Ireland.  A key factor in home delivery in countries like the Netherlands is how they bank land and ensure that land is brought into the equation at low and affordable costs.  The model of relying solely on private developers and speculative development is a broken one.  It does not work and it is abundantly clear that we need a change in direction.</p> <p> We need to ask two key questions about this Bill.  First, who is writing housing policy in Ireland?  Second, who is benefiting from it?  In the shared equity loan proposal being put forward by the Government, as well as the previous Government's legislation around co-living and strategic housing developments, we have seen quite clearly the heavy influence from the construction industry and developers in how housing policy is written.  On the shared equity loan the Government is bringing in, a senior Government official recently stated, "The property industry want an equity scheme because it will increase prices".  Likewise, the ESRI has also critiqued the shared equity scheme.  In a report on de-democratising the Irish planning system, academics Dr. Mick Lennon of UCD and Dr. Richard Waldron of Queen's University Belfast claimed that lobbyists for the development industry played a key role in the creation of our strategic housing developments and housing policies.  With this Bill, we should be delivering affordable housing by cutting out developers' fees, profits and margins.  We should be tackling land costs and ending land speculation.  We should build housing that is affordable to buy or rent on public land and we should end the transfer of public land to private developers.  All those things could be done if the Government and the Minister wished to do them.</p> <p> One of the keys to ensuring the delivery of affordable homes is building up a sufficient pipeline of land that is suitable for development.  There are some good examples in other European countries of how land is strategically managed.  In Germany, the planning law freezes the value of land when the local municipality decides to designate an area for residential construction.  The municipality then acquires the land, produces a master plan for development, puts in the necessary infrastructure and uses the uplift from selling plots of land to pay for this investment.  There is almost no scope for individuals to profit from land speculation.  In the Netherlands, local municipalities have played a similar role in assembling land for development, which includes powers to use compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, to build up strategic land banks.  While they have these CPO powers, they often do not need to use them.</p> <p> In contrast, in Ireland, when a local authority rezones land, the landowner makes a windfall profit from changing the land from agricultural to residential use, often increasing the value of the land tenfold or even a hundredfold.  When the State invests in infrastructure to enable the delivery of homes on this land, the private landowner reaps the benefit of increased land values.  All of these increases in land values are reflected in the final price of a home.  This is why it is so important that this Bill should include compulsory purchase order powers.  Such powers were recommended before I was born, and probably before the Minister was born as well, in the Kenny report in 1973.  Yet, that system has still not been put in place and we do not have the strong CPO powers that are needed.  Instead, the Bill envisages a much more limited role for the Land Development Agency, focused on assembling land banks from existing State agencies and local authorities.</p> <p> The 2018 report on urban development land from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and its recent 2020 report on housing policy, are very strong on the need for CPO powers for the LDA.  It is not just the NESC that has said this, incidentally.  The programme for Government said so as well and committed to allocating proper CPO powers to the LDA.  Yet, such powers are effectively missing.  It will have powers around infrastructure and ransom strips but it is limited to that.  The role of the agency is, therefore, going to be very limited.  These powers are a key part of what we need in a strong and effective LDA to drive down the costs of housing and to make it much more affordable.</p> <p> In recent times, local councillors have correctly insisted that public land should be used only for the delivery of homes that are genuinely affordable and should not be sold on to private developers.  This Bill would strip councillors of the power to determine how land in the ownership of their local authority is best used and would allow the LDA to acquire council lands without the consent of local elected representatives, which is an attack on local democracy.  We have one of the weakest forms of local democracy in the western world, and if this Bill passes unamended, it will weaken local democracy even further.  To be fair, I do not think that is the intent of most Government Deputies or Ministers.  Most of them would recognise that we need to strengthen local democracy.  I ask them to reflect on that.  Not only would the Bill do that, it would also allow the LDA to flip these lands on to a third party and on to private developers, subject only to ministerial sign-off.  In many cases, these lands will then be developed through a company set up in partnership with the LDA and private developers.  This, again, is going to push up the cost of homes.</p> <p> The Association of Irish Local Government, which has members from across the political spectrum and all political parties, including Government parties, has said it has grave concerns about this Bill, particularly sections 49 and 56.  Let us make no mistake.  Local councillors are insisting that all their land that is suitable for housing should be used exclusively for social and affordable housing.</p> <p>If this Bill is passed unamended, the Minister with responsibility for housing will have the power to override that and their lands can be acquired through the LDA.  In this situation, part of that land can be used for full market price housing or sold.  Critically, in terms of affordable housing and how that is defined, that is a key flaw and weakness in this Bill.  We need housing that is set at a genuinely affordable rate and not at the definition of below full market rate, which is not a good enough definition and it will not work.  </p> <p> I will give an example of how affordable homes can be delivered.  I have heard others say that the delivery of affordable homes at prices which people on average incomes can genuinely afford is pie in the sky.  It can be done.  I refer to Dun Emer in Lusk, where Fingal County Council in partnership with the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance is delivering homes ranging from &euro;166,000 for a two-bedroom apartment to &euro;258,000 for a three-bedroom semi-detached home, with monthly mortgage repayments of &euro;698.57 for the apartment and &euro;1,085 for the house.  These are prices within the range of people on average incomes.  Critically, these are homes that are being delivered on public land.  Part of the reason this level of affordability is built into the scheme is that the development is on affordable land.  It could not be done by private developers or at full land prices.</p> <p> With the right level of ambition, the LDA could transform housing delivery in Ireland, ensuring that much-needed homes are provided at affordable prices.  This Bill will allow for privatisation through the back door and, therefore, will allow private developers to enrich themselves through the acquisition of public land.  Members need not take my word for this.  I ask them to listen to what Senator Michael McDowell had to say about it.  Senator McDowell's politics are different from mine and that is why I am quoting him.  He said: "All of the signs are that the Land Development Agency is mainly intended to facilitate the provision of existing publicly-owned land to private developers."  These views are held across the political spectrum.  </p> <p> This Bill is about building full market price unaffordable homes on public land at a time of a national housing crisis.  It specifically allows for this.  Section 27 allows for an upper ceiling of &euro;1.25 billion that may be borrowed by the Land Development Agency.  This is in addition to the &euro;1.25 billion capitalisation of the LDA, which equates to a maximum ceiling of &euro;2.5 billion.  This makes it impossible for the LDA to build up a strategic land bank pipeline of land and to build it out at the same time on the scale that is needed.  This means there will have to be substantial private sector involvement and transfer of land to private developers.  This will push up the cost of homes delivered.  Section 29 specifies that funding can be made available to the agency from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  As we all know, ISIF has a commercial mandate and will be seeking commercial returns on its investments.  This, again, will push up the price of housing, making it less affordable.</p> <p> A key weakness of this Bill is that it provides no protections against homes built on public land being sold to REITs and international investment funds.  This will lead us into the absurd situation whereby we will be subsidising people on low incomes renting privately owned accommodation on public land on which only social and affordable homes should have been built.  We will be subsidising their insecure renting through HAP and subsidising private developers and investment funds.  It would be much better value for money to ensure in this Bill that only social and affordable homes can be built on public land.  This would also be much better for the individuals and families involved who then would be able to avail of long-term, secure social housing and the peace of mind that comes with that rather than the constant worry and threat of eviction into homelessness.</p> <p> Affordable homes delivered by private developers or the Land Development Agency acting with a commercial remit to maximise returns will result in these affordable homes being more expensive than they should be.  We are likely to see affordable homes delivered, albeit at a discount from the full market price, but not at a level within reach for many people on average incomes.  Make no mistake.  The Land Development Agency will facilitate the privatisation of public land through the backdoor.  This is being dressed up by the Minister as delivering affordable homes but it is an attempt to transfer public lands to developers, which will drive up the cost of homes built on public lands.  We need to break from the failed policies of the past that locked thousands of people out of secure and affordable housing.  It is telling that there are no protections in this Bill to stop REITs and institutional investors buying up to 40% of the homes built out on public lands.</p> <p> If the Government is serious about delivering affordable housing on public land, it should commit to amending this Bill to prohibit the sale of public land acquired by the LDA to private developers, guarantee that 100% of homes built on land acquired by the LDA will be either affordable or social housing and prevent the sale of homes built on public lands to REITs and institutional investors.  This Bill will ensure that developers continue to profit while families spend years living in box rooms.  It will mean that international investors are facilitated while people are driven into homelessness when they cannot afford the rent.  The deference to developers and international investors must stop.  It is time that we put the housing needs of people first.  </p> <p> A little over a year ago, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in opposition said the following about his predecessor, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar: "It's their wealthy friends they've prioritised to changing planning laws to have a situation where it's far more advantageous to have investor funds operating in this country."  We now have a Bill brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which does not protect us against international investment funds acquiring and buying up homes built on public lands.</p> <p> We need active land management, a Land Development Agency with strong, compulsory purchase powers and for affordable and social homes to be built on public lands.  Instead, we have a Bill that will enable lands to be taken from public bodies and flipped to private developers, allow many of the homes built on public lands to be sold on to international investors and REITs and envisages 40% of homes built on public lands to be built at full market price, which will be out of reach and unaffordable for a generation locked into paying exorbitant rents.  </p> <p> This Bill, if passed without amendment, will have consequences.  It will mean that we will not deliver affordable homes at the rates that we could.  This will be a lost opportunity and it will mean more people being pushed into homelessness.  We have a choice.  I ask the Government to listen to our concerns and amend this Bill.</p></speech>

Separately, I take this opportunity to welcome the establishment by the Minister of the working group to examine the issue of defective housing, which is an issue in my constituency.  As we all know, housing was a big issue in the general election held this time last year, particularly the provision of social and affordable housing.  The measures proposed in this Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 will ensure the provision of homes for affordable purchase, cost-rental and social housing.</p>  <p>  I would like to raise the situation regarding a site on the Oscar Traynor Road in Santry, Dublin.  Many people will know that last November Dublin city councillors voted against plans for 853 homes on this site despite the fact they had previously voted in favour of this scheme in general.  The arrangement with Glenveagh Homes would have seen the construction of 428 private houses, 253 social houses and 172 affordable houses.  The site has been idle for years, certainly since 1985 when I was first elected to Dublin City Council.</p> <p>The scheme was not ideal and the affordability of the proposed houses was an issue.  We now have another delay.  The pursuit of ideology by certain councillors is getting in the way of the practical provision of social and affordable housing.</p> <p> The area in question, which comes under Dublin City Council's area B, has the largest social housing list in the country.  I understand that a cross-party group of councillors has now come up with its own plans for the site.  The proposals are currently being assessed by Dublin City Council management and I wonder whether they are practical.  This scheme needs to be brought to finality and the houses must be built on the land.  A mixed-tenure development is required.  Ideally, it should be done by the council but, if that does not happen quickly, there could be a role for the LDA in co-operation with the council.  New measures provided for in this legislation and in the Affordable Housing Bill 2020 should be utilised to ensure that much-needed homes in this area are built without any further delay.  I hope the two Bills are enacted as soon as possible in order that people have the full details of the various schemes and can fill out application forms in their local authority.  At the moment, they are hearing about general plans and principles only.  They just want the Government to get on with the job.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that the LDA will have no role in regard to individual planning applications and that the existing arrangements will remain in place.  I am also glad that the strategic housing development provisions will not be renewed at the end of this year.  They have led to unsustainable planning in my area, including the construction of huge build-to-rent schemes.  Building and construction, which has been suspended because of the Covid-19 situation, must resume as soon as possible.  We need to start building houses.</p></speech>

It proposes to do so by bringing together stakeholders such as local authorities, housing agencies and voluntary groups to provide services to local authorities in order to assist them in the performance of their functions.  In doing so, it will provide more affordable housing for the tens of thousands of people left waiting following our economic collapse.</p>  <p>  The initial investment of more than &euro;1 billion under the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund offers a significant opportunity to change the landscape in terms of how we fund housing developments in this State.  We must be ambitious in our goals if we are to change some of the negative traits that have developed in the housing market in recent years.  I certainly hope the LDA can play an important role in that regard by providing a broad base of housing supply that will serve a wide range of people in our society and create the balance we wish to see within our communities.  The development of new housing stock should not fall victim to the mistakes of the past.  All developments must include adequate services and infrastructure that will meet the needs of those who reside there.</p>  <p>  The LDA can play a significant role in helping the national effort to reduce carbon emissions.  As noted in the programme for Government, the agency should be tasked with delivering low-carbon, sustainable and climate-resilient housing.  This will be key in our fight against climate change as we embark on the challenge to turn the tide of the looming climate catastrophe.  To emerge from this battle, we must face up to the need to change countless aspects of our lives and the system we rely upon, including how the State manages and delivers housing projects.  Last year saw many of us spend a lot of time in our homes.  This has highlighted the need for energy-efficient housing that uses heat and electricity effectively.  We should not see the requirements for affordability and efficiency in housing as mutually exclusive but, instead, as intrinsically linked.  I am confident that the LDA can make a positive contribution to this aspect of Irish housing provision in the future.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that concerns were raised in the course of committee hearings in 2019 regarding the forerunner to this Bill.  The rights of local authorities should be protected into the future, particularly with respect to non-residential land, unless otherwise requested by a local authority.  The balance between legislation we pass in this House and the power of local authorities is very important.  We must consider that balance carefully, particularly in regard to the use of public lands and how it affects communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to completing the major changes that were started in recent years within the housing market.  I acknowledge the point made by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that there are too many Members of this House who are too engaged in playing ideological football when it comes to housing, when the current national housing policy has, in fact, taken ideas from both their playbook and our own.  That should and must be acknowledged.  We all recognise the problems in the housing market and we all want the upcoming generations to have the ability to afford a home.  Efficient use of our public resources will be vital to the success or failure of our efforts to reach this goal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-02-17a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700056#DDD00300"><p>It is disappointing to see another housing measure that is based on the very conservative ideology of both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Unfortunately, it will fail to deliver social housing.  In reality, this legislation will increase house prices and push affordable homes further out of the reach of ordinary workers and families.  It is a Bill for developers.  There are serious problems in housing provision for workers and families whose income is just above the threshold for social housing but not high enough to enable them ever to get a mortgage from a bank or other lending institution.  Those people are trapped in private rental accommodation, without rent controls or security of tenure.  The Government's LDA will do little to resolve that issue and will, most likely, make it even worse.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight the land aggregation scheme, which currently manages five State-owned sites in County Laois alone.  There is a total of 40 acres suitable for housing under that scheme but the State has no plans in place to develop housing on those sites.  I note that the Government's Bill will only assist in the development of sites in areas with a population of more than 30,000.  That will exclude all of counties Laois and Offaly.  There has been much said about local authorities' ability to deliver.  Laois County Council, a small local authority, will house 150 families in new housing in the space of six or seven weeks.  This shows that even small local authorities have the ability to deliver new social housing.  As I have said, a total of 150 families will be housed in Laois in a six-week period.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight a number of provisions in the Bill.  It defines affordable housing as housing that is offered at the median price for a particular geographical area.  The issue is that the median price is calculated on the basis of the price of all homes, both modest and mansion.  The Minister knows that this pulls the price up artificially and makes it too high for the people looking to buy.  It is an inflated price that the average worker and family cannot afford.  Second, the legislation compels the LDA to pay the full market price for land from public agencies even if the land has a low existing-use value on that agency's balancing sheet.  This will drive up inflation and, therefore, the cost of homes on LDA land.  Third, the Government is establishing yet another layer of quangos, to be called "designated activity companies".  Some of them will be joint ventures, which strips away powers from local democratically elected councils.  The Minister indicated that applications under section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 are slowing things down.  If he was ever a member of a local authority, as I was, he will know that section 183 applications move very quickly through councils, usually in a matter of weeks.  What he said is a load of rubbish and it should be put to one side.  I thought the Minister had more sense than to come out with something like that.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has published its alternative to the Government legislation.  We have detailed proposals for a new agency with strong CPO powers to deliver an average of 20,000 local authority and affordable homes for workers and families over five years.  Our proposals would see a mix of affordable, social and cost-rental housing.  We are talking about truly affordable homes for low-income and middle-income workers.  These are the people who are stuck in the middle, trapped in private rental accommodation and locked out of owning their own homes forever.</p></speech>

Listening to this debate, all I can say is &quot;wow&quot;.  I do not know whether to laugh or cry when I hear what Government spokespeople are saying.</p> <p>Of course, the Minister has left the building, like Elvis Presley, but the boys are back in town - that is all I can say.  The boys are back in town, as Phil Lynott put it - Fianna F&aacute;il and the developers.</p> <p> I find it absolutely shocking beyond belief that we have Government people accusing the Opposition of ideology.  It is utterly laughable, as is the reference to how we must not repeat the mistakes of the past.  This legislation is a souped-up hyper-speed version of the mistakes of the past.  It is a heist.  It is the legal mechanism to pillage the entire public landbank.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  It applies to every public body, not only the local authorities, and every bit of their land.  It is not only their housing land, but any relevant land - we need only look at the definition.  Designated activity companies can take any parcel of land from any public body and they can do what they like with it, in effect.  It is unbelievable.</p> <p> This is worse than the National Asset Management Agency.  At least we had the NAMA land briefly in our ownership before it was given back to the investors, vulture funds, real estate investment trusts and so on.  They flipped the land, made a fortune and then leased it back to us at extortionate rents, but at least the land began in private ownership.  In contrast, this is the actual public landbank of all public bodies and we are going to hand it over to designated activity companies.  Every public site is to become a private company shielded from freedom of information and democratic oversight.  They will be insulated by commercial sensitivity to enable them to do deals with investment vehicles and third parties - I wonder who they are.  The boys are back in town and this is going to be the cash cow, the ultimate prize.  They can now plunder the public landbank.</p> <p> Of course, the Bill should have done something else but it does not.  Among the institutions not mentioned are those which own church lands.  Where are the compulsory purchase powers to take all the church lands and use them?  No, the companies will be able to take land off the HSE.  They will be handed over to private developers but land will not be taken from the Sisters of Charity and all the institutions that were responsible for the abuse of women and children.  They can keep their land.  They will not be touched by any of this, but the public landbank will be plundered and handed over to private developers.</p> <p> At a minimum, 50% is to be privatised.  That is the guideline.  However, the Minister will have the power to vary this.  He says he might vary the 50% figure downwards and that we might get more social and affordable housing.  Equally, there could be no social and affordable housing at all because the Minister can vary it to whatever level he wants.  The Minister can also give an opt-out, even on the one aspect of social housing that is possibly offered - the Part V 10% obligation.  In any event, we get that obligation on any private development.  Yet, the developers can even opt out of that.  The Minister can give a waiver and cash is given instead to the local authority.  The legislation does not even specify that such cash should be spent on public and social housing.  This is exactly what happened before the crash when private developers were paying development levies in cash to pay off their 20% obligation.  That money was never used for housing.</p> <p> Of course, it was all about incentivising an absolute stampede or goldrush by the property developers who crashed the entire economy.  Now, we are not going to do it on private land but we are going to do it on public land.  No one could make this stuff up.</p> <p> There is no obligation for social housing.  Social housing is mentioned once at the beginning but is not included at all in the functions of the agency.  It simply disappears.</p> <p> Affordable housing is defined as below market price, but then it is strictly and explicitly linked to local market conditions.  It is not even linked to average market conditions, which might at least average it out and bring down average prices and rents because it is done on a national level.  Instead, it is based on local conditions.  In south Dublin average house prices are between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000.  Affordability as defined by this Bill could be &euro;599,000, &euro;550,000 or &euro;500,000.  It is totally useless.  If a person lives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and is a low or middle-income worker, the person does not get paid more because he or she lives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The person still has to pay the rent but rent is &euro;2,200 or &euro;2,400 - that is what is being charged.</p> <p> The requirement of the legislation to benchmark affordability in terms of cost rental at local market conditions means de facto it will be unaffordable for the vast majority of people who desperately need it.  Even cost rental is benchmarked against the market.  It is absolutely shocking.  In fact, cost rental will eclipse traditional social housing completely because the landbank that the council might have built public housing on will be taken by the land development agency in large part.</p> <p> There is one thing that really sickens me.  Much of this heist of public land is being justified on the basis that we must have social mix.  Jesus, that is patronising.  It is sickening patronising nonsense from the Government about people from different backgrounds.  Of course, that snobbery is ultimately at the base of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael establishment.  They have been running councils for the past God-knows-how-long.  The Government simply does not like council housing - that is the truth of it.  Those in the Government do not like council housing.  They want to do away with council housing and replace it with cost rental.  Yet, insofar as any social housing will be delivered cost rental housing will be benchmarked against the market.  This means it will be more expensive.  Moreover, social housing, because the Government has not lifted the income thresholds, will now be only for the poorest of the poor.  In fact, this will intensify social segregation.  It will create a new category in the hierarchy of social segregation in respect of housing.  That is what it will actually do.  In fact, that is already happening.  In the past, nurses, bank workers, teachers and other public servants would have got access to social housing because the thresholds were adequate.  The vast majority of working people saw social housing as a legitimate thing to do.  Yet, because the Government does not increase the thresholds, it is now stigmatised as only for people on the lowest level of income.  Soon, only the people who are on base social welfare payments will actually be eligible to go for social housing, and that is exactly the agenda.  For everyone else, we do not have rent linked to income, but we have cost rental linked to market finance and local market conditions.</p> <p> I will outline another reason why the Government refused to define affordability as a specific proportion of people's income.  It is because the agency is going to partner with investment vehicles.  Those same investment vehicles will also be building on their own private land in nearby areas at full market price.  If Hines or some other company in D&uacute;n Laoghaire want to flog apartments at &euro;450,000 in Cherrywood, they will hardly build houses in Shanganagh, for arguments sake, for &euro;250,000.  That would not really work for the developers because it would undermine the market.  That is why the Government will not define affordability in terms of a proportion of people's income or at a genuinely affordable level.  It is because the investors the Government is hoping to drag in to develop public land would not put up with it.  That is the truth of what is going on.</p> <p> I am unsure whether there is much more to say about how horrible and absolutely appalling this legislation is.  It is an absolute heist.  There is nothing ideological about it.  This is about greed, facilitating greed and a political establishment that is utterly captured.  It has always been captured.  The rich in this country have always made their money by property, by exploiting property and by speculation.  This applies to property developers and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, but Fine Gael did the same with the international vulture funds that the party brought in to benefit from the crisis generated by the last speculative and developer-led frenzy.</p> <p> Of course, we can add in the affordable housing legislation that has come out.  That will strap people in so-called affordable housing with a double mortgage - not only one mortgage but two mortgages.</p></speech>
