Media reports quoted a series of housing experts predicting continued housing price hikes.  This echoes similar commentary from the Governor of the Central Bank last week.  One economist said of our housing market that it is on fire.  Another warned that house prices could reach Celtic tiger levels.  A third expressed the concern that house prices could continue to rise for the next four years.  All of this is, of course, an indictment of the Taoiseach and Government&rsquo;s failed policies.</p>  <p>  Last Thursday during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, raised with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, the issue of rising house prices.  By way of response the T&aacute;naiste said that house prices are cheaper than they were 14 years ago and that, in any event, people were in a position to borrow more, in other words, to amass more debt.</p>  <p>  This approach will only increase house prices further.  One has to ask has the T&aacute;naiste learned nothing from the past ten years?  Does he not understand that more credit will mean more house price inflation, more debt for workers and families and more expensive housing?  Does he not understand that increased debt means greater risk of mortgage default, repossession and, in worst case circumstances, perhaps homelessness?  </p>  <p>  I spoke yesterday to a family in Ringsend.  There were three generations living in one home.  They are by no means unique but I will talk about this family.  One of the family members, a young woman aged 35 with a good job, had just moved back into her mother&rsquo;s home for the fifth time.  Because of the Government's failed policies, this woman and countless thousands like her feel that their lives are on hold.  A whole generation has been left in the same situation.  This woman and people like her do not need unsustainable levels of debt forced upon them; they simply need to put a roof over their heads.  She needs a genuinely affordable home for her and her family.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree with the T&aacute;naiste that house prices should increase further and that workers and families should go further into debt?  Does he think that is acceptable or does he accept that house prices are too high?  Does he also accept that heaping even greater debt on workers and families will force prices up and will not bring them down?  All of this scenario, as it unfolds again in a housing crisis, smacks very strongly of the bad old days of Fianna F&aacute;il in power.</p> <p>The housing system is designed and delivered not for ordinary people, families or workers but by and for developers, and the banks too, of course, get their pound of flesh and line their pockets.<br/><br/>Will the Taoiseach clarify where he stands?  Does he stand with his T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, who takes the <i>laissez-faire </i>approach whereby people should simply borrow more and buy more expensive housing, or does he accept that we have a crisis and need to deliver affordable housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200004#B00200"><p>I ask the Deputy where she stands.  I listened to her soundbite after soundbite, slogan after slogan, which is really all about electioneering, is it not?  The reference to Ringsend is no accident, obviously.  We have all been out and about.  I am very conscious of the significant issue that housing is.  I have said repeatedly in the House that housing is a crisis.  The Government is just about 12 months in office, dealing with a global pandemic that, unfortunately, impacted on house-building in 2020 by about 5,000 houses that we could have got built if there had not been a lockdown, and the lockdown of 2021 has impacted on us as well.  That said, the Government has been very focused on building more houses, getting more supply into the market, which is the key issue, and doing it in such a way that we can make it affordable for people.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows the figures.  About &euro;3.3 billion has been allocated for housing alone in 2021.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is introducing a shared equity scheme, which will help people in terms of affordability, and the Government enhanced the help-to-buy scheme last year.  That has helped about 22,000 buyers get on the property ladder.  That is 22,000 people who have benefited from that scheme, yet the Deputy opposed that scheme and then comes to the House and lectures everybody else about affordability and trying to make housing affordable.  She cannot have it both ways in respect of her stance on housing.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy seems to want to exploit it to win votes but comes up with very few solutions to it.  She opposes every measure the Government introduces to try to make housing affordable.  She is opposing the Affordable Housing Bill and the measures the Minister is introducing, in regard not just to shared equity but also to the enhancement of the serviced sites fund, which will involve the State providing thousands of affordable new homes over the next year or two.  She opposes an extension and expansion of Part V of the Planning and Development Act to designate a range of homes for first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  The first ever cost-rental scheme, being introduced by the Minister and providing up to 400 units, will be expanded significantly in 2022 and beyond.  We have brought about 2,500 voids back into use very quickly through the July stimulus funding of last year.  The Land Development Agency Bill is going through the Oireachtas and will provide additional capacity, through the agency, to get more houses built - both affordable and social.  The initial portfolio for the Land Development Agency can potentially provide up to 4,000 homes to 2025, yet the Deputy opposes that also.</p>  <p>  Family homelessness, in the past 12 months, has decreased by 39% on the total recorded in March 2020.  It is the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since February 2016.  In a short space of time, that represents very significant progress by the Minister on this issue.  He is using every possible opportunity, including a suite of affordable measures and a strong social housing programme, to try to get additional supply into the market.</p>  <p>  In sharp contrast to that, the Deputy opposes all the affordability measures that have been introduced to date and that will be introduced in the coming while, and on the ground her party has been opposing many housing projects that are shovel ready.  Thousands of houses have been rejected and opposed by her party, which is completely inconsistent with the stance she takes in the House.</p></speech>

The story I told of the woman and the family in Ringsend is not a sound bite.  It is the truth.  It is the reality they are living.  One finds that reality throughout Dublin Bay South.  The Taoiseach is on the doors and will hear it too in Sandymount, Pearse Street, Irishtown, Harold's Cross, Ranelagh and Rathgar.  It is always the same and yet the Taoiseach is so out of touch with the harsh realities, he cites a shared equity scheme as evidence of his attendance to affordability matters, which is the very scheme that has been slammed and criticised by experts across the board, not just by Sinn F&eacute;in, because it is not the answer.</p>  <p>  The answer is to double capital investment and for the State to really step forward to deliver 20,000 public homes every year to meet social and affordable need.  That is not just Sinn F&eacute;in's view either.  The ESRI supports that view.  Yesterday, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA-----</p></speech>

The help to buy scheme helped 22,000 people to buy homes, yet the Deputy opposed it and continues to oppose it.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also introduced a new affordable purchase scheme, with the State directly building affordable homes in addition to the help to buy and shared equity schemes.  The Deputy has opposed that as well.</p>  <p>  On the ground, where we had a mix of housing projects, particularly in Dublin city with more than 1,200 in north Dublin, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the building of those 1,200 houses and likewise, hundreds more in Tallaght, Clondalkin and elsewhere.  It just does not stack up.

There is no doubt we witnessed a political transformation, unlike almost anything we have seen for the past 20 years.  Having been an enthusiastic Tory fiscal conservative for his entire life, the T&aacute;naiste has seen the light.  There were so many spending commitments announced on Saturday that Fine Gael delegates must have been checking to make sure they were at the right event.</p>  <p>  I will try to list some of the promises, but there were so many I may inadvertently leave some out.  They included a commitment to build 40,000 houses per year, an extra &euro;4 billion per year for the health service, expanded medical card eligibility, occupational pensions, a living wage and more money for welfare payments, all paid for not with tax increases but some vague sounding growth at a time the economy recovers from the pandemic, we are coping from Brexit and our corporate taxes are set to reduce.</p>  <p>  I wonder if the Taoiseach is fearful that the next time he is down in Dublin Bay South, he will come across a Fine Gael bus with a big sign on the side of it stating there is &euro;4 billion extra per year for the HSE emblazoned on the side of it.  The T&aacute;naiste's other political inspiration, Boris Johnson, found that kind of stunt useful.  Given imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I am gratified the T&aacute;naiste has taken on some of the Social Democrats' policies, including improved public services, better pay and conditions for workers, a social welfare safety net in order that people to live in dignity and much increased State investment in housing.  However, I am not sure he is a credible person to deliver on this given Fine Gael, after ten years in office, has not managed to reach the Rebuilding Ireland target of 25,000 houses annually, never mind 40,000 houses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 1 million people are currently on hospital waiting lists and it has taken Fine Gael ten years to realise the problems with gifting a new &euro;800 million maternity hospital to a private company with a religious ethos.</p> <p> Was the Taoiseach warned or even consulted in advance of these announcements?  Are we to understand that the health budget will increase by &euro;4 billion every year from now on?  Will that come as a surprise to the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly?  Is the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, down in the Custom House planning the delivery of 40,000 houses?  I hope so.  Who in Government is deciding fiscal policy?  Is it solely a Fine Gael remit?  Does the Taoiseach stand over all those commitments and, just as important, does he stand over how they will be paid for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200006#D00200"><p>I did not get a chance to watch all the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis but I picked up some aspects of it from the extensive media coverage.  I can report that the Minister for Health is in good form over the last 48 hours in terms of the underpinning of the substantial health budget which will be required.  He might optimistically think that his bilaterals with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, may not be as difficult or challenging as health Ministers generally have them with Ministers of public expenditure.  That remains to be seen.</p>  <p>  In a more serious vein, the programme for Government aims essentially to take this country through the pandemic as safely as possible, to facilitate the emergence of a strong economy and society and to learn the lessons of the pandemic in terms of a stronger state in health with reforms and funding.  It is not just about funding, but the reforms that go along with it.</p>  <p>  We have learned a lot during the pandemic.  I was keen in late summer when working with the Minister for Health to ensure the winter initiative was introduced with &euro;600 million, an unprecedented level of funding for a winter initiative, and to give full-year funding to that.  That has made a significant difference to the capacity of the health service to withstand normal winter pressures, never mind the third wave.  If it had not been for that level of investment in home care packages, community diagnostics and acute capacity, we would have been in far greater difficulty during the winter.</p>  <p>  Regarding information technology, the digital transformation that occurred in certain aspects of health is something else we have to build on as we emerge from the pandemic.  There will, without question, be a stronger health budget in the next year or two to make sure we embed the reforms that have been made and to underpin the level of services required.  We are living longer generally and that will create its own additional cost.</p>  <p>  On housing, we are very clear the single biggest issue of our time is to make sure the current generation, particularly but not just young people, are in a position to get into the housing market and buy houses that they can afford and that we can provide more social housing.  With the Housing for All strategy, we are focusing on a significant social housing programme for the next five years.</p>  <p>  Another key plank is climate change.  We have already brought groundbreaking climate change legislation into this House and had it passed.  There is a very extensive programme for Government which we are focused on delivering.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  However, announcements were made at the weekend.  Does the Taoiseach stand over them?  Are we, as I hope we are, seriously looking at 40,000 houses a year?  Is that a Government commitment?  Was the Taoiseach consulted in advance?</p> <p>What about the summer economic statement?  Has work been done on that already?  Is it on the way?  Are these announcements likely to be included in it or is this just about electioneering?  It is important that we understand where the Government is at in terms of some of these announcements.  There was a very long list of announcements.  The Taoiseach might address the reference to 40,000 houses.  Is that a firm commitment?  Will the Government stand over it?  Is it credible that what was announced can be paid for by way of growth without tax increases?</p></speech>

The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform last evening presented us with an overview and presentation of the summer economic statement.  It may be characterised as a more sober assessment of the situation over the next five years, generally speaking, in terms of the framework.  We knew that, for these two years, exceptional spending would be required in terms of the pandemic, and an exceptional deficit.  Over the lifetime of the Government, as part of the programme for Government, we have said we will ease our way through to a balanced fiscal position over the next five years.  That is the trajectory the Ministers presented to us.  They will be doing more work on that before the publication of the summer economic statement.</p>  <p>  On the question about 40,000 homes, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is preparing the Housing for All strategy.  We obviously lost a lot of houses last year and this year.  Over the next ten years, we will have to build up.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has referred to 33,000 houses.  Given that we lost 5,000 houses in 2020 and 6,000 or 7,000 in 2021, we need to make that up for the remainder of the decade.</p></speech>

The collateral damage has affected many pubs and restaurants, some of which have now been closed for 420 days.  No other country in Europe has closed hospitality for so long.  In research I have done today, I can find no other European country where indoor dining in restaurants is closed.  Denmark and Finland had roughly the same level of mortality as this State and has had roughly the same level of vaccinations.  They managed to open their indoor dining facilities in April and May.  Here in Ireland, hotels have been allowed to open up indoor dining since the start of June and the T&aacute;naiste says there is no science behind the decision to discriminate between hotels, restaurants and pubs.</p>  <p>  There has been incredible confusion on our streets over the past while.  The Government paid hundreds of thousands of euro in marketing to encourage people onto our streets while at the same time, we saw garda&iacute; baton charge young people off those streets.  For weeks, the Government has allowed publicans to serve takeaway pints to thousands of people milling around our streets but have banned the sale of pints to people sitting safely at those publicans' tables outside those pubs.  In the latest version, the Government has made millions of euro of grant aid available to pubs and restaurants to sell food and drink in areas where the sale of drink is illegal according to by-laws.  It is an absolutely incredible situation.</p>  <p>  Hospitality, tourism and aviation have been calling for the introduction of rapid antigen testing since its approval by the EU last December but the Government does not like the word "rapid" and cannot make a decision.  We have a situation whereby the minister for making things up as we go along has concocted a solution for the confusion as regards the sale of alcohol and food on streets where it is actually banned.  She has called on the garda&iacute; to close their eyes and say nothing.  It is an incredible situation.  Restaurants and pubs in many parts of the country will now operate at the pleasure of local garda&iacute; and discretion may mean that some restaurants and pubs can function and others cannot.  Garda representatives themselves have said that when things go wrong, the blame will be put on their members, who will have to defend their actions.  Those representatives have said they are worried that the Garda will be scapegoated for impossible decisions that will have to be made.  I have never before seen a Government tie itself up in so many knots of confusion.</p> <p>This Government has been a fiasco factory when it comes to hospitality.  Will it now legislate so that pubs, restaurants and hotels can operate safely under the same science and the same regulations?</p></speech>

First of all, the level of supports from the Government to hospitality has been unprecedented, as it had to be in the context of a global pandemic.  Covid-19 has been particularly devastating for the hospitality sector, for travel and for tourism more generally, and that has been true all over the world, not just in Ireland.  The virus and hospitality are close and good companions, unfortunately, and that is a reality we cannot escape.  That is why it has been so difficult for all concerned.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are not baton-charging people all over the country, as the Deputy is-----</p></speech>

I invite the Deputy to come to Cork and have a walk down a few streets in Cork, and he will see some great outdoor dining going on.  I was in Dublin yesterday and called to a number of venues.  People were in a very happy mood, dining outdoors, having a few drinks outdoors, engaging in a friendly way, and thankful, happy and appreciative of the fact they were able to participate in outdoor dining.  We can overplay this as well.</p>  <p>  That said, any issues that need to be resolved will be resolved through legal instrument.  There has been no question but that the opening up in terms of outdoor dining and hospitality has worked, has been working and has been effective.  We will continue, particularly with the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to the end of the year, to do everything we possibly can to make sure the hospitality sector can emerge viable out of the pandemic.  That is why, in terms of VAT, for example, in the economic recovery plan we made very specific commitments out to September 2022, and we also made specific commitments in terms of rates relief, which is of value to many people working in the hospitality sector.  We are very clear in terms of the recovery plan that for those sectors that were hit hardest by Covid, we will do everything we possibly can to support them throughout the pandemic but also as we emerge from the pandemic, with all the twists and turns that can happen and that can take place.  From our perspective, we want to ensure the successful reopening of hospitality.  To date, I think, outdoor hospitality has worked relatively well.  As I have said, any legal instrument that is required to deal with the situation that emerged in the last 48 hours will be provided.</p></speech>

Even when pubs open for indoor service around 5 July, we will have a situation where many people will not want to go indoors to eat and drink.  We will also have a situation where capacity indoors will be less and, therefore, pubs and restaurants will need extra capacity outside.  This issue is going to last right through the whole summer.</p>  <p>  Then there is the question of insurance, which has not been considered.  Many pubs and restaurants have applied for insurance on the basis of their licence but garda&iacute; are saying that the licence does not extend to this outdoor space.  We also have a situation where there is a backlog in the delivery of licences from local authorities, and some pubs and restaurants may be operating while waiting for that licence to be delivered.  Where stands their insurance?  Then we have small businesses which have put out tables and chairs in the hope of being able to make a living at this moment.  Do they have insurance?  Hope is not good enough in the Four Courts if they are being sued.  Will the Taoiseach tell us what instruments will be introduced to solve this and when they will be introduced?</p></speech>

This will be the second of many protests since fishermen have had enough of inaction, spin and lies.  They will take the Taoiseach and the Government's leadership to task for huge inaction which will see every fisherman lose anything between &euro;5,000 and &euro;20,000, with significant job losses in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I was told that the Taoiseach was in west Cork last Saturday, in Union Hall and Castletownbere.  It is always important for a Head of State to visit west Cork.  Those who told me on Friday and Saturday that the Taoiseach was coming felt that it was way too late, other than to hear about the nightmare crisis that these fishermen face after calamitous errors by this Government.  When in west Cork last Saturday, did the Taoiseach apologise for his continued refusal to appoint a senior Minister for the marine, which was a red line for me in negotiations for the formation of a Government?  No matter how I explained the imminent crisis of Brexit and other major issues related to fishing, the Taoiseach refused to understand the importance of appointing a Minister to protect Irish waters, fishermen and our richest resource.  Did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to apologise for signing into law the unjust and shockingly unfair penalty points while in his short term as Minister for Agriculture and the Marine in 2020?</p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach apologise for the shocking handling of Brexit negotiations in late 2020, where clear evidence shows that the Government's eye was off the ball despite me pleading for the Taoiseach to be involved?  While the Government failed, France and other European countries had their terms and conditions fully met by negotiator Michel Barnier before they would agree to anything.  Did the Taoiseach apologise to the fishermen for the cock-up with the weighing crisis hoisted upon our fishermen, with the weighing of fish on our piers for inshore and pelagic fishermen?  We have since found out that the Minister and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, knew in December 2020 but failed to consult with the industry until 5 p.m. on Friday, 16 April, about what the industry would call a crisis beyond belief.  If the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and SFPA could add more insult to injury to the Irish fishing fleet, we now have an agreement to allow French and Belgian trawlers to park at Irish piers and to unload straight onto lorries without weighing or any checks of any sort.  This is a hard pill for honest Irish fishermen who park beside them and have been afflicted by every Irish rule and regulation inflicted on them by the State.</p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach apologise to the fishermen after the attempted ramming of a Castletownbere vessel off the Castletownbere coast by a Spanish trawler which was illegally fishing in Irish waters?  It was three times the size of the Castletownbere trawler.  Irish fishermen have no protection in their own waters since no one could come to their aid to immediately arrest the Spanish trawler which was carrying out an act of piracy.  The only explanation that the Taoiseach gave last Saturday, which has left many exasperated, is that there is an uneven and unfair burden on Irish fishermen and he has made it clear to the Commission.  Is the best the Taoiseach has to offer?  Everyone knew this already.  Will the Taoiseach reveal today how these fishermen's incomes and livelihoods, which the Government is helping to destroy, can be saved without the word "decommission"?</p></speech>

I visited Castletownbere and Union Hall.  We had a matter of fact meeting to go through the issues in a sensible way, listening to what the fishers had to say and identifying the issues.  The country was faced with a no-deal Brexit or a trade and co-operation agreement.  A no-deal Brexit would have been catastrophic for the Irish fishing industry, given how dependent our pelagic fleet is on fish in British waters and always was.  It was always a problem even prior to Brexit and   once Brexit was contemplated at all.  That said, there was, in our view, an unfair burden on Ireland arising out of that agreement, which we are pursuing with the Commission.  That leads to the key item at the meeting.  At the meeting I had yesterday, I initiated a social dialogue forum with the fishing industry and I met with the producer organisations and fishing representatives from the different categories and sectors for more than two hours to go through these issues.  One is the Common Fisheries Policy review next year, which will give us an opportunity to see if we can claw back some of the quota and share that we lost as a result of Brexit.  Another issue is the control plan.</p>  <p>  Deputy Collins is being somewhat disingenuous.</p> <p>The Department did not remove the derogation in respect of the weighing of fish in our factories.  As he knows, the Commission initiated proceedings and an investigation into the plan.  Its implementing decision revoked the approval of the Irish control plan for the weighing of fishery products which had been submitted.  We received that Commission implementing decision revoking the approval of the Irish control plan submitted for the weighing of fishery products.  The SFPA must now respond to that.  This is a very serious issue for all the fishers.  One of the reasons I was in Union Hall and Castletownbere was to witness at first hand the impact of this decision.</p> <p> We also need to engage with the Commission on that.  Rightly or wrongly, the Commission's assertion is that there was overfishing of our quota and it wants to claw some of that back.  We are resisting that.  We will need to deploy all legal tools at our disposal to resist it.  That brings me back to a point I made to all the groups yesterday.  We need to reset our relationship with Europe regarding fishing.  The Commission's perception of how we are enforcing the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland and our perception of that are miles apart.  Standing up and attacking the Government on these issues is missing the point.  We need to engage with the European Commission on these issues.  I intend to engage with it.  I intend to work closely with the fishing industry to go through the items I have just referenced and other items that were also raised.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that the SFPA and the Minister knew in December that there was a crisis.  They did not consult with the industry and they are only doing so now when it is too late.  Listening to the Taoiseach today convinces me that the Government does not have a plan for fishing other than to kick the can down the road until next year.  All the fishermen are being fed is spin and more spin, going around in circles and leading them to a crisis protest tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Only last week the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, stated incorrectly to the D&aacute;il that the control plan is at public consultation.  This is incorrect as only white fish and shellfish plans are at public consultation.  Pelagic fishing is excluded from the consultation and is not part of any proposals.  He also stated that the SFPA would submit the control plan to the European Commission.  This is incorrect and misleading as section 43 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 states it is the function of the Minister to submit the control plan to the European Commission following a Cabinet decision on that plan.  No control plan can be submitted to the European Commission by the SFPA.  This kind of spin to our fishermen is why we are in the mess we are in today.</p>  <p>  I plead with the Taoiseach to give us an honest answer.  How does the Government propose to immediately address the incomes and the livelihoods of thousands of Irish fishermen who will face an enormous drop in income or face losing their jobs?  I again ask the Taoiseach not to insult the fishermen of Ireland by mentioning decommissioning.</p></speech>

I will talk directly to the fishers generally and to the fish producer organisations.  The purpose of yesterday's meeting with all the organisations across the country was to have a no-holds-barred meeting.  It cannot be ping-pong with one side standing back attacking the other.  That achieves nothing.  That is why the Minister established the seafood sector task force.  Agreement was reached on an initial application of funding from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund which would provide support to counter the adverse consequences of Brexit and to help fishers in the immediate timeframe ahead.  The task force will then return to a broader application of funding from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund to see how we can in the medium term support fishers and also the coastal communities supported by fishing.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, the Government has provided substantial supports to Castletownbere, a harbour close to his heart.  In May, the Minister announced a substantial capital programme in that respect and we also want to support fishing communities through the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Fund.  We want to support primarily the fishers themselves who are under considerable pressure from both Brexit and the decision by the European Commission in respect of the control plan.</p></speech>

We have had report after report and investigation, but the Government is not supporting the network.  It is directing business away from the post offices, all of which are sole traders.  We badly need a debate on this matter.  We are told that by July, 875 postmaster-operated offices will face a challenge due to a reduction of 20% in income.  Nobody can sustain that.  They have come to the fore, as always, and played a gallant part in fighting Covid and helping people in the spirit of n&iacute; neart le cur le ch&eacute;ile, the meitheal.

It illustrates the wide-ranging negative impact the pandemic has had on all aspects of our society.  The Government would be willing to accommodate a debate on that report before the summer recess.  The Women's Aid report shines a light on domestic violence and on how the pandemic has exacerbated the issue.  We would be willing to facilitate such a debate.</p>  <p>  In respect of the postmasters, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and others in government have been very focused on that issue, including the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton and others.  I do not believe the issue was raised at the Business Committee.  I do not think anyone sought a debate on this matter at the Business Committee.  I will revert to the Chief Whip to see if something can be facilitated in that regard, not for this week, but next week.  </p></speech>

At that time, and since, very serious questions have been raised about the ownership and governance of this new national facility.  I am absolutely astounded that four years later we do not have a straight answer from Government in respect of ownership of this new national maternity hospital.  I put it to the Taoiseach that it would be unthinkable that hundreds of millions of euro in public money would be invested in a hospital that was not fully owned by the State.  I put it to him also that the Religious Sisters of Charity must be asked, as a matter of urgency, to transfer freehold ownership of that site lock, stock and barrel to the State with no strings attached.  I further put it to the Taoiseach that any question, licence or mechanism that would open up any prospect of so-called ethos intruding on the provision of healthcare for women and neonates must be roundly rejected.</p> <p>Can the Taoiseach confirm for us that we will have a full transfer of it to the State urgently?</p></speech>

This has been a long saga, as the Deputy knows.  It was first announced in 2013 that the new national maternity hospital was to co-locate with St. Vincent's University Hospital.  Since then, there seems to have been a protracted dispute between the two voluntary hospitals.  Kieran Mulvey facilitated mediation in 2016.  That mediation agreement was published.  None of this should be new to people.  References were made to leasing and so on, as was well known at the time.  When the State is investing in and building a hospital, it should ideally own it.  The State will own the hospital but there is an issue with regard to the freehold of the site.  The Minister for Health will be engaging with stakeholders in that respect.  Planning permission for the hospital was secured in 2017.  Enabling works were carried out with regard to the car park and pharmacy.  This is all public knowledge.  The Minister will now engage with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity on the issue of ownership.  There is no question of the ethos being in any way influenced by any religious organisation.</p></speech>

To be honest, the Taoiseach did not answer the question.  The Taoiseach keeps saying that this is going to be owned by the State.  If that is the case, why is the Minister going to talk to the Sisters of Charity?  A deadline will have to be set at some stage.  Does the Taoiseach accept what his T&aacute;naiste said a few days ago, which is that we may potentially have to look at a new site?  Or will the Taoiseach set some sort of deadline for these negotiations so that they do not evolve over a long period of time?  The Labour Party and I have suggested three months.  If not, the land will have to be acquired by way of compulsory purchase order, CPO.  We have to deal with this one way or the other.  The Taoiseach cannot just stand up and say that it will be owned by the State when we all know of the issues regarding ownership of the land and governance.  These issues go hand in hand.  We need to own the land.  The Taoiseach should either set a deadline or acquire the land by way of CPO.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has to get real.  The women of Ireland will not accept a maternity hospital that does not provide the full complement of healthcare services we need.  The Taoiseach has said that he does not believe the governance is an issue.  Is he aware that at the moment one cannot get IVF treatment or sterilisation procedures in St. Vincent's University Hospital?  Why then does he believe that will change in the maternity hospital?  There has been absolutely no indication from the Government on what safeguards it will put in place because there are no safeguards that can be put in place.  The Catholic Church will not allow terminations to occur on land it owns.  It is time for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Government to get real.  We cannot afford to make the same mistakes again.  We just cannot afford to do it and women will not allow it to happen.</p></speech>

The Deputy should not put words into my mouth.  The Minister for Health has inherited this situation and is dealing with it.  First of all, there has to be stronger public interest on the board.  The current structure in terms of the membership of the board is not satisfactory.  Second, in my view, when the State is investing, the State should own.  Third, I am simply saying to the Deputy that those who have been involved in the negotiations to date are absolutely adamant that there will be no influence by any religious ethos and, in particular, the Catholic church or the Sisters of Charity will have no influence - good, bad or indifferent - whatsoever in terms of this national maternity hospital.  They are very clear about that.</p></speech>

In recent years I have asked the Taoiseach; the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; the Minister of State, Deputy Butler; and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about this issue and on each occasion I have been assured that I can move on as there is nothing to be seen or worry about.  However, when I asked the T&aacute;naiste about it last Thursday, he reinforced the absolute need for the State to fully own and control the new national maternity hospital.  We welcome the fact that the Government will not oppose the motion to be proposed by the Social Democrats tomorrow but the arguments over the costs and the legal complexity involved in the land deal cannot deflect from the essential goal of a fully State-owned, State-run and State-controlled national maternity hospital.  Will the Taoiseach respond to the statement of Dr. Peter Boylan that this issue is a test of the State's resolve with regard to who owns critical health infrastructure built with public funds?  If we do not do it now, then when?  What was Sl&aacute;intecare all about?  Why did the Taoiseach and his Ministers repeatedly assure the House there was no problem with this, given that the T&aacute;naiste differed with them last week?</p></speech>

It is a pity that the issue was not raised on Leaders' Questions because the shortness of time to reply on the Order of Business does not allow one to give a more comprehensive account.  As far as I am concerned, there is one very significant issue here, which is the safety of women in particular in terms of building a modern maternity hospital.  I have often been struck by the fact that we have only managed this in one location, which is in Cork, where we have a modern maternity hospital with a neonatal facility.  Everyone agreed way back that we should have co-location in terms of optimal best outcomes for women in particular and that is why the original idea of the national maternity hospital co-locating with St. Vincent's Hospital arose.  I do not think people want to unwind that idea of co-location and that creates its own context for this.  That said, nobody wants, in this day and age, a national maternity hospital built by the State to be influenced by any church.</p></speech>

These are very fine people who, last March, signed up for what they thought was going to be a couple of months, but a couple of months has turned into a couple of years.  Has thought been given to how the State will recognise the significant contribution these people have made during this time of national crisis?  For instance, could a very small honorarium be considered so that they are not out of pocket?  Alternatively, a framed certificate signed by the President could be provided to each of the volunteers or a reception could be arranged in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in or in Leinster House for the volunteers and their families to mark their significant contribution.  I know it means a lot to them because they are very special people.  Many people talk about volunteering but these people have actually done it.</p></speech>

It is an extraordinary achievement so far and we have a long way to go yet.  We are highly appreciative of the important work where volunteers across the country have participated in the test centres and vaccination centres.  I noted the very moving testimonies of Covid vaccine volunteers recently published in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I thank them all.

The Taoiseach told me in this Chamber four months ago that he would meet with Councillor Kieran Bourke and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in Tipperary County Council, the following morning if necessary.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, met with district councillors from Carrick-on-Suir ten days ago and she put the question to them whether they would put any of their loves ones in the hospital.  A petition is being organised by Councillor Bourke and the volunteer and staff team in his full-time office to ask the people of Carrick-on-Suir, south Kilkenny, east Waterford and surrounding areas whether they would put their people into this respite hospital, including for palliative care.  I know, before it comes back, that the answer will be 1,000% "Yes".</p>  <p>  In view of this impending petition and the overwhelming support for the hospital, will the Taoiseach meet with Councillor Burke and the others, as he promised?

Will he meet with the action committee, the wonderful doctors and nurses there and the members of the community who have put so much work into fundraising and everything else for the hospice beds and rooms?

He said he wanted to reset the relationship with Europe in respect of the review of the CFP.  How is he actually going to reset that relationship?  I believe, and the truth of it can be seen, that Europe stole access to fishing from us as we were negotiating to join the European Union.  Is that the relationship the Taoiseach plans to reset, or is he going to go cap in hand to reset the relationship by saying, "Sorry, we were not bold boys and we did not do anything wrong."

I have been consistently on to the Minister and the Office of Public Works to see when they will begin but I have, as yet, received no answer.  I understand the project is happening in phased stages.  This is an issue that requires transparency regarding its timeframe.</p>  <p>The repeated deferral of the start date is unacceptable.  The courthouse was built nearly 200 years ago.  It is right in the town centre.  I have been raising the issue for years now.  It is not like I am only coming to the Taoiseach after a short time.  It has been going on for years.  Even in my time as a Senator, it was meant to be done.  It is unacceptable.  I ask the Taoiseach to get some answers on the matter.  I would greatly appreciate it.</p></speech>

It reminded us all how such tragic events can occur in everyday life.  It can happen to anybody.</p>  <p>  In the course of my work, one of the issues that is raised frequently is the lack of supports for community groups that provide defibrillators.  I acknowledge, in particular, that the sports capital programme, along with other funds, provides assistance in the purchase of defibrillators.  However, more could be done to help with the upkeep and replacement of parts such as batteries, pads and glass.  Defibrillators are vital pieces of equipment in our communities.  I ask the Taoiseach to seek to determine whether greater supports can be put in place to help maintain these vital pieces of equipment in our communities throughout the country. </p></speech>

We were all shocked at the scenes and we were absolutely delighted that Christian Eriksen came through.  The events illustrated both the fragility of life itself and the importance of first aid, first responders, defibrillators and how what can be perceived to be one of the most difficult of circumstances can be retrieved.</p>  <p>  I certainly will give thought to what the Deputy said.  There has been very significant provision of defibrillators through hard work by volunteers and community groups the length and breadth of the country.  The Deputy has suggested a more structured support initiative that would support the provision of defibrillators and other facilities.  The maintenance of them is an issue on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

They are up to 600 ft in height and are being built on sites very close to dwellings.  They are being built using outdated 2006 guidelines that were designed to cover small turbines of less than 50 m in height.  The way things are going, the Laois and Offaly area will soon become the wind turbine capital of the country.  That is not an argument against wind turbines or wind energy.</p>  <p>  I have been chasing the issue for ten years with five Minsters and three Governments.  Some of my colleagues have also raised the issue.  There are still no guidelines or protection for rural dwellers.</p>  <p>  I brought forward two Bills on wind turbine regulation.  I asked members of the Taoiseach's party to support them in the House.  Only last week I received a reply to a parliamentary question that I submitted on the issue, which could have been written eight years ago.

I welcome the Bradley report, which forecasts a very favourable economic outlook in respect of the reopening of the old rail corridor between Athenry and Claremorris.  Unlike other reports before it, the extensive on-the-ground and field research presents a favourable cost-benefit ratio, which demonstrates a positive economic return to the region.  The report mentions the opportunity offered to County Mayo with a potential additional 23,000 tourists per annum travelling on the proposed rail link.</p> <p>The findings of the Bradley report should now feed into the strategic rail review being undertaken on an all-Ireland basis.  Will the Taoiseach commit to reviewing the findings of the report and, hopefully, put into action a project which will strongly promote balanced regional development for the Atlantic economic corridor?</p></speech>

All Oireachtas Members, particularly those from Mayo and Galway, will be interested when we have the results of this review.  I will certainly keep a close eye on it.  The Minister is anxious to be facilitated but obviously he is waiting.  This all-island strategic review has only commenced and we have to wait for the outcome of that to inform decision-making.</p></speech>

I could bring the Taoiseach to many towns and villages in west Cork in my constituency which have a vacancy rate of more than 50% for many on-street houses.  It is even worse again when it comes to those over-the-shop premises where a higher percentage are vacant.</p><p>In fairness to the Taoiseach, he said that the provision of housing is our No. 1 priority in government.  Part of the answer is staring us right in the face.  If we can bring on-street and over-the-shop vacant premises into the market, be it private or social housing, we will go part of the way to solving the housing crisis.</p></speech>

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in the context of the housing for all strategy, will be making provision for the restoration and the bringing back into use of houses currently idle and vacant in rural areas and in towns.

It has met on a total of 13 occasions, most recently on 27 May.  The next meeting is not yet scheduled.  The members of the committee are the Taoiseach; the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Transport; the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Other Ministers or Ministers of State attend when required.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment is responsible for issues relating to the economy and investment and had an initial focus last year on developing the July jobs stimulus.  Most recently, it has overseen the development of the Government's economic recovery plan.  This plan, which was launched on 1 June, sets out renewed supports, investments and policies for a new stage of recovery in order to support people back into work and bring about a sustainable rebuilding and renewal of our economy and society.  The plan builds on the already unprecedented level of support provided by the Government to those impacted by the pandemic to date.  The committee is also overseeing the ongoing review of the national development plan. </p>  <p>  Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, most notably the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.   Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise at other Cabinet committees, such as the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change, and the Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland and Brexit.  Issues relating to transport are, of course, regularly discussed at full Cabinet meetings, where all formal decisions are made.</p></reply>

Specifically referring to my own constituency of Cork North-Central and the north side of Cork city, we have a number of investments that we are looking forward to over the coming years.  I refer in particular to the urban regeneration and development fund announcement on the docklands, the recent Irish Rail announcement of &euro;184 million, the potential movement on the Cork north ring road and, hopefully, a new elective hospital for the north side of Cork city.  Can the Taoiseach clarify what investments he envisages in the north side of Cork city going forward?</p></speech>

That is where we really stand when the impact of multinationals on our GDP is stripped out.  When it comes to living standards and what people can actually afford to buy to live their lives, Irish people are in fact less well-off than the EU average.  That is what these figures are saying and is a reflection on the high prices here.  One of the principal drivers of that is the record levels of rent and the high cost of buying a home.  Childcare, obviously, is another such factor.</p>  <p>  The social contract between the State and its people is that if one works hard, contributes and pays one's taxes, one will be able to afford such things as housing and childcare.  The Economic Social and Research Institute has said we need to double our investment in housing.  I ask the Taoiseach directly whether will this happen.  The head of the National Treasury Management Agency, Conor O'Kelly, said yesterday that the Government can borrow millions of euro more to build homes for years to come as low interest rates will be locked in.  This is his prediction.  Does the Taoiseach agree with him?</p>  <p>  Two questions arise as a result of all of this data coming in.  First, will this be reflected in the review of the national development plan and in the budget of this year?  Will we be able to put that amount of money forward for housing?  Second, does the Taoiseach agree with the T&aacute;naiste's recent comments that 40,000 homes have to be built each year, and will be?</p></speech>

That is why we welcomed the &euro;2.7 billion contract.  There is a disconnect between the talk from the Government on the future of work and the potential of more remote working, and the reality on the ground in Mayo.  In the first 18 months, only 4,378 homes and businesses have been reached out of a target of 115,000 and only 632 of these have actually been connected.  Given that contractors were allowed to continue working on the roll-out over the past year, it is necessary for the Taoiseach to explain what has happened and why so little progress has been made.  People in my constituency of Mayo want to know what is going on.  For them to see such a shocking low number of connections is completely discouraging.  There has not been an adequate explanation of the situation.  What is the new agreed downgraded target for the connections this year?  What penalties will National Broadband Ireland face for falling so far behind schedule?  Does the Taoiseach share our concern?  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said he hopes to negotiate a new contract and he will invoke the change control procedure in the broadband contract.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what is going on because we are very concerned at this point about the contract and all of the promises that have been made around broadband for rural Ireland?</p></speech>

The so-called package that was announced by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is worth about &euro;300 per taxi driver, given that they have lost many thousands of euro in income in the past year and have carried ongoing costs.  It goes nowhere near meeting the demands they made.  They met with the Taoiseach and have written to him subsequently, but have received no direct response from him.  They want to know whether that is the end of it now.  Is that all they are getting?  In particular, they are pleading around the issue of the extension of the ten-year rule to something like 15 years.  Otherwise, many of these drivers who have lost a year's income and are carrying debts will have to replace their vehicles at the end of this year.  They simply will not have the money to do so.  Given that billions of euro have rightly been given to other industries, will the Taoiseach tell the taxi drivers that a measure that would actually cost nothing will be agreed?  I refer to the extension of the ten-year rule to become a 15-year rule.  This would remove a huge burden from their shoulders and would allow them to plan over the coming years while the recovery of their industry remains very uncertain.</p></speech>

For months we have had to listen to millionaire business owners, like Pat McDonagh of Supermac's, calling for cuts to the PUP and claiming it was so high it meant that workers were better off not working.  Yesterday's ESRI report exposed that as being simply untrue.  In fact, it highlighted the major damage that cutting the PUP would have in taking money out of the economy.  It also referred to the cliff edge that is facing students come September.  Those who usually rely on part-time work to pay their way through education will find it very difficult to get work.  The Government is creating a cliff edge for them which will potentially force them out of third level education.</p> <p>It is time to change course.  Cutting the PUP, or trying to intimidate or shame those on the PUP with checkpoints or Government propaganda, is simply not on.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider this position?</p></speech>

She replied that at the time of the decision to announce the layoffs, there was uncertainty regarding the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, its continuance and what form that continuance would take.  Given that there is no longer uncertainty about the EWSS, and given that it will be in place for the September to November period when Cork Airport will be shut, Ms Embleton and Aer Lingus no longer have an excuse not to keep those workers on the books.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach tell the House that the continued payment of the EWSS to Aer Lingus must now mean that plans to temporarily lay off 200 workers will be cancelled, and that the workers must remain on the books for that ten-week period?</p></speech>

Social Justice Ireland, the OECD and many others have recognised this fact.  The Government's efforts thus far in addressing these issues for younger people have been minimalist, to be polite about it.  I urge the Taoiseach to be ambitious, thoughtful and expansive in the support and ambition shown for younger people and younger workers.</p></speech>

It will create employment overall in the region, which will be of great significance for the infrastructural works that will facilitate both residential and commercial developments in the Cork docklands of benefit to many people living in the northside of Cork.</p>  <p>  The Irish Rail investment of &euro;185 million in commuter rail, particularly in regard to the revamp of Kent Station and the Cobh line, from Glounthaune to Monard, will have significant impacts throughout the northside of Cork and the hinterland around the northside of Cork city and county.  It will be a significant investment because it will leverage and incentivise further urban development along the rail track.  The idea is that in order to get sustainable communities, there needs to be investment in a combination of public transport and housing.  It will be very interesting to see how the development pans out.  We are very keen that it will lead to significant economic development on the northside of Cork, and I believe this rail investment will in time come to be seen as very important.</p>  <p>  On the new elective hospital, the HSE has made submissions in that regard and land on the northside of Cork has been identified as one potential location.  It is important that we modernise healthcare facilities throughout the country, and a number of elective hospitals have been identified.  Some work, negotiations and considerations are still under way with the HSE in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, whose framework covers this, and the Government will eventually be involved in the decision-making.  The hospital will make for a very significant development in modernising our healthcare system and will make it more efficient in terms of elective care.  It will take pressure off the trauma centres and the centres for excellence and ensure we can get through our waiting lists much more quickly than is currently the case at the major trauma centres.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Kelly, there are various broader metrics and standards.  We are developing a well-being framework under the aegis of my Department to identify the characteristics and that will more broadly measure not just the economic metrics but also the broader quality of life in Ireland.  This will be within an OECD framework.  A similar model has been developed in New Zealand and elsewhere, and we are keen to adapt such a framework to Ireland.  Of course, there has always been the issue between GDP and GNI in Ireland.  Equally, however, the impact of foreign direct investment, FDI, in Ireland, when it is stripped out, is not accurately assessed either.  It too can be understated, in regard to the quality of work and so on being provided and the historic added value of human capital, experience and expertise that have been garnered over the years, which have a consequential impact on indigenous industry, enterprise and research.  </p>  <p>  We still have much to do.  As for housing, I think it is about capacity and delivery.  We built about 20,000 houses last year and lost about 5,000 because of Covid.  This year, it is estimated that the figure we build could be between 18,000 and 20,000, losing a further 5,000 or 6,000 because of Covid and the lockdown-----</p></speech>

That involved &euro;3 million for the continued waiver of vehicle licence fees in 2022, &euro;2 million for a once-off motor tax refund scheme specifically for taxi and hackney operators and &euro;1.5 million for a national car test, NCT, fee refund scheme.

I will follow up on that to see where it is in the system and activate that process.  Deputies McAuliffe and Lahart and Senator Fitzpatrick were instrumental in organising that meeting.  I will engage with them and Deputy Boyd Barrett to follow through on those issues.</p>  <p>  The Government has decided to extend the pandemic unemployment payment from the previous midsummer date to September and beyond, into February of next year, albeit at reduced rates from September.  The comments on students were not fair.  The Government has been supportive of students in the context of the application of the pandemic unemployment payment in an unprecedented way.  Ordinarily, students have never availed of social welfare payments while studying full time at college, yet the Government, in the context of the pandemic, supported students through the pandemic unemployment payment.  It was unprecedented.  It has been very helpful and supportive to students and their families and it is not fair to try to characterise it as anything but that.  It is certainly not minimalist, as Deputy McDonald tried to suggest.</p>  <p>  A great deal of populism is going on at the moment.  Everybody wants to appeal to everybody and a by-election campaign is taking place, but there needs to be balance and perspective in regard to how we emerge from the pandemic and invest in new sectors.  The most important thing we can do for young people is to invest in education, research and skills and reskilling, and to provide more places in further education, apprenticeships and third level.</p> <p>We will do that.  We did it last year and the economic recovery plan provides substantial investment for thousands of additional places, through SOLAS, the further education sector, third level and fourth level in terms of research.  That is what we have to do as a country in terms of making sure we are competitive into the future as an economy.  We have to invest in human capital and young people and give them the opportunity to gain additional qualifications to reskill, in terms of the retrofit programme, for example.</p> <p> We need more apprenticeships in construction.  Everyone talks about housing.  We need more people who are skilled to build houses into the future.  That human capacity has to be built up to get to the 30,000 or 40,000 capacity towards the end of the decade.  That will be a key ingredient and is where resources have to be targeted in the future.</p></speech>

The secretariat to the Committee is provided by the National Security Analysis Centre in my Department.</p>  <p>  The committee is concerned with ensuring that the Government and I are advised of high-level security issues and the responses to them, but it is not concerned with operational security matters.</p>  <p>  As Taoiseach, I am briefed regularly by the Garda Commissioner and by relevant officials on the national and international security situation and on any individual incidents that may occur.  The relevant Ministers also brief the Government on security issues within their remit as the need arises.  There are also special arrangements in place to deal with particular circumstances that may arise, such as the recent cyber attack on the HSE&rsquo;s IT systems.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the committee, it is the long-standing practice not to disclose information about individual meetings.  I can tell Deputies, however, that the committee generally meets a number of times a year and as required, and that it will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  The committee&rsquo;s focus is on the main threats to the State&rsquo;s security and it has also addressed aspects of the State&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  In addition to its meetings, the members of the committee liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments that might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</p></reply>

Is the centre represented on the committee and did either advise the Taoiseach of high-level cybersecurity threats following Government formation last year?  As the Taoiseach is aware, the budget and staffing of the National Cyber Security Centre came under significant scrutiny last month.  Having failed to secure a preferred candidate for the role of director, this position is to be readvertised and the Minister awaits the outcome of a capacity review, although we know the centre employs just 29 people, despite its responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The main role of the centre is to lead in the management of major cybersecurity incidences across Government, provide guidance and advice to citizens and business on major cybersecurity incidents and to develop strong international relationships in the global cybersecurity communities.  Despite these significant responsibilities, the salary offered to the director is just half of what is paid to each of the Taoiseach's special advisers.</p>  <p>  In fact, the Government's overall annual spend on special advisors matches the centre's annual operating budget.  That is astonishing.  I would like the Taoiseach to explain how that makes any sense.  Evidence given last month at committee advised the centre's budget needs to be significantly increased.  On that basis, can the Taoiseach advise us when the capacity review of the National Cyber Security Centre will be completed?  Will the Government act quickly to provide for the additional resources we expect to be identified in that review?</p></speech>

Why was it dropped?  Is it not even more pertinent now we have such a Cabinet subcommittee?  We have the National Security Committee.  I do not want the details, but I presume Ministers attend that.  Can the Taoiseach tell us how often it meets and at what level?</p><p>Where are we at as regards the cyberattack on the HSE?  Have we sourced where the attackers targeted or how they got into our systems?  I do not want the Taoiseach to tell me here, but does he know?  Does he know where the weaknesses were?  I asked a whole range of questions regarding operating systems which were so out of date.  Have we any information as regards where the source of the weakness was?  I do not want to know what is, but I want to know whether the Taoiseach knows.</p><p>I ask about other future attacks.  How prepared are we across all our public services with regard to attacks in which hackers could be based in Russia or eastern Europe?  If an attack on our ESB or gas network was to happen, it would be serious.  It is not beyond possibility given our health service was brought to its knees.</p><p>There are a number of reports about Russian submarines in Irish waters, operating off the west coast.  Have we any capacity to monitor these?  What do we do?  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i>stated one third of fisheries patrols were cancelled by the naval service last year.  A submission from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Commission on the Defence Forces stated Ireland had to rely on an EU ship to patrol our fishing zones for the first time.</p><p>Some four of our nine vessels are out of action, mostly due to low staffing.  Basic pay, terms and conditions are a key problem for retention of such personnel in the Defence Forces.  Recruitment, career progression and welfare of service families are also a major concern.  The Defence Forces' strength have been hovering at just over 8,000 which is way below the 9,500 mentioned in the White Paper.  Will this issue be addressed?  Has it been looked at by the National Security Committee?  When will the Defence Forces commission a report?</p></speech>

Are there any plans to develop a national security strategy?  The previous Government went to develop a national security strategy in 2019, with the process led by the national security analysis centre.  I understand there was also a short consultation process undertaken at that time, over three weeks which included Christmas holidays.  Were the results of that consultation ever published?</p>  <p>  I note what the Taoiseach said on the confidentiality around this committee and I appreciate that.  However, if there is an intention to publish the results of the consultation, can the Taoiseach outline that to us?  With regard to the recent cyber attack, which the Taoiseach referred to in his response, both on the HSE and the Department of Health which obviously caused huge disruption right across the health system, has this National Security Committee met since that attack?</p>  <p>  Given the impact of that cyberattack, does the Taoiseach believe a general review of the State's cyber and general security apparatus should be undertaken?</p></speech>

In Germany, for example, the citizens get a briefing on the equivalent committee.</p> <p>They know the full composition and what is deemed to be a threat.  That helps people on the non-governmental side in terms of their level of preparedness.  We know what the State knows are threats, like hostile states, hardline dissidents and international organised crime, but where are we in relation to things like energy, cyber and climate issues?  What is being proactively done in relation to emerging threats?  Is independent advice available and routinely got?  Is there engagement with other states?  Has it been costed?  Very often that cost upfront is better than having to do things in response, as we are doing in relation to the cyberattack which may well have happened anyway.</p> <p> A recent article by Conor Gallagher and Martin Wall sets out our vulnerability in terms of policing of our airspace.  We rely on the Royal Air Force, RAF, to scramble jets to monitor our skies.  I do not have an issue with that but it would be useful and reassuring for us to get an understanding.  More needs to be said and we need to be more open.  That is not to say we should expose ourselves in a way that makes us more vulnerable.</p></speech>

It sets out to develop our capacity and protect the State.  In the last budget, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, tripled the budget for the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  It manages the State's incident response process to cyberattacks and is responsible for a series of initiatives to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure and public sector ICT.  It works closely with the Garda and the Defence Forces.  It is currently engaged in a detailed risk assessment of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities in the State.  It also provides public information on cybersecurity risks and best practice.</p>  <p>  In the context of the recent cyberattack on the HSE, our overarching priority was to restore all medical services.  It was extremely difficult on font-line workers.  I pay the warmest of tributes to all staff in the HSE, including those in the war room who had to deal with the cyberattack and worked night and day, at great cost to themselves, to restore services.  It had a significantly negative impact on services.  Front-line staff on the hospital floor had to deal with the absence of scanning, patient records and so on.  It was extremely difficult for all concerned and I thank them for their enormous efforts in maintaining treatments for patients.</p>  <p>  A group comprising the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan; the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys; the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman; and the Minister of State with responsibility for communications and e-government, Deputy Ossian Smyth, was established to monitor and steer the cross-Government response to the cyberattack.  It was supported in this by the National Security Analysis Centre, based in my Department.  That is in keeping with the arrangements in the National Cyber Security Centre&rsquo;s, NCSC, critical national incident response plan for managing incidents such as these.  The technical response to the attack involved a strongly co-ordinated effort across Government working in co-operation with specialist private sector contractors.  That dedicated work is ongoing and will continue until the systems are restored and functioning again.</p>  <p>  The Garda national cybercrime bureau leads on the criminal investigation and will continue to work closely with the NCSC and the HSE on this.  It is also working with international partners, given the nature of the crime involved.  It is clear in the context of cyberattacks that one has to have a team-based response, both within the country across Departments and also across Europe.  It is a collective effort.  The UK was particularly helpful in providing cybersecurity expertise.  People rallied to the call to help us.  The Polish Government gave its experience because it had been the victim of a recent attack.  This needs to be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  On the national security committee and the analysis I have received, there are a number of high-level threats or potential threats to the State that we have to keep an eye on and that some Deputies have referenced, relating to international geopolitics and to right-ring extremists and extremists of one kind or another.  Our security apparatus, our Defence Forces and our garda&iacute; keep a vigilant eye on all of that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked about the status of the commission on the Defence Forces.  That independent commission has been established and has a mandate to report within 12 months.  I think Deputies are familiar with the terms of reference, which relate to the structure and size of the Defence Forces, encompassing capability structures and staffing, appropriate governance, high-level command and control, pay and allowance structures, recruitment, retention, career progression, leveraging the capabilities of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, and its support to the permanent Defence Forces, making service in the RDF more attractive and, of course, arrangements for the effective defence of the country by land, air and sea.</p>  <p>  The commission has invited submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its terms of reference.  It received over 500 submissions, which it is analysing.  It has been established as an independent body and has met with a broad stakeholder group, including the Defence Forces representative associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces and senior officials and personnel from my Department, the Defence Forces and other groups.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Devlin's points, I will work on the publication of the consultations he referenced.  As I have outlined in terms of the national security strategy, there was a framework for us to work on and through and, in terms of resources, to do what we can.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, there is a balance between openness around national security policy and the Deputy's sense that we are overly secretive.  We have to take on board the advice we receive on certain aspects of national security but I would be interested in continuing the discussion with the Deputy</p></speech>

Since it was first published in 2014, the national risk assessment has provided an overview of strategic risks and has drawn attention, at an early stage, to the importance of phenomena such as Brexit, housing shortages and pandemics.  The process of preparing the assessment has been designed to ensure wide consultation across the full range of stakeholders.  This involves the dissemination of a draft for public consultation and opportunities for stakeholders and Oireachtas Members to contribute to the development of the final version.</p>  <p>  The national risk assessment is not intended to replace the detailed risk management and preparedness carried out by Departments and agencies, including by the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre.  Rather, it is part of the overall risk management framework and is a tool to assist Departments and agencies to update existing or develop new mitigation plans.</p>  <p>  The two years since the NRA was last published in 2019 have been particularly turbulent as a number of major risks have materialised.  The Covid-19 pandemic has been the most significant of these, not least in the cost to health and life.  Given the impact on resources of the pandemic crisis in 2020, the Department was not in a position to prepare an updated national risk assessment last year.  However, work is well advanced on preparing an updated draft version this year, which I hope will be published for consultation shortly.</p></reply>

We barely had a flu season in 2020 due to everything.  Ensuring as many people as possible are vaccinated this winter will be critical.</p> <p>I want to ask the Taoiseach about supply issues regarding the roll-out.  What are we ordering for next year?  I know decisions were to be made by the Cabinet today.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach outlined them in his response.  I know we had 4.9 million Pfizer doses ordered for next year and again for 2023.  There were reports in various media saying that we would need to have booster shots in 2022 as, hopefully, we will get to a point where everyone in the country has been offered a vaccine and we are fully vaccinated by September or October at the latest.  From a risk point of view, will the Taoiseach outline if we all need to get boosters?  From what I am hearing, I suggest we probably do.  What are the plans for that?  Have we everything ordered for the end of this year and early next year?  The CMO has indicated to NIAC that a booster campaign will potentially be needed.  Will the Taoiseach please outline to us whether he believes there will be a need for a booster at the end of this year, starting with the elderly and working all the way through the various vulnerable groups and age cohorts?  Have we purchased the vaccines?  I know about Pfizer.  I heard stories today about Janssen and Moderna.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach outlined his thoughts on a booster campaign and what vaccines have been purchased.</p></speech>

The assessment began in 2014, there was another in 2019 and the most recent one was deferred.</p>  <p>  From my assessment, I understand that the level of spending in Ireland on defence in 2019 was 0.2% of GDP.  By my calculations, that is far too low, even by the standards of any comparable neutral country.  In a recent budget there was a bigger annual increase for the military pensions than there was for day-to-day defence expenditure.  Could the Taoiseach have this examined, perhaps by reference to other similar neutral countries for instance, Finland, Sweden and Austria?  It is an important issue and we need to take account of it.  Given that the assessment has not been done yet, as we are going to head into a new cycle it is important that we go in with a view to spending more to ensure the outcome is better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200021#T00300"><p>The pandemic has clarified some of the key risks facing this country, and in some cases has created risks, so it is important that we respond.  The Taoiseach has spoken a lot about higher education, placements and people getting qualifications.  I repeatedly put to him a number of examples of where we are not doing what he is saying we are going to do.  One thing the pandemic has done is created something of a mental health crisis for particular cohorts in society, yet we are chronically under capacity in terms of the supply of psychologists.  We have 400 fewer psychologists than were identified as being required under A Vision for Change.  Interestingly, in Sharing the Vision, the reference to psychologists has disappeared altogether because we have not been able to build the capacity.  I pointed out to the Taoiseach that the difficulties are immense, in particular for working class people or people on low incomes in getting doctorates in psychology.  There is a chronic lack of places for all types of psychology doctorates.  The level of fees for doctorates is &euro;15,000 a year, and in the case of educational and counselling psychology no funding at all is available.  People are expected to do 30 months over three years of work and get no funding.  People are working unpaid on placement and paying perhaps &euro;50,000 over three years in fees.  They are in dire straits.  How exactly is that helping remove obstacles to higher education in a key area like mental health when we have 10,000 children, adolescents and adults waiting for psychological services?</p>  <p>  I could make the same point about doctors and the obstacles being put in the way of graduate entry courses for doctors in terms of fees and the cost of concluding their doctorates, or student nurses who still face significant fees, which they should not have to pay when we need more nurses and who are being made to work unpaid on placements throughout their nurse training.</p></speech>

I raised it again with the Taoiseach last week and he said the Government is not taking any risk in terms of the Delta variant.  When I first raised it, we had a small number of cases of the Delta variant in Ireland but now one in five cases is the Delta variant.  In Britain, they have slowed down and delayed the reopening.  Belgium has now closed its borders to travellers from Britain in order to stop the spread of the Delta variant.  We know that it is more transmissible, and that one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca is not very effective against it.  We know that young people, who make up a majority of the staff in the hospitality sector, have overwhelmingly not been vaccinated.  Does the Government still think that it is not taking any risks?  Is it still planning to go ahead with the reopening of indoor hospitality on 5 July?  Is the Government planning to do anything about the crucial issue of ventilation, which the experts have been screaming about for a year in terms of new regulations and funding to ensure there is proper ventilation in indoor hospitality and elsewhere?</p></speech>

I can get the specific volumes for the Deputy.  That is in addition to what we have already agreed in respect of Pfizer.  This is all part of the European Union pre-purchase agreement framework for 2022 and 2023.  The Health Emergency and Preparedness Response Authority, HERA, was established by Europe some time ago and has been preparing for the speedier manufacture and production of vaccines to deal with variants in the future, but also to have an expanded provision of vaccines for teenagers and children if authorised by the authorising authorities.  NIAC is currently looking at a vaccination programme for teenagers and children.  Suffice to say, it is our view that we need to purchase a sufficiency of vaccines to take us through 2022 and 2023.  Europe has already reached a deal with Pfizer to provide 900 million vaccines over the next two years.  We have opted in to those pre-purchase agreements and options.  It is good pre-planning by Europe.  We will add any surplus vaccines to our current support for COVAX and for other countries getting vaccinated.  Europe is also providing &euro;1 billion to support and build manufacturing capacity to develop vaccines on the African continent.</p>  <p>  Deputy Devlin makes a very fair point on investment in the Defence Forces, which we are improving and increasing.  He is correct about the consultations on the next cybersecurity strategy, which had to be delayed because of Covid-19, but it is resuming.  I outlined earlier the work of the commission on the Defence Forces, which is very comprehensive and in line with the programme for Government.  It will also feed into the pay review body, which is also provided for in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would argue that while some of the postgraduate programmes in medicine are much more expensive than the undergraduate programmes we provided additional places across the board at third level last year and we will do the same this year.  We will do the same in further education and we will increase apprenticeship places as well.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Paul Murphy's point, the Government has been and is concerned about the Delta variant.  We have been monitoring it very carefully.  We set up a special group within the Government comprising senior officials to keep a very close eye on the progress and trajectory of the variant.</p> <p>The United Kingdom has slowed down, although its opening was far more advanced than our opening.  It has not stopped what it has already done but it has certainly not gone ahead with nightclubs and the ending of social distancing, for example, which I always thought was a bit ambitious.  It has stopped that because of the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant.</p> <p> We are going to have to examine this.  We will take the public health advice.  The CMO and his team are examining this.  The most recent data indicate a higher incidence of the Delta variant now in Ireland, which is a matter of significant concern.  We have to look at this on a number of fronts in terms of our vaccination strategy and in terms of ventilation, absolutely.  We will keep the whole reopening strategy under close review, as we always do, and, as we have said all along, everything we do is subject to ongoing public health advice.</p></speech>

At this week&rsquo;s meeting, we will, as has become usual, discuss Covid-19.  This week, our focus will be on vaccination rates across the EU, including in the context of new variants, and on progress on the EU digital Covid certificate, as well as an initial exchange on lessons learnt from the pandemic.  We will also discuss the EU&rsquo;s economic recovery post-pandemic.  We will discuss migration, in particular its external aspects, including our co-operation and support for countries of origin and transit.  We will also return to discussions on relations with Russia, on Turkey and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean more generally, and on the worrying situation in Belarus.  While not part of the formal agenda, the Presidents of the Council and the Commission will brief us on their discussions at the recent G7 meeting, as well as at recent European Union summits with NATO, the US and Canada.  Our meeting will begin on 24 June with an exchange with United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, who was recently re-elected to his post for a second term.  On Friday, 25 June, we will also meet as the Euro Summit in inclusive format.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will provide more detail on Russia, Turkey and Belarus in his concluding remarks this afternoon.  I will address all other agenda items.</p>  <p>  Before turning to this week&rsquo;s meeting, let me take the opportunity to report briefly on the special meeting of the European Council that was held on 24 and 25 May.  At that meeting, we discussed Covid-19, including ongoing developments on vaccination across Europe, and the operationalisation of the EU digital Covid certificate this summer.  As we had agreed to do when we met last December, we provided guidance to the European Commission on climate issues ahead of the expected publication of the "Fit for 55" package in July.  We discussed Belarus and agreed additional sanctions should be imposed in response to the shocking forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega.  We held a strategic debate on Russia and restated our commitment to the five principles which have guided the EU&rsquo;s policy towards Russia since 2016.</p>  <p>  We had a short discussion on relations with the United Kingdom as they have developed since the end of the period of transition in January.  In this, we reaffirmed that the trade and co-operation agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement and its protocols, provide the framework for EU-UK relations and should be fully and effectively implemented.  I expressed my support for the approach being taken by the Commission and encouraged continued engagement in good faith with the UK.</p>  <p>  EU leaders also welcomed the Israel-Palestine ceasefire, which had come into effect in the days before our meeting, following the devastating loss of lives over the preceding weeks.  We reiterated our commitment to a two-state solution and agreed to continue to work with international partners to restart a political process.</p>  <p>  We condemned the kidnapping of the transitional President of Mali and the Prime Minister, and called for their immediate release.</p>  <p>  In preparation for this week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council, I met last week by video call, VC, with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the leaders of Estonia, Greece, Poland and Slovenia.  President Michel regularly convenes such meetings with small groups of EU leaders to help prepare the agenda for European Council meetings.  We had a good exchange on the agenda of this week&rsquo;s meeting.</p>  <p>  Our meeting this week with UN Secretary General Guterres is a timely opportunity as he starts his new term to exchange views on how the European Union and the United Nations can better work together.  Our discussion will build on the assessment on co-operation between the EU and the UN given by EU High Representative, Josep Borrell, to the UN Security Council on 10 June.  Engagement with the UN is always a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy but, of course, it is particularly important at present due to our membership of the Security Council.  Multilateral and UN-centred responses are essential for responding to complex global challenges in an interconnected and interdependent world.  Since taking up our seat on the UN Security Council on 1 January, Ireland has taken an active role and engaged constructively in the Security Council&rsquo;s work on a range of country situations and thematic issues.  Ireland has also assumed a number of leadership roles on the Security Council, including as facilitator for Security Council activities under Resolution 2231 on the Iran nuclear issue, and as co-penholder, with Norway, on Syria humanitarian resolutions.  I look forward to taking part next week in a debate at the UN Security Council, under the Presidency of my European Council colleague, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia, on "Maintaining International Peace and Security in Cyberspace".</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently one of three EU member states on the Security Council.  It is important to maintain EU co-operation and ensure a clear European Union voice on the many issues of concern to both the EU and UN.  The EU and UN are key components of a multilateral and international rules-based approach which provides the best protection and response to international peace and security issues, Covid-19 recovery, human rights, sustainable development and climate change.</p>  <p>  On Covid-19, this month&rsquo;s meeting will allow for further discussion on epidemiological developments, vaccination programmes and preparations for implementing the EU digital Covid certificate.  The decision that the European Union should come together as one to order and distribute vaccines was the right one, and very much in Ireland's interests.  It has given us access to a portfolio of billions of doses, and deliveries continue to increase.  Well over 355 million doses have already been delivered across the EU and more than 55% of the adult population have received at least one dose.</p>  <p>  The EU is the largest exporter of Covid-19 vaccines to the world and will continue its efforts to increase global vaccine production capacities in order to meet global needs.  Hundreds of millions of doses have been exported from the EU around the world to over 90 countries.  Universal and equitable access to safe, effective and affordable diagnostics, treatments and vaccines is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.  Accelerating work on vaccine sharing and production will be a focus of this week&rsquo;s meeting, including the concrete aim agreed in May of donating at least 100 million doses by the end of the year.  On 4 June, the EU, within the WTO, submitted a proposal to agree on a global trade initiative for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics.  The three key components of this proposal are: ensuring vaccines, treatments and their essential ingredients can cross borders freely; concrete actions to expand production and ensure affordable supply; and clarification and facilitation of TRIPS agreement flexibilities relating to compulsory licenses.  It is clear that production capacity is a key issue, and I welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;1 billion in funding to create long-term sustainable production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  The EU has also played a role in responding to the immediate health crisis in a number of countries.  In April, Ireland contributed to EU efforts in providing life-saving equipment to India and, last week, we responded to Nepal&rsquo;s request for assistance from EU member states with donations of medical equipment and PPE.  This material was donated by a number of organisations, including the HSE, and will support front-line workers delivering essential care.</p>  <p>  Next week, we will have a first discussion of the lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on an initial report presented by the Commission last week.  We must ensure that we enhance the EU&rsquo;s preparedness, response capability and resilience to future crises. </p> <p>While the European Union and its member states have accomplished much during the pandemic, it is clear that the European Union must be better equipped to support our collective efforts in the sphere of public health, while acknowledging areas of national competences.  There is scope to reduce unnecessary duplication of effort across member states, to improve co-ordination, and to harness our collective strengths as we address common challenges.  The success of the vaccination programme shows us what can be achieved when we work together as a Union.</p> <p> The Conference on the Future of Europe, which met on Saturday for the first time in plenary session, will no doubt also reflect upon the impact of the pandemic and our collective response during its work.</p> <p> On travel, we should acknowledge that the agreement reached on an EU digital Covid certificate is a significant achievement in a short timeframe.  The Government's advice is still to avoid non-essential travel.  Subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will operate the new digital certificate from 19 July for travel originating within the European Union and the EEA.  Ireland will broadly align itself to the European Union approach to non-essential travel into the European Union from third countries, including Great Britain and the United States of America.  This will facilitate the safe return of international travel underpinned by clear safety and public health protocols, including an emergency brake mechanism coordinated at European Union level to react swiftly to epidemiological developments of particular concern.  The Government agreed last week to enhanced quarantine arrangements for passengers arriving from Great Britain.</p> <p> This month's European Council will be an important opportunity to take stock of economic developments as we look ahead to the next phase of post-pandemic recovery.  The European Commission presented its European semester spring package on 2 June, with a focus this year on implementation of the &euro;750 billion NextGenerationEU.  Formal ratification of the own resources decision by all member states has cleared the way for European Commission borrowing on the markets to fund the NextGenerationEU package, with an initial &euro;20 billion raised last week.  The Commission has indicated that it will issue approximately &euro;80 billion of long-term bonds this year in addition to significant issuance of shorter-term bonds.</p> <p> Most member states have now submitted their national recovery and resilience plans with a view to accessing funding under the recovery and resilience facility, which is the centrepiece of the NextGenerationEU package.  Ireland submitted its draft plan to the European Commission on 28 May.  This has been developed by the Government over recent months, guided by the requirement for a minimum of 37% of expenditure on climate, 20% expenditure on digital investments and reforms, investment and reform challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations to Ireland in recent years, and ensuring alignment with national economic and investment plans, particularly the national economic recovery plan.  Ireland is expected to receive &euro;915 million in grants in 2021 and 2022, which will be used to support investments between now and mid-2026.  Further grants will be allocated in 2023, taking into account economic developments.</p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plan proposes investments and reform commitments in three priority areas, which are advancing the green transition; accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation; and social and economic recovery and job creation.  The Commission has two months to assess the plan, followed by up to four weeks for member states to consider and approve it following the Commission's assessment.  An initial summary of our draft plan was published earlier this month in conjunction with the Government's economic recovery plan.</p> <p> Leaders will meet next Friday for a euro summit, where we will hear from the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and from the President of Eurogroup, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  We agreed in March that the focus of this month's discussion would be on post-pandemic economic challenges for the euro area, as well as reviewing progress under the banking union and capital markets union.  The continued activation of the Stability and Growth Pact&rsquo;s general escape clause, this year and next, provides an important window of opportunity for ensuring we continue to have the right mix of monetary, fiscal and structural policies for the period ahead.  This includes a stronger focus on unlocking the full potential of our Single Market, including for next-generation digital services.  I look forward to constructive discussions with leaders to this end.</p> <p> Discussion next week will also return to the issue of migration.  Our focus will be mostly on the external aspects of migration.  We will take stock of the migration situation on different routes and will discuss how best to co-operate with third countries to manage this.  In 2019, the number of irregular crossings into the European Union was at its lowest level in six years and this fell further in 2020, largely as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.  However, the number of irregular border crossings at Europe's external borders in the first four months of 2021 reached 36,100, about a third higher than last year, and this is expected to rise further throughout the summer.</p> <p> This has, regrettably, brought with it an increase in the number of people who have lost their lives while trying to reach Europe.  Ireland has consistently supported European Union efforts to deal with migration in a comprehensive manner.  This includes the need to make sustainable progress on the challenges posed by irregular and forced migration.  To achieve this, we need to establish and strengthen mutually beneficial partnerships with key third countries.  We recognise the importance of development co-operation in helping to create the conditions in which people do not feel that migration is their only option.  We need to keep a focus on tackling the root causes of forced migration such as conflict and climate change.  However, it is important that we do not let migration define the European Union's relationship with third countries.  It should be only one part of a wider partnership.  In this context, the entry into force of the new neighbourhood, development and international co-operation instrument, known as NDICI-Global Europe, is welcome.  An indicative 10% of the NDICI-Global Europe financial envelope of almost &euro;80 billion for 2021 to 2027 is to be used for migration-related activities.  Ireland looks forward to continued work together as team Europe on this issue.</p> <p> I look forward to the opportunity this week of engaging collectively and bilaterally with my European counterparts.  In advance of the formal meeting, I will meet informally with leaders from the six Nordic-Baltic European Union member states, a group with which Ireland shares many policy priorities.  I will report to the House on our discussions next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200023#V00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach.  EU leaders will meet at a crucial juncture.  I will raise a number of issues.  As we emerge from the pandemic, we have to plot our way ahead carefully and thoughtfully.  The Council will meet in June, which is the month of Pride.  I cannot let this opportunity go to reiterate our abhorrence towards the discriminatory and bigoted approach adopted by the Hungarian Government in respect of LGBT+ citizens.  I know the Commission is investigating this matter but there have to be consequences for Governments that behave in this way.</p>  <p>  As we rebuild, there are opportunities and challenges.  The challenge is to rebuild an economy which is better, stronger and fairer for everyone.  There cannot be a return to the old economy which served a privileged few at the top but failed ordinary workers and families.  We can do better and we must do better.  The focus of our recovery must be on jobs that are secure and well-paid.  Businesses will need to be supported to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  The future is a new green, sustainable economy which can preserve our environment for future generations.  We need a balanced economy, in which rural communities get their fair share of jobs, growth and investment.  We need a specific focus on micro, small and medium businesses, which form the backbone of our economy and economies across Europe.</p>  <p>  When we look to the North, we need to work through the challenges and maximise the opportunities of the Irish protocol because business wants the protocol to work and expects political leaders to work together to deliver solutions to the practical challenges they face.  All political parties, bar one, are doing this.  The joint committee has an important job to do.  Neither the DUP nor David Frost speak for the majority of people in the North of Ireland, whether MLAs, businesses or, crucially, citizens on any of these matters.</p> <p>Nobody wants recurring extensions of grace periods, which only kick the can further down the road and fail to provide the essential certainty and stability businesses and all of us need.  Through dialogue and engagement, solutions can and must be found and delivered.</p> <p> We must also highlight the opportunities the protocol brings to the North.  It places the North in a unique position in respect of access to markets and we need to explore what that can mean for investment and growth.  This week, one of the largest businesses in the North, Dale Farm, won a contract to supply ingredients to a major European company.  InvestNI has spoken of the significant interest it has had from outside investors sparked by the opportunities of the protocol.  There are success stories but we do not often hear them.</p> <p> Leaders at the European Council must be in no doubt that contrary to the loudest doomsday voices, the silent majority in the North supports the protocol.  All of us across the island recognise its necessity and that needs to be made clear at the European Council.</p> <p> The Council also has an important opportunity to challenge the injustice of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy that has been devastating for our fishing community.  The Government has sat idly by while a situation has developed in which Ireland has 12% of the waters in the EU but our fishing communities are only allowed to catch 4% of the fish.  This costs our State thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of euro worth of seafood every year.  The Common Fisheries Policy must be revisited.  In the short term, we need equal burden sharing of the loss of fish quotas arising from the EU-British trade and co-operation agreement among the fishing fleets of all member states.  The current situation is unreasonable and Europe must address it.  Ireland must stand up for our fishing communities at the European Council.</p> <p> The Taoiseach again mentioned the Palestinian situation.  I have said this to him previously, but I wish to say it again.  It is not enough for Europe simply to restate positions and support for a peace process and for a two-state solution.  The challenge for Europe is much more profound than that.  In the face of Israel consistently flouting and breaching international law and in the face of what is an apartheid regime in Israel, what will Europe do?  It is not a question of what it will say, but what it will do.  What will we do?  What will the international community do to bring this to a head and to ensure that Palestinian lives matter, that Palestinian self-determination is realised and that this open wound in the heart of the Middle East that affects all international diplomacy but above all has devastated the lives of men, women and children who have the right to a homeland, who have the right to peace and security, and who have the right to have their human and democratic rights recognised and vindicated?  What will Europe do?  The Taoiseach should ask that question because that is the question on the lips of Irish people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200024#W00200"><p>Undoubtedly, the primary issue facing the EU at this moment continues to be the Covid-19 pandemic followed by how we, both as an independent nation state and as a contributing member of the institution, are to chart the course of economic recovery from the unprecedented events that have occurred since March 2020.  The impact the pandemic has wrought on our economy has been compounded by the added impact of Brexit.  The geographic position that we occupy of having Britain as our nearest neighbour, the political complexities of our relationship with the British and the impact of Brexit on our export economy positions Ireland as the nation most severely impacted by Brexit.  While I welcome the reports that Ireland will receive &euro;1 billion from the EU Brexit adjustment reserve fund, it is imperative that these funds find their way to where they are most needed.</p>  <p>  Significant issues remain to be resolved relating to access to traditional fishing waters by Irish trawlers as a consequence of the failure to safeguard the rights of Irish fishers.  The impact on our coastal and fishing communities is potentially devastating.</p>  <p>  Many of our businesses have made heroic efforts to stay afloat during the pandemic lockdown.  Their ambitions have been reduced to just staying in the game.  This funding must be directed towards keeping people in work and keeping businesses going.  Legislation before the House concerning our maritime jurisdiction offers an opportunity to send a message on the sovereignty of our waters and to put in place the mechanisms required that will allow our nation to harness our natural resources to become a world leader in the development of offshore renewable energy.</p>  <p>  On the issue of Covid-19, the global focus is on the vaccination programmes.  The emergence of new more infectious variants of the Covid-19 virus leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that we are in a race against time to administer vaccines globally before a variant emerges that is immune to existing vaccines.  The threat to global health, the economy and social cohesion concerns us all.  Until all are safe, no one is truly safe.</p>  <p>  It is welcome, therefore, that the European Parliament endorsed a resolution earlier this month calling for a temporary waiver of Covid-19 patents.  The steadfast opposition of the European Commission to this measure is disappointing, even though it alluded to having different plans to accelerate the global vaccine roll-out despite the growing global consensus in favour of the policy of waiving the vaccine patents.  The Government owes an explanation to the House as to why its Members in the European Parliament refused to vote in support of that resolution.  I call on the Taoiseach to answer where Ireland stands following the recent expressions of support for the WTO waiver for Covid-19 vaccines by political leaders in both France and Spain in the aftermath of the adoption of the resolution and the earlier expression of support from the Biden Administration in the US.  </p>  <p>  Migration is one of the most important challenges facing the EU.  Conflict, poverty, persecution and global warming have led to the displacement of millions of individuals in recent years.  It is a political, moral and humanitarian issue.  It is also an issue we cannot discuss without broadening the debate to include the role of Turkey and how the EU's dependence on Turkey to act as a bulwark against migrants attempting to gain access to Europe has undermined the ability of the Union to address some of the more provocative actions that Turkey has taken in recent years, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean.  </p>  <p>  Just this week, the United Nations Human Rights Council heard from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, that we are heading towards a severe cascading of human rights setbacks across the globe.  The situation has been exacerbated by the human rights agenda of the EU having been compromised by its relationship with and dependency on Turkey to help resolve the issue of migration.  The irony is that the continuing erosion of human rights feeds the flow of refugees.  Last year, even though we were amid a global lockdown due to the pandemic, a staggering 82.4 million people were forced to flee war, violence, extreme poverty and human rights abuses.  More than 500 people have already died this year in attempting to cross into Europe.</p>  <p>  We stand on the cusp of potentially horrific humanitarian disasters in both Yemen and Ethiopia.</p> <p>The head of the UN has warned that Yemen is facing into the worst famine in decades and that more than 30 million people in the Tigray region remain at risk of famine.  The failure of the EU to use its influence on the global stage to address these issues while simultaneously examining its current migration policy will inevitably lead to a fresh exodus of migrants fleeing the horrors of famine and conflict.  </p> <p> The decision of the EU yesterday to renew sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, which have been in place since 2014, stands in stark contrast to the tepid response of the EU in regard to the ongoing annexation and apartheid policies of Israel.  Why can the EU not extend the restrictive measures being imposed on Russia?  EU imports emanating from the areas which have been annexed, along with the infrastructural or financial investments in these areas and exports from the EU for use in transport and telecommunications, gas, oil and mineral exploration, are all included, yet the Irish Government's response to the apartheid policies in Israel is to establish an IDA office there.  This is unacceptable.  The citizens of the West Bank and East Jerusalem are entitled to the same consideration as the citizens of eastern Europe.  Ireland being the first country in Europe to formally recognise the reality of Israel's annexation of Palestinian land has given the Irish Government the imprimatur of the D&aacute;il to use the motion on annexation and take it to the European Council.  The Irish Government can use its voice within the European Union to call for Brussels to support measures to review and downgrade its economic, cultural, military and diplomatic relationships with Israel until the occupation fully ends.</p> <p> Ireland can become the first EU country to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements through the enactment of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  The Irish Government has been given the authority to use its voice and seat on the UN Security Council to support the efforts of the International Criminal Court to investigate potential war crimes in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  It is not good enough to make statements of condemnation and to pass resolutions within this D&aacute;il and not take meaningful action.  The Taoiseach has the mandate of the D&aacute;il to take that voice to the European Council and to urge our European partners to follow suit and take action against the apartheid policies.</p></speech>

There will be a sharp focus on Covid-19, the vaccination situation across the European Union and the post-Covid economic recovery plan, all of which relate to our business and our prospects as a country.  A number of related matters are important to us.  I will briefly touch on a few of them.</p>  <p>  On the roll-out of the vaccines and vaccine acquisition, after a slow start it is reasonable for the Taoiseach to suggest that the co-operation agreement across Europe in acting jointly on vaccine acquisition has been the right one, but our experience with individual companies has not been uniform.  As it turns out, Pfizer BioNTech has been the workhorse of the vaccine programme in this country and in many others.  Its delivery has been reliable, its word honoured and its contract good.  The same cannot be said of AstraZeneca and that has posed real issues for us.  The cohort of people in their 60s, who are among the most vulnerable in terms of age according to the criteria set by the Taoiseach and the Government, have not been fully vaccinated because they are still awaiting their second dose of AstraZeneca.  I hope that when the Taoiseach or the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, are concluding this debate, they will make it crystal clear that, as per the schedule set out, everyone in that cohort who has received their first dose of AstraZeneca will get their second dose by mid-July, as expected, and that AstraZeneca is committed to providing those vaccines.  In terms of the planning for vaccination next year and so on, the Taoiseach touched on that during Leaders' Questions.  There are questions to be set straight in regard to the necessity for booster doses for those who have received the Janssen vaccine and the availability and timeline for same.  We will return to that on another occasion.  </p>  <p>  Another important aspect is the issue of free movement of European citizens, one of the four pillars underpinning the legal framework of the European Union.  The EU digital Covid certificates are to be issued from next month and Ireland is to participate.  I sincerely hope that commitment becomes a reality.  On the post-pandemic recovery plan, there is a lack of clarity in how the financial supports set out are to be made available to Ireland.  The Taoiseach mentioned the recovery and resilience facility.  That facility consists of &euro;672.5 billion, of which less than half, or &euro;312.5 billion, is grant aid.  According to the Taoiseach's statement, of that &euro;672 billion Ireland is to receive of the order of &euro;915 million, which is a very small percentage for Ireland.  According to the EU Commission website, the &euro;915 million is EU and national funds.  I would like to have underscored exactly how much money Ireland will get and when we will get it.  </p>  <p>  Other issues that will be discussed include Russia.  The May conclusions pointed to a stark underlining of the worsening of the relationship between the EU and Russia.  In those conclusions, the Council condemns "illegal, provocative and disruptive Russian activities against the EU, its Member States and beyond".  Those are very strong words from the EU in relation to Russia.  We have since had the cyberattack on the HSE and the Department of Health.  We understand that the cyberattack emanated from a criminal gang based in St. Petersburg.  Has the Government raised directly with the Russian authorities what action they have taken to find out how this group operates, if they will take action to ensure those involved are brought to justice and if they will co-operate with Ireland in that regard?</p>  <p>  Turkey was mentioned.  The human rights record of President Erdoğan is shocking.  We depend on Turkey to absorb migrants that want to come to this country and to the European Union.  I listened to other Deputies mention this and they are right, but the solution to that is not so evident.  If we do not depend on Turkey, what do we do?  There are 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.  A shocking number of people have been dislocated, thrown out of their own countries fearing persecution.  Not only are there 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, there are 400,000 others from Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere.  We need to have a different dialogue with Turkey and to not become complicit with the human rights abuses that are ongoing in that state.  </p>  <p>  In the time remaining to me, I want to mention the Israel-Palestine conflict.  There is a new Israeli Government and, I hope, a prospect for a new initiative.  As I said in the last three contributions I made on this issue, we get very focused when there is conflict and we then lose our focus when the conflict results in ceasefire but the underlying reason for that conflict - the annexation - continues.</p> <p>We need a very clear proactive initiative by Ireland and like-minded countries to bring about a two-state solution once and for all, as opposed to the endless talk about such a solution.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to do so in light of the new Israeli Government.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that this summit did not reach any substantial conclusions with regard to climate change and reductions in carbon emissions.  The EU agreed last year to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2030, having regard to the 1990 levels, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  However, no agreement was reached as to mechanisms to be used to reach these targets.  It is reported that Poland in particular put forward objections on the basis of its continued reliance on coal.  In any event, we await the &quot;Fit for 55&quot; package from the European Commission.  Achieving these targets will be challenging for all member states but we have no choice but to proceed with this agenda with haste.  Ireland in particular is rising to the challenge with the recent passing of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>A lot of time at the May meeting of the European Council was spent discussing the situation in Belarus and the state-sponsored hijacking of a civilian aircraft, which the Taoiseach mentioned.  We cannot move on from this issue.  What do we now know about the fate of the Belarusian journalist and opposition activist, Roman Protasevich, and his partner, Sofia Sapega?  We must continue to call for their release and for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus.  The EU must continue to take strong action to deal with the unacceptable situation in Belarus.  The issue of Belarus must not slip down the EU agenda.  I welcome the commitment the Taoiseach has just made to the effect that Belarus will be on the agenda of this forthcoming meeting of the European Council.</p><p>I take this opportunity to welcome the outcome of the Brexit adjustment reserve negotiations.  It has been confirmed that Ireland is to receive approximately &euro;1 billion out of a total fund of &euro;5.4 billion.  This is a great achievement for Ireland.  The Taoiseach and all involved in the negotiations, including the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, can be very satisfied with the outcome.  Ireland is one of the member states most affected by Brexit and it is clear that our EU partners have shown solidarity with us.  We now need to ensure that this funding is given to those who need it most.  By this I mean the business and economic sectors most affected by Brexit and, the fishing industry in particular. </p><p>US President Joe Biden recently attended the G7 summit in Cornwall.  He went on to have meetings with the EU, NATO and Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  It is welcome that President Biden raised the issue of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Good Friday Agreement with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He started by proposing a <i>d&eacute;marche</i>to the Brexit minister, David Frost.  The President has steadfastly supported the need to implement the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and has requested that the specifics and modalities as to the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol be finalised as soon as possible.  I hope his words will not fall on deaf ears.  In response, the UK Prime Minister said that he will do whatever it takes to protect the territorial integrity of the UK.  This is obviously rhetoric meant more for a domestic audience.  The trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK and the Northern Ireland protocol have nothing to do with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the Prime Minister knows that.</p><p><i>The Irish Times</i>reports today that the Taoiseach has suggested to European leaders that an extension to the grace period in which EU regulations governing the importation of chilled meets to Northern Ireland are not applied should be granted.  This is a sensible and practical suggestion.  We need to be sensitive to the political situation in Northern Ireland.  Such an extension would calm tensions and allow for constructive negotiations to continue.  I also welcome the ongoing support and solidarity of EU Heads of Government on this issue.  It is reported that French President, Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President, Charles Michel, all took the UK Prime Minister to task on this matter in their recent meetings with him.  Such solidarity has been unfailing since the Brexit nightmare started on 23 June 2016, five years ago, almost to the day.  </p><p>Ireland is not a member of NATO, but we have to take note of the fact that NATO declared China a security threat at its recent meeting.  Of specific concern are the persecution of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong.  These concerns were also referred to in the G7 communiqu&eacute;.  There are other concerns about China which I do not want to go into today.  Ireland has good relations with China but we need to highlight these human rights issues at the EU, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council.  The EU is divided as to how to respond to China's activities at this time for various reasons.  The cornerstones of Irish foreign policy, however, are rules-based multilateral diplomacy and the promotion of basic, fundamental human rights.  Those issues arise to a great degree in respect of China.</p><p>I have no doubt but that the European Council meeting will devote some time to the Covid-19 position and the prevalence of the Delta variant.  I ask that the summit take decisions on vaccinations in developing countries and on the question of global vaccine inequity.  As we all know, nobody is safe until everyone is safe.  The COVAX scheme is a good one and it is working but it needs more financial support.  While Europe and the western world generally appear to be getting a grip on the pandemic, the same cannot be said of developing countries.  We are morally bound to assist them financially and in any other way we can.</p><p>In passing, I pay tribute to UNICEF for its Get a Vaccine, Give a Vaccine campaign.  The former Minister of State, Peter Power, is the executive director of UNICEF Ireland.  Its advocacy for increased vaccine sharing deserves our support.</p><p>I also acknowledge the fact that Ireland's national recovery and resilience plan has now been finalised.  Ireland is to receive &euro;1 billion or thereabouts from the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility, which is the centrepiece of the next generation EU.  Whatever about its response to the securing of vaccines in the first place, the EU has not been found wanting when it comes to the need for economic recovery following the pandemic.  The initiation of this EU fund is unprecedented in many ways and signals that the EU can effectively respond to crises in a practical and timely way.  The Irish plan aims to advance the green transition, accelerate and expand digital reform and transformation, bring about social and economic recovery and create jobs.  It has been integrated into our recently announced economic recovery plan.  The Government must proceed with all haste to bring about our post-pandemic economic recovery, which all of us await.  </p><p>I note that there are several other issues on the agenda of the meeting of the European Council, including relations with Turkey and the issue of migration.  Of course, Turkey has a big role to play in respect of that issue.</p> <p>In addition, the summit will revert to the issue of relations with Russia.  That is an issue of much concern to many Deputies and we await the outcomes in that regard.</p> <p> I welcome the contribution of the Taoiseach regarding the role Ireland is playing on the UN Security Council.  Ireland is very much active on the global agenda and the issues of the day that are of concern to the United Nations and countries throughout the world.  I believe we are making a major contribution in resolving many of the intractable issues in global politics at this time.  I welcome the report the Taoiseach gave in that regard.</p> <p> I wish the Taoiseach well for his meeting.  I have no doubt that he will keep the flag flying.  Obviously, the question of how Europe recovers from the pandemic is big on the agenda, as are the lessons to be learned.  There will be significant changes as a result of all our experiences with the pandemic in terms of work practices and so many other facets of our lives.  It will be interesting to see what the summit comes up with in that regard, how lessons can be learned and how economic recovery will be rolled out for the EU and the member states.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200027#Z00200"><p>Next week, we may have agreement on the next Common Agricultural Policy.  I raised the CAP process with the Taoiseach two weeks ago and he accused me of being anti-European.  I raised the CAP with the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy McConalogue, last week and he accused me of wanting all decisions to be made at European level.  It would be appropriate for Fianna F&aacute;il to learn that it is possible to defend Irish family farmers both at Irish and EU levels.  Given that so many of the policies, standards and regulations that guide the work of family farmers are being decided at European level, it is absolutely appropriate that an Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would fight on their behalf at EU level.  However, that is not what we have had from the Government.</p>  <p>  In fact, one of the first actions of the Taoiseach on taking office last year was to sign off on a really bad European budget deal.  That budget negotiation - I am being generous by referring to it as a negotiation - saw the proportion allocated to agriculture reduce from 37% to 30% and therein lies the crux of the challenges we now face.  There was no word of flexibility on whether Ireland would agree to or have any flexibility regarding how the &euro;13 billion of the so-called common defence fund, the centralised military structure now to be created within the EU, would be allocated.  There was no sense of or argument in terms of flexibility for the hundreds of billions of euro that will be spent on various other streams of the European budget that will bring virtually no benefit to the Irish people.</p>  <p>  The first indication that the Irish Government was the defender of sovereignty and the need for flexibility at a national level came when at a European level there were proposals that would take money away from those such as Larry Goodman and the sheikhs and put it into the hands of family farmers.  All of a sudden, the Government became the defender of the Irish people.  Of course, that is a ruse because, despite arguing for flexibility and sovereignty, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine acknowledged in the House last week that he has no intention of bringing before the Houses of the Oireachtas the CAP strategic plan that will outline how he intends to use the flexibility for which he has been fighting so hard and actually stalled the CAP talks.  The Minister should speak to his constituents in County Donegal.  What he would hear might surprise him.  They see very little difference in terms of the outworkings of decisions made by bureaucrats in Brussels or in Agriculture House.  They are all bureaucrats at the end of the day.  What people want are decisions that are made in the best interests of rural communities and family farmers.  Therefore, today is an appropriate day for the Government to come clean regarding its intentions.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy McConalogue, appears to be the only person with any interest in Irish farming who does not have a position on the key elements of the next CAP.  He has no position on how much should be redistributed in the context of convergence even though his fellow spokesperson on agriculture while in opposition for Fianna F&aacute;il during the last CAP talks organised public meetings the length and breadth of the country, slamming the then Fine Gael Government for refusing to support redistributive measures.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appears to be the only person who does not have a position in respect of whether there should be front-loading and what proportion of acreage should be allocated to front-loading, a position and proposition that would disproportionately support and benefit farmers in his constituency.  The Minister says he supports an upper limit CAP payment in terms of the payments that any single entity can receive and that he supports that level being at &euro;60,000 but he has not put on the record clearly that he is going to fight against any discretion or opt-outs that would allow people to continue to draw down the obscene sums that we have again seen in recent weeks.  He still has not articulated whether he has put that proposition to the European negotiations or whether he is willing to stall the negotiations a second time if it means that those on obscene payments would continue to be allowed to do so under the current arrangements.  Next week will tell a big story.  I hope we will finally reach a point where an Irish Government and an Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine go to Brussels and actually fight for Irish family farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200027#Z00300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach <i>in absentia</i>not just for his detailed preview of the upcoming European Council meeting, but also for his review of the previous European Council meeting which I particularly appreciated.  As I said at the time, it was disappointing that the House was unable to have stand-alone statements on it, but I truly appreciate the opportunity the Chamber had to have an extensive and meaningful debate on the situation in Belarus in light of the downing of an Irish-owned aeroplane there.  I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in terms of a further update on the situation in Belarus and activity at a European level in respect of how we can continue to tackle the flagrant breaches of international law as well the absolutely despotic regime being run by a dictator in Belarus.  Ireland has a strong and prominent role to play in this regard.  This cannot be simply a one-time-only debate that we ignore when the issue no longer seems apparent.  We have deep and meaningful ties to that part of the world and, moreover, the very worrying contagion that comes out of such a regime in Belarus and the efforts of non-state actors supported and protected by the regime in Belarus and the money men in Moscow is extremely concerning.  One only has to look to the recent cyberattack on the HSE to see exactly how damaging that can be for all in society.</p><p>The first issue on which I wish to focus in advance of the very important meeting of the European Council later this week is, obviously, that of the pandemic.  There is much to compare and discuss in spite of the air of cautious optimism in this country that the vaccination rate is going extremely well.  The HSE and all those involved deserve much credit in that regard.  I am delighted, as, I am sure, is the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, that the vaccination programme has made its way down to registering those in their 30s, although the Minister of State may have a while to wait yet.  A significant part of this issue is a reopening strategy across Europe in the context of looking at other European countries that got things right and taking the warnings where they got things wrong.  I know many Members may be quite envious to see crowds of 12,000, 25,000 or even full stadiums at the European Championships while we are still running test events.  It is disappointing but perhaps it shows what we can achieve and how we can work against the very worrying rise of the Delta variant.</p><p>In his opening remarks, the Taoiseach referred to the progress on the digital Covid certificate.  I have no doubt many Members will refer to this issue in this debate and have consistently raised it in recent months.  It is vital for Ireland on every level.</p> <p>We think in this regard of our airline industry, which has been decimated, and our airline staff, whose representatives we have all met outside both this building and Leinster House in recent weeks.  We think about the correspondence we have received.  Crucially, we think about those who have been apart from loved ones for more than a year.  We also think about the many small and medium-sized businesses up and down the country that depend on safe and reliable overseas visits for their patronage.</p> <p> I want to raise an issue on which I am seeking clarity and in respect of which the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, said earlier today on the radio that there are plans afoot.  I refer to the need to ensure the digital Covid certificate is available to Irish citizens around the world who have received recognised vaccinations.  Among the people who may not have been vaccinated in this jurisdiction are Irish citizens living in the UK who have had an EU-approved vaccine, whether AstraZeneca or otherwise.  They must be able to access the digital certificate.  It is crucial that people in Ireland have access to the certificate, as well as those in Northern Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, whether we can get clarification that people in Northern Ireland will be allowed to access the digital Covid certificate.  This issue has been raised a number of times by my colleague, Senator Currie, in the Upper House.  It is vitally important that we have an element of joined-up thinking on this island when it comes to the digital certification system.  In dealing with the pandemic, we have seen that when we worked together, when, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Swann, had meetings together, it was for the betterment of everyone on this island.</p> <p> The issue into which I will segue from that point relates to the discussions on economic recovery that are due to take place at the Council meeting.  We had a lengthy, although slightly fragmented, debate in this Chamber on the EU's recovery and resilience plan.  It kind of became a free-for-all discussion on the national development plan and every sort of funding that may be available.  The &euro;950 million allocated to Ireland under the recovery and resilience scheme is vital and we must see progress in that regard at European level.  We need that funding at this critical time, as we come out of the pandemic.  Crucially, and I hate to say it, we need to have the preparations done and everything in place for the next time we may need that type of funding.  The groundbreaking decision that the EU would be able to generate own resources and float eurobonds is very welcome, particularly for a small member state such as Ireland that has, at times, borne the brunt of European solidarity in terms of the response to the financial crisis.  It is an important development for the whole of the EU and it provides a major opportunity.</p> <p> In that context, we must also pay close attention to the delivery of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  The funding of more than &euro;1 billion announced last week for Ireland, which makes us the member state getting the largest part of the first &euro;5 billion tranche, is important.  We will have to wait a couple of months until we see those funds in accounts, which is completely understandable.  I would like to see a discussion taking place on this issue at European Council level and Eurogroup level.  I understand the latter is to meet with the Council in due course.  We need to ensure account is taken of the sectors in Ireland that need the supports available under the Brexit adjustment reserve.  I refer to the sectors most impacted by Brexit, including agrifood, and logistics and freight exports.  We need to consider how we can use the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, together with the overall recovery and resilience fund and, indeed, the general Government strategy, to mitigate the difficulties and challenges associated with the sorry state of affairs that is Brexit but also to realise the opportunities that arise out of it.</p> <p> We must use European Council meetings and any other opportunity we can to ensure we make the most of Irish exporters having access to the word's largest economic bloc.  The volume of exports from Ireland to the Continent simply must increase.  They are at record levels but we can do much more.  There are traditional markets and products in respect of which Ireland has good business relations on the Continent, including in France and Germany, but we also need to look further afield.  We must look at the requirements of other large European economies, where, I would argue respectfully, we are simply not performing.  We can do much more, for instance, in the Nordic countries.  I note that the Taoiseach is to have a side meeting with the Nordic Prime Ministers.  There are huge opportunities in that regard.  We also need to look at countries such as Italy and Poland and how we can further develop our trade with them.  I repeat my call that the overall review of our foreign missions should consider the additional economic and consular opportunities that arise, having regard to the success of the second consulate offices in Lyons and Frankfurt and, in particular, the additional consulates in Great Britain, in Cardiff and Edinburgh, with another soon to be opened in the northern powerhouse region.  We need to see much more of that happening across the Continent.  We must, in due course, have consulates in Barcelona, Milan, Gdansk and the many other cities that offer real opportunities for Irish businesses impacted by Brexit to diversify and reap the opportunities of access to the world's largest economic bloc, the Single Market.</p> <p> A very important issue that will, of course, be discussed at the upcoming Council meeting is one the Taoiseach referred to in the opening lines of his statement.  That is the fallout, for want of a better word, from the G7 summit ten days ago.  We have discussed it in this Chamber and in a range of contexts.  We must be serious in expressing to our European colleagues that significant concerns remain in this Parliament and this country regarding the impact of the British Government's treatment of the Northern Ireland protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  Even today, we see Lord Frost continuing to operate as a one-man propaganda machine in doing down the very protocol he negotiated and criticising the EU.  He should be back in the room, whether with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič or with people on the British side such as Michael Gove and the Prime Minister, talking about what this British Government negotiated and ratified, on the basis of which it won an 80-seat majority.</p> <p> We must look at the areas of the protocol that need to be implemented.  A very interesting study was released recently, with comments by Matthew O'Toole, an MLA in the Northern Ireland Assembly, about how no one is talking up the advantages of the protocol for Northern Ireland.  We have seen, for example, a massive investment in one Northern Irish factory that produces whey protein and all the opportunities it will have to export, not just to the market in Great Britain but also to the Single Market.  The message that must come from the European Council is the same message we have been getting from our European partners, including the Heads of State in Germany, Italy and France as well as the European Commission and Council Presidents, all of whom attended the G7 summit, namely, that the British obligations under the protocol simply must be met.  We appreciate that things are difficult in Northern Ireland.  There is, to put it mildly, an ongoing element of change in political unionism.  Where there are concerns, they should, of course, be addressed.  Ireland should always play a proactive and productive role within European circles to ensure the protocol is applied reasonably.  However, that comes with the requirement that the British Government meet its legal obligations and act responsibly in respect of the international treaty it signed months ago.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address the House and the Taoiseach for his remarks.  I look forward to the reply from the Minister of State in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200028#AA00200"><p>I want to discuss two issues.  The first is the upcoming review of the EU's fiscal rules and the second is the reforms Ireland was requested to make as a requirement of accessing the Recovery and Resilience Facility.  In March last year, the European Commission suspended the fiscal rules by activating the general escape clause.  Those rules place limitations on member states' deficit and debt levels and, as such, have a significant impact on the economic performance of member states and the EU as a whole.  There was some irony in the timing of the suspension, as it occurred just as the long-awaited review of the fiscal governance framework was to begin.  The speed at which the rules were suspended gives a clear indication of their procyclical nature.  There was widespread recognition that, following the previous financial crisis, they served to stymie recovery, acted as a rationale for austerity and meant the eurozone spent a decade teetering on the brink.  Fortunately, last year's suspension of the rules allowed member states to engage in the kind of countercyclical deficit spending that was necessary to prevent the worst from happening.  The President of the Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, said at the time that "national governments can pump [money] into the economy as much as they need".  It goes without saying that this was a far cry from the response to the previous crisis.</p>  <p>  The review of the fiscal rules is scheduled to recommence later this summer.  The Commission is widely expected to put forward proposals for simplifying the rules, thereby providing greater incentives for productive investment and changes to debt levels.  The question is whether the changes will go far enough.  The European Parliament has just produced its draft report containing proposals for reform and I was very disappointed to see they do not go nearly far enough.  The Commission will soon seek submissions from members states and interested parties and it is essential that this State has its say.  I hope the Government will outline what its position will be in this regard.  The rules are now nearly 30 years old and, as long as they have been with us, so, too, have been the calls for their reform.</p> <p>Reforms proposed have included exempting public investment, cyclically adjusting the 3% ceiling, shifting from a deficit ceiling to a public debt ceiling, swapping the system of fiscal rules for fiscal standards, and so on.  <br/><br/>At a bare minimum, we need to introduce a golden rule that would exempt member state investment in green and social capital infrastructure from debt and deficit considerations.  I cannot see how a new European green deal and just transition will be possible without such a measure.  The report of the European Parliament considers a golden rule, but it is so restrictive that it is unlikely that most member states will qualify.  In the absence of this, I cannot see how we will reach our climate targets.  Yet, I already detect the obsession with fiscal discipline being prioritised above all other concerns.  That is creeping back in.  It is exemplified in the article by former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, published recently in <i>The Financial Times</i>, which called for a hasty return to fiscal contraction.  Thankfully, a response was written and signed by almost 150 economists, stating that the exact opposite of that is what is now required.  Not only does Europe need expansionary fiscal policies, we need fiscal rules that support public investment and do not straight-jacket policymakers from engaging in the kind of expenditure required to meet the needs of the moment.  We need more economic sovereignty to make decisions based on our conditions and needs.  <br/><br/>Lastly, I wish to address the issue of the conditionality that was attached to the access of states to the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the concerning request by the Government for confidentiality.  The European Council examined the recovery plans for the EU.  The Government has now submitted its plans.  It has been confirmed that Ireland requested the Commission to redact certain sensitive information from its recovery and resilience plan as officially submitted on 28 May 2021.  It is deeply concerning that such a large amount of public money is subject to privacy conditions.  We need confirmation of when the entire plan will be published.  We need a full list, without any redactions, of the reforms that the State has committed to implementing.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the EU's so-called country-specific recommendations made specific demands on Ireland to reform certain tax rules and schemes.  A full account must be given of how the Government intends to meet these recommendations in its national plan through changes to tax law over the coming years.  The fund is significant and it is a welcome aid to our recovery, but the people must know what agreements were reached in return for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200029#BB00200"><p>I wish to raise a specific question that was put to me.  I do not expect the Minister of State to answer now, but I would appreciate it if he could get back to me.  On the issue of the EU digital Covid certificate and plans for travel within the EU, a person asked me  very valid question.  In the case of a person who has been told by their doctor - not through scepticism about vaccines - that because of a particular condition they have, they cannot be vaccinated, is that person going to be discriminated against in their ability to travel, when others who are vaccinated are allowed to travel?  It is a fair question.  People who are in that situation deserve an answer on it.  They should not be discriminated against.  If it is decided at a certain point that based on vaccination, people are allowed to travel, or particular conditions around international travel resuming within the EU, green listed countries or whatever are introduced, there should not be unfair discrimination against people who, through no fault of their own and because of particular conditions, are unable to be vaccinated.  That is a specific question on which I hope to get a response.</p>  <p>  The main point I wish to make concerns the references to Palestine and the discussions around Palestine.  The Taoiseach's references to the discussion were fairly minimal in just saying that there was a restatement of the commitment to the two-state solution.  I wish to assert that the two-state solution is not a solution.  It has been tried since the Oslo Accords were concluded and it has been an absolute disaster.  By the way, it essentially legitimises and accepts the principal of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and the ethnic-religious partition of people who used to live in one country as equals, but who were ethnically partitioned.  Imagine if somebody said that the two-state solution in Ireland was a legitimate solution.  I think many of us would baulk at that.  Yet, we continue to go on about a two-state solution, which is, in effect, legitimising and endorsing the ethnic-religious partition of the land of Palestine.  In fact, to my mind, it is the main basis on which Israel continues to seize Palestinian land and ethnically cleanse Palestinians.  It reinforces the idea that because at some point borders will be fixed, Israel should grab as much land and ethnically cleanse as many Palestinians as possible.  It is having disastrous consequences.  Therefore, it is time to question the two-state solution as an absolutely failed and dangerous fantasy and to start to talk about equality of everybody in the historic land of Palestine, whether they are Jews, Arabs, Christians or have no religion.  We would not accept anything less anywhere else in the world.  Why do we accept the idea of ethnic cleansing and ethnic partition which has been so disastrous for the Palestinians?  </p>  <p>  In that regard, I also ask the Taoiseach why we are practising apartheid against Palestinians when it comes to access to the EU.  Israelis have a visa waiver coming into the EU, but Palestinians do not.  Why are we discriminating in favour of Israel in that regard, as against Palestinians?  Is that not a case of apartheid being practised by Europe and should it not cease?  If we are serious about seeing people as equals in the historic land of Palestine, Israel or whatever you want to call it, why are we treating those two groups of people differently, particularly when Israel behaves quite disgracefully towards EU passport holders who happen to be of Palestinian origin and who enter Israel trying to access the West Bank or Gaza?</p>  <p>  Finally, I appeal to the Government to do everything it can to assist the people of Gaza in the reconstruction effort.  Gaza has suffered four attacks in the past 12 years.  In the latest attack, 1,148 houses were destroyed, 15,000 were damaged and 100,000 people were displaced.  In many cases, people had their homes destroyed for the second, third or fourth time.  We urgently need to get assistance to the people of Gaza to help reconstruct their shattered society, particularly in the area of housing.</p></speech>

It is 52 years this month since the Stonewall uprising, when LGBTQ+ people in New York city rose up against police harassment and violence.  Since that time, the movement for gay liberation has spread to every country in the world.  Every June, the community celebrates and takes stock of the journey travelled and the journey yet to come.  Stonewall's tradition of resistance and struggle lives on, despite attempts by the corporate world to co-opt and monetise the issues.  Here in Ireland, much has been achieved, but homophobia is still alive and kicking, as shown by recent events in Waterford and Ballyfermot.  Meanwhile, the Government failed to challenge the homophobia of the church's new sex education programme for our schools or to insist on objective, factual sex education for our students.</p>  <p>  The EU projects itself as modern and liberal, yet same-sex unions have not been legalised in five countries and same-sex marriage has not been legalised in 13 countries.  In Poland, there is a state-sponsored ideological war against the LGBTQ+ community, and so, too, in Hungary, which banned adoption for same-sex couples late last year and now has banned what it describes as "the display and promotion of homosexuality" among under 18s, thereby criminalising large numbers of young gay people in that country.</p>  <p>  EU governments have been far too quiet on the issue.  The Irish Government has been far too quiet on it.  What does the Minister of State intend to say and do at the European Council?  If governments fail to act, then it will be a revival of the Stonewall tradition, a tradition of militant struggle from below, along with international solidarity, that will hold the key to challenging these regimes and approaches.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200030#CC00100"><p>This week's meeting of the European Council comes at a critical time for many economic sectors in member states.  That is very true for Ireland.  The pandemic has left a trail of damage in its wake, taking the lives of thousands in Ireland and hundreds of thousands across the European bloc.  This has brought significant suffering to Europeans, presenting fundamental challenges to our economy and our way of life.</p>  <p>  From the outset of this crisis, EU member states have acted in good faith with one another, working together to share information and respond to an unprecedented challenge not seen in the past century.  The development of more reliable vaccines in a short time has been nothing short of remarkable.  Moreover, the ability we have demonstrated in terms of solidarity, bearing in mind some early bumps on the road in terms of supply, to efficiently roll out a vaccine to our peoples has given real hope for a timely and much wanted return to an open society.</p>  <p>  As a united bloc, we must now consider the medium-term prospects for the Irish and European vaccination programmes and the economy, both of which are intrinsically linked.  I believe in a strong vaccination response, one that avails of continued co-operation with nation states outside of the EU, as well as pharmaceutical companies and production sites.  We cannot have certainty without open dialogue.  I urge all of our partners to continue to engage with each other to avoid any potential pitfalls.</p>  <p>  I also believe that we in Europe are among the most privileged in the context of vaccines.  From such a position, it is, therefore, right that we ask if we can do more to help ease the burden on nations still struggling to control the virus.  Encouraging a global take-up of vaccines in as short a time as possible will benefit everyone living in Europe and allow us to avoid delays in our reopening.  We know that it is a matter of time before further Covid-19 variants emerge.  We do not yet know what some of these variants might look like and what might be the ramifications of a further aggressive strain emerging.  That is why we must act.</p>  <p>  The European Union has the means and capability to extend the hand of friendship around the world and supply millions with protection from Covid-19 which will, in turn, leave a legacy of hope in what has been an incredibly difficult time for the world.  I commend organisations such as UNICEF on their efforts in providing vaccines to the most vulnerable around the world.  I hope Ireland can also bring the issue to the heart of the UN and advocate for those very same people.  I am aware of COVAX and the European Union's ambition but I would like to see more being done.  Allowing other countries with the facilities to produce vaccines the ability to do so through waiving vaccine patents is a step which should be encouraged.  Like all Members, I was very heartened by the steps in some jurisdictions and by some companies in this regard.  This can transform the speed at which we can reduce the impact of Covid-19 on lives around the world.</p>  <p>  I spoke earlier about the unity in which the EU has acted throughout the pandemic.  We are already on the path to dealing with the recovery in a united manner.  This is evidenced in the EU recovery and resilience plan under which approximately &euro;750 billion will be provided, of which Ireland will receive nearly &euro;1 billion.  However, I would repeat that which has been said by some of my colleagues on the detail of that &euro;917 million package.  The House has not had the opportunity to assess that or to determine what is appropriate in terms of where the money should be expended.  I note from attending various committees over the past number of weeks that no committee has been provided with any information.  That is somewhat of a short-sighted approach to the provision of almost &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  Despite these positive developments, there remains a clear difference between Ireland and the rest of the EU in respect of one critical sector of the economy.  The Ceann Comhairle will not be surprised to hear that is aviation, an issue which I have raised in this House on many occasions over the past number of months.  As has been said countless times over the past 18 months, it was the first and most badly affected industries in Ireland.  However, unlike many industries that were severely curtailed, the aviation sector remains in a situation where it is unclear as to many of the aspects on which it requires clarity in order to fully restore it to its previous position of strength.  Recent reports regarding air traffic in the EU suggest we saw a recovery of up to 50% as compared to 2019.  Air traffic in Ireland, however, is expected to lag behind this average recovering to just 43%.  More disturbing are the recent published figures from the Central Statistics Office which showed that, in April of this year, daily passenger traffic through Irish airports stood at just 4,700 people.  This represents just 4.5% compared to the level seen in 2019.  At that same moment in April of this year, American Airlines was hiring new pilots.</p>  <p>  These figures and facts cannot be ignored.  The alarm bells are ringing and the industry is calling on us to act.  Thousands of jobs are on the line on top of the 4,000 already lost.  Providing a clear path to restoring consistent and safe travel in Ireland is of paramount need.  We must learn from the experiences of other nations and use all available to tools to deal with the issue with the urgency it requires. </p>  <p>  While I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, requesting a trial of antigen testing within the aviation sector, I believe it is several months too late and most certainly will be too late for some within the sector.  It is my firm belief that Ireland should introduce antigen testing for the aviation industry, most especially for vaccinated individuals.  I listened carefully to the transport committee hearing with Dr. Holohan and his colleagues last week.  What was effectively discussed was a second layer of testing alongside PCR.  I do not think that is what other EU nations are doing and I am not convinced it is what we should be doing, particularly as it applies to individuals who have been vaccinated.  We lag behind many of our European partners in this respect.</p>  <p>  We will reap the consequences of that in the event that we do not regularise antigen testing in our travel hubs.  Further clarity must also be given with respect to children who are travelling.  We must acknowledge that children will be among the last to be vaccinated.  While in Europe many parents of young children are vaccinated or due to be vaccinated shortly, this underscores the importance of setting coherent plans for travel.  It will provide clarity to both passengers and the industry as more people begin to plan a return to international travel on 19 July.</p>  <p>  If we are sincere in our commitment to the aviation sector, we must recognise its extraordinary contribution to the Irish economy in supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs, creating billions of euro in revenue and connecting Ireland to the world.  We must put into action what we commit to and deliver results for the industry which we desperately need to help at this time.  An assistance scheme for testing for travel should be provided, as has been provided in other EU member states.  I would like to see Ireland follow those countries.  We are an island off the coast of the world.  We need our aviation sector and we need to find supports for it.  We need these in place before 19 July.</p>  <p>  The digital green certificate is a welcome EU initiative and there is clearly a place for more information to be provided to the public in advance of unfettered travel in July.  It is incumbent on the Government to move appropriately to provide the public information campaign in due course.  As we begin to look towards an increase in return to international travel, the EU should engage with our partners around the world, most notably the UK and the United States, in order to facilitate reciprocal agreements and recognition of official documentation.  The upcoming EU meeting this week is another opportunity to press for these developments which will contribute to providing certainty for the wider travel and hospitality sector.  Our hospitality sector is important and will have a good summer with domestic travel.  It will benefit even more, however, with international travel to these shores.</p>  <p>  Also to be discussed at this upcoming meeting will be the increasing belligerent behaviour of the Russian Government.  For some years now we have seen Russia threaten countries attempting to move towards EU values, interfere with the domestic democratic processes of EU member states and exert its influence on its own people, notably journalists and opposition leaders.  We cannot stand by and allow this behaviour to go unchecked.  To do so would be to encourage all those who have been unfaithful to the principles of democracy around the world, as well as here in Europe.</p>  <p>  Russia is interested in destabilising the EU because all governments which lean towards authoritarianism fear the values that we hold dear, namely, a free press, an independent judiciary and the right of people to freely choose their leaders.  We in Europe learn these developments and values the hard way.  We saw the suffering and pain caused by extreme political ideologies and undemocratic leaders.  We resolved to build a better union, one in which freedom is paramount and despots are unwelcome.  Unfortunately, some lessons of the past cannot be forgotten.</p> <p>We now see member states, namely, Hungary and Poland, in direct contradiction of the values of the EU.  We see those attacks on media and on the courts in an effort to suppress criticism of the government and we should be under no illusion that these events have been welcomed in Russia.  We must send a clear message to Russia, in respect of those who would do their bidding in Europe, that their actions will be met by repercussions.</p> <p> In my remaining minute, I want to talk briefly about solidarity with members of the LGBTQ+ community across Europe.  We have seen infringement of their rights in two member states and have seen further infringements of their rights across other member states in recent months and years.  In Pride month it is appropriate for me, as a member of Parliament in Ireland, to stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters in the gay community right across Europe because it is very important that we recognise that we are all equal and the laws should reflect that.  That is why it is particularly disheartening to see a country like Poland and other countries act in contradiction of the principles of the EU.  There is a context for a wider debate on how there could be consequences for an EU member state if it is found to be acting in a way that is unfitting with the principles of the EU.</p> <p> I wish the Taoiseach well in his upcoming EU meeting and I look forward to our continued co-operation with our EU partners.</p></speech>

We all know NPHET's view on it at this stage, and Dr. Tony Holohan stated that there is an insufficient amount of evidence on antigen testing, particularly around travel and aviation.  There has been a failure and this needs to be rectified quickly, even if it is very late from the point of view of putting a proper pilot testing scenario in place to provide the evidence, so that it can be audited properly and, if as many of us believe, antigen testing is proved to be useful for aviation, that it is put in place.  That needs to be done as quickly as possible as we are way behind the curve on it.</p>  <p>  We welcome the move that is to be made on the digital Covid-19 certificate.  It is Europe operating at its best when one has an element of working together and one has a sensible solution that will be operated throughout the European Union.  We need to ensure that there are no hiccups from our end and that all of the technicalities and the logistics are put in place as soon as possible.  Communication with all stakeholders is necessary.  In regard to 19 July, we need to accept that the aviation sector has been significantly hammered and it does not need anything to happen beyond what has happened with Covid-19.  That which is within our control needs to be sorted out.  We need to ensure we deliver for this sector.</p>  <p>  There has been much talk about certain difficulties around the recovery and resilience funding.  We all welcome the &euro;1 billion funding from the Brexit adjustment reserve fund but we have to ensure that we put these funds where they are necessary from the point of view of economic recovery.  A significant amount of work still needs to be done on that.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned Brexit.  We received great solidarity from across Europe and we have heard the recent statements from Boris Johnson and David Frost.  We have also heard these statements from certain elements of unionism as it goes through the particular difficulties it has at this point in time.  On some level, the British Government is probably providing succour, in that people believe there is a major political move that can be made on the Irish protocol.  This protocol is like the Good Friday Agreement which is there to stay.  Solutions will be found to whatever difficulties there are.  We need to ensure we maintain that element of solidarity and that Britain is left in no doubt that solutions will be found but that the Irish protocol is there to stay.  This, to me, is continuity of the failure of British rule in Ireland and the absolute failure of partition.  Once again we will have to have a proper and real conversation on what a united Ireland will look like and which allow everybody to be part of the conversation.  Then we can have a plan.  Eventually, we will have a referendum.  Everybody in the wider world believes it is going to happen so we need to have a bit of reality check.  In this House, I recognise there have been moves by certain political elements, which are very welcome.  We need to have this conversation, to have the plan and to deliver, following 100 years of absolute failure.</p>  <p>  We really need to look at a TRIPS waiver, even if it is temporary, to ensure the steadiest and biggest supply of vaccines is delivered across the world.  This State, and across this island, we are in a race of vaccines versus the Delta variant.  We need to ensure we reduce the number of variants across the world and that we bring every other state and nation to the place we are in now because none of us are safe until all of us are safe.</p></speech>

What was the delay in putting Ireland's application forward?  The big question remains as to the delay at the European Commission and why we only looked for &euro;1 billion.  I was always taught as a little buachaill &oacute;g going to the shop to look for more than one could get and take one's share then.</p>  <p>  Denmark, which has a similar population to Ireland, is receiving an allocation of &euro;1.6 billion, which is almost double the allocation Ireland is receiving, which is &euro;900 million.  Belgium with a population twice that of Ireland will receive &euro;5.9 billion under this programme, which is three times the allocation Ireland is receiving based on population.  Croatia, with a population less than that of Ireland, will receive &euro;6.3 billion, which is more than six times the allocation of Ireland.  Are we or are our officials the laggards?  Sweden, which has a population of about twice that of Ireland, requested a total of &euro;3.2 billion.</p>  <p>  Here we are the good boys of Europe, where we rock up to say that we are a month late putting in the application.  What are Department officials doing?  This is across all Departments because we cannot get an answer from any of them.  They had better wake up and dust themselves down from Covid-19, look for these answers and pony them up.  We are being blackguarded in Europe and treated like schoolboys in the bold boy corner.  Imagine getting &euro;900 million when other countries with similar populations are getting three or six times as much as we are.  What is going on?  I know that we are the lackeys of Europe where we sold and destroyed our fishing industry and everything else, but this is outrageous.  The Minister of State has a great deal to answer for as has the Taoiseach and everybody else.</p>  <p>  It simply beggars belief that this could be allowed to go on, where we receive such a pittance.  Why would we not accept this when we always take what we get, are the good boys of Europe, pay homage to it always and do not even look for money?  We looked for &euro;1 billion and we received &euro;900 million.  The others looked for &euro;6 billion and they received &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion.  This is crazy stuff and we need answers.</p>  <p>  EU passports are part of a plan.  We discussed EU passports in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Nobody blamed Covid-19 then as it was not an issue.  This is all part of the control.  We are the wonderful boys who will do anything that is asked of us.  We will lie down and let them eat cake.  This is a shocking indictment of our officials and of our country.  That we can come back with that sort of a package, which we applied late for and in such a feeble manner, is scandalous.</p></speech>

We just heard that &euro;750 billion was available.  Ireland is receiving &euro;915 million and other countries are receiving triple this amount even though they are of a similar size.  The Irish application did not prioritise broadband, infrastructure or housing, even though we have a housing crisis.</p>  <p>  I have been in business and self-employed all of my life.

This package, Next Generation EU, is Europe's shared response to the severe health and economic crisis caused by Covid-19.  The European Commission announced on 28 May that it had received an official recovery and resilience plan from Ireland and Sweden.  Sweden, with a population about twice that of Ireland, had requested a total of &euro;3.2 billion in grants under the recovery and resilience facility, RRF, while Ireland had requested a total of &euro;1 billion.  Many of the other figures were outlined by my colleagues Deputies O'Donoghue and Mattie McGrath.  In comparison with other countries, we have been left far behind.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath is correct; we are the good boys in Europe.  We have been the good boys in Europe for decades and we can see what it has cost us.  I plead with the Minister of State, before the fishermen's protest that is to take place tomorrow, to get back out to Europe, fight for the Irish fisherman and farmer, fight for Ireland and not walk away with a bad deal.  We walked away with a shocking deal in regard to Brexit.  We are scared of asking for a slightly higher quota.  We do not want to insult anybody by asking for a bluefin tuna quota for the fishing industry because we might insult other European countries that have very high quotas.  We are an absolute disgrace when we go to Europe.  We are scared.  It is time to stand up, get the best team out there and put up the best fight.  There should be no more good boy attitude.</p>  <p>  Where are we going to be in the CAP negotiations?  Are we going to be the whipping boys again?  Are we just going to give to the wealthy farmer in Ireland and let the small man go, as we have done before?  A total of 40% of farmers in this country get between &euro;1,500 and &euro;5,000 from the CAP.  Will they be neglected again under the CAP agreement?  Will the powers in Europe look after the fat cats and leave behind the ordinary men and women in this country?  It is time to step up and we need the Government to do so.  It failed in regard to fishing but surely he will not fail in regard to agriculture.  If it does, it will have devastating consequences.</p>  <p>  The Government failed to bring this fund to Ireland in a sufficient manner to allow us to have some kind of recovery.  Businesses throughout my county and others, such as pubs and hotels, are starved in the need of funding.  Their doors have not been open for more than 400 days in some cases.  They are in a desperate position and they are getting only meagre money, and that is no wonder because we cannot fight our corner in Europe.</p></speech>

The agenda for the European Council meeting includes Covid-19, economic recovery, migration and external relations, including relations with Turkey and Russia.  Will the leaders also discuss the TRIPS waiver issue and the lack of equity in regard to vaccine distribution and the epidemiological situation pertaining to Covid-19?  "None of us is safe until everyone is safe" is the mantra we keep hearing, but what about the question of what is the morally right thing to do?  We cannot just continue to vaccinate ourselves and say "to hell with everybody else".  That is why migration is such an important issue.  The EU and the wealthy north continue to enjoy that wealth at the expense of the south, and then we wring our hands when people from the south try to get here.</p>  <p>  This is a topic on the Council's agenda, namely, the migration situation on the various routes.  Will the leaders examine which route has resulted in the most deaths?  Are some routes safer for children and babies or is there a data-deficit because bodies have not yet washed up on shores?  That may sound callous and facetious, but the EU's migration policies are callous, cruel and inhumane.  No doubt, the leaders will examine which routes can be easily closed.</p>  <p>  The EU leaders will discuss the implementation of Next Generation EU and recommendations on the economic policy of the eurozone area.  They will talk about the impact of Covid-19 on our economies and the challenges we face, and review progress made on the banking union and the capital markets union.  Will that discussion involve how to make policy more responsive to citizens than to banks and capital markets?</p>  <p>  On 25 March 2021, the Council issued a statement about discussions on relations with Turkey, while at the end of May 2021, it was decided that relations with Russia would be discussed again.  Is it not remarkable that an EU member state that has been a member for 17 years could introduce legislation that discriminates against the LGBTQI+ community?  Just last week, Hungary voted for regressive measures for members of that community who under the age of 18.  Similarly, Poland has also been a member state since 2004 and has been allowed to flout common decency and human rights legislation by having designated LGBT-free zones.  The Hungarian Government has stated that anything that &ldquo;promotes deviation from gender identity, gender reassignment and homosexuality shall not be made available to persons under the age of 18.&rdquo;  A Hungarian LGBT+ group, the H&aacute;tt&eacute;r Society, surveyed about 2,000 people and found that 42% had thought about suicide and 30% had attempted it.  The survey found that 64% of the respondents who had thought about suicide were teenagers.  That is shocking and it should be discussed at EU level.</p>  <p>  This month is Pride month, and people ask why Pride is still needed.  Pride is a protest, and Irish EU leaders must make a stand at this month's Council against these dangerous, outdated and disgusting laws.</p></speech>

I have read a copy of the Taoiseach's contribution and it contains some welcome aspects.  What stood out for me was that he stated that next week, we will have a first discussion of the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on an initial report.  If we have learned anything from this time, it was that we were utterly unprepared for such a pandemic because of our failure in this country to invest in public health and our hospitals.  We will recall what the World Health Organization stated more than a year ago, namely, that the failure to act, on the part of Ireland and other countries, was truly shocking.  I would like to see a transformative action emerge from the Council meeting in order that language will mean something.</p>  <p>  There are many other issues I would like to address but time is limited and some of them, relating to Hungary and Poland and refugees, were mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Pringle.  Some 60 million people have now been displaced, the highest number since the Second World War.  I will use the brief time that remains to focus on Colombia.  I am surprised and shocked that the Taoiseach did not mention the country, given the level of unrest, violence and deaths that has obtained there in the past while, and particularly since April of this year.  I acknowledge that the former T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party is the EU envoy and that he is deepening his understanding of Colombia in regard to this matter as we speak.  Nevertheless, our role on the UN Security Council is a very special and privileged one.  We secured it because of hard work on the part of the Government but also because we are respected as an independent voice.</p>  <p>  I ask that we use that voice and that, at the very least, Colombia be put down on as the number one item on the agenda of the next Council meeting.  The figures are horrific.  The latest protest followed on from those in 2019 and 2020, but the current unrest began at the end of April.  Human Rights Watch has stated that 34 deaths occurred in the context of the recent protest, comprising two officers, one criminal investigator and 31 demonstrators or bystanders.  There are many other figures I could quote but time is limited, so I will outline what two non-governmental organisations on the ground have stated.  They are highly respected NGOs.  They have stated that 43 massacres have been committed in Colombia this year alone, with 164 victims.  They define a massacre as the killing of three or more people in the same place at the same time.</p>  <p>  The protest has become a massive movement for change.  I ask that it be put on the agenda of EU meetings and that we have reports back.  Will the Minister of State clarify when the Minister for Foreign Affairs will report back to the House regarding his role on the UN Security Council?  How are topics on that body's agenda determined?</p> <p>We have a good relationship with Colombia.  I had the privilege of meeting the ambassador in a different role lately.  We have connections going back to Roger Casement.  However, we have to use our voice on what is happening there at present and the unacceptable level of state violence or state-sponsored violence.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has outlined his expectations for the European Council's meeting with the UN Secretary General, Mr. Guterres, and for their discussions on Covid-19, economic recovery, migration and the Euro Summit.  I will now turn to the foreign policy items on the agenda of this week's European Council.</p>  <p>  With regard to Russia, at their last meeting on 24 to 25 May, leaders held a discussion on the EU's strategic relationship with Russia.  In addition to condemning recent illegal, provocative and disruptive Russian activities, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the five principles which have guided the EU's policy towards Russia since 2016.  These five principles are full implementation of the Minsk agreements on the conflict in Ukraine as key to any substantial change in the relationship; strengthened relations with the eastern partnership countries and with Russia's central Asian neighbours; strengthening EU resilience to Russian threats; selective engagement with Russia when it is clearly in the EU's interest, for example, on issues such as counter-terrorism; and support for people-to-people contacts and for Russian civil society as a whole.</p>  <p>  This approach has aided the EU in maintaining unity in its engagements with Russia.  Preserving EU unity is a primary concern for Ireland.  Disunity would result only in weakening our voice and would undermine our credibility, interests and values.  On foot of a leaders' request at the main meeting, the EU's external action service and the European Commission have produced a joint report in line with these principles.  Ireland agrees with its analysis that relations with Russia are unlikely to improve in the short term.  However, it is important we explore paths which could help the current dynamics gradually into a more predictable and stable relationship.</p>  <p>  Ireland will also continue to utilise its bilateral contacts with Russia in support of the overall EU approach.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, spoke with his Russian counterpart, the foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov, on 17 May.  They discussed a range of bilateral and UN Security Council-related issues.  In that conversation, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, raised the EU's concerns around human rights and the oppression of minorities.</p>  <p>  With regard to Turkey, the discussions on relations between the EU and Turkey and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean follows from leaders' discussions by videoconference in March.  At that meeting, it was agreed the EU-Turkey relationship could be developed in a phased, proportionate and reversible manner, provided Turkey sustained its de-escalation in the eastern Mediterranean and adopted a constructive attitude.</p>  <p>  This week, the European Council will assess the situation.  Since the March meeting of the European Council, Turkey has largely refrained from its previous provocative behaviour, such as drilling in the eastern Mediterranean.  Turkey has also engaged bilaterally with Greece at senior levels.  However, Turkey's relationship with Cyprus remains much more complex.  Turkey has unacceptably continued to call for a two-state solution and has continued its construction works in Varosha in northern Cyprus.</p>  <p>  The rule of law and human rights situation in Turkey continues to be of concern.  From Ireland's perspective, there is justification for maintaining a degree of positive momentum, if possible, including through continued co-operation with Turkey on migration.  It is important we continue to support the 4 million refugees in Turkey and their host communities.  Basic humanitarian needs, education and healthcare will remain key priorities for future funding.  However, hand in hand, we will continue to seek concrete steps to improve the human rights situation and the rule of law in Turkey and to express solidarity with Cyprus.</p>  <p>  Although the situation in Belarus was not formally included on the agenda, leaders are expected to return to the situation there.  This was subject to extensive discussion in May, when the European Council agreed on concrete steps to protect our citizens, including introducing new sanctions calling on airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and commencing work to ban Belarusian airlines form EU airspace.  These measures are now either in place or will shortly be so.  Ireland supported the opening of an independent investigation into the incident at a special meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization held on 27 May and this is now under way.</p>  <p>  Ireland has serious concerns for the welfare of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, concerns which have grown in light of the so called confessions which have been released.  We continue to call for their immediate and unconditional release.  The overall situation in Belarus remains grave and violations of human rights continue on a regular basis.  Ireland will continue to highlight these violations and work with its international partners to ensure those responsible are held accountable.  Ireland will take an active role on this issue at the current session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, this House unanimously supported a Government motion condemning the actions of the Lukashenko regime and expressing strong support for the Belarusian people.  It is important we continue to keep this issue high on the international agenda and in doing so, demonstrate the ongoing support of Ireland and the EU for civil society in Belarus.</p>  <p>  In addition to the issues I have outlined, leaders may also raise other current external relations issues.  The agenda for this week's meeting at the European Council is being discussed by EU affairs ministers at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg today.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is representing Ireland at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I wish to thank the Members for their active participation in this debate and the Taoiseach will fully report to the House, following the European Council meeting next week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200033#FF00700"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  	notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; workers in the State make a considerable tax contribution throughout their working life and should have the right to access the full pension rate of payment when they retire at age 65;<br /><br />&mdash; some workers want to retire at age 65, while others want to remain at work, where they are able and willing to do so;<br /><br />&mdash; numerous employment contracts stipulate an end of employment date in line with when an employee turns 65 years of age;<br /><br />&mdash; since the abolition of the State Pension Transition payment, thousands of 65-year-olds have had to sign on for a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment;<br /><br />&mdash; there are now thousands of 65-year-olds who are on the Jobseeker&rsquo;s social welfare rate of &euro;203 per week instead of the State Pension rate;<br /><br />&mdash; there is a difference of &euro;45.30 between the Jobseeker payments and the State Pension, leading to an annual loss of &euro;2,355.60; and<br /><br />&mdash; the pension age had been scheduled in legislation to increase to 67 years of age in 2021, and 68 years of age in 2028; and </blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; commit to restoring the State Pension Transition payment for those retiring at 65 years of age;<br /><br />&mdash; abolish mandatory retirement, with exceptions for security-related employment, to give workers the choice to work or retire so long as they are fit to do so;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that workers who choose to work on, do so on their own terms, and in their conditions of employment they are not compelled to sign fixed- or short-term contracts of employment;<br /><br />&mdash; make provision for those who remain at work beyond 65 years of age to have their Pay Related Social Insurance contributions counted towards their State Pension; and<br /><br />&mdash; commit not to further increase the State Pension age. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>It is not that long since the last election and the message from voters then was very, very clear.  Workers want the right to their pension rate of pay, after a lifetime of work, when they reach the age of 65.  They also want the choice to work on on their same terms and conditions of employment.  In short, workers want choice and I agree with them.  That is what this motion is about.  It is about giving workers a choice and making a public declaration we listened to them in the last election and have not forgotten the message they gave us.</p><p>After a lifetime of work, I and Sinn F&eacute;in believe a worker should be able to retire on the full pension rate of pay.  That was abolished by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 2013.  We want that position reversed and replaced with the choice to access the pension rate of pay at 65 or to work on on the same terms and conditions of employment.  That is an important part of this motion.  We want to see Deputies backing the position that workers should not only have the right to work on when their contract states they must retire at a certain age but that they should not be forced to take lesser or different terms and conditions of employment.  They should have the right to work on on the same terms and conditions.</p><p>I would welcome the views of the Minister of State on this matter, which is important.  There are many reasons for workers wanting to work on, not least of which is the sky-rocketing cost of housing.  They should not have their terms and conditions diminished.  In fact, the State should protect their terms and conditions, when they exercise the right to work on.  There are many workers in arduous employment.  They spend all day on their feet, carrying heavy loads, cleaning and working outdoors in all weathers.  When they get to 65, their shift is done.  They are ready to retire and want the dignity of the pension rate of pay.  They have paid tax all their working lives and want to be able to access the pension rate at 65.</p><p>I do not know that many of us in this House will ever understand what a lifetime of backbreaking work does to a person's body, but we can certainly show empathy and try to understand that many workers are simply not able to continue past the age of 65.</p> <p>Being able to access the pension rate means they can realistically consider stopping work.  If one is waiting tables, laying blocks, stacking shelves, cleaning or doing any other physically demanding work, that extra year makes a huge difference.</p> <p> I understand the Minister of State will read the script, try to deflect from the issues and maybe try to score a few political points but I caution against that.  This D&aacute;il motion gives the Minister of State the opportunity to speak directly to those workers and let them know where he stands on this important issue.  I ask him to address his remarks directly to those workers to let them know if he is prepared to hear their concerns and fears about being denied the pension rate of pay at the age of 65 after a lifetime of work and to outline the Government&rsquo;s position on the right to work past the retirement age stipulated in a worker&rsquo;s contract on the same terms and conditions.  I really want to hear the Government&rsquo;s position on this.  I further ask the Minister of State to recognise the contribution these workers have made during their whole working lives.</p> <p> We often stand in this Chamber and say politics is about making choices.  We have a choice this evening.  Sinn F&eacute;in has chosen to use our time to amplify the very real concerns of these workers about the mean-spirited move to raise the pension age.  We want to use our time to let the Government know that workers want and deserve the choice at the age of 65.  When one hits 65 in this State, the chances are that one has been working and paying tax and PRSI for decades and that one started work believing one would be able to retire at the age of 65.</p> <p> We ask the Government to join us this evening to support older workers and give them dignity.  &ldquo;Dignity&rdquo; is an important word here.  When we talk to people on the doors, which we have the opportunity to do now with the approaching by-election, they say there is dignity in being able to access the pension rate of pay at the age of 65.  We ask the Government to join us in supporting that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200034#GG00200"><p>There is a fundamental difference between the view of the Minister of State and the Government and our view when it comes to retirement.  The Minister of State and the Government think it is appropriate for people at retirement to be paid a jobseeker&rsquo;s rate of &euro;203.  We do not.  The Minister of State and the Government think it is fine for workers who have paid into the social insurance fund for decades - some for 30, 40 or more years - not to be able to access their pension at retirement.  We do not.  To be clear, we seek in this motion to restore the State pension transition for people retiring at 65.  It was a mistake to abolish that in 2014.  I am still waiting for someone in government to tell me what will happen if the proposed pension age increases go ahead.  Will we have a situation where the new benefit payment for 65-year-olds becomes the new benefit payment for 65- and 66-year-olds?  Will there be a gap of two years where people are paid a jobseeker&rsquo;s rate, losing out on over &euro;4,700 in that time?  We must be the only country in the world to place people who are retiring on a jobseeker&rsquo;s rate payment.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State will tell us how adequate our State pension rate is and he will probably compare it to the rate in the North.  That is not in question this evening.  The rate in question is &euro;203 per week.  That rate is far from adequate; in fact, it is set below the poverty line.  When one talks about adequacy, one does not talk about the cost of living.  A EUROSTAT report was issued today showing that prices in Ireland for goods and services are the joint second highest in Europe and were 36% higher than the average across the EU last year.  We are one of the most expensive countries in Europe for food.  Utility bills are 78% more expensive than the EU average.  We really should leave the argument in relation to how adequate our rates are right there.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will also tell us there is no mandatory retirement age in Ireland, which ignores the reality that every year people are forced to retire at the age of 65 because they are contractually obliged to do so.  This is an issue and was acknowledged as such in the last D&aacute;il when a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to abolish mandatory retirement was passed unanimously.  We need to progress that.</p>  <p>  We should let people remain at work if they wish and are willing and able to do so.  We should also let them continue to contribute their PRSI into the social insurance fund.  That is a win-win situation.  This is committed to in the programme for Government but it can only be of benefit if we allow for longer working lives.</p>  <p>  I expect the Minister of State will use the North not just to compare what is beyond comparison in relation to the rates but also to highlight the fact the North has a state pension age of 66, without putting on the record the reality of the North, which is important to do.  Westminster determines the pension age and decided to increase it to 66.  If we departed from that, we would have to cover the cost out of the tiny block grant we get to run the North.  The Minister of State will also know we have extremely limited revenue-raising powers in the North.  It is important to put that on the record because it is common practice in here for the Government to use the North in debates like this, rarely in any positive way.  It shows an arrogance and ignorance on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to throw an argument like that out.  It shows a lack of information as to how the North works.</p>  <p>  We make no apology for reiterating the calls clearly made by the people in the polls last February in the general election and saying we need to put an end to the mad situation of, first, telling people they can no longer do their job at 65 and, second, telling them they have to retire having done their work and contributed for decades and will receive a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;203.  It is an insult.  The people have said it and been clear.  We are saying it and we are clear.  I hope the Government considers supporting this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200034#GG00300"><p>Every year, workers are forced out of their employment for no reason other than they have turned 65 years of age.  Irish law allows their age to be the defining factor on whether they can continue in employment, regardless of their ability to carry out the work.  This is possible because Irish law allows employers to impose mandatory retirement ages on staff contracts of employment, facilitating ageism within the workplace and creating a set of second-class employment rights for older workers.</p>  <p>  Every worker in the State makes a significant and valuable contribution during their working lives.  We talk about looking after older people who have contributed to the State throughout their lives, yet we force them onto the dole queue when they hit 65.  We all know the vast majority of people at 65 will not get a job.  At a time when citizens should be able to take their foot off the gas or continue working, this Government wants them to sign on the dole.  It is a charade in which the Government is forcing older people to take part.  To make matters worse, it wants them to take part in the charade for less money than they would have got on their pension.  That is rubbing salt into the wounds.</p>  <p>  Workers should have the right to retire at 65 with their State pension or the freedom to remain in work if they so decide.  The Government cannot keep moving the goalposts when it comes to the retirement age for the State pension, from 65 to 66, and to 67 in the new year.  The Government&rsquo;s next move will be to increase the pension age to 68.  Where will it stop?  That is a real concern.  A pension age of 68 would be one of the highest in the OECD.  If someone wants to retire at 65, that should be their choice, taking into consideration their physical, mental and family circumstances.  They must also have the choice to work on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200034#GG00400"><p>I thank my colleagues, Deputies O'Reilly and Kerrane, for bringing forward this important motion.</p> <p>As other speakers have mentioned, increasing the pension age was a significant issue on the doorsteps in the last general election.  I did not hear anyone disagree with our proposal at any of the meetings or debates I attended, so I do not think there will be any difficulty with everyone supporting the motion before the House this evening.</p> <p> As a society, we should be striving to ensure that if people want to retire at 65, the choice is theirs.  If people want to continue to work, that is their personal choice but they should not have to continue to work.  People should be able to retire at 65 if they wish.  A number of employment contracts stipulate an end-of-employment date in line with when an employee turns 65.  Since the abolition of the State pension transition payment, thousands of 65-year-olds have had to sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  I have come across many people who do not want to put themselves through the experience of having to sign on for any sort of transitional payment.  They feel they have worked hard.  Many of those we are talking about have been working since they were teenagers.  They feel they should be able to get the pension at 65 rather than having to avail of an in-between payment or jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p> I also wish to refer to women in the context of pensions.  Although women outnumber men among the over-65 age cohort, women only account for a third of those in receipt of a full State contributory pension.  The National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, has called for a rethink of our pension policy to become one that places equality and living with dignity in older years at the centre.  I wish to mention that in particular because once again we have women being failed by the State.  I do not think any of us are surprised by that at this stage, but it is an important issue.</p> <p> Many people in receipt of a pension have often said they feel like a forgotten category in the country.  Their cost of living has increased and every now and again they get a paltry &euro;5 increase.  It is important that we remember them.  The cost of living does not reduce just because one turns 65 or 66.  Sometimes, it is very difficult for elderly people to live on a pension, in particular when they are more dependent on medical services and have increased fuel costs.  We are great at setting up age-friendly initiatives and other such initiatives, but we are not very good at following through on actions that support them.</p></speech>

They have been promised that they would be paid once they reach 65 and that they would be looked after by society.  That is not the case.  As other speakers have mentioned, utilities in this country cost a fortune.  Most pensioners I know are worried about where the money is going to come from to maintain their houses, pay their rent if their landlord increases the rent or throws them out, or for food.  They know that what little savings they have will not last.  While people should have the right to remain in work, they should also have the right to retire at 65 as they have been promised.  The pension they have paid into should be fit for purpose in order that they can enjoy their retirement, and not just survive it.</p></speech>

People should be entitled to retire at the age of 65 on a full State pension if that is their choice.  It is unacceptable that they are expected to sign for jobseeker's benefit at the age of 65.  The decision to get rid of the State pension transition payment was cynical and that must be reversed.  The sum of &euro;45 a week might not sound like a lot of money to some, but it makes a big difference to people who are struggling to make ends meet.  It is heartless to expect people to wait for their pension and then to go on and penalise them in the process.</p>  <p>  People had their voices heard during the last election.  They told us they want the option to retire at 65.  Talk of increasing the pension age to 67 or 68 targets those who are in the last few years of their working life.  The Government is seeking to move the goalposts just when these people are looking forward to retiring.  This debate should be about giving people a choice.  Many people want to work beyond the age of 65, even well into their 70s.  They should have the right to do that if they feel fit to do so, but we must act now and give people a right to access their pension at the age of 65 if that is what they want to do.  They have worked and contributed to their pension for 40 or 50 years.  The Government cannot continue to treat those reaching the age of 65 with such disrespect.  They have been the backbone of every sector in society for the past four or five decades and they deserve to be treated with dignity by the Government.  I hope everybody will support the motion tonight.</p></speech>

It featured heavily in last year's election, but even before that because it was something that was debated quite a lot in the Houses, probably since 2007 or 2008.  At that stage we needed to have a national conversation about it, which probably did not happen.  It was not led by anybody at that stage but it is important that we are having this debate tonight and that the Pensions Commission is doing its work, which is leading the national conversation on the work we are going to do in this area as well.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State in the Department of Social Protection, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the State pension this evening on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Department.  The Government recognises that the State pension age was one of the most important issues that arose during the last election.  The public were very clear that they wanted a new approach and a new conversation in this space to see where we would go, bearing in mind that most people are responsible with the public finances and how we have to pay for all this as well.  That is why, when we formed this Government, we gave it very specific attention in the programme for Government and set out a range of commitments on which we have been following through.</p>  <p>  As per the commitment in the programme for Government, the Pensions Commission was established last November by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  As we are all aware, the public policy and social issues underpinning the funding of a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  The Government, therefore, wanted to get an impartial examination of the situation and an independent assessment of what would be required to sustain the State pension system and what may be possible for the future.  Even all those who raised concerns on this around the time of the election and prior to it want to make sure we have a sustainable system in place that guarantees the funding will be there to pay pensions well into the future, not just for them but for their children and grandchildren.</p>  <p>  That is the reason we established the Pensions Commission with care, ensuring it had a gender-balanced membership with extensive experience of social and public policy, and the necessary expertise to grasp the potential impacts of any proposed pensions reform options.  The commission is examining both sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of the State pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  In that respect, it has been asked to develop options for the Government on issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.</p> <p>It is also considering the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts that differ from the State pension age, which I note is one of the points raised in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  In addition, the commission is looking at the issue of pension provision for long-term carers, which all Deputies will agree is very important.  To date, the commission has met on 15 occasions, with further meetings planned.  As part of its work, it has held an extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, representative groups and associations, and national and international public and advisory bodies.  As part of this consultation, the commission has received 220 detailed submissions.  It has also conducted an online stakeholder forum, which included detailed presentations from a range of representative groups, and it has engaged with a range of national and international experts to inform its decisions in this space.  Lest anybody be in any doubt, the Pensions Commission is very much getting on with its work, and rightly so.  That is the challenge it was given, namely, to advise the Government in this space.</p> <p> As a Government, we want the commission to be able to carry out its work independently and unfettered.  That is why, as committed in the programme for Government, last December we passed legislation to defer the planned increases in the State pension age pending the report of the commission and its consideration by the Government.  That decision was not taken lightly.  We understood it was important to let the commission do its work and bring forward its advice.  That measure will cost &euro;221 million in 2021 and approximately &euro;453 million in a full year.  As also committed in the programme for Government, earlier this year we introduced a new benefit payment for 65-year-olds.  People who retire at the age of 65 and avail of this payment do not need to attend an Intreo centre to sign on, they do not need to be available for or genuinely seeking work, and they are not required to participate in any activation measures.  That was a sore point for many people.  They felt that having worked all their lives, they should not have to join those queues, go to the Intreo service or actively seek work.  It was a big issue and people did not like it.  Even though it had been debated for years, it certainly was not communicated and people did not have the chance to contribute to that debate in those years.  It was important that we paused this and took another look, while bringing in that benefit for the moment.  Unlike jobseeker's benefit, which lasts for nine months, a person who retires at 65 can avail of the payment for the full year until they reach pension age at 66.  That is dealing with another issue in that, under the previous scheme, the payment ran out after nine months.</p> <p> It is important to note the social insurance contribution requirements for this payment are not as high as for receipt of the State pension and people retiring at 65 should, in most cases, easily meet the required PRSI conditionality.  While it was only introduced in February of this year, there are already over 2,600 65-year-olds benefiting from the new payment.</p> <p> Speakers referenced the issue of adequacy.  From an adequacy point of view, the Irish State pension is regarded as successful at protecting pensioners from poverty.  However, we also want to continually improve the pension offering, which we have done for many years through successive Governments, and to improve the rate at which it is paid in order to give people a more comfortable retirement and to enable them to have the quality of life they deserve.  When increases are sanctioned, we will always have a view on pensioners living alone and those on single pension incomes in a household.  We recognise the difficulties if people are living alone and trying to run a household.  Pension rates in Ireland compare very favourably with other jurisdictions.  Again, we recognise that is what is needed to give the quality of life that goes with that.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in members do not like comparing this to the North, where they have a decision-making role.  When we compare this with the North, they always say it is someone else's fault, but the reality is that the contributory State pension here is over &euro;248 and in Northern Ireland it is considerably less, at &pound;175, or about &euro;195.  That is the reality.  They will always blame somebody else.  I know they are not in government there on their own but they are responsible for decision-making in the North, whether they like it or not.  Repeatedly, we in the South are expected to judge Sinn F&eacute;in on what they say they would do if they were in government in the South, not what they actually do when they are in government in the North.  We should bear that in mind when we have these debates.  I am conscious the North gets an envelope of money from Westminster and I accept that too.  However, there are decisions to be made as well. </p></speech>

We have to accept that, plan for that and budget for that, and make sure the resources are in place for the lifetime of the pension.  In 1971, the average life expectancy was 71 and, thankfully, by 2016, that had risen to 81.  A person who reached 65 years of age in 1971 could expect to live to the age of 77 and, in 2016, that had increased to about 84.  That is a positive development for our country and one we are trying to allow for in all our policies and plans, not just when it comes to the pension age but also housing for the ageing and every other policy document we bring forward as well.  Of course, it is hugely welcome that people are living longer and healthier lives but it does present its own challenges, challenges we have to meet collectively and responsibly.</p>  <p>  In 1997, spending on pensions was &euro;1.7 billion.  By 2010, this had increased to &euro;5.8 billion and by 2019, the cost had increased to over &euro;8.2 billion, so the numbers have really jumped in recent years.  This expenditure increase is due in no small part to the ongoing increase in pensioner numbers.  Some 743,000 persons over the age of 66 are expected to benefit from State pension payments next year.  This is an increase of over 150,000 people in ten years.  About 40% of the total social welfare budget is spent on pensions, up from 28% in 2010.  Whether we like it or not, this has obvious implications for the ability of the State not only to fund pensions but also to allocate resources to other priorities.  I was involved in the document considering housing options for those who are ageing, an important document looking to the future and looking to give people a choice.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of security for people in rented accommodation as they age and move onto the pension.  It is important across all Departments that we recognise that policy changes and implementation are needed.  It also has implications for intergenerational equity and fairness.</p>  <p>  The sustainability of State pensions is not an issue unique to Ireland.  This is a conversation that is happening all over Europe.  In Northern Ireland, the pension age was increased from 65 to 66 last year and I believe it is planned to increase it again to 67 by 2028.  It is easy to be populist but the bottom line is there are no easy options on this, and that is the case for governments across the world.  This is an issue that has to be dealt with in the fairest possible way.  That is why an independent commission to bring evidence to this and to allow evidence-based decision-making is appropriate, and it is one the Government will respond to.  There is a duty on every Deputy in this House to ensure we do not jeopardise the future of the State pension system by taking short-term, populist approaches to this matter.  The decisions we make today will not only impact those approaching retirement age but will have long-term and far-reaching implications, particularly for today&rsquo;s younger generations of workers, who through their social insurance contributions and taxes are paying for today&rsquo;s pensioners, but also for our children and their children when they reach retirement age over the coming decades.</p>  <p>  While the Government will not oppose the motion, I want to be clear that we will be allowing the Pensions Commission to continue with its work independently and giving it the necessary time to finish its deliberations and report to the Government independently, based on evidence and assessment of where we are going with this.  I expect that will happen in the near future and it would be inappropriate to pre-empt its conclusions and recommendations at this time.  Once its report is finalised, the Government will consider the options and recommendations set out by the commission and, as promised in the programme for Government, will take action within six months.</p></speech>

Voters sent a clear message that they wanted to restore the right to retire at 65 on the full pension rate, and Sinn F&eacute;in is making good on its promise to continue to campaign for that very right.  However, despite the message that was sent loud and clear, the Government has failed to act.  Instead, it has opted to stall the matter and resist bringing about the change that people called for.  While the legislation that had sought to raise the State pension even further has been repealed, there is still a need for a new law to replace it.</p>  <p>  This is where the Pensions Commission that was appointed by the Government last November comes in.  It is expected that when the commission reports in the very near future, its findings will influence the course of action the Government will take.  However, there is considerable concern that the commission does not include any representative from the groups who are particularly affected by pension changes and who will be the most affected by the decisions informed by the commission&rsquo;s report.  We have seen concerns about the gender pay gap and the glitches around those who are required to retire at 65, yet neither the NWCI nor Age Action is represented on the commission.  Let me remind the House that the NWCI said that the commission "lacks the balance needed to arrive at conclusions that can accommodate a range of interests, especially those most affected by any pension age increase".</p>  <p>  What this Bill also seeks to do is to resolve the issues that successive Governments have seemed incapable of resolving.  Only recently, a constituent who is approaching pension age contacted me to ask why, if they choose to work past their retirement date, their PRSI contributions will not be counted towards their State pension.</p> <p>We seek to address that in this motion.</p> <p> We also demand a commitment from the Government to restore the State pension transition payment for those retiring at 65 years of age.  The Government's handling of this issue has been chaotic and shows a total lack of appreciation or regard for the years of service these citizens have put into supporting the State.  They now deserve to be supported through just and comprehensible policies.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is also calling for mandatory retirement to be abolished in most cases and for workers to have the choice to work or retire as long as they are fit to do so.  For those workers who choose to work on, they should be able to do so on their own terms and not be compelled to sign fixed-term or short-term contracts of employment.  We have tabled this motion because it represents the message sent in the last general election, and because the current Government cannot understand that our workers deserve the right to retire at 65 and the choice not to.</p></speech>

Forcing people to work for years longer when they were planning and expecting to retire is wrong.  It is even more wrong because those of us in this Parliament who are making these decisions and forcing them on people are not being asked to do the same.  In 2028, the Government intends to raise the pension age to 68.  This has been met with widespread opposition from trade unions and the wider workforce.  My union, SIPTU, launched its Stop67 campaign.  It understands that many workers, especially manual workers, cannot physically do the work that they have done for decades.  Bricks and blocks do not get lighter as people age.</p>  <p>  Under pressure during the last election, one Government party, Fianna F&aacute;il, promised to at least restore the transition pension so that those aged 65 did not have to sign on for the dole for a year after retirement.  So far, An Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il have not delivered on that promise.  By removing the transition pension, the last Government unofficially raised the retirement age to 66.  As a result, many 65-year-olds who plan to retire cannot afford to stop working.  This is unfair, callous, and wrong.  The Government must stop its attempt to force through the planned increase of the State pension age to 67 in 2021.  It must restore the transition pension and the right to retire at 65.  Those workers have worked hard all their lives, paid their taxes and paid into the system.  They deserve their pension at the full rate.  They should be treated fairly and with dignity.  Working beyond 65 must always be a choice that workers make for themselves.  Some may wish to keep working and should be enabled to do so.  Others will want to retire and enjoy the fruits of their labour.  No one else should force them to make those decisions.</p></speech>

The State pension age was a significant issue at the time of the last election and it remains a significant issue for thousands of people across the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue its campaign until the Government's plans to raise the pension age are scrapped and the pension age is restored to 65.  The Government plans to raise the pension age next year to 67 and to 68 in 2028.  The State pension transition payment has been abolished, leaving thousands of 65-year-olds having to sign on for jobseekers' payments.  Thousands of people are in receipt of a &euro;203 jobseeker's payment instead of the State pension, which is &euro;45 higher per week.  This amounts to an annual loss for a person who retires in this State of &euro;2,355 per annum.  These are people who have worked hard all their lives.  Some have worked hard in physical jobs for decades.  They have earned their right to retire at 65.  They paid their taxes, which the Minister of State seems to forget.  When people get to pension age, they have already paid their taxes for their pension.  They have paid social insurance contributions all their working lives.</p>  <p>  Some Deputies, the people who are making these unjust laws, can retire from the age of 50, should they choose to.  Some will be retiring to enjoy big fat pensions.  We cannot have one rule for people in here and another for everybody else.  It is wrong to make people's working lives longer without giving them any say or choice whatsoever.  We support those who wish to remain at work after 65.  People should not be forced to stop working against their wishes.  We need a fairer system that suits people's needs as they reach the traditional retirement age.  We have to support those who want to continue working, for example by ensuring that their PRSI payments count towards their State pension.  We must also respect that others will want to retire at the age of 65.  We need an end to mandatory retirement.  We need to restore the State pension transition payment and we need to keep the pension age at 65.  We need action.  There has been too much flip-flopping and indecision by Government.  We know what the people and unions want, and we fully support them.</p></speech>

It concerns the PAYE tax credit as it relates to the contributory pension.  The Finance Act 2013 did away with this credit as it applied to dependents.  For example, a husband could avail of this tax credit as it applied to his own contributory pension but not to his wife's pension as was previously the case.  This means that some dependents now have a tax liability.  This issue mainly affects older women.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this and to support our motion in full.</p></speech>

I want to raise some issues in respect of the Pensions Commission, which the Minister of State has spoken extensively about.  We are struck by the IBEC submission.  One of its key recommendations calls on the Government to remove the necessity to objectively justify a post-retirement fixed-term contract.  We believe that this is a retrograde step that would give employers the green light to discriminate against workers on the grounds of age.  While plenty of sticks and stones are thrown at the Labour Party about our time in government, we must remember that it was a Labour Party Minister of State, my colleague, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who introduced vital legislation in 2015 to protect working people and bring laws to prevent age discrimination in line with European case law.  We must protect the provisions set out in section 6(3)(c) of the Employment Equality Act at all costs.  This vital legislation prohibits employers from "offering" a post-retirement fixed-term contract without any requirement to objectively justify it.</p> <p>It is vital that is protected.  A move though to row back on this or amend this legislation, as some are calling for - I hope the Government will resist those calls - would set back workers' rights and equality rights by decades, which would be unacceptable.<br/><br/>The reality is that many workers wish to remain in their employment until at least their State pension becomes payable due to their continued ability to do their job and that they would see a significant drop in their income if forced to retire.  The recently introduced benefit payment does not address this issue.  Let us call a spade a spade here and be honest with each other about the debate that we are having tonight about the benefit payment.  It does not address the issue.  Addressing this issue requires legislative change.<br/><br/>The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 state that an employer cannot discriminate against a worker on the grounds of age.  The Act allows, but crucially does not require, employers to set a mandatory retirement age for workers provided it can objectively be justified by legitimate aims.  Therefore, where we have legislation which allows for workers to be retired by a particular age, it will not be regarded as age discrimination if it is objectively justified by a legitimate aim.  However, such an aim most include legitimate employment policy, labour market and training objectives for it to be in line with the EU's directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation.  That is the law.  That is where we are and there can be no going back on that.  These decisions must be justified rather than the decisions of individual employers.  The Labour Party believes that is missing from tonight's motion, although it addresses it to a certain extent.  As well-meaning as it is, it falls short on a crucial element the Stop67 campaigners are calling for, which is a statutory right to remain in the job.<br/><br/>We are supporting the motion.  I listened very carefully to the Sinn F&eacute;in contributors to the debate.  <i>De facto</i>Sinn F&eacute;in is calling the retirement age to move to 65.  I do not think there is any ambiguity about that.  That is my understanding of it.  The motion states in the first line that &quot;workers in the State make a considerable tax contribution throughout their working life and should have the right to access the full pension rate of payment when they retire at age 65&quot;.  In other words, it wants to move the retirement age from 66 down to 65.  The final Sinn F&eacute;in speaker might clarify this for us.  The motion calls on the Government to &quot;commit to restoring the State Pension Transition payment for those retiring at 65 years of age&quot;.  I may be misinterpreting the motion but I ask for clarification.  If the motion is calling for the retirement age be reduced by 65, I imagine it negates the need for the State pension transition payment to be reintroduced at 65 years of age.  However, I may be missing some logic there.<br/><br/>We support the motion and we support the work of the Pensions Commission.  We need to be cognisant of what is already in law.  When the Pensions Commission makes its final deliberations, hopefully it will not recommend any unwinding of pre-existing law particularly in respect of arguments Stop67 has so stridently put forward, and which we have all adhered to.  The Employment Equality Act is existing robust legislation.  We need to ensure that fixed-term contracts are dealt with properly in the context of the Pensions Commission.  We all wait with anticipation for the report of that commission.  Ultimately, it will be for this House to decide where it goes thereafter.  The Labour Party is setting out its stall tonight in respect of post-retirement fixed-term contracts because we believe that issue will be very high on the agenda.<br/><br/>We support the motion; there is no ambiguity about that.  I just want to raise a minute, but significant issue on the benefit payment.  The application process can be cumbersome for some people.  On 15 June I asked the Minister if she would make the form for the benefit payment for 65-year-olds available to download and print, rather than on request only.  The Minister responded to say that people can apply online, which is fine and many people will apply online.  For those not able to apply online, the alternative is to make a request to the local Intreo office or through the Department's income-support helpline and it is posted to the applicant.  If the form could available online for people to print it off and make their application it would help a significant number of people.  It is a relatively minor issue.  We do not understand the logic of not being able to print off the form itself.  However, a significant cohort of people are not able to do that at the moment.  I would be very grateful if that could be considered.</p></speech>

As we start to emerge from the pandemic many of us have been forced to re-evaluate what is important in our individual lives and in wider society - family, health and friendship.</p>  <p>  It might seem simplistic but we need to keep these learnings close to us.  At the same time, we need to ensure flexibility and an assortment of values are represented.  The value and meaning one derives from work cannot be thought of as universal.  Some of us, I hope all of us here, derive immense pleasure from our work and find meaning in our lives through our work.  Others work to be able to sustain their other passions and hobbies and for some their work is measured through care which has historically been undervalued and ignored.</p>  <p>  It should not be a utopian idea to have better work-life balance through a four-day working week, flexible working-from-home options, a society which values life spent outside labour participation as much as in it and a society where it should be a privilege, not a stress, to grow old, where the frenzy relating to security no longer haunts our elderly population.  Allowing our elderly to retire with dignity is the purpose of a pension system.  The State pension is and must remain the most important pillar in achieving that.</p>  <p>  Older people in Ireland have the lowest rates of poverty of any age group.  The State pension is solely responsible for this.  At any one time, approximately 85% of older people in Ireland would live below the poverty line if it were not for the State pension.  Instead, that number is generally between 9% and 11% and has been so for the last decade.  For this reason, the Social Democrats believe the Government&rsquo;s priority on pensions should be to end the auction politics on pensions, by linking the State pension to 35% of the average wage.</p>  <p>  There is also a need to align the retirement age with the pension age and adjust employment contracts accordingly.  The Government should also look to introduce a system where people have the flexibility to receive the State pension earlier or later than the State pension age.</p> <p>This should be about choice.  People should have a choice as to when to leave the workforce, confident they will not be punished for the choice they make as the pension amount they receive would be reduced or increased on a cost neutral basis.</p> <p> There are regular contributions to the discussion on pensions from the commentariat and members of the Government, all referencing the sustainability of the pension system and the fact that people are living longer.  Successive Governments have done little to encourage or support longer working lives among people who want to work beyond the retirement age.  There is rarely justification for mandatory retirement except, perhaps, in some very select professions and there is no justification for it when the Government is simultaneously talking about a pensions timebomb and insisting that we cannot allow our retirees the financial security they have earned.</p> <p> The Social Democrats support this motion.  If the Government acted on it, it would be doing something real to support workers on their own terms, supporting those who wish to have longer working lives.  There is also a need to expand coverage to groups not covered by pension arrangements.  We know of the contribution that care work makes.  People, mostly women, who perform care work save the Irish economy, by some estimates, &euro;20 billion per annum, be that by raising families or caring for elderly family members or family members with disabilities.  They are literally saving the State billions per year, not to mention meeting a tsunami of need that cannot be met by our healthcare system, yet we continue to insult these individuals and the value of their work by providing no security.</p> <p> A few weeks ago, I said in this Chamber that there is no greater injustice than someone spending decades caring for family members with disabilities facing a retirement of financial insecurity.  This is the reality faced by many long-term caregivers.  Thanks to anomalies in our antiquated breadwinner pension system they have no entitlement to a pension from the State when they retire.  Nobody is more deserving of the admiration and support of our society than those who spend years, sometimes decades, in these caring roles.  Aside from the social value provided, they save the economy billions of euros annually - a point that cannot be overstated.</p> <p> The Pensions Commission is due to report to the Government at the end of this month.  Included in its remit is the creation of a pension solution for carers.  I sincerely hope that solution is one that ends the situation where understandable gaps in PRSI history or quirks in the means test often leave carers without any pension entitlement.  The Government should begin to treat credited PRSI contributions the same as paid contributions as treating paid and credited contributions differently tells carers that society does not value their work as much as it values paid employment.  That attitude is an anachronism in 2021.  Public policy needs to reflect more modern thinking about what counts as valuable work in our society.</p> <p> Family Carers Ireland hears from many carers every year who have no individual entitlement to a pension from the State.  If they are lucky, they will qualify for some income through a spouse, but if married to a civil servant who was hired under the old pension regime or to a farmer who has land, even if that land has not been worked, they are usually left with nothing.  A commitment from Government to the development of a dedicated long-term carers' pension scheme is the best way it can prove its support for carers.  This scheme should target people who have delivered full-time care for more than 20 years regardless of their PRSI history and should pay a pension equal to the maximum contributory pension, which is currently &euro;248.30 per week.  In addition, there should be no means test.</p> <p> There is no excuse for continuing to allow these anomalies in our pension system to fester, resulting in great financial uncertainty and instability into older life because of care work.  I am reminded of the words of C.S. Lewis, "You can&rsquo;t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending." </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200039#MM00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I first want to make a point that is relevant to this motion and to a number of other motions passed by the D&aacute;il in the past number of weeks.  The Government is taking an extraordinarily cynical approach to motions brought forward by the Opposition in that it is supporting them, with no intention of doing anything about the issues raised.  They are doing this because they do not want to see bad headlines in the media to the effect that they are against something.  Tomorrow, the Government will vote in favour of the Social Democrats motion on the national maternity hospital.  A few weeks ago, it voted in favour of the motion on the national maternity hospital brought forward by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and others and in favour of the People Before Profit-Solidarity Bill on the right to housing, but it has no intention of doing any of what was proposed, in my opinion.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said in his opening statement that the Government will vote in favour of the motion, which is very clear in terms of the pension age coming back to 65, but simultaneously he said something that entirely contradicts that, that is, the Government is in favour of the Pensions Commission continuing its work and does not want to interfere with the work of the commission, etc.  The Pensions Commission is a tool to take something out of the political arena because of the pressure the establishment parties came under in the course of the last election.  If the Government is in favour of the pension age coming back to 65, why not pass that into law?  What the Government has been doing over the last while is incredibly cynical.  It has copped onto the idea that voting against motions that are popular is a bad idea so instead it allows everything to pass with no intention of doing anything.  That is extremely cynical.  </p>  <p>  The fundamental point is that instead of increasing the retirement age, which I believe is still what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would like to do if they could get away with it politically, we should be bringing it back to, at least, 65.  As a result of the Fine Gael and Labour Party decision to raise the age to 66, there are now 4,000 65-year-olds in this State out of work, unable to get the State pension and having to sign-on, effectively for jobseeker's allowance, and instead get &euro;45 per week less than the pension.  These are people who worked all of their lives, retired from their jobs at 65, and are now left to twist in the wind, unable to get a job, but not allowed to get the State pension.  It is not good enough.  The Government should hang its head in shame.  This provision should be reversed immediately.  </p>  <p>  It says something deeply profound and bad about capitalism that people living longer is a crisis.  We have a demographic timebomb.  The idea that people could retire at 65 and live a comfortable retirement for a number of years is a crisis.  These workers have been incredibly productive over the course of their lifetimes and they have created huge profits for their bosses, etc yet, it is unthinkable that we could make the employers and those who made the profits from their work pay for a comfortable retirement through increased employers PRSI.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a wealthy country.  Per person, we are the richest country in the world, but one would not think it looking at how the Government treats our older workers.  Workers should be entitled to retire in comfort, but instead the Government is attempting, or would like to, push up the retirement age to 67 or 68.  We can afford a decent retirement for all workers at 65 - a universal basic pension.  The problem is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are more concerned with protecting the billionaires from taxes than they are with supporting the workers who have created that wealth.  Their pensions are part of their wages.  They are deferred wages.  </p>  <p>  I welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward this motion pushing to reduce the pension age to 65.  However, I would make the point to Sinn F&eacute;in that it is the real attitude of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on this issue from which they should draw some conclusions.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are not on the side of ordinary workers, pensioners or otherwise.  Any coalition or compromise with these parties of the rich would mean betraying those who were looking for real change.  We do not need, and should have a ruling out of, coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael and instead a fight for a left Government with socialist policies to stand up to the billionaires and bring down the pension age for workers.</p></speech>

The attempt by the State to push out the pension age has had widespread political support and was first designed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and put into legislation by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition and it was part of the austerity response.  It was also based on the idea that because people are living longer we cannot possibly pay a State pension at 65.</p>  <p>In 2011, in highlighting the significant challenges facing the Irish pension system, Joan Burton said, "The fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer needs to be emphasised and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement."  She said the population aged over 65 was expected to more than double by 2050, increasing from 11% to 26%, because people were living longer and that spending on "social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5&frac12; % of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% in 2050."  There has been some rowback on the part of this Government with regard to pushing the retirement age out to 67.  It has had to do this and to create this commission, which is stacked with safe hands.  Of the 11 members of the Pensions Commission, three are civil servants, three are members of IBEC or similar bodies, two have legal backgrounds, two are economists and one is a token representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Pensions Commission is a way to move this issue out of the political arena and was set up because the parties who came to a coalition deal, namely, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, felt political pressure during the general election.</p> <p> The attack on the right to a State pension at 66 should be seen as a wider attack on all workers.  The right to a State pension at 65 was a big gain won by the working class in the 1970s and all workers should fight today to retain it because those who are workers today will be retired workers tomorrow.  We reject the demographic time bomb argument.  People do now live longer.  That is something to be celebrated rather than a cause of concern or a reason to impose another heap of austerity on people in their retirement.  Workers living longer does not mean that those now working are less productive.  In fact, while it may have taken five workers to pay the pension of one retired worker and while in the future it may take two or more to do so, the evidence clearly shows that workers are becoming increasingly more productive and that this is not being recognised in their wages or their pensions.</p> <p> This problem can be addressed by increasing the rate of PRSI paid by employers.  Ireland's employers pay one of the lowest rates of PRSI contribution in the EU at just over 10%.  In Austria, employers pay 21% while in Germany they pay 45%.  The EU average is 21%.  We are laggards again and are once again behind.  The attack on pensions reflects a wider crisis in the capitalist system.  Instead of celebrating the longevity of ordinary people, some see it as something they cannot afford to take any risks with.  We need to ensure that the right to retire at 65 is retained and that people can retire with dignity on a liveable income.  If that means addressing wider issues such as the wider attack on pensions by employers and our country's status as a low-tax haven by increasing PRSI contributions, that is what should be done.</p> <p> The auto-enrolment policy of the Government is deeply flawed.  It will not deal with the crisis about which the Government talks and will only impose another tax on low-paid workers with no occupational pension.  By its nature, it cannot affect workers whose PRSI contributions are so low as to not qualify for anything other than a State contributory pension.  The growth of precarious low-paid work indicates how that will affect the current workforce when they are due to retire.  This is part of the reason for People Before Profit bringing in the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021 on 30 June.  This Bill aims to give retired workers a voice.  I hope we will get widespread support for the Bill from across the D&aacute;il.  The retired workers to whom I have spoken, some of a cohort of tens of thousands, have a slogan, which is that retired workers are not retired voters.  The systemic attack on their pensions since the austerity measures were brought in by the Minister of State's party and by Fianna F&aacute;il when the banking crisis happened has been absolutely punitive on them.  It is part of the collective response of this system to retired workers, which is shameful.</p></speech>

I hope the parties will support the Aont&uacute; amendment to ensure convergence between the pension ages in the North and South of Ireland.  At the moment there is a difficulty with regard to the pension in the North of Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is symptomatic of the two-tier Ireland in which we live that when it comes to retirement, there is one rule for the elites and another for hard-working men and women.  Deputies, whether they get voted of office or resign, will leave with golden handshakes to see them well and in wealth in their years of retirement.  All the while, working men and women throughout the country live in fear and anxiety about whether they will have enough money to afford to retire.  The gulf is enormous.   A massive chasm exists in this country between the ruling elites and the people on the ground.  I firmly believe that the vast majority of people in government do not even recognise how differently they treat themselves from the people on the street.  If one were to look for an example of that, one need only look to the ongoing &euro;25,000 a day for this building.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, amid the global crisis in health and the economy, the Government voted to upgrade the golden handshake pensions for former taoisigh and top civil servants.  The Government gave them a platinum handshake pension by restoring the cuts made to those pensions.  It costs the taxpayer &euro;12 million every year to do this.  At the same time, the Government voted against giving any pay to student nurses.  This is another example of how differently members of the Government treat themselves from the rest of the country.  This can be contrasted with the failure of the Government to find so much as a tenner for pensioners in the &euro;18 billion budget.  Quite simply, there is a chasm between lawmakers and the people on the street.  The hallmark of a civilised society is how we treat the most vulnerable.  God knows that the most vulnerable in the crisis we have been through are the older members of our society.  If the hallmark is how we treat them, the Government has failed very badly.  </p>  <p>  At the moment, people are in many cases obliged to retire at 65 under their contracts.  They are then forced onto jobseeker's payments for one year before being allowed access the State pension at 66.  That is an absolute nonsense.  It again shows the lack of professional administration in this country.  This strange year people experience at the end of their working lives shows a lack of ordinary competency in administration.  Ireland is to have a pension age far older than those of the majority of our European counterparts.  England does not plan to move its pension age to 68 until 2046, 18 years after this Government expects this move to be made in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  There will be a change in the demographics in the next 40 years.  There will be just 2.3 people of working age for every pensioner.  The new total contribution approach brought in to replace the old averaging system means that people need 2,080 contributions to qualify for a full State pension.  That is the equivalent of 40 full years of PRSI contributions.  Just under six in ten Irish workers have some sort of pension to supplement the State pension.  We are looking at a major difficulty over the next while because of that.  It should be remembered that many older people locked themselves into significantly long mortgages to buy their houses.  It should also be remembered that there is a significant cohort of older people who are in rented accommodation while the price of rent is radically increasing.  This is happening at a time when the opportunity to get the full pension is narrowing and when the age at which someone is eligible is getting older.</p>  <p>  The Government says that it will launch an auto-enrolment pension scheme some time in 2022.  People will make contributions equal to 1.5% of salary, rising to 8% after ten years of work.  What progress has been made on this?  When will the Government be in a position to fulfil this pledge?  Will pensioners once again be left in uncertainty?  Shameful brazen politics have been played in respect of the issue of pensions over the past while.  In January and February, the pensions issue threatened to define the election of 2020.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael had to quickly row back on their previous plans to raise the pension age.  Significantly, they did so just to deal with the electoral backlash coming their way at the time.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael decided to get together to put a pin in the grenade that was about to go off.</p> <p>Both parties stated they would oppose raises in the pension age.  However, like so many of the commitments from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, it disappeared like snow off a ditch once the election was over.  What did they do?  They pulled a very common trick in Irish politics and created a commission to do two things - kick the can down the road and transfer responsibility from them in the decision-making process.  If the Government opposes the increase in the pension age, why does it not just state that it opposes it?  Why the need for a commission at all?  Why the inability to stand up for what one believes on obvious and simple issues of justice such as this?  It is incredible that both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael speak about opposing the raising of the pension age but both see a commission to do just that as being the solution.</p> <p> My concern is that raising the pension age will be part of an economic payback for the fiscal mismanagement of the Covid crisis by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government.  It must be remembered that Governments have form in this regard.  Successive Governments have sought to recoup economic losses at the expense of the rights and entitlements of the most vulnerable and hard-working in society.  To bail out the banking sector in 2008, medical cards were attacked and retirees were told that although the crisis was not of their making, they were nonetheless expected to pay to bail out the offenders.  Fast forward to today and this crisis, which is not the fault of older people, yet the Government has its eye on their pockets to see if it can pick them to pay for the costs of the crisis.  In 2011, Fine Gael and the Labour Party in their first year in government legislated to raise the pension age from 65 to 68 incrementally.  It was incredible for the Labour Party or any party that says it is based on the legacy of James Connolly to see the pockets of those aged 67 or 68 as the solution to the financial crisis the country was in.  In the run-up to the general election in 2020, we saw Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il reject that policy for fear of losing votes but now their policy is actually indistinguishable from it and they are just awaiting the most politically opportune time to push through the increase in the pension age.</p> <p> Aont&uacute; is an all-Ireland party.  We are a 32-county Irish republican party.  We want to see convergence on the island of Ireland in all aspects - economically, socially and in the delivery of public services - but we also want to see convergence with regard to incomes and pensions.  It is wrong that pension ages in the North of Ireland are different from those in the South of Ireland.  It is important that political parties speaking on this side of the Border do so with the same language up North as well because people in the North of Ireland listen to what parties say here and they want to make sure the parties fulfil those words in the Six Counties too.  We in Aont&uacute; have proposed an amendment seeking the convergence of the pension ages North and South and we ask the political parties here to support that amendment.</p></speech>

There is a difference of &euro;45.30 between the jobseeker's payment and the State pension, leading to an annual loss of &euro;2,355.60 for pensioners.  The urgency with regard to the pension age issue, as provided by the Government, is that there is a massive financial cost coming down the tracks as a result of the increasing number of older people.  However, this is a shameful position to adopt and we must see it in context.  For example, why should pensioners and ordinary workers bear the brunt of this cost when the Government is creating unsustainable and record levels of public debt in areas such as the national children's hospital and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021?  The annual cost of the climate change Bill is in the region of &euro;20 billion, as confirmed by the International Monetary Fund, and the overrun to date on the national children's hospital is &euro;1 billion, so why should ordinary workers and pensioners, who worked hard and served this country so well, bear the brunt of the Government's reckless decision-making when it comes to finances and how it deals with people in a fair manner?  It is clear that the Government does not care about pensioners and it is not dealing with workers in a fair manner.  What is happening here is that it is presiding over chaos and affecting the lives of too many people.  It needs to reflect on that and be fair to pensioners.</p></speech>

The pension age was a key issue in the general election in February 2020.  Voters across the State expressed their opposition to the pension age increase throughout the election campaign.  The Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government that was in power from 2007 until 2011 decided to increase the pension age to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The subsequent Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition put that into law in 2011.</p>  <p>  The current Government pledged in the programme for Government to keep the pension age at 66 pending the recommendations, to be delivered within a year, of the recently established Pensions Commission.  The approach of this Government to every issue now seems to be to establish a review or a report.  It is a delaying tactic to buy time and hope the issue will simmer.  It is grossly unfair and deeply disingenuous.  This delay is causing great uncertainty for many citizens.</p>  <p>  In any civilised society that respects its workforce, people should be entitled to a pension at the age of 65.  Let us not forget that the only people who are not entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment are those over 65 years of age who are still working.  These people again were left behind.  Irish people cannot wait for another protracted report or review.  They deserve to know where they stand.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been all over the place on this issue.  Last year in the D&aacute;il, it rejected a call for a State pension age of 65 but then agreed to defer the increase in the pension age to 67.  It is making it up as it goes along.  Every worker in the State makes a considerable tax contribution throughout his or her working life and should have the right to retire at 65.</p>  <p>  In the few seconds I have left, I refer to a meeting held this evening between the Rural Independent Group and members of the taxi forum.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, to go back to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this issue.  Taxi drivers are in a crisis situation.  They need a taxi wage subsidy or a business subsidy to survive the pandemic.  At least while they are trying to get their business back up and running, they need some kind of wage subsidy scheme to be put in place, as was done for other businesses but not for taxi drivers.  That has to change.  In addition, the ten-year rule relating to the changing of a vehicle has to be moved to 12 years in this crisis.</p></speech>

Voters across the State expressed their opposition to the pension age increase throughout the election campaign.  The Government told them that things like that would not happen.  While in power from 2007 to 2011, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party decided to increase the pension age to 67 by 2021 and to 68 by 2028.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party implemented that while in government in 2011.  In 2020, those same parties went out and said they were not in favour of the increases in the pension age that were the doing of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in 2007 and Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2011.  I spoke again last week about double standards.  It is a great thing that there is social media now because people can actually go back and check the record with regard to what various governments, some members of which may now be in opposition, have done, and hold them to account.  How dare they ask persons of aged 65 who have worked their whole lives for this country and paid their taxes to queue up to get the jobseeker's allowance?</p> <p>How does the Government dare to do this?  What it is doing is hypocritical.  I hope every person of pension age, and every child and grandchild of those pension-age people, researches and sees exactly what Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Labour Party have done to those people in their retirement years.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that an Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment, which I also support, was not put through, but I understand the situation.  The difference between what people get on jobseeker's allowance and what they would be entitled to on the pension is &euro;2,000 per year.  It is a most ignominious insult to 65-year-olds to be told to sign on.  These are people who were proud to work all their lives, raise their families and pay their taxes and dues.  To expect them to sign on with other people, no disrespect to them, at the labour exchange is unacceptable.  The sooner that is changed, the better.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is new to the D&aacute;il, new to politics and new to this level of politics.  I hope he will be able to exert some influence in this matter.  What is being done is shocking.  I was in the House when the representatives of the grey vote arrived here some years ago.  They met at a church up the road and came down to the D&aacute;il at the time cuts were made to medical cards.  They put the fear of God into Fianna F&aacute;il and the Minister of State's party at that time and, let us be fair about it, they also put the fear into me.  Their muscles will be flexed again because they have been blackguarded right through the pandemic.  They were locked up in their homes and had the life scared out of them by RT&Eacute;, the national media and all the rest of them.  People in that age group, including taxi drivers, bus drivers, ambulance drivers, publicans, self-employed people and many others, could not even get the difference between their pension and the pandemic unemployment payment.  Total disrespect was shown to them in this regard.  They had to pay for the sins of the banking crisis and now they must pay for the sins of this crisis and the way it has been handled.  They must pay for the abysmal waste associated with the new children's hospital, which will probably cost &euro;2.5 billion or &euro;3 billion.  We will discuss tomorrow the cost of the new maternity hospital, which has gone up from &euro;200 million to &euro;800 million.  The behaviour of Governments, Ministers and senior officials has been reckless.  Then we have the gold-plated pensions for former taoisigh, Ministers and public servants.  It is shocking and disgusting.</p>  <p>  I am telling the Minister of State that enough is enough.  The pensioners of Ireland will not take this.  They do not deserve it.  Their children and grandchildren will remember what Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party, the Labour Party and some others did.  As an employer, I know the situation is difficult, but all older people want is fair play.</p></speech>

I, of course, support Sinn F&eacute;in's very genuine and heartfelt motion.  My late mother always said one could judge any government or society on how it treats people who are getting to an older age and how those people are respected.  Past governments certainly did not shroud themselves in glory in the way they treated our older people.  When it comes to pensions, it should be about choice.  If a person is in the good form and health that means they want to keep working, he or she should be allowed to do so.  If a person is getting tired and wants to get out of the workforce, having worked hard, contributed, paid a great deal in tax and raised their families, to have more time to take a bit of ease for themselves, then, my good God, they are more than entitled to it.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight some of the things that have gone on here this evening.  When I see Labour Party Deputies saying they are going to support Sinn F&eacute;in's motion, by God I must say they are a hypocritical shower, of what I will not say.  They had a special Minister in a previous Government who had the responsibility for being particularly horrible.  I would call her the Minister for horribleness.  I recall what she, in particular, did to older people, pensioners and women, and how women's rights were so desperately and detrimentally affected when it came to pensions.  When I see Labour Party Deputies saying tonight they will support this motion, I can only say they are a hypocritical shower.  That is exactly what they are to be doing that here tonight.  Why will they not be true to their form and say what they said before, in 2011 and 2012?  Will they not say here tonight what they said then about pensioners?  Perhaps other people will forget what they did but I will not forget it and nor will I let anyone else forget it either.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on this motion, which I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward.  It was 1 December 2020 when we last debated a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on pension age, in support of the STOP67 campaign.  Fortunately, there was enough public pressure on the Government at that time, and in the lead-up to the general election in February 2020, to pause the planned increase in retirement age to 67 years from 2021, even though that provision had been enacted in the Social Welfare Bill.</p><p>I listened with interest to the contributions of Labour Party Members in support of this motion.  The electorate has not forgotten that it was the Labour Party, in coalition with Fine Gael, that first legislated for the phased increase in pension ages.  In 2014, the age was increased to 66 years and it was supposed to increase to 67 years from 1 January this year and to 68 years from 1 January 2028.  A State pension transition payment was introduced and then abolished, and 65-year-olds then had to sign on for jobseeker's payment.  That payment is &euro;45.30 less per week than the State pension rate.  Why must the public always be expected to pay for the Government's ineptitude?</p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, gave us some insight when she said during the debate in December 2020: &quot;We want to maintain a fair balance between those who are contributing to the system and those who are drawing from it.&quot;  This reflects the particular quality of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that likes to pit cohorts of people against each other in their deservingness of, or access to, scarce resources.  The programme for Government sets out a number of commitments regarding pension provision, specifying that it would be &quot;[u]nderpinned by the principles of sustainability, adequacy, and fairness&quot; and would involve &quot;affordable changes&quot;.  That is laughable.  Changes cannot be called affordable if they do not include addressing the extortionate expenditure on tax relief for people with private pensions, which has cost the Exchequer billions over the years.</p><p>In discussing pensions, I always look to Social Justice Ireland for guidance, as it has consistently produced excellent analysis, proposals and fully costed measures to inform Government decisions.  I suppose the clue is in the name, however.  Why would Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party take advice from any group seeking, God forbid, social justice?  The organisation has done a significant amount of work on the cost of providing tax relief on private pensions.  In its 2018 paper, A Universal State Social Welfare Pension: Recognising the Contribution of all our Senior Citizens, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	.  The <i>Green Paper on Pensions</i>estimated a gross cost of &euro;3,220m for 2006 while the Department of Finance's Tax Strategy Group estimated a gross cost of &euro;3,035m for 2007...<br /><br />The <i>National Recovery Plan 2010</i>gave the total gross cost of pension tax expenditures as &euro;2,500m for 2010, comprising: the costs of tax relief on employee/employer/individual contributions to pension savings at &euro;1,000m; the cost of the tax exemption for employer contributions as Benefit-in-Kind (BiK) in the hands of employees at &euro;500m; and the cost of exempting from tax the accrued income and gains growth of pensions funds at &euro;1,000m...<br /><br />Collins and Walsh (2010: 24-25) estimated the total cost of tax expenditures allocated to private pensions in 2007 was &euro;3,100m.  In 2010, the Revenue Commissioners estimated a gross cost of &euro;2,929m for pension tax expenditures (Revenue Commissioners, 2011). </blockquote>  <p>There is a significant variation in the figures but all the numbers are huge and they show that the Government is governing for the few, not the many.</p><p>According to the same Social Justice Ireland report, giving tax relief on private pension contributions at 40% instead of 20% means that &quot;[o]ver 70 per cent of the tax relief for private pensions accrues to the top 20 per cent of earners, with more than 50 per cent accruing to the top 10 per cent of earners.&quot;  A change in this regard would, the report noted, be a .  At the end of April 2021, in response to the public consultation by the Pensions Commission, Social Justice Ireland released a statement entitled &quot;Disjointed Pensions Policy will fail Older People&quot;, in which it advocated for the following changes:</p> <blockquote> 	of tax relief on private pensions from 40 per cent to 20 per cent and second increasing employers PRSI by 0.5 per cent.  These, along with some other smaller measures, would raise in the region of &euro;949m, which is &euro;200m+ more than the additional cost of the Universal Pension in 2019. </blockquote>  <p>Social Justice Ireland has long advocated and put forward costed proposals for a universal pension scheme.  However, as I said, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, two interchangeable parties, are about governing for the few, not the many.  The Government committed to establishing the aforementioned Pensions Commission, the purpose of which was to &quot;outline options... to address issues including qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements&quot;.</p> <p>The Pensions Commission was due to finish its work in June 2021.  When will the report of the commission be available?  The programme for Government states: "The Commission will report by June 2021", but the Commission's website states that it would meet fortnightly until June 2021.</p> <p> I am out of time, but I wish to mention a few issues, including pension solutions for carers, the majority of whom are women; and the impact of the housing crisis on pensioners, as we have upcoming generations who do not own their own homes and therefore will not be living mortgage-free or rent-free into their pension years.  These issues also need to be addressed. </p></speech>

I would like to start by addressing some of the points that were made by Deputies, not all of whom are still present in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Martin Browne, I wish to put it on the record that there is a member of the board of the NWCI who is also on the Pensions Commission.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Munster, the Government has no plans in place to increase the State pension age at all.  The Government removed the legislation that would do so and will await the publication of independent report of the Pensions Commission before any decisions are made.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Gannon, the commission is also looking at benchmarking and index-linking the State pension at 34% of average earnings, and at a pension solution for long-term carers.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, who raised a point about auto-enrolment, I wish to underline that auto-enrolment is totally separate to the State pension.</p>  <p>  As already outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the Government is very mindful of the debate that occurred during last year's general election campaign and has made considerable commitments in the programme for Government to deal with the matter.  In that regard, the Government is absolutely committed to maintaining the State pension as the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland and to ensuring it continues to protect pensioners from poverty.  We are spending over &euro;8.8 billion on the State pension system this year alone.  That amount is projected to increase substantially over the coming years and decades, given the considerable demographic shifts occurring in Irish society.  That is why we must also ensure that we do not jeopardise the future of the State pension system with short-term thinking and that younger generations will also have an entitlement to the State pension system when their turn comes.</p>  <p>  In February of this year, in keeping with our programme for Government commitment, we introduced the new benefit payment for 65-year-olds with less onerous PRSI eligibility conditions than those required for a State pension.  So far, over 2,600 people have benefitted from this payment without having to be available for, and genuinely seeking, work, without having to undertake various activation measures and without having to turn up at their local Intreo centre to sign on.  Through the introduction of that payment, we have delivered on our commitment in the programme for Government.   We established the Pensions Commission last November to independently assess sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of the State pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  The commission has engaged in an extensive public consultation process to ensure it is apprised of all relevant information and issues.  The Government enacted legislation last December that will keep the State pension age at 66, pending the report of the Pensions Commission and the Government&rsquo;s consideration of its conclusions and recommendations.  The programme for Government commits that the Government will take action on the recommendations of the Pensions Commission within six months of receiving its report.</p>  <p>  We need to be honest with people in this debate.  There are no easy fixes.  Governments across the world are grappling with the issue of pension sustainability.  One only has to look at Northern Ireland and the UK where the pension age was increased from 65 to 66 last year and is due to increase again to 67 by 2028.  The rates of payment within our own pension system compare very favourably with other jurisdictions.  To be specific, the contributory State pension here is over &euro;248 per week.  In Northern Ireland, by contrast, it is considerably less, at &pound;175 or approximately &euro;195 per week.</p>  <p>  As I have stated, the Government wants to ensure that the State pension remains the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  That means ensuring that today&rsquo;s workers, and particularly young workers, have access to a State pension into the future.  While we are not opposing the motion this evening, having established the Pensions Commission, the proper and sensible thing to do is to await its independent assessment of the situation and then engage with its recommendations in a comprehensive manner.  That will provide members of this House with ample opportunity for further engagement and debate on the matter.  I look forward to that engagement being constructive and mindful of the overarching aim to protect this and future generations in their retirement.</p>  <p>  Throughout this, I will remember the people I met on doorsteps during the election campaign last year who were about to retire, some of whom had done very difficult manual labour jobs throughout their lives and some of whom wanted to continue working.  I will always be mindful of that in the decisions that are made in the future.</p></speech>

I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions this evening.  I want to draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that there is no representative from the NWCI on the Pensions Commission.  There are named representatives on the Pension Commission.  There is one representative from the ICTU and one from IBEC, but there are no specific representatives from the NWCI that I can see.  I just checked it before I rose to speak.  It is an important clarification to make, because as we know, women are impacted disproportionately by the pension situation.</p>  <p>  I would not call it a "crisis".  Although the Minister of State is right to reference the fact that Governments across the globe have to deal with the issue of pensions, it would be most helpful if the somewhat hysterical language were taken out of the debate.  We are not facing a demographic time bomb.  It is a good thing that people are living longer.  We do not have a pension crisis or anything like it.  In fact, what we have is an opportunity to look at the economy and how it is structured.  We have an opportunity to look at low pay, precarious work and the way the Government has built and constructed the labour market.  It provides an opportunity for growth, which is very important.  It is important that we grasp the opportunity to fund our pensions through growth.  By growth, I mean the growth of decent jobs and the elimination of precarious work.  Decent well-paid jobs afford us an opportunity to grow and to ensure we put pensions onto a sustainable footing.  That is important.  It is an important lesson for the Government to take on board.</p>  <p>  The Government must not demonise people who have worked all their lives and want to retire when they get to the age of 65.  In fact, we should thank those people for doing their shift by offering them the opportunity to access the pension rate of pay when they get to the age of 65.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in believes.  We know it is what workers want.  Workers are not foolish.  They do not seek out things that will cause the economy to crash.  Indeed, I am sure the speakers from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party know well how to crash an economy.  That is not what workers want.  Workers want to know that the pensions they paid into will be available to them when they reach the age of 65.  That is what this motion seeks to deliver.  It seeks to facilitate workers accessing the pension rate of pay at the age of 65.  It seeks to abolish mandatory retirement where that retirement is mandated within a person's contract and it seeks to allow workers to continue working on the same terms and conditions.  Like other speakers, I was alarmed by the IBEC submission to the Pensions Commission that referenced the potential use of fixed-term or altered contracts.  In actual fact, what we are looking for is an extension of a contract to facilitate a person to work on past the age of 65, and indeed, when they reach the age of 65 to have the ability to exercise choice.  There is a lot of dignity in having a choice.  For many Deputies, particularly on the Government side of the House, there is very little understanding of the options that are available to people.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that people should have the right to access their pension rate of pay at the age of 65.</p> <p>Much like the Minister of State in his speech, from an adequacy point of view, the Irish State pension is excellent at protecting pensioners from poverty.  However, we believe that, at the age of 65, one should have access to that rate of pay.  It is not the label that is put on it, or not calling it a pension, that is a factor in the alleviation of poverty.  It is the rate one gets.  Currently, the thousands of workers who hit 65 since the Government came in almost a year ago are on the jobseeker's rate, not on the pension rate.  The Minister of State was right when he said, from an adequacy point of view, the Irish State pension is excellent at protecting pensioners from poverty.  We are saying that they should be allowed to access that pension at the age of 65 when their shift is done and their work is completed.</p> <p> I am not sure there is a massive understanding on the Government side of the House that when people do backbreaking work, such as waiting tables, laying blocks and working outdoors in all weathers, they are ready to retire when they hit the age of 65.  Sinn F&eacute;in is saying to those people that we believe they should be able to access the pension rate of pay and have the dignity to choose.  If they want to work on, they should be able to retain their terms and conditions of employment.  If they want to retire, they should be allowed to do so and access the pension rate of pay.</p> <p> There is almost unanimity, which is quite unusual, on this issue across the board.  The Government said it will not oppose the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I believe that is a little bit disingenuous, however.  Not opposing something is not the same as supporting it.  The workers watching this debate this evening, particularly anyone in the age bracket of 60 to 64, will want to hear what the Government is thinking, regardless of what commissions, reports or other mechanisms it has used to sideline this issue.  On our part in Sinn F&eacute;in, we will ensure we keep this issue front and centre.  We will ensure we make good on the commitments we gave to people on the doorsteps in 2020.  Thanks to people like the STOP67 campaign, they have put this issue on the agenda for those parties that needed it.</p></speech>

People know that we listened and heard their concerns.  They know that we are using our time here this evening to keep this issue on the agenda.  It suits the Government to have this issue off the agenda.  We know from the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government record that when its back is to the wall, the first people thrown under the bus are the minimum wage workers.  If we do not keep this issue on the agenda, we know what will happen because we know the history of governments and how people are treated.  We will keep this issue on the agenda and we will be as good as our word.  We will push hard and continue to do so to allow people the opportunity to retire with dignity on the pension rate of pay at the age of 65.</p></speech>

A number of people came up to us to explain how angry and frustrated they were at what they perceived as a betrayal by the previous Government and Fianna F&aacute;il on the retirement age of 65.  In particular, one man stood out.  He told us he got his first job when he was 14 years old.  He worked for 41 years non-stop in the same company, starting as a boy carrying wood and blocks to finishing up in management.  He was retiring in March last year but the Government put him on the exchange.  The previous Government put him on the dole, as he called it, and kept him on it.  He said he never had a problem with jobseeker's allowance because whoever needed it was entitled to it.  His problem was that after working for 41 years non-stop that the Government put him on jobseeker's allowance.</p>  <p>  Where is the dignity and respect that people deserve?  As Deputy O'Reilly said, they worked hard jobs all their lives such as in factories, shops and hospitals.  They were denied the right to retire at 65 and, instead, were put on jobseeker's rate which is a lower rate than the pension rate.  The Government said it will not oppose this motion.  Will it support people who are 65 and give them the pension they deserve if they want to retire?  Many people want to continue to work after 65 which we support.  This is a rights issue.  Many Government Deputies promised the retirement age and the pension for those people at 65.  Those Deputies must stand by their word and live up to what they committed to.</p></speech>

The pilot events will use a range of measures to militate against Covid-19, including reduced attendances, social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitising, contact tracing, the careful management of ingress and egress of audiences and spectators, and appropriate ventilation for indoor events.  I sought these pilot events as I am determined to see a safe reopening of our live music sector as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Neither my Department nor I had indicated an intention to use antigen testing at the Iveagh Gardens event, although I am aware that the National Concert Hall has employed antigen testing for staff and performers in the past.  The Department has been monitoring pilot events internationally and is aware of the role that testing can play in supporting activities.  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced today that antigen testing will be deployed for the forthcoming concert event at the Irish Museum of Modern Art on 3 July.  Some 3,500 fans will be in attendance, 500 of whom will be health care workers.  Some of Ireland's best talent will be performing on stage, talent we have all so greatly missed seeing live in this past year.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in addition to the pilot events, from 7 June numbers permitted at organised outdoor events have increased to a maximum of 100 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 200 for outdoor stadia and venues where there is a minimum capacity of 5,000.</p>  <p>  The measures being employed will be reviewed for their appropriateness as pilot events proceed and will be adjusted as necessary and if necessary.  They will allow sports, arts, culture and entertainment organisations to test necessary control measures and other measures in venues across a range of settings and have been designed to inform the safe reopening of these sectors.  They will be subject to ongoing review including with respect to the prevailing public health situation.</p>  <p>  I have never been unwilling to publish the minutes of the meetings of the live entertainment working group and am happy to supply those to the Deputy, should he so wish.</p></speech>

I have been critical of the slow pace of the roll-out of pilot events, in particular, in comparison to other countries.  We could have been further along the road with those pilot events.  It is welcome that the Minister has announced the use of the antigen testing on 3 July.  If it had been used in the other events, we may be further down the road of rolling out and opening up live events, which would have been a very significant encouragement to musicians and others working in the entertainment industry who have been basically locked out of work for so long.  The events, obviously, have to be assessed afterwards.  There has to be a period of time to check whether there has been any spread of the virus, especially given that we are in dangerous times in respect of the Delta Indian variant, as people think.  Can the Minister outline how many more test events there will be before the industry can go fully live again?  What would set it back?  Is it all hands on deck as soon as the industry gets the all-clear after 3 July?</p></speech>

Today's announcement of antigen testing and reduced social distancing shows that progress is being made.  The reason this was not the case with the Iveagh Gardens event was because it was the first pilot event.  As the Deputy will know from his knowledge of this sector, it is not a question of switching it on overnight.  These are venues that have not been in operation for over 15 months and are now working in the context of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The first event was really about the logistics of simple things like staggered entrance and egress and social distancing.  We learned from that and we are moving to 1 m social distancing.  Progress is being made.  We will complete the pilot events as set out a few weeks ago in the Government announcement.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that in my engagement with the sector, I am determined for it to reopen.  I will, of course, have to be guided by the public health guidance at that time.</p> <p>We are making progress and will reopen as soon as possible.</p></speech>

That is why it is important that as many as possible of these test events are held in the proper manner and given the full range of supports and protections in order that lessons can be learned and processes can be set down as quickly as possible for the next series of events.  In doing so, organisers will have a better idea of whether there is a need for increased social distancing, for everybody to wear masks or whatever measures may be required based on the learnings from the pilot live events as soon as they are rolled out.  Those in the live industry who organise events need to know in order that they can plan for the end of July, August and September and, I hope, gain something from the summer season for live entertainment.  It will allow them to look towards the rest of this year rather than have to sit back and wait until next year.</p></speech>

Even today, the hospitalisation and ICU numbers are very positive.  I fully appreciate the lead-in times in planning and delivering events.  However, I cannot give a definite timeframe for when this will happen.  What I can give is my assurance that I will continue to work with colleagues in the Government and with the sector to bring certainty as soon as possible.  I am fully aware that in the case of venues working at reduced capacity, while it is good to have a return to live music, it is not viable.  That is why I secured in the national economic recovery plan a commitment that as long as venues are working with reduced capacity and social distancing due to restrictions, the many supports that have been rolled out will remain in place for the sector.</p></speech>

The proliferation and explosion in respect of people's interest in swimming and of their desire to swim, both indoors and outdoors, has been one of the positives of the pandemic, if we can say such a thing.  What is the Minister of State's strategy to ensure the activity will be well resourced in the years ahead?</p></reply>

In this regard, the local authority swimming pool programme provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  To date, 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects, in Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry, remain in the programme.  The Lucan pool is under construction and is expected to be completed later this year, while both the Buncrana and Edenderry projects are at contract documents stage.</p>  <p>  Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now provided under the large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, which was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facilities including both indoor and outdoor swimming pools, with at least &euro;100 million made available over the period to 2027.  Fifteen applications were received for swimming pool projects, all of which were for indoor facilities.  Provisional grants for eight swimming pools under the LSSIF were awarded in January 2020 and these projects are at various stages of a due diligence process.  While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF to new applications at present, the Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF programme, which is expected to be complete in the coming months.  This review will consider progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded, while the timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered.  Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding under the current review of the national development plan.</p>  <p>  As for future swimming pools, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027, launched on 25 July 2018, commits to the development of a national swimming strategy.  This will involve close collaboration with relevant Departments, local authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders.  As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how they can be met.  Moreover, a sports action plan, covering the period to the end of 2023, is nearing completion and will be published soon.  It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority in the early stages of that action plan.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I recently met representatives of Swim Ireland to discuss a proposal for a pilot programme using mobile or pop-up container pools to deliver swimming lessons on school grounds.  These pools can be transported to a school setting and I understand a similar scheme is in operation in the UK.</p>  <p>  I will conclude my prepared contribution in my follow-up response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200046#TT00900"><p>I was encouraged by the end of the Minister of State's response because we do need to identify gaps.  He and I were both elected to an elected local authority in 2014, Fingal County Council, that has no public swimming pool in the area.  It is quite incredible that a town the size of Swords or Balbriggan has no public swimming pool, whereas Finglas, when I was growing up, had one, while on the 17A bus route, there were three.  It is really important that the Minister of State and the Department, through the review of the funding mechanism, become drivers of the provision of swimming pools.  We cannot leave it to local authorities to drive it; it must come from the Minister of State and the Government.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in outdoor swimming, not just in the summer months but throughout the year.  Wonderful places such as the Captains and the Springers in Skerries and High Rock in Portmarnock have been used for years as swimming spots but there is no provision of facilities such as a place to get changed, somewhere to secure car keys or anything like that.  I refer not to wholesale infrastructure but to some supports for amenities, which would be welcome.</p></speech>

If successful, the scheme could be extended by the provision of additional container pools, something on which we will engage further with Swim Ireland.</p>  <p>  As I said, we have identified a national swimming strategy as a key priority in the national sports policy and the sports action plan we published this summer.  As part of that, we want to underpin the people who will deliver these programmes while addressing the deficits in certain parts of the country in regard to capital infrastructure and swimming pools, which the Deputy highlighted.  Ongoing capital schemes are open to clubs and organisations.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy lives in Fingal along the sea.  There is great interest in sea swimming.  Particularly during Covid, there was a significant increase in sea swimming while the use of pools was restricted.  It is open to any club to apply under the sports capital programme for equipment, and funding schemes are available through local authorities.</p></speech>

Swimming pools have too often been viewed through a for-profit lens.  We do not look at libraries, green spaces for field sports, playgrounds or any other public amenities like that, and rightly so, but when it comes to the provision of a local authority pool, the question is whether it will make a profit.  We need to move on from that.  The question should be whether it will be able to serve the community that needs it.  Only 25% of our pools, 100 of approximately 400, are in public ownership and many of them are blocked up by private groups.  That is understandable, but this is something we need to move on.  We need a wholesale change in how we approach swimming.</p>  <p>  It is great to see so much engagement and participation in outdoor swimming, but water quality is the key.  In Balbriggan, for example, the EPA reported poor water quality and it has thrown into doubt the entire season despite excellent water quality results.  That too is something that needs to be examined by relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for a very encouraging response.</p></speech>

The national sports policy identifies swimming as one of three sports that have great potential for generating higher levels of active participation over the course of one's life, along with cycling and running.  That is why it has been given priority status and is receiving additional funding under dormant accounts to promote greater participation under the Get Swimming campaign.</p>  <p>  From my engagement with Swim Ireland in the context of treating swimming as a public good, I am aware it is examining excellent initiatives from the UK that will help broaden the reach of swimming into more communities where there are infrastructural deficits.  It is also carrying out an ongoing survey of every piece of sports infrastructure in the country and tagging them in order that the geographical and community deficits can be accounted for.</p> <p>It could be areas of disadvantage or regional places which do not have the adequate sports infrastructure and being able to respond appropriately.  That will give us a national picture of where there is a deficit.  On the issue of-----</p></speech>

Tourism accommodation and outdoor dining, tourism attractions and activities have reopened and, subject to satisfactory progress with the health situation, more indoor activities will reopen in July.   </p>  <p>  The Government has supported businesses through the closure in particular with initiatives such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism business continuity scheme and is now assisting them in their reopening.  While CRSS and the tourism business continuity scheme have addressed fixed costs, the EWSS has been crucial in maintaining employment and the link between employer and employee.</p>  <p>  Its continuation was one of the key asks of the sector and the Government has committed to its maintenance until the end of 2021 in the economic recovery plan.  I know the reopening is very welcome but I also know it brings a number of challenges, especially in reconnecting with employees. </p>  <p>  Tourism brings employment to many parts of the country that have limited alternative job opportunities.  That said, I am aware of the reports of difficulties in rehiring workers.  After such a long period of closure it is not surprising there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved location or taken up other employment.  I also understand the caution some employees may feel about their safety, as well as concern about potential future closures. </p>  <p>  That is why the Government has taken a cautious and staggered approach to reopening to, as far as possible, avoid backward steps.  Thankfully, building on the high uptake in vaccination, we are still on track to deliver our plans for July and I hope this will give people confidence to return to work. </p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, tourism and hospitality accounted for approximately 260,000 jobs and F&aacute;ilte Ireland was very active in the issue of skills development in the sector.  The tourism recovery task force made a number of recommendations to enhance sustainable employment in the tourism sector to support both its survival and recovery.  This includes the development of a national tourism education gateway as a one-stop shop to education for all tourism employees.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to progress these recommendations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p></reply>

Some in government, the media and the industry have created the false narrative people are abusing the PUP.  It is not backed up by any data.  An Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, representative, who recently appeared before an Oireachtas committee, put forward the facts there and stated there was no basis for it whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I have sympathy with the sector.  It is not trying to take away from the hardship it has had over the past year and a half but the issue has to be addressed, for the sake of workers and employers.</p></speech>

The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has shown in its recent study, 95% of workers would be better off back at work.  The PUP was an effective response to unemployment brought about the pandemic.  The best way to secure the future of the industry and workers' incomes is to facilitate a safe and sustainable reopening that secures employment and income in the longer term.</p>  <p>  The tourism and hospitality sector, as the Deputy is aware, is a large employer.  It is not surprising, after such a long period of closure, there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved or taken up other employment.  I understand the caution employees may feel about the future and their concern about potential future closures.  The best way to address that is to support workers and businesses to help them get back to normal trading.</p></speech>

It is up to the Government to make sure it steps up and follows through in the commitment to introduce a living wage as a matter of urgency.  In 2019, almost 82,000 workers were in accommodation and food services.  In 2018, their median pay was &euro;313 per week.  If one weighs that against the cost of living, rent, utilities, childcare etc., one can understand why the sector is struggling with staff retention.</p>  <p>  It is not a new problem.  For years, we have had a shortage of chefs, cooks etc.  We should use this as an opportunity to address the long-running issues in the sector when it comes to workers' pay and conditions.  Does the Minister have plans for workers in tourism and hospitality, in terms of low pay and poor conditions and improvements in that area?</p></speech>

A recruitment for reopening webinar event was delivered on 30 April for tourism and hospitality businesses and more than 1,000 businesses registered for this event.  Each business received a toolkit to support the recruitment challenges, including sourcing opportunities.</p>  <p>  A social media campaign is live for the tourism sector and is targeting jobseekers on both Facebook and Instagram.  A schedule of targeted content will run through the summer on F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism career websites.  State agencies, such as SOLAS, through the education and training boards are delivering new sector-specific support, on their skills to advance programmes in conjunction with industry, with a number of higher education institutes continuing to develop new Springboard courses and deliver additional skills.  These programmes received funding as part of the human capital initiative to retain and regain qualified staff.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He also is keen to make progress on the living wage.</p></speech>

The Audience Agency was awarded the contract following a competitive tender process advertised on <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>.  The Audience Agency is a registered charity.  It is funded by Arts Council England as a cultural sector support organisation.  It is an experienced and internationally recognised monitoring and evaluation organisation whose mission is to enable cultural organisations to use data to increase their relevance, reach and resilience.</p><p>The monitoring and evaluation framework, developed in consultation with stakeholders, including my Department, provides for review of Galway 2020 project in terms of how it developed Galway&rsquo;s cultural capacity, delivered the programme rooted in people and place; and the social and economic benefit accruing.  The final monitoring and evaluation report, scheduled for delivery in quarter 4 this year, will include results on the number of cultural organisations supported, the jobs created to deliver the programme, new projects commissioned, events held, audience numbers and a breakdown of the total income and expenditure.</p><p>It is not within the remit of the monitoring and evaluation framework report to carry out an audit of Galway 2020 finances.  Galway 2020, as a registered company and charity, complies with all statutory and regulatory reporting requirements set out under the Companies Act 2014 and the Charities Act 2009, including the annual lodging of an audited financial statement with the Companies Registration Office and the Charities Regulator. </p><p>On the question of Galway 2020 legacy initiatives, Galway 2020 will, in the coming months, commence a focused stakeholder consultation process with creative, community, business, Government and European stakeholders.  This consultation process, together with  the report from the monitoring and evaluation framework, will inform the development of a sustainable strategic legacy plan for Galway 2020.  This legacy plan is due to be finalised before the end of the year.</p><p>The remaining &euro;1 million from my Department's overall funding commitment of &euro;15 million for Galway 2020 will contribute to the implementation of the legacy plan.</p> <p>Galway 2020 supported a wide range of local artists and cultural organisations to create, develop and deliver original works.  Close to &euro;15 million or 66% of the overall expenditure of &euro;22 million to date by Galway 2020 on delivery of its year as European Capital of Culture has been spent on cultural programme delivery.  Over 500 events employing at least 600 artists and other cultural professionals, such as producers, technicians and crew, have been delivered.  Cultural project partners are in the process of completing individual post-project evaluations.  Artists and cultural organisations funded included Druid Theatre, Branar children&rsquo;s theatre company, Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta, Galway Theatre Festival, Blue Teapot Theatre Company, Galway Community Circus, Babor&oacute; children&rsquo;s festival, Trish Forde, Galway Film Fleadh, R&iacute;onach N&iacute; N&eacute;ill, NUIG Aistri&uacute;, Galway International Arts Festival, Macnas, Music for Galway, Galway Dance Project, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n O&rsquo;Connor, Galway UNESCO City of Film, Galway hospital trust and Galway City Museum.</p> <p> The data from post-project evaluations are being collated to provide comprehensive information on key project deliverables for each artist or cultural organisation, including income and expenditure, numbers employed, numbers of events held, level of audience engagement, partnerships developed, outcomes and possible legacy opportunities.  This information will be used to inform the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for Galway 2020.  That will be delivered in quarter 4 this year.  As an indication of the level of delivery, I can advise that the seven post-project evaluations completed document that 374 artists and other culture professionals were supported to deliver 188 combined live and online performances and Galway Community Circus, as part of its projects, delivered 93 professional and 95 public training workshops.</p></reply>

I think the rule is that a little discretion is shown if a Deputy goes over one minute.  I thank the Minister.  One of the advantages of being Leas-Cheann Comhairle is that I have a copy of the Minister's answer but she read an additional answer that I do not have.  She might supply me with that because the answer I have is a basic one.  I welcome what she has set out but I would like the details.</p>  <p>  This is something I have followed up.  Galway 2020 was the most marvellous thing that happened to the city but the roll-out was not so marvellous.  Covid and bad weather interfered but, separate from that, there were huge issues related to staff, legal proceedings and the absence of transparency and accountability.  The Department took a lead in this and ensured, finally, that there was a performance delivery agreement.  There was no question of a legacy.  That came about through pressure, including from me, and eventually a committee was set up to look at the legacy.</p>  <p>  The two questions were tabled together.  I thank the Minister for her response, which is as comprehensive as it can be without providing more details.  We need to see the breakdown of the total of &euro;15 million given by the Department.  It is a substantial amount of money.  Presumably, that breakdown will come with the accounts, which I understand will be finished in June this year.  Then there is the Audience Agency.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me how much it is costing to carry out this evaluation.  I would expected evaluation and monitoring by the Department to be an inherent part of the ongoing process.  Then there is the legacy.  The Minister will have a consultation about the legacy over the coming year, when Galway 2020 is over.</p></speech>

The legacy planning is a key element of all European Capitals of Culture and an important aspect, as the Deputy pointed out, of Galway 2020.  Legacy planning involves taking stock of learnings from the delivery of the European Capital of Culture, incorporating the successes and building on these for the future.  The Galway 2020 monitoring evaluation report and stakeholder consultation will be initiated later in the summer and will feed into the development of the strategic legacy plan.</p>  <p>  Galway 2020 is working with a number of upcoming European Capitals of Culture on initiatives, such as the inclusion of projects from Galway 2020 in their programmes, thereby creating additional opportunities for Galway 2020 artists to foster sustainability in their careers and contributing further to meeting the objectives of the European Capital of Culture programme.</p>  <p>  The performance delivery agreement between my Department and Galway 2020 was signed on 6 November 2018 and addresses the roles and responsibilities of the Department and Galway 2020 in the provision and expenditure of the grant as well as key deliverables and performance indicators attached to the drawdown of the grant.  That agreement will expire on 1 July 2021.  While this is under discussion, the agreement will likely be extended to year end, at least.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's query about costs, I can get back to her.  I think she may have another question.  I am happy to talk to her afterwards.</p></speech>

We think of the amount of money that went into Galway 2020, without a basic income for artists.  That issue will come up later in another question.</p>  <p>  On buildings, I would love to see what we are getting from Galway 2020.  Has progress been made on the An Post building?  I think it has but the Minister might clarify that.  We have a former industrial school which has remained vacant since 2009, although there is a dispute as to whether it was 2011.  That is the wonderful Lenaboy site, which is lying idle.  It formed part of the redress from the nuns; it was not a gift but part of the redress.</p>  <p>  My problem with this is the legacy seems to be an afterthought, like the Irish language.  The Irish language officer was an afterthought and the first person to be let go when the troubled descended on Galway 2020.  I would have thought the legacy would be an integral part of Galway 2020, not something that came from pressure from Deputies and other sources when a committee was finally set up to determine what the legacy would be.</p></speech>

It will be difficult for me to answer them in the minute available but I am happy to provide the Deputy with all the information she wants and to be as transparent as possible.</p>  <p>  I absolutely agree about the basic income guarantee for artists.  A legacy and lesson to learn from Covid and from what we missed and enjoyed in Galway 2020 will be to support the arts.</p>  <p>  On the An Post building, the redevelopment of the site is a matter for Galway County Council and An Post.  The site is in the city centre and includes the city&rsquo;s central post office and a number of buildings behind it that housed a former telephone exchange and now defunct sorting and storing offices.  One of the vacant buildings in the complex on a laneway off the street was repurposed by the Galway International Arts Festival in 2019 and used as a temporary art gallery.  A number of arts organisations participating in Galway 2020 used it for rehearsals.  Under the An Post plan announced at the end of March 2021, a property developer will refurbish the existing post office, create a civic space and be free to use the rest for retail and commercial units.  It is intended that, while An Post will still own the land, the redevelopment will be on a very long lease.</p></speech>

Increased funding has been provided to Sport Ireland this year to assist with its participation programmes.  Sport Ireland plans to implement a return to sport campaign in 2021 which will target all demographics, including children.  This highly visible campaign will encourage people to engage in sport and physical activity and clearly signpost how they can access opportunities to participate.</p>  <p>  I am arranging for Sport Ireland to provide the Deputy with a comprehensive outline of its participation and promotion activities, including those for young people.  A sport action plan to cover the next three years will be published shortly and will contain a number of important measures and initiatives to steer increased participation in sport over the coming years.</p>  <p>  At my request, my Department recently organised two important consultation sessions in sport for young people.  In March, I listened to boys from the FAI Fingal transition year programme and girls from the Galway Swimming Club and Shark Swimming Club, also from Galway.  In April, with the great assistance of For&oacute;ige, I had a similar video consultation with young people from Blanchardstown Youth Service and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g from Cork, Meath, Tipperary and Waterford.</p> <p>There were many insightful and considered views on the current situation, as well as suggestions on improvements.  Areas such as access to facilities, transport issues, peer pressure, exam pressure and coaching standards were among the most prominent issues raised.  Subject to public health guidance, I intend to hold an in-person event in respect of this topic later this year that I hope those involved in providing sport for young people can attend and listen to their needs with a view to improving the situation in the long term.</p> <p> The sports capital and equipment programme, SCEP, supports the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city, for people of all ages and from all walks of life.</p></speech>

That is to be welcomed.  My question goes further than that because, unfortunately, young people are not returning to sport or to the arts.  As a result of the lockdown restrictions, people were isolated at home and could not train.  Some of them have not gone back.  I recently spoke to a coach who is a GAA academy co-ordinator in Cork city who told me he believes that one in five children between the ages of 11 and 16 has not returned to training.  This is quite a serious issue.  What supports are we going to provide for GAA clubs, soccer clubs and arts organisations to reach out to children and young people because I do not believe anyone should be let fall through the cracks as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions and the lockdowns?</p></speech>

I held a sports management group meeting only yesterday with many of the governing bodies and organisations and that was a topic raised by some involved in the call.  We will do everything we can to support the grassroots system and the sporting organisations so that we can enable young people to go back to sport.</p>  <p>  From my engagement with many sporting clubs and organisations, I know that many young people were delighted to get back playing and participating in recent weeks.  That has been extremely positive.  Matches have taken place.  Training is back and gyms have reopened.  As Deputy Gould outlined, however, we must identify those who may not have returned and do everything we can for them.  We are in discussions with the sports sector on a package for this year, which is about ensuring sporting organisations are kept afloat and can recover properly but also ensure that clubs at grassroots level are strong and sustainable post Covid.  That means keeping young people participating and involved.</p></speech>

It was fabulous to see the return to sport and the energy and excitement up there.  One of the problems for the club is that it does not own its own facility, it rents it.  The other problem for the club is that it pays fixed costs for electricity, gas and water and it also has to pay other bills.  For most of the past 15 months, the club has had no income.  Other clubs right across the sporting spectrum have likewise been affected.  I know some funds have been put in place to assist with rates and grants for opening up and installing sanitisers and other such measures to deal with the pandemic.  I welcome all of that, but we must go a step further.  Many clubs and organisations are now in real financial trouble as a result of the pandemic and I ask the Government to consider what we can do to support them.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Gould.  As I indicated previously, we are in ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on a package for sport this year.  There was a very positive package last year of approximately &euro;90 million, which included a club resilience fund.  The fund was designed to support sporting organisations at grassroots level with some of their costs.  We are engaging in discussions on a package for this year.</p>  <p>  Whether it is a boxing club or other type of sports club, the sports capital and equipment programme is open to everyone to try to strengthen clubs.  We had a record number of applications for funding this year.  I am not sure whether the club to which Deputy Gould referred applied to that particular fund.</p>  <p>  We are working with Sport Ireland to make sure we get as many people as possible back playing and participating in their clubs and being active now that sporting activity has reopened.  I hope we will have pods of six involved in boxing from early July.  Many indoor sports that have been restricted for such a long period will be able to reopen to a much greater extent, which will also improve participation.  I thank Deputy Gould for tabling the question.</p></speech>

I know the Minister and her officials put a lot of time and effort into it and met with a broad range of people involved in the music and entertainment sector.  The Oireachtas committee meets regularly with them as well.  At our most recent meeting, they expressed concern about some of the complexity involved in applying for the scheme and some of the qualifying criteria.  What has the success rate been like?

This scheme aims to support businesses operating solely in the live entertainment sector that do not qualify for other business supports and have been significantly impacted by Covid restrictions.  This scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of once-off, flat payments: &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021; &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of between &euro;50,001 and &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021 and; &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p>  <p>  Businesses, whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities operating exclusively within the live entertainment sector may apply.  Businesses of musicians and singers of all genres are eligible to apply, as are sound engineers, lighting engineers, audio engineers, stage managers, stage technicians, sound and lighting equipment suppliers, live-streaming equipment suppliers and full-time disc jockeys.  The scheme was designed to reach out and provide support for those who have not been supported to date.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this scheme is not a horizontal income support and grants are intended to provide a contribution towards business costs.  The scheme was developed in consultation with the sector and the eligibility criteria aim to strike an appropriate balance, having regard to other available supports and the need to reach as many professional musicians and crew as possible.  To date, just over 300 applications have been submitted for the scheme.  Of these, approximately 50 have been approved and three have been unsuccessful.  All details in respect of this scheme, including guidelines and the MEBAS application portal can be accessed on my Department's website.</p></speech>

If I read the reply correctly, only three of 300 applications have been refused, which is a refusal rate of only 1%.  That would speak to the scheme having some success.</p>  <p>  I note that the Minister mentioned the other scheme that was launched recently as well, providing &euro;25 million for the live performance support scheme, which will provide an opportunity for all those involved in the sectors mentioned to get back to work in some shape or form.</p> <p>What is apparent to me from the meetings I have had with these groups is the urge and desire just to get back out there and entertain and not to have to depend on supports and not to have to go through the process to get those supports.  What measures can we take to try to get as many people back entertaining as possible?  I know the local authorities have funding for outdoor entertainment locations in towns and villages.  Can we do more in that regard?</p></speech>

I come from this background myself and I am very much aware of the need not just for us to hear and enjoy music but for these people to get back to work.  It is not just the musicians but the technicians, the crew and everyone behind the scenes.  That is one of the lessons that has been learned because a light has been shone on those who work behind the scenes and how they need to be supported.</p>  <p>  The recent development has been the securing of the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force in that I have received agreement from my coalition partners and Cabinet agreement to pilot the basic income guarantee.  We have to look to the future and place value on artists by looking at how we can support them beyond Covid.  The pilot events I am rolling out at present in music are all about establishing that safe pathway back to work.  As the Deputy knows, I today announced one for 3 July, where 3,500 fans will attend, 500 will be healthcare workers and there will be antigen testing and reduced social distancing.</p></speech>

Often, when we go to see a show or we go to be entertained, we see who is standing on the stage but we have to recognise that many more people are operating front of house, backstage, in production, in decor and in everything else it has taken to get that entertainer on the stage.  It is important the schemes recognise them as well.</p>  <p>  In terms of outdoor entertainment, we have to look at places like pubs that have large beer garden spaces that are carefully managed and carefully controlled, so we can get as many of these people who are involved in entertainment, lighting, production and everything that goes with that operating as best we can.  I note that the live performance support scheme has a good range and that it ranges from the small independent venues right up to the bigger events we all enjoy during the summer.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

The live performance support scheme is unprecedented.  It shows that a sector that never had to reach out before had to reach out, and we responded with &euro;50 million in supports, including &euro;25 million in the live performance support scheme that was announced last week.  That will supply thousands of hours of work to thousands of performers and technical staff.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s query in regard to when we will get singers outdoors at those licensed premises, the Deputy may be aware that I have raised with my Cabinet colleagues that those regulations be reviewed because I want to get them performing again.  As many Members have said in the House, and I firmly believe it, the best support we can give to our musicians is to get them back performing again, and that is my goal.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200050#XX01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 77 together.</p><p>The sports capital and equipment programme, SCEP, is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.  In excess of 13,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to more than &euro;1 billion.  The programme for Government commits to continuing the sports capital and equipment programme and to prioritising the investment in disadvantaged areas.</p><p>The 2020 round of the sports capital and equipment programme closed for applications on Monday, 1 March.  By the closing date, 3,106 applications were submitted, seeking in excess of &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.  The scoring system and assessment manual for the 2020 round has been finalised and is available at <i>www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie</i>.  All applications are being assessed in accordance with this manual.  Given the large number of applications received, this assessment process is likely to take a number of months to complete fully.</p><p>Of the 3,106 applications, 1,000 were seeking sports equipment and these applications are being assessed first.  Approximately 75% of these have been assessed and the remaining ones should be finalised in the coming weeks.  Allocations to these applications will be made once the assessment is complete.  The remaining applications for capital works will be assessed immediately afterwards, with these allocations expected before the end of the year.</p><p>No decision on allocation amounts will be made until all applications have been assessed.  Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.  While a minimum of &euro;40 million is available, the level of funding will be kept under review in the context of drawdown demands in the coming years for older sports capital and equipment programme grants and the review of the national development plan.  As both Deputies know, that review is ongoing and will inform any future uplift in the sports capital programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200050#XX01600"><p>I appreciate the response.  I am very pleased there has been such a significant uptake.  It is an extraordinarily important scheme, which I know the Minister of State will recognise.  I am certainly hopeful the Minister of State would see fit, along with the Cabinet, to increase the level of funding available, given the unprecedented level of applications.  I am very pleased to hear that more than 1,000 of the clubs and associations that have applied for equipment grants, if I am reading between the lines, should hear a little sooner than the balance, which is very good news.  A number of improvements have been made to the sports capital scheme in recent years.  Certainly, in my time in this House, it has become a much fairer and more transparent process which the public can access regularly through the online portal.</p>  <p>  I have one question in regard to the clubs and associations which apply but whose application is unsuccessful initially, perhaps due to a lack of documentation.  Is it the Minister of State's intention to permit those clubs to fix their application to become eligible or will they be rolled on into the next programme, whenever that might be?  The Minister of State might offer clarity on that.</p></speech>

It is encouraging people of all ages to get physically active while simultaneously increasing the membership of local sporting clubs.  It would be useful to know if any communication has taken place with applicants on the sports capital and equipment programme since they submitted their applications.  It may be useful to consider sending an update on the information outlined by the Minister of State earlier to keep them informed on the progress with the processing of applications and to provide clarity to them on this matter.  Many clubs and sporting organisations are under incredible pressure financially as they maximise their efforts to provide outdoor facilities.  Keeping applicants informed will certainly go a long way and I ask the Minister of State to consider this important step.</p></speech>

On the first question from Deputy Farrell, the factual position is that if an error is identified in an application, that is communicated to the club and can be clarified.  However, if it is a matter of submitting new information which will affect the assessment, that is not allowable.  Historically, there were a huge number of unsuccessful applications because of minor errors in the application process.  That is outlined in the documentation and all clubs are kept abreast of that.</p> <p> Regarding Deputy Dillon's question, I will have to clarify whether there has been any further direct communication.  There would be communication from assessors if something has to be clarified or if an obvious errors is identified.  I can clarify the broader communication of timelines with my officials and revert to the Deputy about it.  Many parliamentary questions are asked by Deputies who are anxious to see this timeline progressed.  As I said to Deputy Farrell in the initial response, the equipment is being assessed and we hope to conclude that in the coming weeks.  The broader sports capital applications will hopefully conclude in the autumn.</p></speech>

I refer to a prior question from Deputy Gould answered by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, about sustaining participation in sport.  The sports capital programme forms a critical part of that process.  While I appreciate that &euro;200 million for the sports capital programme is unlikely and that &euro;40 million is quite generous, I am interested to see if there will be a move in the near future to try to accommodate as many clubs as possible.  The Minister of State has mentioned that criteria will be made available.  What sort of recognition might be given for future sports capital and equipment grant programmes for those clubs which have submitted successful applications?</p></speech>

This would be welcome.  Sporting clubs and organisations will be key in counteracting the mental health challenges which have resulted from this pandemic.  We need to increase the quality of our outdoor sporting infrastructure after a period of social interaction having been kept to a minimum for many people.  Increasing the funding to this programme should be considered as an investment and not viewed as a cost.  To add to Deputy Farrell's point, that would also allow for an increase in the number of applicants who would benefit from this funding.  This year will be the most important ever with regard to how we support our sporting organisations and maximising how we benefit our communities.</p></speech>

There is scope for it and there will be ongoing engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Regarding the published criteria, key components are: the likelihood of increasing participation in sport, as people mentioned; sharing of facilities; level of socioeconomic disadvantage; technical merits of the project application; and the level of own funding available.  We also have a particular focus on greater female participation, people with disabilities, disadvantaged areas, and minority groups, as well as focusing on areas that we have identified that have a sporting deficit so that they can have an opportunity.  The criteria are all set out and address many of the key aims under the sport policy.</p></speech>

Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector&rsquo;s survival and sustainable recovery.  Until now, the focus has been on the survival phase.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023, submitted by the tourism recovery task force last year, continues to be an important consideration for me, as well as my colleagues in the Government, as we continue to evaluate additional measures to support the recovery of the sector.  It has informed many of the measures introduced to date which support the tourism sector. The sector-specific measures I have introduced, together with the horizontal supports available, have been critical for helping tourism businesses and employees through the pandemic.</p>  <p>  There are recommendations aimed at the stabilisation and recovery phase in the recovery plan, with an emphasis on sustainability.  These include the development of a suite of actions to promote the sustainable development of tourism and that these actions in turn will underpin the development of a sustainable tourism policy to be adopted by Government.</p>  <p>  A sustainable tourism working group set up under the aegis of my Department published guiding principles for sustainable tourism development at the end of 2019.  An ambition in it states, "Ireland will seek to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices".  Earlier this year, in order to maintain momentum on the sustainable tourism agenda, I reconvened this working group to complete the development of a set of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new national tourism policy being developed.  I expect to receive the group's final report shortly.  It will outline the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices in the short term.  Following this, I will instruct my officials to initiate the development of a new national tourism policy later in the year.  This policy will mainstream sustainability, rather than having it as an additional consideration.  I want the recovery in the tourism sector over the coming years to be sustainable in environmental, social and economic terms.</p></speech>

Surely we want to focus on longer stays rather than getting people in and out of the country quickly?  Surely we want to look at more dispersed tourism rather than all the pressure and bed nights being in Dublin?  I will naturally refer to Waterford but also to the rest of the country, so that tourism spending is more dispersed.  People will increasingly focus on experience rather than consumption.  Will we focus on cultural output, heritage and those intangibles, which is what we do well in this country, rather than on just consumption?  The pandemic has taught us many things, including perhaps that tourists need to slow down to enjoy their stays rather than to get quickly in and out.</p></speech>

Sustainable development in tourism means using, without exploitation, our cultural and other tourist resources, to preserve them for future use by future generations.  This means that tourism can be a positive, as the Deputy would understand, for local communities, as well as being economically sustainable.  It means longer stays and tapping into all the resources in a community during those stays.  We must seek to realise Ireland's ambition to be among world leaders in sustainable tourism practices.  We are well placed to be a world leader.  Development of the new policy which I mentioned earlier will set out the path for the coming years, which will support sustainable recovery and the subsequent regrowth.  The Deputy mentioned Waterford.  It has been a leader in sustainable tourism activities, especially the greenway from Dungarvan to Waterford city, which has been an exemplar for other cycle routes across the country.  It is a testament to the determination and co-operation locally.</p></speech>

I see the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage waiting in the wings.  There is a real role in heritage-led development, not only of our towns and villages, but also of our tourism product.  Waterford is an outstanding example of that.  The Minister of State with responsibility for heritage opened the Museum of Time in Waterford for us last week.  Our Museum of Silver will be opened by the Minister for Finance on Thursday.  The Minister referred to the greenway, St. Declan's Way, going farther west.</p> <p>It will link all the way to Cashel and will provide an outstanding tourist experience.  We need to focus on that and away from the consumption model where people come quickly into and out of our cities and perhaps do not spend a great deal or experience the culture in the way that we might like them to.  We need to ensure we have a regional approach to this and not just concentrate on bed nights in Dublin which before the pandemic was reaching capacity.  We need to spread that spend across the country.</p></speech>

A week ago, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 got amazing support in this House.  It will establish a legally binding framework for clear targets and commitments set out in law to ensure we achieve our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term.  Every sector needs to play its part.</p>  <p>  I am confident that our tourism sector will be a strong participant in achieving these legally binding targets.  Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise the ambition that we spoke about earlier to become the world leader in sustainable tourism practices.  These objectives are consistent with the EU climate ambition and the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  Ireland has the reputation for being the Emerald Isle internationally.  Sustaining and nurturing this real green image through the adoption of sustainable tourism practices is an important underpinning for the recovery and future tourism growth.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to commend the Danish football team on the dignified way they minded their teammate and the medical staff on their response.  Like most people, I watched in horror thinking the worst was going to happen and was delighted that it did not.  Having a defibrillator and trained personnel on site made a difference to Christian Eriksen still being alive today.  Will it be a requirement for sporting organisations to have a defibrillator?  Will funds be available for them?</p></reply>

We were all horrified by what happened to Christian Eriksen and I commend his teammates on what they did on the day.  I am glad he is recovering well.</p>  <p>  The procurement of defibrillators and subsequent training is in the first instance a matter for each individual club.  However, the State provides a number of supports for their purchase and training for their use.  The sports capital and equipment programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Grants are available for a wide variety of capital works and non-personal sports equipment including first aid kits and defibrillators.  </p>  <p>  Defibrillators situated at sports clubs are generally also for community use.  Funding is also available through the HSE&rsquo;s national lottery grants schemes and other community grants schemes.  At a local level, the network of local sports partnerships throughout the country deliver education and training opportunities across a broad range of areas to local sports clubs and community groups.  This includes first aid workshops, which typically cover CPR and-or defibrillator training as part of the content.  </p>  <p>  Defibrillators can improve a person&rsquo;s survival chances following sudden cardiac arrest and their availability can be an important part of the medical response.  I would encourage all governing bodies to support their clubs in their efforts to purchase defibrillators.  I am aware that much important work is happening already.  The three large field sports have been very proactive and have dedicated programmes in place relating to cardiac care, screening and defibrillator training.  </p>  <p>  A number of national governing bodies of sport also have schemes in place to support their club networks in cardiac care, screening and defibrillator training.  The GAA&rsquo;s community heart programme, the FAI&rsquo;s heart care programme and the IRFU&rsquo;s safe rugby programme are excellent examples of proactive supports to assist clubs and members to participate safely in sport.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has also commenced work on the development of a national database of sport and recreation amenities.  This GIS-based database encompasses considerably more datasets than was originally envisaged in an audit of sports facilities and is expected to be substantially completed within two years.  As part of this work, Sport Ireland is examining a proposal to include the location of defibrillators in the database.  This would be an important part of our sporting infrastructure and would allow us to see where defibrillators are located and then target investment on having them located in areas where there has not been an intervention up to now.</p>  <p>  We have ongoing capital and equipment supports for defibrillators and also through our local sports partnerships.  It is important that we train volunteers in our communities so that they can use the equipment in a way that saves a person's life.  We should also have ongoing support through the sporting organisations for their maintenance and so on.  I have outlined the broad range of supports there and I appreciate the importance of the question.  </p></speech>

In my area I commend the Ciaran Carr Foundation.  Ciaran collapsed while training in 2012.  He was training for my club, Round Tower GAA club, and despite the valiant efforts of his teammates, Ciaran tragically passed away just short of his 21st birthday.  His parents, Gemma and Phillip, set up the Ciaran Carr Foundation to raise awareness of sudden adult death syndrome and provide supports for the families of people who pass away as a result of it.  I acknowledge the work the Government has done in providing funding for the equipment.  Would the Minister of State consider having an awareness campaign on where these are located, how to use them and how clubs can access the funding for this life-saving equipment?</p></speech>

We were all shocked by what happened to Christian Eriksen.  We were absolutely delighted that it did not end in tragedy.  There was spectacular action, particularly by the Danish captain and his teammates.  Obviously, the medical care kicked in quickly.  We need that to happen in all these sorts of circumstances.</p>  <p>  I accept what the Minister of State has said on the sports partnerships and the amount of grants available.  We need to ensure we have a steady supply of these defibrillators where they are needed.  We also need to ensure people are trained up.  The Minister of State mentioned the GIS database system.  I ask him to consider an audit to go beyond just sports groups so that we also look at the community sector and ensure as many defibrillators as are viable are provided wherever they are needed.  </p></speech>

In my area, Seaghan Kearney, who is involved in St. Oliver Plunkett Eoghan Ruadh GAA club, tells the story of the importance of having a defibrillator in communities throughout the country.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, this will primarily cover the deficits in sporting infrastructure throughout the country.  We are trying to ensure it includes defibrillators.  I will engage with my colleagues with responsibility for the community sector.</p>  <p>  Speaking personally, a relation of mine passed away from sudden adult death syndrome and I know how difficult that is for the families.  I would be supportive of an awareness campaign.  Family screening is also important.  Many people are not aware of how it can run genetically.  Having cardiac screening for families that have been affected is also important.  I would absolutely support any campaign on that front.</p></speech>

It plays in two different parks, located in two different local authority areas, Griffeen Valley Park and St. Catherine's Park, one of which is in the South Dublin County Council area the other of which is in the Fingal County Council area.  Members of the club are really concerned that if there were an incident, it would be too late for them if they needed to get a defibrillator on site.  Not all clubs have a structure or a building in which to locate a defibrillator.  Would the Government consider working with local authorities to provide defibrillators in local parks so that all sporting organisations can avail of them irrespective of whether they have a building in which to locate them?</p> <p>Will the Minister of State work with the local authorities to achieve this?  This would be very beneficial.  In my own area, there are hundreds of children involved in Collinstown Football Club, but there is no defibrillator in the park where they play.  This would be a really welcome initiative.  I ask that the Minister of State work with the local authorities to proceed with it.</p></speech>

It highlights the necessity for defibrillators and for us to ensure the availability of defibrillators and know-how in that regard where and when it is needed.  We need to make sure that happens.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to engage with some of his colleagues in regard to putting in place a holistic solution.  Screening is necessary.  I have heard it said previously that one in 500 people have cardiomyopathy, but as most people do not train as elite athletes they are not necessarily always tested.  We need a greater level of screening.  As I said, an audit, not only in regard to sports clubs but across the community sector and local authorities, would be beneficial so that we can identify the deficits.  We must ensure we have defibrillators where we need them when we need them.</p></speech>

In the days that followed the Christian Eriksen collapse, I would say many Deputies got emails from members of the public querying the availability of automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in their communities.  In that regard, the local Lions organisation in Fingal has an extensive list, which is really useful to be able to provide to people.  </p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that Dublin City Council has an extensive list of public locations.  Fingal County Council, which is my local authority and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, does not.  As mentioned by one of the Deputies, it would be a good idea to ask our local authorities to co-ordinate on this issue.  I am aware that there are funding streams available to other non-governmental organisations for the provision of AEDs, in addition to the sports capital grants.  The Government might consider the roll-out on a national basis of a register and maps for AEDs.</p></speech>

I agree with what Deputy Farrell said.  All of the local sports partnerships are interlinked with the local authorities.  We can play a role in aligning the sports infrastructure with community facilities in line with what the Deputy mentioned has been done by Dublin City Council.  We will work with all Deputies on this issue.  What people saw on their screens with regard to Christian Eriksen has alerted the minds of everyone to it.  We also need general screening.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned cardiomyopathy.  It is a condition unknown in so many people until something happens, which then results in families getting screened.  Any event or incident that brings about public attention should cause us to provide a proper response, be that through the provision of information working with the local sports partnerships, the local authorities and the community sector.  My door is open to everyone so that we can save lives.  This is an important issue to raise.</p></speech>

Accordingly matters such as the closure of an airline come under the remit of his Department. </p>  <p>  As an island nation, Ireland relies heavily on air transportation for tourism purposes.  Maintaining and growing direct, competitive and convenient access to the island of Ireland is of critical importance to our tourism sector.  The air access landscape has profoundly changed since the outbreak of Covid-19 and it may be several years before air capacity returns to the levels seen in 2019.  For our tourism sector, strong air and sea access links are vital.  The restoration of air connectivity will be essential to restoring growth in overseas tourism to Ireland.   </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the particular importance of regional connectivity and the importance of our regional airports to the regions they serve.  Stobart Air had the contract for operating Government-supported PSO air services on two routes between Dublin and the airports of Kerry and Donegal.  The recent termination of its franchise agreement with Aer Lingus had immediate implications for both PSO services.  I understand that the Department of Transport has initiated an emergency procurement process with a view to restoring air services linking Dublin with Donegal and Kerry airports.  The Minister for Transport hopes that this process will be completed by early July with a view to services recommencing by the new operator as soon as possible thereafter.  The contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate in accordance with EU law.   </p>  <p>  In light of Government restrictions on travel, load factors on these routes had been very low since the onset of the pandemic.  Accordingly, the interim impact of this event on tourism in the regions of Kerry and Donegal is expected to be very small given that replacement services will be restored in the coming weeks in conjunction with the resumption of international travel on 19 July.  I will continue to work closely with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my colleagues across Government to support the restoration of direct connectivity to and within Ireland.</p></reply>

I appreciate the level of funding her Department has offered the sector.  There are extreme difficulties, particularly in our regions.  As a general observation, I want to express my disappointment that Stobart Air went to the wall, in light, in particular, of it being a PSO carrier.  A modest level of funding with a requirement for us to ensure that the routes would be retained and maintained might have gone a long way, but it is a bit late now.  I appreciate what the Minister said in her response.</p>  <p>  On a point of order, I have a bit of difficulty keeping track of business.  For some reason, the screen behind the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not display the business or question being dealt with.  I am sure that like me other Members find that slightly problematic.</p></speech>

It is a core part of our attractiveness as a location to invest in Ballina.  It is served by a superb team at Ballina railway station.  The Ballina freight depot is one of the busiest in the country.  However, since Christmas there have been a number of disruptions to services and in recent weeks the service has stopped completely.  A wonderful company called International Warehousing and Transport, IWT, has been running the service.  It has shown huge ambition in terms of developing the service and it has further plans for it.  The service has come to a halt because of difficulties at Dublin Port that relate to Brexit and the need for space and some other issues which have put a stop to trains going into Dublin Port.</p>  <p>  It is ridiculous that Dublin Port, the biggest port in the country, is no longer open to rail freight.  We passed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 in this House last week, during which debate we heard much talk about lowering emissions.  We are failing to lower emissions yet a freight service which catered for between five and seven freight trains per week and took freight off the road is stopped.  There does not appear to be a huge amount of urgency in terms of resolving the issue.</p> <p>I know that work is under way and that the Department of Transport is engaging.  It is a very minor operational issue.  Dublin Port is engaging with International Warehousing and Transport, IWT, and Irish Rail but urgency is needed.</p> <p> I acknowledge the engagement of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on this matter.  I know she cannot be here this evening.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that the Department of Transport needs to get serious about rail services in the west.  It does not believe in them.  It treats rail services as an item under "any other business".  This service works and is profitable.  It delivers in so many ways and yet there is no urgency in the Department to resolve the issue.  It is typical of the Department's approach to rail transport in the west.</p></speech>

I know this is an issue which is very close to Deputy Calleary's heart.  He has argued the case for Mayo very well and very strongly at a number of forums.  I was astounded to read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>which stated that freight services through Dublin Port were to be discontinued.  I had assumed that we would be going in the other direction in every sense.  In fact, when the new Government was formed last year, I spoke to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, about this and expressed my assumption and wish that freight would be increasingly directed onto rail, even aside from this particular issue, of which I was not aware at the time.  I got into politics partly through the railways in a sense.  I set up a group in my village of Sallins for commuters seeking to improve the rail service there.  I passionately believe in the railways for the movement of people, freight and goods.  It is more comfortable, environmentally friendly and efficient.  There are so many benefits with regard to the movement of both people and goods that they hardly need repeating.</p><p>At a time when we have a great many opportunities, when Brexit is favouring Irish ports with increased traffic, when more and more goods are coming through Ireland as a gateway to Europe and when we are seeing opportunities in all of our ports and a spike in traffic, it is staggering to see Dublin Port suddenly deciding that the right thing to do is to close down one arm of its service.  I am aware that customs posts need to be there and that various checks need to be done.  I believe 5 ha is now devoted to this in Dublin Port.  It is a necessary evil but the answer to an increase in business is not to contract an operation.  Surely, it is to expand and to invest in it.  I might regret it but I could understand it if we were all here wringing our hands and lamenting that a railway was being taken up because of a lack of business or a lack of interest but, to add insult to injury, this is a successful commercial operation.  As Deputy Calleary stated, Ballina is serviced by five to seven trains a day.  Coca-Cola helps with the operation and other firms may be involved.  This is a successful enterprise which is being taken away and stopped at the very moment it is needed most for environmental and other reasons.  We made the mistake of lifting up railways in this country before.  Let us learn something from history and not go down that road again.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the position regarding rail freight into Dublin Port on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.</p>  <p>  The Minister and the Minister of State strongly believe in the potential of rail freight and think it can play a bigger role in freight transport generally on this island.  Both have spoken specifically on the potential for rail freight in the west.  This is why, as part of the strategic rail review, we have included a specific focus on the topic.  The review will also examine how our key ports are connected to the rail network and whether improvements are needed.</p>  <p>  The focus we are looking to bring to this issue replicate the focus at a European level, where there is a renewed push to examine rail freight corridors and their potential as part of the Green New Deal.  Obviously, there are differences in terms of what that potential might be across different countries, including in Ireland, however, it is clear in my mind that we can, and should, look to increase the modal share of rail freight from an environmental perspective and with a view to reducing congestion on our roads.</p>  <p>  Specifically on Dublin Port, the Ministers are aware of operational issues that have arisen in the port involving two private companies with regard to the facilitation of rail freight services there.  This relates to capacity constraints that have occurred in a lo-lo terminal in the port that are impacting on the rail services.  To give some background, Dublin Port is the largest and busiest port in the State serving the trading needs of Ireland and handling, on average, 70% of all vessels visits and over 50% of all tonnage handled by ports in Ireland.  Since the end of the Brexit transition period last January, shipping services direct to the Continent from Ireland have increased from approximately 36 lo-lo and ro-ro sailings a week in the first quarter of 2020 to more than 60 sailings direct to the Continent now.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, reports that, in recent months, ro-ro volumes on Republic of Ireland&ndash;EU direct services increased by 81% while lo-lo volumes increased by 11%.</p>  <p>  In Dublin Port, the lo-lo freight terminals are leased, managed and operated by private stevedoring companies.  The rail line or spur in Dublin Port currently goes into the area where one of the stevedoring companies provides services for loading containers on and off trains.  Since January, with the increased level of sailings and number of containers being handled in the port, this has led to significant pressures on space to cater for the additional freight and the containers coming in by rail at the same time and location.</p>  <p>  Dublin Port, with an 85% percent share of all ro-ro trade in Ireland, provided 14.6 ha or almost one fifth of its lands on the north side of the river to facilitate the State services required post Brexit including facilities relating to customs, agriculture, immigration and so on.  At the same time, Dublin Port is undertaking its most ambitious development programme in over a century to future-proof the port by providing additional cargo handling capacity and infrastructure for larger vessels, which is essential to cater for a growing economy.  In the six years prior to 2020, and the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a 36% growth in freight volumes at the port.  As it undertakes this work, Dublin Port itself is experiencing pinch points with no spare space at present which can be provided for the container services.  With the completion of the capital works at the port and the introduction of a range of measure to optimise operations, however, it is intended that further growth can be facilitated in the future, along with the growth in rail services at the port.</p>  <p>  The Minister and Minister of State are aware that discussions are ongoing at present with the stakeholders involved, including the two private companies along with Irish Rail and Dublin Port, to explore options to resolve these issues.  They strongly urge all parties involved to engage constructively in this dialogue to ensure the continuation of the rail services into the port now and into the future.</p></speech>

He spoke about the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, wanting to bring a focus on connecting key ports to the rail network.  Such a connection was in place in Ballina long before the Ministers came into Government.  We have a service that works well and which has massive potential but it has been stalled for reasons that have nothing to do with the service itself but, rather, with Dublin Port and the constraints there.  I accept that Brexit is a challenge and that there have been other challenges at the port in recent weeks but the Brexit referendum was held five years ago.  There was time to put all of these things in place.  Given the size of Dublin Port, surely space and priority should have been given to rail freight if it is a priority.</p>  <p>  This is typical of the Department's view of rail transport.  We are being subjected to another strategic rail review.  A rail committee in the west today published a report by Dr. John Bradley, formerly of the ESRI, into the viability of the western rail corridor.  This debunks entirely the taxpayer-funded EY report, paid for and commissioned by the Department.  That a private, volunteer-led organisation could debunk a State report entirely says volumes about the lack of commitment in the Department of Transport with regard to rail freight and rail transport.</p></speech>

It seems to tell us that the port is very busy and getting busier.  We already know that.  That is the whole point of this debate.  Why can we not use this to put more freight onto the railways?  Why are we discontinuing a vital service at the very time it is needed most and when the port is in expansionary mode?  I have gone through the reply a couple of times to see if I missed something.  The Minister of State is agreeing with us but not proposing any solutions.  I do not blame him, he has just been dragged in to take this debate, but it really beggars belief.  I see the evidence of this with my own eyes.  We have enough trucks on the road already.  I represent Kildare North, which effectively serves as an outer M50.  Trucks come off the M4 in the north and run to the M7 in the south, without bothering to go through the M50 in Dublin.  They criss-cross Clane, Sallins, Naas, Straffan and all of the little villages and rat runs along the way.  It is bad for north Kildare, for Ireland and for the environment.  At a time when we should be expanding rail freight, this makes absolutely no sense.  If Dublin Port cannot handle it, perhaps Drogheda, Arklow or a new deepwater port need a go.  If Dublin Port is not up to it, somewhere else should take over.</p></speech>

Significant Government investment has gone into the customs, agriculture and immigration inspection facilities necessary since 1 January 2021.  There has been a remarkable response from the shipping sector in the context of a significant number of additional sailings direct to the Continent as a result of market demand.  There has also been a sharp increase in the demand for lo-lo services.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that neither the Minister for Transport nor the Department is directly involved in decisions taken by the privately operated terminal at Dublin Port.</p> <p>However, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is very concerned that the question of the continuation of rail services into the port should arise at a time when the focus is on ensuring our transport modes are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable.  The Minister understands discussions are continuing to explore several options to address the situation.  He encourages all parties to engage constructively to ensure the difficulties are resolved as a matter of urgency so that Irish Rail can maintain and develop its services to the port.</p> <p> The ultimate aim is that rail freight continues to be facilitated at Dublin Port in line with Government policy and particularly having regard to the strategic review of rail freight that is under way.  It is acknowledged that freight by rail can make a significant contribution to climate action initiatives and tackling road congestion.  As I mentioned, the Department of Transport, in consultation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and other relevant stakeholders, is undertaking a strategic review of the heavy rail network on the island of Ireland.  The Department launched the procurement process in April and it is expected that work on the review itself will commence by the summer and take 12 months to complete.  This will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate that Garda resources are a matter for the Garda Commissioner but people in east Meath are rightly very distressed and concerned.  It is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country.  The Garda station was built 20 years ago to meet the needs of a population one quarter the size of the current population.  The one thing all electoral areas in County Meath such as Trim, Kells, Ashbourne, Navan and Ratoath have in common is they all have a full-time, 24-7 Garda station and a Garda superintendent.  East Meath, including Laytown and Bettystown, has a population of 34,000 and that will increase by approximately 10,000 in the coming years but it does not have those services and it needs them urgently.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner is aware of this issue and he is listening to us.  He met local representatives at the joint policing committee on 6 March 2020, and he was aware of the boundary issue between Meath and Louth in terms of ensuring there could be hot pursuit of criminals from east Meath into Drogheda and <i>vice versa</i>,  if needed.  The problem is parents are very upset as children were assaulted there recently.  A couple of Sundays ago, the Garda dog unit and the Garda mounted support unit were needed in the area to ensure peace would prevail and thugs and people out of their heads on drink and drugs would not be able to dominate social life over a very important weekend.</p><p>Residents who live in one part of estates in Drogheda such as Rosevale and Beaubec ring Ashbourne Garda station, 25 miles away, while those who live in the other part of the estates ring Drogheda Garda station.  That is not good enough and it is not acceptable.  The Minister for Justice is aware of the issue and I have discussed it with her and the Department, but it is up to the Garda Commissioner, who has listened to us in Drogheda before, to deal with it.  He assigned additional garda&iacute; to the area following the appalling murder of Keane Mulready-Woods.  Let us have action now in east Meath.  The people need it and demand it.  Tania O'Neill, a mother from the area, is campaigning very strongly on the issue.</p></speech>

That is indefensible.  I cannot put it any more simply than to say Laytown and the wider east Meath area demands and needs a 24-7 Garda station.  As all present are aware, three weeks ago, Jamie O'Neill, a young leaving certificate student from Bettystown, was viciously beaten in a savage and unprovoked attack on Bettystown beach.  The policing district is managed out of Ashbourne rather than out of Drogheda Garda station, which is nearby.  The call that was made to the Garda about the incident ended up in Kildare.  This is madness.</p>  <p>  There are 22 garda&iacute; in Laytown, up only marginally on the number in 2016.  When the station is closed, the area is managed by mobile dynamic patrols.  Until the crash and the cutbacks of 2008, the station had its own superintendent.  In fact, there were plans to build a brand new station in the Laytown area to service the rapidly expanding east Meath and south Drogheda area, but responsibility was then given to Ashbourne, 30 km away, to manage Laytown.</p>  <p>  The population of the area has trebled since 1996.  It is not the small rural picture-postcard hamlet it used to be, although it is still very beautiful and one of my favourite places.  However, it has got bigger and the challenges have become more extreme, but the services have not been provided to respond to the population changes.  It has suffered more than its fair share of poor planning decisions and poor public policymaking in the past 20 years.  The people of the area are entitled to security, a full-time station and to have their demands met as taxpayers and citizens.  If the Government does not agree with the emotional arguments in favour of providing a full-time station, it should just look at the figures and how rapidly the population of the area has expanded in the past three years and how it will expand again in the coming years in the context of the new draft Meath development plan.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management and administration of Garda business, including the distribution of members of the Garda throughout the State.  The Minister for Justice has no role in these independent functions.  The determination of the need for the development of a new Garda station in Meath or at any other location will be considered by the Commissioner in the context of the overall accommodation requirements arising from the ongoing expansion of the Garda workforce, the availability of capital funding, the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, and the new Garda operating model which will inform the accommodation priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the years 2022 to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works, OPW, has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Works in respect of Garda accommodation are progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the OPW.  Again, the Minister for Justice has no direct role in these matters.  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of all resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure their optimum use.  In that regard, I note the crimes cited by the Deputies.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in Garda resources in Meath in recent years.  As of the end of May 2021, a total of 322 Garda members, in addition to 43 Garda staff, were assigned to the Meath division.  These figures represent increases of 16% and 65%, respectively, since December 2015.  As regards Laytown Garda station in particular, an inspector was appointed to the station in January of this year, indicating the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the area.  I am advised that local Garda management has taken steps to improve Garda coverage in the area.  These steps include increased frequency of patrols in affected areas as well as regular support from the divisional operational support unit for the area.  The Meath division is one of four divisions earmarked by the Commissioner for the introduction of the new Garda operating model in the next year.  The new operating model is envisaged to deliver improvements to structures, processes, services and governance, and there will be an increase in the number of front-line garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Drogheda: Creating a Bridge to a Better Future report recently published by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and compiled by Mr. Vivian Geiran, a former director of the Probation Service, recommends that exploration of how to address the issue of the impact of the county boundaries of Louth and Meath and the corresponding delineation between Garda districts and divisions, with specific regard to the policing of the Laytown-Bettystown area of east Meath, be undertaken.  An implementation plan for the report is due to be published by the Department of Justice shortly.  I again thank the Deputies for raising this issue.</p></speech>

The Geiran report was commissioned following the appalling and vile murders in the Drogheda area.  Indeed, there were also murders in east Meath, including the execution of a person outside his front door.  In addition there are people missing, believed murdered, in the same general area.  It is a significant issue.  I welcome that reference was made to the Geiran report.  That means the Commissioner is aware of the action he must take.  He has listened to us previously and I stress I have every confidence he will act on this issue, but he needs to act now because the Tania O'Neills of this world will not wait and let their sons or daughters be attacked and assaulted.</p> <p>They want a proper and appropriate Garda service and they are entitled to it.  Garda&iacute; want to provide that service but they are not in place to do so.  We need additional garda&iacute; to be assigned to the area.  The initiative introduced by Commissioner Drew Harris in Drogheda was very welcome.  We need him to introduce a new initiative in east Meath.</p></speech>

She speaks for all local parents and citizens, who are deeply frustrated with the situation, notwithstanding the good efforts of local garda&iacute; and Garda management.  This is not just an emotional argument.  All the evidence is there, including the Central Statistics Office data showing a huge increase of 70% in public order offences in the area between 2018 and 2019.  There was an increase in the region of 15% in recorded crime for the station at Laytown between 2016 and 2019.  We have seen far too many gang-related criminal problems in the area, with some residents complaining there is open drug dealing going on and people behaving with impunity.  Only 7% of all Garda resources in the community are deployed to the east Meath area.  Given the size of the agglomerated area made up of Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington and south Drogheda, we are entitled to expect more.  We are entitled to expect a full-time Garda station for these citizens and taxpayers to help them feel more secure and support what is a great community that is set to develop further over the next few years.</p></speech>

It is vitally important and they have brought forward very serious crime issues in the area that we need to tackle.  I assure them that community safety is a priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as evidenced by the Government's unprecedented Garda provision for 2021.  In tandem with this year's record Garda budget, the Department's justice plan for 2021 includes a range of commitments focused on actively supporting communities to enhance the safety of all residents.  These include the establishment of a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which has already helped to inform a new scheme to tackle the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  We also had the launch in April of the new youth justice strategy for 2021 to 2027, which has a strong focus on diverting young people away from offending and building supports to provide prevention and early intervention in young people's lives.  Antisocial behaviour will also be considered by the local community safety partnerships that are to be set up by every local authority under the Department's new community safety policy.  Three pilot partnerships are currently being established, in Dublin's north inner city, Longford and Waterford, and will run for the next two years, ahead of a nationwide roll-out.  That is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that the Minister for Justice continues to meet with the Garda Commissioner on an ongoing basis in regard to all Garda enforcement matters.  I encourage members of the public to report any incidents of assault or antisocial behaviour directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Th&aacute;inig s&eacute; aniar aduaidh orm nuair a chuala m&eacute; sc&eacute;al ar an D&eacute;ardaoin go raibh fadhb i nGaillimh maidir le bheith ag freastal alc&oacute;il taobh amuigh de na pubanna agus na bialanna.  Labhair m&eacute; leis an Aire an o&iacute;che sin agus - ceart go leor - d'eisigh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas a thagair don tuiscint a bh&iacute; ag an Roinn.  It is interesting to read the Garda statement, which specifies:</p> <blockquote> 	Licences to sell alcohol are issued by the District Court.  The application for a licence to sell alcohol is accompanied by the lodgment of inter alia a site plan highlighting the specific area to which the licence will apply.  The licensee is licensed to sell intoxicating liquor to a person to consume the alcohol within that highlighted area only, any other sales are on a takeaway basis only. </blockquote>  <p>In other words, if something is not provided for on the licence, it is illegal.</p><p>We cannot go ahead without absolute clarity in the law.  My question to the Minister of State is whether we are going to get either primary legislation or a new statutory instrument, whichever is needed and would suffice, to get rid of any doubt in the law.  It is not fair to ask An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to show discretion that is contrary to the law.</p></speech>

The Garda issued a statement and then we had the Minister for Justice tweeting about it.  The information she gave was not accurate and needs to be corrected.  The message was very clear from the Government that we will have an outdoor summer.  Restaurateurs and pub owners knew what that meant.  We all thought we knew what it meant.  To be clear about it, I asked An T&aacute;naiste on 13 May, nearly six weeks ago, whether a plan would be put in place that would ensure everyone is on board, knows the rules and knows what he or she is supposed to be doing.  He agreed that a plan would be necessary but nothing was done.  The situation is absolutely shambolic.  It is as though the Government does not realise that hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on its getting this right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200056#DDD00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity, however short, to raise this matter with the Minister of State.  I have a slightly different view on it from my colleagues.  First, I think the Garda has done us a favour in highlighting the difficulties its members are facing in being asked to use their discretion.  That is extremely difficult to do.  In fact, we know from history and various tribunals that it is just not possible.</p>  <p>  This problem has arisen as a consequence of the message given by the Government that we are to have an outdoor summer.  Unfortunately, that simply means more consumption of alcohol and the situation is not helped by a broader interpretation of what an outdoor summer means.  In Galway, we have clear by-laws that say it is not permitted to drink on the streets.  Those by-laws were not put in place overnight.  They happened as a result of continuous pressure from various people because public drinking was out of control.  Rather than recognising that position and having a balanced approach to the reopening of pubs, which I fully agree with, the Government focused on an outdoor drinking situation, which is totally wrong.  We should have opened all pubs, albeit with restricted capacity, to reduce the pressure.  I am asking not just for clarity in this matter but for a healthier message from the Government as to what an outdoor summer means, while still facilitating businesses in Galway and elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-22a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200056#DDD00700"><p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, O'Reilly and Connolly for raising this important issue and giving me an opportunity to address it on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Following public health guidance, Government policy is to have a gradual reopening of the hospitality sector, beginning with outdoor hospitality, before a decision is taken on resuming indoor service in a few weeks.  Many of our bars and restaurants have now reopened with outdoor service, which is giving people a welcome opportunity to meet safely with friends and family again.</p>  <p>  As An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made clear, the overwhelming majority of licensed premises have behaved responsibly.  Those that continue to behave responsibly in controlling their premises should have nothing to worry about.  Garda&iacute; all across the country use their discretion every day to police as the circumstances require, as they have done throughout the pandemic, and they work closely with restaurants and pubs to ensure the safety of the public.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to adopt a graduated approach to the public health guidelines.  Members of the force will engage with the public and encourage and educate in respect of the public health guidelines, as they have done throughout the pandemic.  This often requires a delicate balance and there are different legal situations in different parts of the country, depending on whether there are local authority by-laws in place.</p>  <p>  A small minority of pubs have been serving alcohol to customers seated outside agreed areas.  Clearly, that will be the focus of any Garda action in the first instance.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has discussed this matter with Garda Commissioner Harris a number of times and did so again yesterday morning.  The Commissioner has since issued a communication to regional assistant commissioners indicating that garda&iacute; should use discretion while continuing to respond to public complaints about public order issues, parking, noise etc.  The Commissioner has reassured the Minister that discretion will continue to be applied by garda&iacute; in their engagement with licensed premises.</p>  <p>  Both the Commissioner and the Minister are satisfied that the Irish people can be facilitated to enjoy a safe outdoor summer while garda&iacute; continue their difficult work of keeping people safe.  The Attorney General and the Minister have also spoken on this matter and their officials will work closely, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to examine the matter in full.  This is a complex area of law, as the Deputies will appreciate, but the Minister has committed to taking legislative action, if necessary.</p>  <p>  In regard to specific points raised by Deputy O'Reilly, I do not agree with the contention that the Government's approach is shambolic.</p> <p>The Government has managed and put in place a level of adequate supports to help facilitate a safe and socially distanced outdoor summer.  The messaging, from a whole-of-government approach, is getting out.</p> <p> Deputy Connolly raised a significant and important point about spreading the impact across towns and cities.  It is certainly to be considered.  However, the Government has made good strides in working with all partners, including local authorities, local communities, vintners, hoteliers and the services sector, to put in place a good set of proposals and supports to ensure that we can have a safe and enjoyable summer in 2021.</p></speech>

He stated, "This is often a delicate balance and there are different legal situations in different parts of the country depending on whether there are local authority by-laws in place."  That is true, but is it the problem in this case?  If it is, the local authority in Galway should be told to sort out the problem.  However, towards the end of his response, the Minister of State made it clear that this may not be the case, and it might be a matter of primary law.</p>  <p>  When garda&iacute; visited a licensed premises in Galway, they must have known under what law they were doing so.  It cannot be a great complex problem, because garda&iacute; cannot approach anybody without having authority based in law.  Will the Government introduce amending legislation to rectify the issue or is it saying unequivocally, without doubt, that it is a matter for the local authorities and their by-laws?</p></speech>

The Minister of State indicated that the Minister of Justice had &quot;committed to taking legislative action, if necessary&quot;.  In the past hour and a half, the <i>Irish Independent</i>has reported that &quot;Justice Minister Heather Humphreys will bring legislative changes on pubs and restaurants selling alcohol in their outdoor seating areas&quot; in the coming days.  That is the message that people who are fighting really hard to save their businesses and workers who want their jobs to survive this, are getting.  They are getting mixed messages.  They deserve some clarity, as do members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are being asked to police this.  They are not being given sufficient guidance by the Government on the issue.</p><p>As I stated, I raised this issue with the T&aacute;naiste six weeks ago.  The Government has had a long time to plan for it.  We should not be having the conversation at this late stage.  In the intervening time, will the Government issue guidance and provide some sort of clarity for those people who are going to be expected to deal with the mess the Government has created?</p></speech>

We are sending out a message that businesses can take over public spaces and serve alcohol, which breaches by-laws that prevent the consumption of alcohol in such spaces.  That is one message that is being sent out.  The Government is placing the Garda in an impossible position.</p>  <p>  Galway City Council passed the Barcelona Declaration almost 20 years ago, guaranteeing universal access to all of the city's residents to the streets of Galway for services, regardless of ability and age.  In addition to giving consideration to the needs of businesses, a balancing of rights is required here, and that has not been considered.  We are focusing on law.  To me, the law is quite clear.  You get a licence to serve drink on a premises and the drink can be taken and consumed outside, unless there are by-laws in place.  Such by-laws are in place in Galway.</p>  <p>  The Government message to the public to enjoy an outdoor summer must be healthier and cannot just be about the consumption of alcohol and taking over public spaces.  It must be much fairer, broader and more inclusive than that.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

A tiny minority of pubs have been serving alcohol to those seated outside agreed areas, and clearly that will be the focus of any Garda action in the first instance.</p>  <p>  Many cities have by-laws in place.  Local authorities have facilitated pubs with permissions for outdoor seating and grants have been made available to many businesses.  We want this to work but garda&iacute; need to be able to control matters as needed and prevent them from getting out of hand.  Garda&iacute; across the country use their discretion every day to police as the circumstances require, as they have done throughout the pandemic, and work closely with restaurants and pubs to ensure the safety of the public.  I trust that Garda members will act in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's instruction and will continue to adopt a graduated approach to the public health guidelines, in the interests of public safety and order.  However, the Government is clear that if we need to take further action, we will do so.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, is discussing what further measures may be needed with the Attorney General and Government colleagues. </p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Connolly's point about the messaging on the outdoor summer, it is broad and it is about the enjoyment of outdoor spaces and nature.  We are asking for people to enjoy the outdoor summer responsibly.  Those messages have begun to be sent out in media campaigns this week.  The messaging is much broader and is about much more than just the consumption of alcohol in our towns and cities.  It is about enjoying what the country has to offer on a broader scale.  We are cognisant of that messaging and we have begun to get that message out this week.</p></speech>

As a public representative, I find the process of reporting issues cumbersome and frustrating.  I can imagine, therefore, that it would try the patience of an ordinary citizen.  When a problem is reported to Irish Water it utilises the water services staff and equipment of Dublin City Council and other councils.  If I were to go directly to the council to report an issue, I would be told to contact Irish Water first, which is a ridiculous situation.</p>  <p>  While there is a dedicated elected representative support email address, in my experience the system does not necessarily address the issues any quicker.  My constituency colleagues and I have had to pursue issues to the point of exasperation, sending email after email to the Irish Water representative's address to try to get the problems we have raised resolved.  I have found that many of the responses I receive show a lack of understanding of the problem raised and are often inaccurate.  This method of raising issues with Irish Water is nothing more than a sop to public representatives.  Lack of effective communication and an inability to liaise directly with senior management raise concerns in respect of both transparency and accountability.  </p>  <p>  Elderly residents, families with small children and people with disabilities or long-term illnesses and so on are severely affected by any disruption to their water supply.  It is essential, therefore, that the customer service side of Irish Water is effective and public representatives have access to senior management.  </p>  <p>  I am also concerned that works carried out by Irish Water have caused secondary problems, such as airlocks and low water pressure.  On McKee Avenue in Finglas last Saturday, after Irish Water had completed works in the area, residents, including a number of elderly people, were left without a water supply all weekend and all day Monday up until this morning.  It appears that no advance notice was given of the works taking place.  In St. Canice's Court in Finglas, residents were also left with disrupted water supply following works carried out by Irish Water.  The issues around water pressure are still ongoing.  When these problems are raised with Irish Water, I find that it effectively abdicates responsibility and in many cases puts the onus on the homeowner affected to rectify the problem.</p>  <p>   One such example relates to a case in which the roots of a tree have penetrated a sewage pipe, causing a blockage.  The affected pipe is located outside the boundaries of a private residence on Collins Avenue Extension.  However, Irish Water is of the view that it is the responsibility of the homeowner to fix the problem.  It is not an isolated case.  In this and other cases, it is clear that Irish Water is not undertaking proper investigations that would lead it to a different conclusion as to who has responsibility for fixing such problems.</p>  <p>  Irish Water also needs to look at the policy of patching up of work areas after initial completion.  In many instances, the patching up of roads and pathways has left them in a terrible condition for months on end before they are properly reinstated.  I am concerned about the proposal to transfer responsibility for Dublin City Council's drainage section to Irish Water in July.  It is a serious worry in light of Irish Water's failures to date.  It needs to get its house in order before it should even consider taking on this responsibility.</p></speech>

The Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 set out the arrangements in place for the delivery of water and waste water services by Irish Water, and for the scrutiny and oversight provisions that apply in respect of these arrangements.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, including with respect to water supply interruptions and communication with customers and the maintenance of water and waste water infrastructure.  Irish Water is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions and in regard to day-to-day operational matters.</p>  <p>  In assuming responsibility for water services from local authorities, Irish Water has entered into service level agreements, SLAs, with each local authority for the provision of water services.  Staff members working under these arrangements remain local authority employees while continuing to perform key water services functions with local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water.</p>  <p>  As part of the operational model established by the Oireachtas it is important to note that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in its role as economic regulator of Irish Water, has an important role in regulating and protecting the interests of Irish Water customers.  One of the key ways the CRU protects customers is through the Irish Water customer handbooks, which set out how Irish Water must deal with its domestic and non-domestic customers.  In the case of planned interruptions for operational reasons or for other service incidents, the handbooks detail how Irish Water must communicate with its customers.  These handbooks are available on the CRU website.</p>  <p>  Planned supply interruptions can occur for maintenance reasons or in regard to planned works undertaken by local authority staff or third party contractors on behalf of Irish Water.  Unplanned interruptions can often be the result of a fault in the network, or related to a severe weather event, and are usually responded to in the first instance by the relevant local authority under the service level agreement with Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Irish Water assures me that it makes every effort to deliver on its responsibilities and keeping such interruptions to a minimum to the extent possible, thus minimising the impact on its customers.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Ellis that all Oireachtas Members and councillors use the public representatives&rsquo; service.  I find it good but I take on board the points made in terms of it being a different way.  It took a bit of getting used to from when we would make representations directly to a local authority.  Generally, I find that any representations I make to Irish Water in regard to water or waste water infrastructure or emergency situations are good but there is always room for improvement in this regard.</p></speech>

The people went out on the streets and stopped that.  It now seems we are going to keep Irish Water in public ownership, which is right.  However, it was already in public ownership with the local authorities.  That was the best place for it to be.</p>  <p>  That said, Irish Water is in place and I am outlining the problems we face as public representatives when dealing with Irish Water, as well as the problems residents encounter.  In some cases, Irish Water fixed a fault, only for other houses to be knocked off the system through air locks and other faults.  We must have a mechanism to deal with that.  We cannot just turn around and say to people it is their responsibility.  Many of these are senior citizens and pensioners, left with a large bill to sort out a problem that they never had before.  It is just not good enough.  We need to have better mechanisms.  The handbook needs to be revisited with some of these issues.  I have encountered it on a number of occasions.  On a lot of occasions Irish Water has reacted reasonably well.  However, there are many occasions where there has not been a proper reaction with people angry over it.</p>  <p>  The residents to whom I spoke only this morning were fuming over what happened.  They were not even given warnings.  No one even sent a letter around from door to door, which to me would be the most sensible thing to do, especially for those with sick people at home.  That would give them the opportunity to store water and be ready for a cut-off.</p></speech>

Those points are important for Irish Water to take on board.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Acts place specific responsibilities on the Minister and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, including responsibility for matters relevant to water policy, funding and in the making of regulations.  The Water Services Acts also put in place a variety of legislative and regulatory controls to ensure governance, oversight and accountability regarding water services.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is subject to significant regulation and oversight from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, relating to environmental compliance and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, relating to economic regulation, including customer service.  The Oireachtas also established the Water Advisory Body to report to the Oireachtas on Irish Water&rsquo;s performance.</p>  <p>  For example, regarding the major boil water notice arising from problems at the Leixlip water treatment plant in 2019, the CRU carried out an audit of the Irish Water response to check compliance with the standards laid down in the customer service handbooks.  This audit is also available on the CRU website.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined, Irish Water assures my Department that it makes every effort to deliver on its responsibilities, to keep service interruptions to the minimum extent possible, as well as to comply with its obligations under the customer service handbooks when communicating with customers.</p>  <p>  I note the points made by Deputy Ellis.  As I said, we can always improve on the communication and on the level of service provided to the public.</p>  <p>  On the point raised about McKee Avenue, Finglas, I understand that the burst water main has now been repaired.  It was probably the initial query brought forward by Deputy Ellis.  I thank him for bringing this issue forward this evening.</p></speech>
