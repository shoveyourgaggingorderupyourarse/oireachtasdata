For example, the woman who says: "My husband is 70.  He is still working.  He can't stop at the moment because if he stops, we know it will be very difficult for us just to live."  Or the mother who says: "I have started to cut back on my food shop.  The price of everything has gone up.  Everything.  The kind of things that we cannot do without.  Or another mother who says: "I now go to a food bank.  It is embarrassing, but if I don't go, we'll go hungry.  I am there every Tuesday and every Thursday and it is packed to the rafters."</p>  <p>  These are the words of thousands of people who took to the streets on Saturday afternoon because they are pushed now to the brink by an ever-worsening cost-of-living crisis.  Despite the hardship that they face, they see a Government refusing to take action that will make a difference.  Households are now caught in the eye of a perfect storm of soaring prices.  They are ripped off by extortionate rents and mortgage repayments.  They are ripped off by big energy bills.  They are ripped off at the pumps for petrol and diesel.  They are ripped off by sharp increases in the cost of groceries.  People face unbearable pressure.  They all said one thing, with one voice, on Saturday.  They said they are at breaking point.  They cannot wait until October for the budget and then wait again until January for measures or relief to kick in.  People are suffering now.  They are being pushed to the edge now and they need the Government to act now, today.</p> <p>An emergency budget is needed because people face a disaster as they struggle to afford the basics.  There are mothers who cannot afford a new pair of shoes for their child, parents who are struggling to put breakfast on the table and elderly people who are choosing between heating and eating.  The Taoiseach is asking these people who are in dire straits to wait.  That is just not right.</p> <p> At Saturday's protest in Cork, Ms Catr&iacute;ona Twomey who runs Cork Penny Dinners - she is a great lady and the Taoiseach knows her well - said, "...we fed over 500 people today ... I can get through everything else but when children are hungry and their parents are crying, [well] that gets [to] me."  That is the Ireland of 2022.  How on earth can anyone in the Government look these families in the eye and tell them it has done enough?  What these people live through daily tells us explicitly that enough has not been done.  The response from the Government has been slow and has lacked urgency.  We all know international factors are at play and we accept the Government cannot do everything but it can do more.  Without emergency support, families will face a very difficult back-to-school period and a brutal winter as energy costs continue to rise.  T&aacute; an costas maireacht&aacute;ala imithe &oacute; smacht.  T&aacute; teaghlaigh i mbaol faoi l&aacute;thair.  Caithfidh an Rialtas aghaidh a thabhairt ar sc&aacute;la na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime seo.  Teasta&iacute;onn c&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is uainn sa D&aacute;il l&aacute;ithreach.</p> <p> The Cabinet met this morning.  We were told the cost-of-living crisis was high on the agenda.  I hope there was a realisation at that meeting that households cannot wait another six months and the Government cannot pack up for the summer and leave workers and families in the lurch.  The Government must now respond with urgency and introduce an emergency budget.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbainfidh siad taitneamh as a l&aacute; anseo.</p>  <p>  There is no question the war on Ukraine has very significantly exacerbated what was an emerging inflationary cycle coming from the pandemic, the fact that economies rebounded so quickly from the pandemic and the resulting supply and demand issues.  That has created significant pressures on families and households.  The Government responded and has done so quickly, more quickly than other countries across Europe.  In particular, the Government introduced very significant measures in hiking up the fuel allowance to more than &euro;1,139, which is a 55% increase in the free fuel allowance alone.  We reduced the excise duty on petrol, diesel and green diesel and we also reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity.  We gave &euro;200 to every single household throughout the country.  We cut the annual public service obligation levy from &euro;52 to minus &euro;75.  We launched the national retrofitting scheme.  We also put a cap on school transport fees for families.  We cut public transport fares by 20%, with an additional 50% cut in fares for young people.  We lowered the threshold for the drug payment scheme to &euro;80 per month, which benefits more than 70,000 families.  We brought forward a working family payment budget increase.  We abolished the &euro;80 inpatient hospital charge for children and so on.  We brought in specific schemes for the haulage, tillage and hospitality sectors.</p>  <p>  The bottom line is more than &euro;2.4 billion has already been spent on cost-of-living measures.  We are asking nobody to wait six months.  We are saying we cannot chase inflation every month.  The World Bank is warning of the risk of stagflation, which is the kind of thing we experienced in the 1970s.  Whereas 1970s' stagflation was caused by the initial oil price shock, it was the second and third rounds of inflation that drove it on for the next ten years.  I do not want that to happen in Ireland over the next ten years.  The wider economy in Ireland is still growing.  We need to protect our economic growth as long as we possibly can.  We need to protect all those people who are in jobs - the 2.5 million people who are working.  We cannot take risks with the economy or with inflation.</p> <p>That idea of protecting the jobs in the economy is something to which the Deputy should give more attention.  If we had followed Sinn F&eacute;in's advice from the outset, I think we would be in an even greater inflationary cycle.  The ESRI report is a good reminder of that in terms of the importance of targeting and not just making wholesale cuts across the board, which Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated time and time again as it would damage the economy.  I do not think that it gets the enterprise side of the economy or wants to get it.  In my view, we have to watch that side of it and we have to avoid stagflation in itself.</p> <p> We have taken action and we are going to take more action to alleviate pressures on people and households.  I am worried about the winter period because we have seen what Putin did this week in reducing gas supplies to Germany and other European customers.  That is going to have an impact on our energy situation.  He is leveraging it in particular to create maximum pressure for the winter period.  We have to allocate our resources in the optimal way, which in my view is to protect people right throughout the winter period and beyond the winter.  That is the big objective that we should share, namely-----</p></speech>

I am not asking the Taoiseach to chase inflation.  I am asking him to recognise the reality that people are struggling now, in June, and that people will continue to struggle through the summer months, not to mention the winter ahead of them.  The Taoiseach says that we need to protect our economy, and we do, but above all else we need to protect our people.  Above all else we cannot take risks with our people, risks that have children hungry and parents crying.  That is the reality.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is asking people to wait.</p>  <p>  With all sincerity and not in a spirit of political rivalry, I appeal to the Taoiseach to change that position.  Families are suffering now and they desperately need targeted and thoughtful measures to give them breathing space now.  The Taoiseach stated that the Government was not asking families to wait.  If he is insisting that the October budget will be the moment when relief is delivered, then he is asking people to wait.  That is wrong.  It is not real and is totally unfair.  What measures will the Government introduce with all due haste now, not in October?</p></speech>

That has been a consistent theme that it has been articulating since the beginning of the year.  By the way, protecting the economy is protecting our people.  Protecting jobs is protecting our people.  We should not underestimate the economic recovery that has happened, which gives us some buffer - not a total one - for protecting people against what was predicted coming out of Covid.  No one predicted that we would be at 2.5 million people working in the immediate aftermath of Covid-19.  People thought that would take until 2024 to happen.  Thankfully, the economy has rebounded much faster, but inflation is a huge pressure on people and it is largely driven by the energy strategy of Putin.  He wants to sow discord across the West.  He wants to create maximum pressure on western democracies through his energy policies, through his food policies - preventing grain from getting into Europe - and through migration pressures by terrorising people out of Ukraine.  We cannot allow him to win the strategic battle that he is waging on us.  When I said-----</p></speech>

It is for this reason that I am struggling to understand why the Government is refusing to alleviate the pressure on people.  For weeks, all we have got from the Government has been platitudes, but tea and sympathy will not pay people's bills.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Government did something extraordinary when it ruled out any measures being introduced before the budget in October and the Taoiseach said that: &quot;can give relief to people in terms of the pressures that they are currently facing.&quot;</p></speech>

People are worried about how they will heat their homes, pay their rents or mortgages and put food on the table.  Four months feels like a lifetime.  All the indications are that this will worsen and we all know that.  A number of kites on childcare, taxation and social welfare increases have been flown but how can people get relief from something when they do not know what will come in the budget?  Increasingly, we are hearing people talking about already being in debt.  We know that energy bills will soar by up to &euro;2,000 this year while fuel costs will skyrocket by an additional &euro;1,500.  We know there is a staggering 30% of people in fuel poverty who are spending more than 10% of their income on energy.  We also know that people on low to middle incomes are the ones suffering most and that core social welfare rates, like pensions, were only increased by &euro;5 over the last three years.  Those people cannot hang on and they are not surviving at the moment.</p>  <p>  The promise is that more than &euro;5 will be provided in this year's budget.  We proposed an emergency budget.  We think there should be a &euro;10 increase in core social welfare rates, &euro;300 should be put back into the pockets of those earning up to &euro;50,000 with a refundable tax credit and a &euro;100 million hardship fund should be created.  There is no doubt that targeted measures such as a double social welfare payment is the kind of thing that could make a sizable difference.  We would not mind sitting for an extra week in this House if a mini or emergency budget was brought in.  Is it intended to do anything at all before the budget?  Is the Government intending to extend the excise changes that are due to expire on 31 August into October?</p></speech>

We fully accept the pressures that are on people.  Since October we have brought in &euro;2.4 billion worth of measures that, in many respects, are targeted at healthcare, education, fuel and transport costs, including reducing prices in public transport.  Deputy McDonald also called for an emergency budget but I am not sure that Deputies are really talking about an emergency budget; they are just talking about an emergency expenditure programme if we are honest.  A budget has pluses and minuses and it has revenue generation.  I will not go into the detail of that but it seems to me that every month since this crisis - which is a serious crisis and I can understand why - people want &euro;1 billion to be spent every month.  No sooner had we announced the last &euro;1 billion and a bit than the demand was for more the following month.  I have no doubt that if something was announced next week, before a month was out Deputies and parties would be looking for another package.  That is the nature of it.</p>  <p>  We all agree that the people are under enormous pressure because of what is happening globally and within Europe.  The Deputy was right when she said it could get worse and it will get worse.  That is why we need to make sure that what we do is well thought through, does not add unnecessarily to inflation or the inflationary cycle, and is targeted and I agree that it should be targeted.  The ESRI report is useful in that respect.  It should also be sustainable over a longer period of time.  It should not be the case that as soon as we do the budget, we have to do something the following month and the following month again if we can avoid that.</p> <p>We need to create stability and to underpin our jobs and the other positive sides of Irish productivity and manufacturing that are evident at the moment.  Much of that depends on the global situation, which we are worried about.  Markets in other parts of Europe are under pressure.  We see that from reports and predictions coming in.  The biggest fear is prolonged stagflation.  One of the biggest barriers against poverty is getting a job.  Thankfully in this country, because of the way we managed the economy for the last two years and supported jobs and enterprises through the pandemic, we enabled many of them to come back much more quickly than might have been anticipated and to survive, with the result that we have record levels of employment.  That is a strength going into the end of the year.  We have revenue coming in also but towards the tail end of the year, there is much uncertainty.  Because of that, we need to be cautious and make sure we get it right.  The Deputy should be in no doubt that we want to alleviate the pressures and to do it in a comprehensive way that will affect average people in a good way for a sustained period.  </p></speech>

A sizable amount of additional tax is being taken in because of inflation in terms of energy and the inflationary impact on goods and services.  The Taoiseach talks about expenditure but there is a sizable additional income coming in to the Government as well.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach talks about Putin and discontent but discontent will be sown by not responding well domestically.  He must be delighted with the kind of discontent he is sowing outside of the appalling situation in Ukraine.  It is important that we do not allow him to do that.  That is why it is important that we do not allow this kind of political vacuum to happen.  These measures are needed at this point because people are saying they are not managing now.  It is not just in the constituency office; people stop me in the street.  I am sure the Taoiseach is getting that as well.  People are really worried.  Those of us who remember inflation rates of 20% or more include many pensioners who are terrified of the winter.</p></speech>

People are terrified of the winter and we want to make sure we have a comprehensive package that protects people throughout the winter.  Throughout and beyond the winter, we want to protect people as best we can.  We have to do it while taking on board a range of issues.  </p>  <p>  Right now, we have to settle our expenditure levels in every Department.  Why?  Because we need to protect education, health, housing and social protection.  Those Departments have measures that are important in terms of cost of living.  We have to do this in a proper evidence-based way, rather than just saying here is a billion in July and here is a billion in August.  That will not work and will not be optimal or effective for people on the ground.</p>  <p>  The ESRI has pointed out that some measures asked for in the House were not ideal or optimal and that we could target more.  I am open to suggestions as to the type of measures and so on that Deputies think we should concentrate on.  It is important that the budget will set expenditure levels for 12 months, across all Departments.  That work is under way but there are pay and tax issues.  Then there is the package to alleviate pressures on people as well.</p></speech>

Even if he had been inside UHW, a model 4 hospital in our great Republic, he could not have accessed cardiac care as the cath lab was closed, which it is 129 hours of every week.  Sadly, that man passed away two days later in UHW.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  Where is the 24-7 cardiac service the Taoiseach promised the south east?</p> <p>The Taoiseach extols his Government's capital spending programme and the hundreds of millions spent in Cork delivering a new airport runway, two new &euro;100 million teaching blocks for University College Cork, UCC, the new convention centre and the Dunkettle interchange.  Contrast this with how Waterford has been treated.  There has been no capital budget approved for the South East Technological University and a review of a land purchase to add to the Waterford campus footprint has now been going on for 14 months.  While UCC is granted a new school of medicine, the engineering buildings promised to Waterford Institute of Technology in 2012 have been deferred to 2026 or later.  The Taoiseach's Government has starved our airport of regional aviation funding, threatened the retention of our air-sea rescue service and offered nothing to address the 20-year-old problems of the N24 and N25 road networks in the south east.  However, it is the obstruction of capital funding for University Hospital Waterford that offers the greatest insight into the denial of 24-7 services for the south east.</p> <p> I wish to respect the House's long-standing convention of not making charges against persons here under privilege but I need to balance that convention against my responsibility to identify the sharp practice with regard to the capital and clinical resourcing of UHW by the Cork-based South/South West Hospital Group.  Lies are being told regarding the present strategic development of capital and clinical resourcing at UHW and those responsible must stop or be stopped.  A recent three-year national study on heart attacks allied with three years of blue light patient transfer data makes the case for 24-7 services for the south east clinically unassailable, yet the Government chooses to ignore this information, preferring to jockey and await the further steered reports required to give it the answers it wants to provide it with the political cover it seeks.  Such actions reveal an implicit understanding that the private and public patient streams and numbers of students that flow out of the south-east region and sustain the medical and academic privilege of Cork and Dublin must never be threatened or diminished by competition.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach's Government is abandoning his backbenchers in the south east, just as he has abandoned his promise to deliver 24-7 cardiac care to the south-east region.  They will have to answer to the electorate.  Without political redirection, I predict that the ballot boxes of the south east will bring a heart-stopping arrest to the political careers of many of the Taoiseach's colleagues in government and in his own party, Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

He said that we are waiting for clinical reviews to get political cover.  Anybody who knows anything about how healthcare has evolved over the past 20 years will know that clinical expertise have been the driver and has occasioned courageous political decisions with regard to modernising healthcare service in this country.  Politics likes to ignore the harsh advice that comes from the bodies that set the various standards such as the College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the authorities on cardiology.  It is wrong to suggest it is all politics.  No politician wants to close anything in any hospital.  I have never come across a politician who willingly says that he or she wants to close a given service.  However, the politicians of the parties of successive Governments receive advice as to what is optimal with regard to patient safety in given locations.</p>  <p>  I remember when emergency medical technician, EMT, was hardly recognised as a profession in this country.  The most important thing for a person who has a heart attack is the first responder, rather than how close the hospital is.  Thankfully, we have professionalised the role of EMTs through the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, initiative we undertook more than 20 years ago.  That type of modernisation has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from cardiovascular issues.  This country has some of the best survival rates in Europe with regard to cardiovascular issues.  We need to have a debate that is balanced and that shows perspective.  What we were doing in the past with regard to cardiovascular and cancer healthcare was all wrong.  We have changed that over two decades with the result that we are now number one in the European Union league table of lifespans.  However, we conveniently ignore all of that when endeavouring to get local political advantage, which I respectfully suggest is what the Deputy is about.  He summed it up in his last paragraph when he reduced all of this to politics and said that someone would pay an electoral price for not going wholesale against advice received from cardiologists and clinicians, whether we like that advice or not.</p> <p>The Deputy knows well - he has engaged with me and other Members of this House on the matter - that we have put investment into a second cath lab in Waterford.  That funding is just in terms of the facility.  Recruitment in order to staff the new cath lab is ongoing.  As I have informed the Deputy previously, the lab will be available for use in October.  A total of 24 whole-time equivalents have been approved by the South/South West Hospital Group to staff the second cath lab.</p> <p> More broadly, employment in the south east increased by 13.6% year on year which is a really strong performance and the Deputy should acknowledge that.  The Government approved more than &euro;120 million through the urban regeneration and development fund for Waterford, and still the Deputy comes in here and says the Government is ignoring and does not care about Waterford.  What he says does not stack up.</p></speech>

He did when he stood in the grounds of University Hospital Waterford with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and made a commitment to deliver 24-7 cardiac care to the south east.  In recent weeks, I presented to the D&aacute;il data from a three-year National Office of Clinical Audit report along with three years of patient ambulance transfer times for University Hospital Waterford that show that the average transfer time for a cardiac patient was three and a quarter hours, which is totally outside any clinical assessment where they can have any benefit of getting into a cath lab.</p>  <p>  I was in the room in 2012 with Ambrose McLoughlin and James Reilly when the commitment was given to deliver a second cath lab to University Hospital Waterford.  Here we are eight years later and we still do not have delivery on it.  Beyond that, the Taoiseach talks about the report that is due out and the clinical evidence.  There is no clinical evidence.  There is evidence from three-year National Office of Clinical Audit report and we have ambulance data.  However, the Government chooses to do nothing about it.  In Waterford, the South/South West Hospital Group is running around claiming it is implementing the 24 whole-time equivalents.  What has it recruited?  It has recruited one porter and one cardiac physiologist.  That is what it has recruited so far on the basis of a promise that was given 18 months ago.  It is not about delivery and it is not about politics.  I am here for the people of the south east and Waterford who I represent.  The Taoiseach should represent them and deliver on his promise.</p></speech>

However, we have committed the resources to doing it and we have asked the South/South West Hospital Group and the HSE to get on with it as fast as they possibly can - both the physical facility and the resources.</p>  <p>  Regarding the broader situation in Waterford, there needs to be balance.  The south east is progressing.  The Government was very concerned about the economic performance of the south east and wanted to improve on it.  The foreign direct investment, FDI, performance in the region has been strong over the past five years, with employment among IDA Ireland clients increasing by 25%.  The Deputy knows that PublicRelay, Horizon Therapeutics, Eirgen Pharma, Infosys and Tegus all provide substantial employment.  Exchequer funding of &euro;14.3 million to date has been provided for the technological university, which is very good for Waterford and for the south east in general.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said a few minutes ago that the Ukraine war is the issue when it comes to energy costs in this country.  He also said that the Government had provided &euro;2.6 billion to counteract that.  He never said that the Government took &euro;6 billion in tax on fuel alone in one year.  In 2020, it took in &euro;2 billion and now it is taking in &euro;6 billion and is returning &euro;2.6 billion to the people of Ireland.  The Government is here to protect the people of the here and now.</p> <p>It is here to protect the economy, which also protects the people.  The Taoiseach has stated that there are 2.5 million people working in this country.  There are 2 million vehicles in this country and 99% of them run on fossil fuels.  Those vehicles help to run the economy by helping people to go to work and thereby feed their families.  The Government's answer in that regard to is to take 49% of the cost of fuel in taxation.  That is not protecting the people of this country.</p></speech>

The Government's figures are now coming out and showing that is the case.  By delaying the budget until October, the Government will take another &euro;2 billion in tax on fuel alone.  That is only with regard to fuel.  What about coal and all the other energies we must pay for?  What about everything?  What about the clothes on our backs?  The Government is taking taxes like they have never been taken before.  The Government was given a toolbox by the EU in November but it has done nothing.  On 6 April, the EU allowed member states to reduce the VAT rate to 5%.  The Government has done nothing.</p>  <p>  Why does the Government not take a leaf out of Malta's book?  Diesel in Malta costs &euro;1.21 per litre today and petrol costs &euro;1.36.  We are paying &euro;2.15 per litre for petrol and our Government takes 49% of that in tax.  Why do we not go back to 2020 and put in place the cap for which I asked?  Last year I asked the Government to cap taxes.  That would have given 40 cent per litre back to every motorist in the country.  As the Taoiseach said, 2 million people in this country have vehicles and 2.5 million people are working.</p></speech>

The Government provides services to the people of Ireland through raising revenue and spending it.  We need a tax base to fund education, housing, health, childcare services and child protection services and the development of transport infrastructure.  We need revenue to do those things.  Every stable democracy needs a stable revenue base.</p>  <p>  Across the European Union, a broad VAT directive sets out the bands for the various VAT rates that can be deployed and so forth.  We have to work within those parameters and we willingly signed up to that.  It places limits on how far VAT can be reduced as we adhere to the rates on which we entered into agreement.  We have reduced VAT on gas and electricity.  We have also reduced excise in the amount of &euro;2.4 million as a result of measures we have taken.</p>  <p>  I understand that Malta has one of the highest levels of borrowing of the EU 27.  It stood at 11% of GDP in 2021.  We also have debt levels.  The idea that &euro;6 billion of tax revenue can be eliminated in simply not a runner.  It cannot be done anyway, but it is not a runner if the proposal is thought through.  The Deputy looks at this issue through a one-dimensional lens.  He has not looked at the other side of the matter, namely, the allocation of that funding.  For example, &euro;4 billion per year has been allocated for the building of social and affordable housing and for cost-rental accommodation.  There must be a revenue base to allow for that and, thankfully, we have a diverse revenue base.  The more important point is that in the context of the next budget, we will be in a position to do things that can alleviate the pressure on people, families and, in particular, children.  We have already allocated substantial resources since the most recent budget to alleviate those pressures across the board.  I have gone through the list of measures we have taken in respect of transport costs and so on.  There have also been schemes for hauliers, tillage and hospitality.</p></speech>

He could not even fill out what he had to say back but he managed to use extra time talking back to everyone else.  That means he does not have a clue what he is talking about.  I will tell him what he can waste his minute on.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach talked about protecting the building industry.  At the moment, we have a building crisis.  What is causing the building crisis?  It is all to do with fossil fuels, transport costs and all energy into insulation and oil-based products.  We have a building crisis.  People are no longer building.  Check it out.  Building is now slowing down.  We have a housing crisis and building slows down.  Sums of &euro;144,000 are being given to developers for apartments.  That is what the Government is giving - &euro;144,000.  We have people now that are stopping building.  We have builders who are saying it is no longer affordable to build houses for their people.  The Government could do it.  The Taoiseach said the Government put &euro;4 billion into housing.  That is &euro;4 billion for the people, and we have to make them live here now.  The Taoiseach mentioned Malta.  Malta has taken the position of protecting its people, even if it has a higher debt.  At least they are protected for the here and now.  Who will protect the Taoiseach in the future?</p></speech>

New allegations have been coming out week after week in respect of undeclared conflicts of interest and irregularities regarding the appointment of board members.  There have also been also allegations that board members made changes to independent inspector's reports and overruled the vast majority of cases with regard to specific types of applications.  There are also allegations that files were not randomly allocated to board members, that two board members in particular acted as a team in a large number of planning decisions and that there were multiple alleged breaches of the board's code of conduct.  The report the Minister ordered is due on Thursday, which would be a good day to have statements on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It would also provide an opportunity for the Minister to clarify when he first became aware of these allegations, what action will be taken on foot of the report he commissioned and how the Government will ensure that all the allegations that are in the public domain will be properly investigated.</p></speech>

There has been a drip feed of allegations and very serious matters have been raised about conduct, processes and governance.  It is timely that we would have that debate this week.  We are all conscious that there is only a small number of weeks left before the recess.  We have the summer economic statement to come and there are quite a number of other urgent matters before us.</p> <p>This week would seem the right time and the appropriate time to have the debate on An Bord Plean&aacute;la, given the serious nature of the allegations that have been raised.</p></speech>

This is the second country, Russia being the first, that has notified Irish authorities that it is to carry out a military exercise within Irish zoned waters in recent months.  The French exercise, however, is on a much bigger scale than that proposed previously by Russia.</p>  <p>  We have found ourselves in an astonishing situation over the past few months in regard to Irish territorial waters.  This is a danger to the lives of Irish fishermen who are already struggling in terms of their incomes.  It is a danger to marine life, to fish, dolphins and whales, and it is a danger to our environment and our neutrality.</p>  <p>  We have been told that the French military exercise is not to go ahead, that it has been put off or that it will happen a foot or two outside of our waters.  This is an issue of huge importance to Irish people and warrants a debate.  I am calling for a full debate on the issue this week in the D&aacute;il.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach accepted that.</p></speech>

It is an independent review.  It is not the Minister's review.  I appreciate the concerns the Members of the House have on these issues.  Under the terms of reference, Mr. Remy Farrell SC was requested to provide a report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, within a period of six weeks.  The Minister will consider those matters on receipt of the senior counsel's report.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Planning Regulator has announced that it is commencing a review into An Bord Plean&aacute;la's systems and procedures as part of its reviews programme.  The Planning Regulator has indicated that details of the Office of the Planning Regulator's approach to this review will be published in the near future.  The Government is aware that judicial reviews have been initiated or are ongoing in relation to certain An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions.</p>  <p>  On 6 May, the Minister requested a report from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la chairperson setting out the chairperson's opinion on the allegations against Mr. Hyde, in accordance with the chairperson's powers under section 110(2) of the Planning and Development Act.  The chairperson responded on 9 May that he first needed to gather and analyse all relevant information in order to form an opinion that the conduct of an ordinary board member has been such as to bring the board into disrepute, prior to exercising his chairperson's powers under section 110(2).  He also confirmed that Mr. Hyde had agreed to absent himself from his duties as deputy chairperson of the board for the time being, on a strictly without prejudice basis.  The chairperson has indicated to the Department that he should shortly be in a position to provide an update to the Minister in respect of the ongoing process.</p>  <p>  The difficulty about having a debate right now would be the possibility of prejudicing the report itself and the content of the report.  That is the challenge right now in terms of having a debate.  The Government will keep the matter under review prior to the recess.  We need to balance the genuine interest Members have and the public interest with the need to try to get some of these reports completed.  If we can keep the matter under review, I would be open to doing that with Deputies.</p>  <p>  On the French navy, I understand this is not to take place.  I did not have the full and specific details on it coming into the House.  I will ask the Whip if we can have a debate on that, or more generally about the whole area of military exercises and the compatibility of such exercises with marine life.  We are all interested in protecting marine life.  I am aware Deputy Collins would be a long-standing advocate for marine protected areas.  It is also about protecting fisheries into the future and marine biodiversity.  I would be very much in favour of having a wider debate on that.  I am sure the Deputy would endorse that.</p></speech>

I am sure the Taoiseach remembers that.  Instead of taking comprehensive action then, the Government introduced a token 10% stamp duty increase.  It was warned at the time that this would not stop these funds and that these funds would easily absorb that increase by charging massive rents, on which they pay no tax.  That is exactly what happened.  Since the Government introduced its measure funds have bought 350 family homes, so these funds are still running rampant.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, said that he would now review this approach.  That will not cut it.  To halt the gallop of these funds and to give ordinary home buyers a chance, the Government must ramp up stamp duty to deter these funds, as well as end the tax advantages they enjoy.  Crucially, the Government needs to apply these measures to apartments as well as houses because apartments are family homes too.</p></speech>

The majority of those homes went on the open market while the remainder have been acquired by Kildare County Council for social and affordable housing under the terms of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  There is an endless attempt to spin this issue, but the facts are the facts.  That estate was not bought out by the funds, as the Deputy has asserted.  Also, in terms of the objectives, the planning laws we introduced on this last year have worked.  Some 15,883 residential units have received planning permission since May 2021.  Basically, in the space of 12 months, almost 16,000 residential units have been planned for or reserved or received planning permission for individual purchasers.  The number of 350 is out of 16,000, so there needs to be balance and perspective here.</p></speech>

Certainly, we will keep everything under review, but there must be a little balance and perspective.  The funds are not dominant in the Irish housing market.  The Deputy keeps saying they are, but they absolutely are not dominant in the housing market.</p></speech>

I heard from them how their calls have reached record levels this year and how so many households and individuals are contacting them with serious money issues and huge pressures in paying for childcare, rent and mortgages.  These are working people who were previously on adequate incomes and they now say the cash simply is no longer there to meet their basic needs.  That is why the Labour Party has called for immediate measures to be adopted by the Government.  That is why the kite flying in recent days has not been helpful.  We need to see targeted measures now to support those on the lowest pay and the lowest incomes, with an immediate social welfare bonus this summer to help people struggling with the fear and anticipation of back-to-school costs and an immediate rise of &euro;1 per hour in the minimum wage.</p></speech>

They have broken up for the time being, but the Government is open to re-engaging in the public service pay talks.  Meanwhile, in the private sector there have been various agreements in different sectors between different companies and their employees in respect of pay.</p>  <p>  The Government has taken substantial measures in respect of fuel, transport costs, healthcare costs and education costs.  Our view is that the situation is serious; there is no doubt about that.  The pressure on people is enormous.</p> <p>We want to do a comprehensive package in the budget that will be sustainable right through the winter.  Our objective is to get people through what will be a very difficult winter, both here and in Europe, as well as globally.</p></speech>

She is fearful that she will never recover from these illnesses through the public mental health system.  Emma has no choice but to seek costly private treatment.  People are being incredibly generous in donating, including a bake sale at Ballinlough community centre at the weekend.  A bake sale to raise money for potentially life-saving treatment is a glaring indictment of public eating disorder care in Ireland.  Emma is not alone.  Many, mainly young women, are in the same position.  I have continuously raised this issue.  Every time I do, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or the Taoiseach have given me the same assurances of more funding and improved care.  I do not doubt their sincerity but cases like Emma's reveal the reality.  What is going to be different this time?</p></speech>

I am aware of the case to which she alludes but I cannot discuss it on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  It was brought to my attention by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan a couple of weeks ago and we have been working on it.  The Government does remain firmly committed to enhancing specialist eating disorder services, including improved access and shorter waiting lists.  A total of &euro;6.85 million has been allocated, and a further &euro;1.15 million again this year.  The current situation is that by the end of this year, funding will have been provided for nine teams in total.  Three teams are currently operational.  Three other teams are funded and are at an advanced stage of recruitment, and funding is to issue this year for a further three teams.  What I am trying to achieve is that we will have one team in each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  It is important that we have a situation where, regardless of where one lives, one has access to an eating disorder team.</p>  <p>  It has been stated constantly that there are only three eating-disorder beds in the country.  All approved centres are available for eating disorder cases, and we have 56 approved centres in the country.  A person can avail of inpatient supports at any of the 56 centres.  I will continue to work on the particular case.</p></speech>

It is a life-changer.  Some 554 children and young adults are serviced by the paediatric diabetic department at Cork University Hospital, CUH, but as of two weeks ago, only 198 of them, 36%, had a pump.  As of two weeks ago, 24 under the age of six were being forced to wait for pump therapy.  Due to understaffing, CUH was allowed become the only hospital in the country where pump upgrades had to be paused.</p>  <p>  I congratulate the parents who campaigned long and hard on these issues and whose efforts have played a key role in winning extra resources for this department.  There will be two new nurses this July, a psychologist position is to be filled shortly, as well as an advanced nurse practitioner, and there will be extra administrative resources.  However, through no fault of their own, the doctors here have a significant backlog to address.  I will watch the progress made like a hawk and will demand extra resources in the coming months should that prove necessary.</p></speech>

This is being realised through the recruitment of staff and additional resources at various locations across the country, including CUH.  We will continue to keep an eye on that and to keep the pressure on.</p></speech>

The European Central Bank, ECB, is likely to begin to move the rate next month.  Traditionally, Irish retail banks have been very quick to raise interest rates for borrowers but very slow to raise them for depositors and savers.  Does the Government have any plans to ensure that Irish retail banks will not make excessive profits in this new interest rate environment and that the benefits of interest rate increases will also be passed on to Irish consumers?</p></speech>

The Central Bank regulates the banks.  The ECB has kept interest rates at an exceptionally low level for the past decade, as concerns about deflation dominated.  Inflation is now the predominant concern and worry, hitting about 8.1% in May across Europe.  Last week, the ECB signalled a 0.25% interest rate hike in July and said a bigger increase might be needed in September.  In our previous interest rate cycles, lending rates and deposit rates tended to move together, so there is good reason to believe that at some stage in the near future, deposit rates will move up from the current exceptionally low levels, as the ECB tightens monetary policy.</p></speech>

Tusla was compliant in only two of the 12 standards assessed.  One example is that some children with complex needs taken into State care by Tusla in Cork were housed in hotels.  The report is the latest among scores of reports that finds Tusla is not compliant with national standards for foster care in all of its 17 service areas.</p>  <p>  HIQA has the power to monitor Tusla but has no power of sanction.  This is farcical.  It can close down nursing homes overnight and everything else.  The Alliance of Birth Mothers Campaigning for Justice is advocating for these children.  The group has written to the Taoiseach.  A letter was handed to him by a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy.  The group has asked to meet the Taoiseach.  He was well able to question the then Minister, Ms Zappone, when he was sitting in this seat, but he has done nothing about it.  What is going on in terms of how children are being treated is a present-day scandal.</p></speech>

The follow-up report continues to reveal deficiencies, in particular of staffing levels, in the Cork area.  The crucial issue is the lack of social workers.  Tusla has a remediation plan in place to try to bring in the necessary social workers, in particular at the relevant degree of qualifications, into the area.  I am happy to follow up with the Deputy directly on how the plan is being implemented.  It is something that I have raised with both the chief executive and the chair of the Tusla board.</p></speech>

On 15 March, HIQA visited UHL to measure its compliance with four key standards.  It failed three and was only partially compliant with the fourth.  The report found that there was inadequate capacity and pointed to the fact that it was the only model 4 hospital and there were no model 3 hospitals in the region.  It also found that there was inadequate management of existing capacity, in particular, human resources.  That is just one day.  On every day, UHL is overcrowded.  On every day, it poses a danger to the patients it is supposed to serve.  On every day, people are afraid to go to the emergency department.  People are afraid that frail family members will be brought by ambulance to the department.  They beg ambulance drivers to bring them to another facility.  I have lived that fear, as have many families right across the constituency.  As Head of Government of this State, will the Taoiseach take responsibility for remedying this into his Department to ensure it is remedied, and if not, what will be done by the Government to remedy the situation?</p></speech>

The capacity is simply not there for any Department, including the Taoiseach's Department, to begin to run hospitals.  That is simply not going to happen.  It is not a runner, nor is it feasible or practical as a solution.  In terms of what we can do, the Minister has met with the chair, the CEO and senior management of the HSE, and has requested the development of comprehensive plans with short-term and long-term measures to be taken nationally and at each emergency department and community healthcare organisation to ensure sustainable improvements in the performance of emergency departments.  Without question, recent months have been highly challenging for emergency departments.  The situation has been exacerbated by the constant recurrence and the prevalence of Covid-19, not just in terms of what happens in hospitals but of egress from hospitals and the inability of some community nursing units and nursing homes to take patients from the acute wards of hospitals because of them being subject to outbreaks of Covid as well, so it has been very challenging.</p></speech>

The report was instigated in late 2017 or early 2018.  It has been sitting on the Minister's desk since January 2020.  It has cost the State approximately &euro;86,000 to publish and, more than anything else, patients need to see that report and what improvements it advocates.

There are 88 patients on trolleys there today, which is the same number as that on 15 March when HIQA carried out its report.  UHL needs serious help at a national level.  We have the second highest number in throughput of ED patients, yet we have the lowest number, relatively, of acute beds.  That is a very important statistic.  The Minister for Health set up, and asked the HSE to put in place, an expert team at UHL.  That team concluded its review on 10 June.  We now need to see HSE corporate stepping in to help UHL.  It needs help.  I need the Taoiseach to stand behind that proposition and these measures.  I ask that the action plan now being brought forward by the review team in the HSE nationally be implemented immediately in UHL.  It has very hard-working staff but we have serious problems there.</p></speech>

We are acutely aware of the challenges and pressures on the hospital.  The HIQA report identified, for example, that even though there has been a substantial increase in beds in the past number of years, it did not in itself alleviate the pressures on the emergency department.  There are issues other than resources.  More resources will be required for acute beds but that will take time.  In the interim, there are issues such as systems within the hospital and flow through it.  As I said, when the HIQA report was carried out, it was at the high point of disruption caused by Covid-19.  It was an unannounced visit, which is the same thing-----</p></speech>

The diabetic clinic in Portlaoise has 7,000 people with diabetes registered from the catchment area of Laois, south Kildare, Offaly, north Tipperary and County Laois.  The insulin pump service is available for children and adolescents only and not adults.  When people reach the age of 18, they have to go to Dublin and go private at more than &euro;500 a pop.  That is the only option.</p>  <p>  There is no dietician for the adult insulin pump services, which means there are no such services.  The clinic is doing great work and hospital management want to develop it, but it cannot provide a full service.  Hospital management has made the case three times for funding up to January this year and continues to make the case.  On 2 December, the Minister informed me that the appointment of a senior dietician to support the continued development of the services has been identified and is currently being considered.  This is after years of delay.  The heads of the hospital group are delaying this.  This is what is happening because I have been digging into it to find out what the real problem is.

Of course, she is not the only female Member to have had a baby in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  Indeed, a number of men have had babies in their families during the period of this D&aacute;il.  It is a useful opportunity to remind us we have made no practical advance in maternity provision for Members of the Oireachtas who may have babies.  A Bill was passed on Second Stage and I thank the Government for its engagement with that.  It is a recommendation of the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament, and part of the work of the gender equality committee, to have a referendum on remote or proxy voting in limited circumstances, which would include maternity and potentially paternity provision.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate his support for this measure and indicate the lead Department in order that we might follow up on a practical basis for the future.  Is it the Taoiseach's Department?  It is surely not a matter of equality but one of the administration of politics more generally, rather than being hived off to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></speech>

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his team are working on that.  My Department is working on the provision of maternity leave to Oireachtas Members.  We have engaged with the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus.  We have sent a survey to all female Members to get their views.  I am meeting with the Ceann Comhairle soon regarding an engagement to bring together Standing Orders and to see what elements we can undertake in that regard.

The passports for her four children came back on 31 May with a request for further information from her, which she sent in.  The flights were scheduled for 21 June.  This is nearly ten weeks ago and I requested this matter be treated as urgent.  Last week, she came to me saying she was so disappointed because this passport was urgent as this family was picked from the Kildare and Leighlin diocese for an audience with the Pope during the World Meeting of Families 2022.  This is a family that is representing Ireland.  I did everything on Friday to get the passport.  I contacted the Taoiseach's office and the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  I contacted everywhere and she did not fly out today.  It is unacceptable that this lady and her four children - it is such a privilege to have an audience with the Pope - did not get her passport.  As I said, it has been going for nearly ten weeks.  It is unacceptable.  The other issue is that Helen went to the Passport Office on Friday and Monday.  She said staff there were not one bit nice or helpful to her.</p></speech>

In a more serious vein, it is very distressing for the family, to be fair.  Normally, passport applications for children tend to be the difficulty and not those for the mother.  I will raise this with the Department.  It is no fault of the Deputy's because she contacted my office yesterday at around 8.30 a.m., as she did others.  It is very distressing for the mother and the family who were selected to go to Rome to have an audience with the Pope.  It meant a lot to that family.  I cannot understand how that happened, especially if the children's passports were all sorted because that is normally the area where there seems to be the greatest delay.</p></speech>

They were three of the great pioneers of peace, change and non-violence on our island.  Their legacy lives on all around us.</p>  <p>  Today, it is my honour to pay tribute to someone whom I had the honour of getting to know when I first became interested in politics.  He inspired me then and he continues to inspire me today.  For me and many of us in Fine Gael, Austin Currie was one of the most outstanding politicians of his generation, a person of incredible personal courage, political insight and humanity.  He was my local Deputy when I first got involved in Fine Gael and it was a strange experience to see someone who was almost an historical figure attending my local branch meetings above my local pub.  I will always be grateful to him for encouraging me in my early years in politics when plenty of others did not.  I learned a great deal from him, and it later became my great honour to represent the people of Dublin West, a constituency that he served with distinction for over a decade.  Today, I serve the families and individuals of Dublin West alongside his daughter, Senator Emer Currie, and I see in her the same passion for justice and determination to help others.  I also see in her the total absence of cynicism, which is rare in politics.</p>  <p>  Other speakers will pay tribute to Austin's remarkable achievements as a civil rights leader, how he exposed and highlighted discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland, especially in terms of issues like housing, how he organised one of the first civil rights marches in Northern Ireland and went on to co-found the SDLP with John Hume and Gerry Fitt, and how he was a politician of remarkable physical and moral courage who refused to stay silent even when people tried to intimidate and silence him and when he was threatened and attacked.</p>  <p>  To understand him, one has to understand his unshakeable commitment to peace and democracy.  Although he and his family, some of whom are present, were subjected to violence, they never once contemplated resorting to it.  He always stayed true to his belief &ndash; shared with John Hume - that two wrongs could never make a right.  Like Martin Luther King and Mohandas Gandhi, he knew that a people could be liberated without any need for recourse to violence, sectarianism or hatred.</p>  <p>  When Austin died, many of the tributes understandably focused on the earlier part of his career in Northern Ireland.  His time as a Deputy and a Minister of State in this State was almost viewed as a postscript, a less interesting part of his life when he took up different causes and issues.  To me, however, it was a continuum of a single cause - a fight for human rights, dignity and justice for people, North and South.  By remembering Austin's later career, we see the full extent of his patriotism, his courage and his contribution to our country.  So, today I want to say something about his career as a Deputy and a Minister of State, a remarkable period when we saw the exact same political insight, courage and humanity on display.</p>  <p>  In the 1990s, which was in our lifetime, there were dark parts of Irish society that we did not like to be open about or talk about, issues that we tried to ignore and pretend did not exist or just did not know how to deal with, for example, child abuse.</p> <p>He showed the same courage and moral clarity in fighting these wrongs and in fighting for the rights of children as he showed when fighting for the rights of Catholics in Northern Ireland.  He was appointed a Minister of State by former Taoiseach John Bruton.  He as the very first Minister of State with specific responsibility for children in the history of the State.  This has developed into a full Cabinet Ministry, held by my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Gorman, but this was when that role was created.  It spanned three Departments: the Department of Health; the Department of Education; and the Department of Justice.  His experience of how politics worked &ndash; and often did not work &ndash; made an immediate impact.  One of the first things he discovered was that many of the civil servants working on different aspects of policies relating to children did not know each other, so he introduced regular meetings, bringing them together and ensuring that for the first time there was a co-ordinated approach to national childcare policy.  Austin was the first Minister of State to call for the creation of a children&rsquo;s ombudsman, which was built upon by the next Government when that office was established in 2002.<br/><br/>Austin showed real bravery in tackling the issue of child abuse and in trying to find real solutions.  For example, he wanted to introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse and started a debate about how that policy might work.  It took 20 years, but it happened during Enda Kenny&rsquo;s first Government.  When Ireland held the Presidency of the EU in 1996, Austin used that platform to speak out against organised paedophile networks worldwide and about how countries needed to work together to fight it.  Austin was ahead of his time in many ways, including when it came to identifying future threats to children, such as the Internet.  This was in the days when email and the Internet were new concepts.  Austin represented the EU at the first World Congress Against Sexual Exploitation and spoke passionately about the dangers posed by the growing popularity of the Internet and how it was being used to transmit images of children and promote child sex abuse.  He lost none of his oratorical skills, and his contribution made a considerable impression and helped influence governments across the world.<br/><br/>To give a small flavour of Austin's achievements , he spoke in the D&aacute;il about child sex tourism and brought forward amendments to legislation against it.  He worked to modernise Ireland&rsquo;s adoption policies, provide more money for families in the family resource centres, increase the fostering allowance for teenagers and fight child homelessness.  He also worked to improve childcare services and services for young offenders.  Furthermore, he worked with others to establish a specialist unit to deal with family violence.  As is the case now, there were not many votes in these things but a lot of good was done.  When he died, Niamh Bhreathnach, the former Labour Deputy, who was Minister for Education in the rainbow Government, wrote a generous letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, crediting Austin with the work he had done behind the scenes in the area of special education.  Austin was driven by ideas and his belief in people.  Thanks to his courage and determination, we live in a better Ireland today.</p></speech>

As I said in the aftermath of his death, on that basis alone he would be deserving of national recognition and respect but Austin Currie&rsquo;s contribution to Irish politics and Irish life was much more consequential than his service to this House or to Government.  Austin Currie was a major figure among that singular generation of Northern leaders.  He was one of a group of extraordinary individuals, from ordinary backgrounds, who were forced by the degradations of the Northern state at that time to confront this appalling injustice.  They recognised the power of peaceful protest and they understood that social and economic justice and progress would only be secured through the force of argument.  His protest on housing rights in Caledon is widely recognised as the beginning of the civil rights movement.  Then, along with those other great names, Hume, Cooper, Fitt, Devlin and O&rsquo;Hanlon, and others, he founded the SDLP and developed the fundamental political philosophy that ultimately became the basis of peace and power-sharing across the board.  We can imagine with complete confidence his impatience and dismay with the ongoing refusal to honour the mandate of the recent assembly elections and bring back the institutions.</p>  <p>  Alongside his intellectual capacity, Austin Currie was a man of real and significant physical courage.  More than 30 times his family home was attacked by loyalists and so-called republicans and, yet, along with his colleagues, he persisted.  As I said at the time of his death, and I repeat today, our country owes him a great debt for this persistence.  Many people are alive today and raising families of their own because of this persistence and we have peace in our country because of this persistence.</p>  <p>  Austin's contribution to this D&aacute;il and to Government have been well articulated by the T&aacute;naiste but his role as Minister of State with responsibility for children's rights is particularly significant because it was the commencement of an evolution that has placed children and childcare policy that is more reflective of children at the Cabinet table.  That took place over a period, with additional powers and responsibilities being given to successive Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for children.  Austin began that process and was particularly focused on protecting children from all forms of abuse.  That is something for which we also him a debt of gratitude.</p>  <p>  Outside politics, Austin&rsquo;s great passion and love was his family, namely, Anita, Estelle, Caitr&iacute;ona, Dualta, Austin &Oacute;g and our colleague, Senator Emer Currie.  All of his grandchildren have come in today for this important moment.  They are welcome to this House.  It is important that we pay tribute to Austin Currie in the context of his contribution to this House and to politics in the Republic and on the island as a whole.  I know that his family will continue to miss him every day.  I hope that as they listen to the heartfelt tributes from colleagues across the House this afternoon, they will get some comfort from the huge and enormous respect in which Austin Currie was held and that they feel pride in the profound contribution he made to our country.  Their husband, father and brother was one of those who truly made Ireland a better place.  Ar Dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Very few people will equal, in one lifetime, the positive impact that Austin Currie had on politics on this island.  As the Minister with responsibility for equality, I have always been inspired by Austin's lifelong dedication to achieving equal civil rights for those so profoundly discriminated against in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of this was a deep conviction that justice should prevail through peaceful and democratic means and that courage was needed to act on this conviction in a climate of violence, intimidation and hatred, often against him, his immediate family and his political peers.  That courage and conviction could be seen in the political tasks Austin turned his ambition towards, which were always peacebuilding projects.  He brought real political skill and dignity to both his elected and appointed political roles in: the old Northern Ireland Parliament; the short-lived 1973 Assembly and Executive; the New Ireland Forum; and as Deputy for Dublin West, my constituency, for 13 years.  Austin's active political career ended before mine began so I would not have known him terribly well but I recall in May 2019 in the convention centre in City West him walking around with unalloyed pride as Emer was elected to Fingal County Council on her first attempt.</p> <p>A number of weeks ago, I met Senator Currie and Anita in the car park and Anita gave me a concise history of the foundation of the SDLP in her and Austin's front room.  She talked about a small number of people going over the political programme and of how she took down the constitution on their typewriter.  It is amazing to think of the legacy that comes from such small and intimate gatherings and of the political movement created within that sitting room.  That dignified legacy of Austin's stands as a credit to him, his family and his former SDLP and Fine Gael colleagues and it should serve to inspire all of us in this Chamber and everyone still engaged in the process of peacebuilding in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

As a leading member of the early civil rights campaign, co-founder of the SDLP, Minister in the short-lived 1974 power-sharing Executive in the North and Fine Gael Minister of State, Austin had a long and distinguished record of public service.</p><p>He first served in the old Stormont Parliament for East Tyrone from 1964 to 1972, representing first the Nationalist Party and later the SDLP.  Austin was among a class of young nationalists in the North who had benefitted from educational reform after the Second World War and sought job equality not alone for themselves but for everybody.  In 1964, when he was elected to the old Stormont, he was the youngest person ever to gain a seat in that institution.  He was one of the organisers of the first civil rights march in August 1968, which followed the occupation of a house in Caledon, County Tyrone in protest at discrimination in local council housing allocations.  Austin was in the Caledon house just hours before the police ousted him and others, such as Patsy Gildernew and Joe Campbell.  The photograph of him there became a recurrent and iconic image in media coverage of the civil rights movement.</p><p>He once eloquently described the effect of partition on the nationalist community in the North:</p> <blockquote> 	Partition was used to try to cut us off from the rest of the Irish nation.  Unionists did their best to stamp out our nationalism and, the educational system, to the extent it could...was oriented to Britain and we were not even allowed to use names such as S&eacute;amus or Se&aacute;n.  When my brothers' godparents went to register their birth, they were told no such names as S&eacute;amus or Se&aacute;n existed in Northern Ireland and were asked for the English equivalent. </blockquote>  <p>Later in his career, Mr. Currie became a Fine Gael Deputy for Dublin West in 1989 and finished a creditable third in the 1990 presidential election.  He was the first person to be elected to parliaments in Belfast and Dublin, and served as a Minister in both.  He was the first ever Minister in an Irish Government with dedicated responsibility for children.</p><p>Austin Currie long harboured doubts about the commitment of many politicians in the South to the plight of nationalists in the North, many of whom demonstrated absolute indifference.  In his 2004 autobiography, <i>All Hell Will Break Loose</i>, he wrote about his experience of running in that presidential election and the prejudice he faced as a northern nationalist from those within the political system here who harboured deeply partitionist attitudes.  He wrote: &quot;What annoyed, indeed angered me most was the suggestion that because I came from the North, I was not a real Irishman.&quot;</p><p>Following the deaths of Seamus Mallon and John Hume in January and August 2020 respectively, Austin was the last surviving founder of the SDLP.  Whether as a representative of the SDLP or Fine Gael, Austin was often a spirited and determined opponent of my party and we of his politics, but that is the nature of politics.  Today as we reflect on his very considerable life and political career, we pay tribute to his service to his constituents and his country.  On my behalf and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, I express our condolences to his wife Anita, his family, his children, his grandchildren, all his friends and to his political colleagues in the SDLP, Fine Gael and beyond.

As a politician and civil rights campaigner, he leaves a tremendous legacy and had the extraordinary achievement of serving as Minister in both jurisdictions on this island.  Reviewing the remarkable journey of Austin Currie's life and his strong legacy on peace and integration, one can only imagine what it must have been like for him at such a young age - 24 - to take a seat in the then unreformed Stormont Parliament, having won the 1964 by-election in East Tyrone.  I cannot imagine what that was like.  It was a time when there was blatant discrimination, including structural discrimination, against Catholics in Northern Ireland, particularly in the allocation of public housing, an issue that was to have a huge influence on his politics and his campaigning work.</p>  <p>  In 1968, the well-documented sit-in at the new council estate in Caledon shone a light for Austin Currie and all on the island on what was happening across Northern Ireland and brought much-increased public attention to the discrimination faced by Catholics and the political situation there.  Speaking on the issue beforehand in Stormont, Austin Currie said those famous words, that all hell would break loose.  They were prescient words because the fallout from that protest and that political context led to the formation of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement.  Following that, as we saw, unfortunately, the terrible violence of the Troubles erupted and Austin went on to form the SDLP along with his colleagues Seamus Mallon, Gerry Fitt and John and Pat Hume.  Like them, he was a man of peace who abhorred the violence of the Troubles and remained committed to non-violence, despite the enormous toll it took on his own family, with constant threats and over 30 attacks on his family home and family members, including on his beloved wife Anita.</p>  <p>  These things led him to move his family, ultimately, and take refuge in this jurisdiction, where he served as a Teachta D&aacute;la for many years and was to serve as Minister of State with responsibility for children in the rainbow coalition between 1994 and 1997.  The T&aacute;naiste has remarked how Niamh Breathnach, Labour Minister for Education in that coalition, paid tribute to his work on the rights of children.  Another colleague of mine, former Labour leader Joan Burton, was a constituency colleague of Austin and shared with me the anecdote that when he first came to run for Fine Gael in Dublin West, Vincent Browne asked him about his knowledge of the geography of the constituency at a time when he would not have been an expert on that, to put it politely.  Once elected, as Joan acknowledges, he became an expert on the highways and byways of Dublin West and developed a detailed mastery of constituency issues, remaining a Teachta D&aacute;la until 2002.  As a Fine Gael candidate in the 1990 presidential election, he was extraordinarily generous to our successful Labour candidate, Mary Robinson, recommending transfers to her unstintingly right up until polling day.  We remember him for that too.</p>  <p>  I pay tribute on behalf of Labour to Austin's family, to Anita and his children, Estelle, Caitr&iacute;ona, Dualta, Austin &oacute;g and Emer, our Oireachtas colleague.  I think I am the only Member here who has had the pleasure of serving with Emer, which I did in the Seanad until my by-election last summer.  It was a pleasure to serve with her in the Upper House and to continue to work with her on the WorkEqual campaign and other campaigns in which we share a common interest.  I express my condolences and those of Labour to the extended family, Austin's grandchildren, siblings, relatives and friends.  May Austin rest in peace, knowing that his efforts helped to bring peace and reconciliation across this island.</p></speech>

When facing up against the weight of systemic oppression, it is easy to feel as if any action you take is futile and that the personal risk always outweighs the reward but Austin Currie provides a really good example of how a seemingly small action can light a spark and lead to something much bigger.  By smashing a window in a council house in Caledon in County Tyrone in June 1968 and occupying that house for just a short few hours, the 28-year-old Austin Currie changed history by giving people a very tangible understanding of the discrimination being experienced.  For the first time, housing discrimination against Catholics was being reported and broadcast on the evening news across Ireland and in the UK.  His protest was not the first act of civil disobedience and it was far from the last but it lit a spark in the beginning of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.  He built on this momentum to lead the first non-sectarian civil rights marches in Northern Ireland, taking direct inspiration from the American civil rights movement.  From there, he went on to become a co-founder of the SDLP and became well known for speaking truth to power at a time when that was not only unpopular, but dangerous.  His life was under constant threat throughout his political life in Northern Ireland, as were the lives of his family.  As we have heard from several others, there were 30 attacks on his home.  Shots were fired through the windows, bombs were left outside the front door, threats were constantly made and his wife, Annita, was brutally attacked.  Despite the danger and violence, Austin Currie, supported by his family, remained absolutely opposed to all forms of political violence and firmly committed to achieving peace on this island by peaceful means.  He was tireless in his commitment to peace and justice, which is illustrated well by the famous words he delivered at Stormont right before the housing protest in 1968, "All Hell will break loose and by God I will lead it'".  It made a remarkable difference in a very tangible way.  I reiterate our sympathies to the Currie family.</p></speech>

Austin Currie was one of the leading figures in the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and, as we know, co-founded the SDLP.  He became a poster boy for the Northern Ireland civil rights movement in June 1968 when he bravely squatted in a house in Caledon in his home county of Tyrone.  I have often visited that village and stood on the big wall that surrounds the estate, dividing it from Glaslough in County Monaghan where my wife worked in the early 1980s.  They had enormous bravery and courage.  As the late Canon Hayes said, it is better to light one candle than to curse the dark.  They lit that candle and that spark eventually ended up in some modicum of fairness for the minority of Catholics and nationalists in Northern Ireland with regard to housing and many other issues.  I am delighted that I got to know him when he was here as a junior Minister.  I met him at a function or two in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  It was fortuitous that he got elected in Dublin and became an Aire St&aacute;it.  I also remember meeting him during his presidential campaign.  I offer the Rural Independent Group's sympathies and, indeed, our thanks and gratitude for the obair stairi&uacute;il a rinne s&eacute;.  He worked very hard with the other co-founders of the SDLP, Gerry Fitt and John Hume.  His autobiography says a lot more but I will not go into that today.  It is a momentous day, although tinged with sadness for his wife and family.  These expressions of sympathy show the respect in which he was held in this House and by the people of the Republic of Ireland.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I acknowledge all of his family who are here today.  My own fondest memory is of an afternoon he and I spent in the final days of a recent election, which Senator Doherty will remember, when we were canvassing at the same church gate.  It was very much the end of the campaign, when the scramble to convince those last few undecided voters takes place.  He was campaigning for his daughter, Emer, who is now a Senator and my constituency colleague in Dublin West.  What was clear on that day was his special way with people.  Many whom he met from all walks of life showed great respect for him, but also a lovely warmth.  He matched that with his own, chatting gently with churchgoers, asking after their families and engaging with sincerity and openness.  He was a gentleman in the truest sense of the word.  The same man chatting gently at the church gate backed up that warmth with the real strength of conviction that came to mark him from his early political career in Tyrone through to his time in Dublin West, which has cemented him as a key architect of peace on this island.  He was a man who, having tried everything else, felt so strongly about the injustice he witnessed that he had to do something.  His actions in 1968 marked the starting point of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.  It was a protest over housing that, within months, became so much more and which has echoed down the decades since.  He was a man who continued to advocate for the most vulnerable in society as the first Minister of State with responsibility for children's rights and whose vision was ultimately vindicated through the Good Friday Agreement, which I closely associate with the party he helped to found.  Many in this House have a decency that allows them to connect with those they represent.  Others are great statespeople who implement lasting positive change.  A special few are both.  Austin Currie was one of those special few.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

That meeting is expected to be followed by a meeting of the Euro Summit.  An EU-Western Balkans meeting will also take place on 23 June.  Before turning to these meetings, I will briefly update the House on the special meeting of the European Council which I attended on 30 and 31 May.  I also take the opportunity to update the House on my recent visit to Strasbourg and address at the European Parliament.  At the special meeting of the European Council on 30 and 31 May, we discussed the situation in Ukraine, including international justice, humanitarian, financial, political and economic support, and the impact on neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  We also discussed energy defence and food security.  On the first day of the summit, we were joined by video conference by President Zelenskyy for the opening of our discussion on Ukraine.  We expressed our unwavering commitment to support Ukraine in exercising its right to self-defence against ongoing Russian aggression.  We called on Russia to immediately withdraw from the internationally recognised territory of Ukraine.  We also called on Russia to allow humanitarian access and the safe return of people forcibly removed to Russia.</p>  <p>  We welcomed efforts to gather evidence and investigate war crimes and indicated our support for the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in that respect.  Ireland has joined 40 countries in referring what is happening in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court.  Our objective is that Russia, Belarus and all those responsible are held to account for their actions in accordance with international law.</p>  <p>  We discussed the need to cut Russia's oil and gas revenue and agreed a significant new sixth package of sanctions.  We reaffirmed our intention to continue to support Ukraine in addressing humanitarian liquidity and reconstruction needs, including through new macro-financial assistance of up to &euro;9 billion in 2022.</p>  <p>  We concluded that the European Union is also prepared to play a key role in the reconstruction of Ukraine along with international partners.  European Union support for reconstruction will be linked to the implementation of reforms which will additionally support Ukraine's progress on its European path.  I will return to this topic further in my remarks.</p>  <p>  Leaders also welcomed recent agreement to increase military support to Ukraine under the European Peace Facility.  Ireland will again contribute towards non-lethal elements bringing our support to a total of &euro;44 million of the overall &euro;2 billion in support provided under the four packages.  Furthermore, we welcomed the adoption of the decision to suspend import duties on all Ukrainian exports to the European Union for one year.  We reiterated our call for an end to repression in Belarus and the democratic right of the Belarusian people to new, free and fair elections.</p>  <p>  The sanctions package which we agreed includes a prohibition on imports of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products by sea on a phased basis.</p> <p>A temporary exemption is in place for imports by pipeline.  The bulk of Russian oil is expected to be banned from the EU by the end of the year.</p> <p> Other restrictive measures in the package include listings of a further 65 individuals and 18 entities, the removal of four banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, a prohibition on the provision of accountancy, consultancy, public relations and cloud services, additional export controls and prohibitions on three Russian broadcasters.  It also targets additional Russian and Belarusian banks and Russia state-owned broadcasters responsible for Russian state propaganda.  The sale and transfer of European property to residents of Russia are now prohibited.</p> <p> Ireland had frozen more than &euro;1.72 billion of Russian assets by 17 June.  We will continue to use our membership of the United Nations Security Council to hold Russia accountable and to urge Russia to end its war in Ukraine immediately.  Some &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid provided by the Government is being disbursed through United Nations and non-governmental organisation, NGO, partners in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.  Ireland has also provided medical assistance and supplies, including ambulances valued at more than &euro;3 million, in a partnership between Departments, the HSE and other agencies working with private sector and civil society partners.  A total of 13 medical evacuations of patients from Ukraine to Ireland have been completed to date, including some whose ongoing care in Ukraine has been interrupted by the crisis and some war-wounded with trauma-related injuries.  Two containerised water treatment plants, valued at &euro;460,000, have been shipped by Irish Water to Ukraine, which will supply 6,200 people in Ukraine with clean water.</p> <p> On the second day of the summit, we discussed energy, defence and food security.  With the war in Ukraine, we have reached the watershed moment.  Europe is now acting decisively to make a fundamental break with Russian fossil fuels.</p> <p> When we met last month, EU leaders had an initial discussion of the Commission's REPowerEU plan and how to fast-forward the transition to renewables, including reducing energy usage, producing clean energy, reducing delays in permit processes for clean energy and diversifying our energy supplies.  The best medium- to long-term approach to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewables, enhance electricity interconnection and deepen the internal energy market.  We also discussed food security and were joined in our discussions by Macky Sall, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union.  </p> <p> It is clear that with his targeted destruction of agricultural production and his blockade on Ukrainian ports, Putin is deliberately trying to force and further aggravate a food crisis.  Impacts are already being felt in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where some countries are particularly exposed to Russian and Ukrainian exports, and have lower food security.</p> <p> EU leaders called for effective and swift international co-ordination, including through the United Nations, to keep global trade in food free of unjustified trade barriers and to enhance solidarity towards the most vulnerable countries so as to avert hunger.  We also returned to our discussion on security and defence in follow up to the publication of the strategic compass strategy.  We discussed the analysis of defence investment gaps within the EU published by the European Commission on 18 May which covers expenditure, industrial gaps and capability gaps, with all agreed on the need for more and better investments.  We reaffirmed our support for the global, rules-based order with the United Nations at its core.</p> <p> I visited Strasbourg on 7 and 8 June.  I met with representatives of the Council of Europe to mark Ireland's six-month presidency of the body and paid a visit to the European Court of Human Rights.  At the European Parliament, I unveiled a bust to honour the life and career of the late John Hume.</p> <p> On Wednesday, 8 June, I had the honour to address the plenary session of the European Parliament, reflecting on the 50 years since Ireland voted to join what is now the EU.  In my remarks, I set out the impact EU membership has had on Ireland and the positive contribution we make to the EU as a community of shared values.  I had a welcome opportunity to thank President Metsola in person for the European Parliament's support and solidarity throughout the Brexit process.</p> <p> I will now turn to this week's upcoming meetings.  An EU-western Balkans leaders' meeting will take place on the morning of 23 June.  EU leaders will meet with our counterparts from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia.  The meeting will be an opportunity to take stock of progress on key investments under the economic and investment plan for the western Balkans, to discuss geostrategic issues, to explore ways to foster people-to-people contacts and from the EU's perspective, to promote greater alignment with democratic values and the EU's common foreign and security policy across the countries in the region.</p> <p> The economic and investment plan launched by the European Commission in February aims to spur long-term recovery, accelerate a green and digital transition and foster regional co-operation.  It will help attract public and private investments, backed by the western Balkan guarantee facility, which has a potential to mobilise up to &euro;20 billion.</p> <p> I have long been an advocate for improving and accelerating the EU enlargement process, including for countries of the western Balkans.  I believe that more needs to be done to positively encourage the reform commitment and aspirations of those seeking to join the EU.  Greater use should be made of the provisions for accelerated integration within the existing methodology.  I would like in particular to see the opening of accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia without delay.  The French presidency has been very active in seeking to secure a compromise under which Bulgaria would lift its current block on negotiations with North Macedonia.  While there is limited time left ahead of the meeting, it would be very welcome if progress could be made.</p> <p> I welcome the agreement reached by political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 June.  This agreement underlined the importance of the implementation of reforms that advance Bosnia and Herzegovina's European integration in areas, including democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights and public administration reform.  Granting Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status when the time is right would mean that all five western Balkans countries that have formally applied for membership would have candidate status.</p> <p> Our partners in the western Balkans have been heavily impacted by Russia's war on Ukraine, in particular those who have demonstrated strong solidarity with Ukraine and are closely aligned with the EU's position, including with regard to sanctions.  This week we will have an opportunity to discuss how the EU can continue to support those countries in the face of the ongoing war.</p> <p> The agenda for June's European Council covers wider Europe; Ukraine; the membership applications of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia; economic issues; and the Conference on the Future of Europe.  We may also touch on some foreign policy issues, including in respect of Turkey.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will address the Conference on the Future of Europe in his remarks later as well as the prospects and possible agenda for a meeting of the euro summit this week.</p> <p> EU leaders acknowledged the European aspirations and European choice of Ukraine in our Versailles declaration on 11 March.  Last Friday, following an assessment process, the European Commission recommended that Ukraine be granted candidate status.  This is an historic moment.  If endorsed by the European Council, as I expect it will be, it will place Ukraine on a firm path towards EU membership, where it belongs.  Every sovereign country has a right to determine its own future free from external pressure and duress.  The people of Ukraine have chosen a future in the EU and they deserve our full support.  I have long advocated for this outcome and I will be arguing strongly that it be endorsed at our meeting.  It will provide a great boost to the people and Government of Ukraine who have stood firm in defence of our shared European values in the face of the most appalling Russian war.  I hope that it will give them heart and courage in the weeks and months ahead.  It is a message that Europe stands with them now, that we will continue to stand with them whatever lies ahead and that we will be with them as they work to rebuild their country.</p> <p> The road to EU membership is complex and challenging.  It requires considerable work on the part of the country looking to join.  Ireland is ready to walk every step of that journey with Ukraine, providing whatever support and encouragement we can along the way.</p> <p> I warmly welcome the recommendation that Moldova also be offered candidate status and that Georgia be offered a European perspective and candidate status once a number of priorities have been met.</p> <p> As I said before, as we know from our own experience, membership of the EU is transformative.  As we mark 50 years of our own membership, we hope that others will be able to benefit from the same peace, prosperity and opportunity.</p> <p> Leaders will also discuss the sanctions we have put in place against Russia, including looking at how to close any loopholes and block off any route to circumvention.  We will also look to make explicit that food and agricultural products are exempt from sanctions.</p> <p>In the face of a global food crisis, this is the right approach, as is the European Union's close co-operation with the UN and others to act now to stem worsening food security and growing global hunger.</p> <p> On economic issues, leaders are expected to endorse the country-specific recommendations for this year's European semester and look forward to Croatia adopting the euro from the beginning of 2023.  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the introduction of euro bank notes and coins and it is positive to see the number of countries using the euro growing to 20 from next year.  I expect that leaders will also meet in European summit format and hear from the President of the European Central Bank, ECB, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the President of the Eurogroup, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on economic prospects in Europe in the period ahead.  Leaders across the Union are very focused on the impact of rising inflation, energy prices and interest rates, not least on our citizens.  With many predicting that the war in Ukraine may be long, it is important that we come together to discuss collective strategies on how to manage this difficult and evolving situation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will speak to these issues in more detail later.</p> <p> We will also have an initial discussion on the issue of wider Europe.  President Macron has some proposals on the concept of a European political community.  We are, without doubt, at an inflection point in European history and these discussions will help us frame our wider regional political engagement.  As we come to the end of the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the end of June, I would like to take this opportunity to commend and express my appreciation to President Macron and the wider French Presidency team for their successful stewardship of the work of the council during this period of acute risk and difficulty with Russia's brutal war in Ukraine.  The French Presidency laid the groundwork for the EU to act with unity of purpose and clear focus over recent months.  I also wish to take this opportunity to wish the incoming Czech Presidency, under the stewardship of Prime Minister Fiala, every success and to express my ongoing support for a proactive, strong and strategic European Council agenda as we look into the next half of the year.</p> <p> I look forward to the opportunity this week of engaging collectively and bilaterally with my EU counterparts as well as western Balkan partners on a broad range of pressing economic, political and security issues.  I will report to the House on our discussions after the meeting.</p></speech>

I hope that matter is ratified as outlined by the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The meeting of the European Council this week occurs against the backdrop of the British Government's full frontal attack on the Irish protocol and the Good Friday Agreement.  Boris Johnson's reckless decision to push ahead with legislation to override the protocol is an intentional breach of European and international law.  It is an affront to an agreement that the British Government not only signed up to but also helped to design and it is right that the EU now restarts legal action in response.  Johnson's agenda is driven by a need to appease the hardline Brexiteers in the European Research Group, ERG, and the Tory party so that he can cling on to power at any cost.  For Mr. Johnson, Ireland's economic prosperity, peace and political stability is to be collateral damage in a self-serving power play.</p>  <p>  The behaviour of the Tory Government is devoid of any integrity and the unified message from this Oireachtas is clear.  The days of the British Government being allowed to bully Ireland and to ride roughshod over Ireland's interests are gone and they are not coming back.  Mr. Johnson says that his legislation is about fixing the protocol for trade but the problem for the British Prime Minister is simple.  No matter how hard he tries, Mr. Johnson cannot spin a lie.  The undeniable truth is that the protocol is working but the facts do not suit Boris Johnson's threadbare narrative.  The protocol gives businesses in the North access to both the British market and the EU Single Market of over 500 million people.  The North's economy is outperforming the English economy.  Business is growing and jobs are being created.  Cross-border trade has increased significantly and the all-island economy is thriving.  Now, because the Tory government in London cares very little for Ireland, it will happily take a wrecking ball to this progress.  The impact on Ireland's economy would be colossal.  It would have devastating consequences for agriculture in particular and put thousands of jobs at risk.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  The Irish Government, together with our European and international partners, cannot blink in the face of this Tory belligerence.</p>  <p>  We also see that the protocol is being used as a Trojan horse by political unionism to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  This is because unionists cannot come to terms with the new political reality in the North, echoed in May's Assembly election.  Mr. Johnson allows this to happen because it serves his self-interests.  He allows the DUP to block the formation of an Executive in Belfast and uses political deadlock as an excuse to break international law in turn.  The result is that the people of the North are left without a government as they deal with the most serious cost of living crisis in a generation.</p>  <p>  Boris Johnson should be under no illusion.  Ireland, Europe and the world can see what he is at.  If this is his negotiating tactic, it is an extremely bad one.  The British Government now risks a trade war that nobody wants and which would have catastrophic outcomes for everyone on both islands.  Last week, I said that we need a unified Oireachtas approach in response to this assault on Ireland's interests.  Mr.Johnson must hear from all of us, loudly and clearly, that our economic prosperity, our political stability, our peace and our Good Friday Agreement are not on the table.  The future of our people is not a bargaining chip he gets to play with each and every time his grip on power slips.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not alone.  We are joined by our European partners against this threat.  Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič's confirmation that the EU will not renegotiate the protocol is very welcome and gives us confidence for what lies ahead.  Ireland will not be the collateral damage in the Tory Brexit nightmare.  Together with those throughout the world who care deeply about Ireland, we will face Boris Johnson down.  The Taoiseach must use this meeting on the European Council to marshal that diplomatic focus towards this crucial goal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100023#X00300"><p>The role of the EU in addressing Boris Johnson's government's shameful and opportunistic exploitation of the issues surrounding the protocol remains critical.  The British Government, along with its allies in the DUP, is using the protocol to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government cannot and must not be allowed to play free and easy with an international agreement which has brought about peace on this island.</p>  <p>  I welcome the criticism by the Council of Europe of the Tory government's plans to introduce legislation to protect members of the British army guilty of crimes against the Irish people by offering them immunity from prosecution.  This is another attempt by the British to deny the families of victims here in Ireland truth and justice.</p>  <p>  I join my party leader Deputy McDonald in reiterating Sinn F&eacute;in's support for Ukraine's application to join the EU.  Ireland must continue to play its role as a militarily neutral, non-aligned State within the EU.  I also reiterate my support for sanctions against Russia and the efforts being made to offer aid to the Ukrainian people.  As an act of solidarity, like many other EU countries have done, we must open the Irish Embassy in Kyiv as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  Yesterday was World Refugee Day.  We can be proud of Ireland's record in offering a haven to those who have been forced to flee the conflict in Ukraine.  However, there is still no clarity on the pledge by the Government to accept 500 vulnerable Ukrainian refugees who are in Moldova.  I ask the Taoiseach to address that issue and provide some clarity on the commitment the Government made in March.</p> <p>One of the consequences of the Russian invasion is the food shortage, which has impacted in Africa and parts of the Middle East.  In many areas that have already been ravaged by climate change and regional conflict, shortages of wheat and grain are set to lead to humanitarian catastrophe.  This will lead to mass migration as millions will seek to flee famine and war.  The EU must act to prevent this human tragedy from unfolding further.<br/><br/>The response of the EU to the war in Ukraine has largely been laudable and it foregrounds the importance of territorial integrity, the need for states to operate within the parameters of the international rules-based system, and the need for international law to be universally applied.  Unfortunately, the recent gas deal between the EU and Israel falls short of the moral and legal obligations of the EU and Ireland towards the Palestinian people.  This deal runs contrary to long-standing EU and Irish policy, which requires <font color="#00201F">that &quot;all agreements between the State of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967&quot;.</font>This deal contravenes UN policy as set out in the UN Security Council Resolution 2334.  States have a moral and legal obligation &quot;to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967&quot;.<br/><br/>The Government was recently briefed by the UN special rapporteur on the situation with human rights in the Palestine occupied territories since 1967.  Professor Michael Lynk has stated that Palestinians in the occupied territories are living under a &quot;system of apartheid&quot;.  Neither Ireland nor the EU can bypass their own values, the UN and international law for the sake of what is a dodgy deal.  Israel has been exploiting occupied Palestinian territories for decades now.  This includes the mineral wealth on Palestinian land and in its waters.  The colonial settlement expansion programme in the occupied territories is a grave breach of international law.  Last year we took a unanimous decision in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that Israel has illegally annexed Palestinian land.  We cannot now about-turn and support a deal that not only undermines the decisions of this D&aacute;il, but also directly contravenes international law, even if a Minister believes it convenient to do so.  International law is not a pick and mix.  It must be applied equally and in all instances.  All lawbreakers must be held to account and not rewarded.  </p></speech>

The Taoiseach has given us a comprehensive update on the recent meeting of the European Council on 30 and 31 May.  The Taoiseach has also spoken to us about the meeting of the European Council in Brussels later this week.  I believe, and we in the Labour Party believe, that we need to see more and stronger actions being taken against Russia by the EU at this point.  It is clear that we must continue to work hard to achieve a stronger set of sanctions against Russia.  We have seen quite a number of different sanction packages but these have clearly not been enough to see an end to this brutal war.  We must see stronger support for Ukraine both politically and financially.  I very much welcome the Taoiseach's comments that Ukraine is now on a firm path to EU membership and that Ireland is supporting that path.</p>  <p>  We must also see stronger supports for those countries surrounding Ukraine, which are currently carrying the burden of the crisis caused by the Russian invasion, which is the crisis of refugees fleeing war and the brutality of the Russian invasion.  We need to see more done at a political and diplomatic level.  In this House and in protests outside the Russian Embassy I have consistently called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland.  Let us see why we continue to have diplomatic relations with a country like Russia at all, a country that shows no remorse for its actions.  It has engaged in a series of gruesome human rights abuses and a war of blatant territorial conquest.</p>  <p>  There are many unanswered questions about the size of the Russian diplomatic presence here in Ireland and its real purpose.  Last week, the Netherlands uncovered a Russian spy trying to infiltrate the International Criminal Court, which is rightly investigating war crimes in Ukraine by Russia.  The undercover back story, which we have seen in the newspapers here, of the GRU agent known as Victor Ferreira, involved four years of undergraduate study at Trinity College Dublin.  If Ireland is being used as a training ground for Russian GRU agents then we need fuller disclosure.  We need to know more about what the Government here knows about Russian activities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  We also need to see more action taken against Russian assets.  Russian assets frozen in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, should be committed to rebuilding Ukraine after its wanton destruction by the Russian army.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has brought forward legislation in this House, the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020, or the Magnitsky Bill, which passed Second Stage last December and which today is on Committee Stage.  This legislation would empower our Government to take stronger action against Russian oligarchs and against those Russians guilty of war crimes.  Mr. Bill Browder, the inspiration for this legislation, asked this morning in the Irish media, where was the speed and urgency for the progress into law of the Magnitsky Bill.  I urge the Minister to fast-track its passage into law.  We, as members of the UN Security Council, should be showing leadership in the international community in ensuring that the assets of those responsible for this brutal war may be seized in any jurisdiction in which they are held, including in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome that the Government is supporting so strongly the candidate status for EU membership for Ukraine, but that will not be enough.  We need to see stronger pledges of humanitarian and financial support for the people of Ukraine.  I was glad to bring into this House members of the Ukrainian community in recent weeks, and in the past ten days to meet the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland to hear directly from those most severely affected as to what is needed.  Last week a survey of the Ukrainian community in Ireland was published as to the supports needed here around housing, childcare and after-school care.  That is here in Ireland but we also need to see greater emphasis at EU level on the tariffs on Russian oil and gas to limit the financial benefit to Russia from rising prices of fuel internationally.  I welcome what the EU has already done on Russian fossil fuels, but we also need to see stronger action taken and more urgently.  This would also raise revenue for the EU to use in support of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Of course, we know that the Russian action in this brutal war has been a major factor in the rise in inflation rates.  These are causing major stress, trauma and pain to households in Ireland and across the EU, as we see stark rises in the cost of living and stark rises in fuel prices and food prices.  Again, we see Russia using and weaponising grain and food produced in Ukraine in an attempt to destabilise European countries and countries worldwide.  We are all very conscious of the impact this is having particularly across the developing world.</p>  <p>  What can we do?  Since last November we have called on the Government to secure key derogations on VAT rules on heating to try to ameliorate the really terrible impact that rising fuel prices are having here in Ireland.  We also need to see, and we need to ensure, that stronger action is taken at EU level to secure an embargo on Russian oil and gas.  That is crucial in order to see an end to this brutal war.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100024#Y00300"><p>The response to the war in Ukraine dominates the agenda of this European Council, and rightly so.  We would fully expect that.  I have just emerged from a D&oacute;chas briefing in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, where it was spelled out in real and very stark terms how the impact of the conflict in Ukraine extends far beyond just European borders.  The UN Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres has said that the war goes far beyond Ukraine and "a sword of Damocles hangs over the global economy - especially in the developing world".</p>  <p>  It is that crisis unfolding across the developing world, across Africa, and the Horn of Africa in particular, that I want to address.  We are aware that Ukraine, Belarus and Russia play a critical role in global food markets.  They are major producers of wheat, grain, barley, sunflower seeds and oil, potash and fertiliser.  Together, those three countries produce 12% of the world's traded food calories, which is almost one eighth.  It is an amazing figure.</p> <p>In March 2020, Russia announced a temporary ban on exports of grains and fertilisers, which has led to supply scarcity and further market destabilisation.  In addition, Russia has attacked Ukraine&rsquo;s transport infrastructure and instituted a <i>de facto</i>blockade in the Black Sea ports from which 90% of Ukraine&rsquo;s agricultural products are normally exported.  Damage to Ukraine&rsquo;s crops, food warehouses and agricultural machinery caused by Russian forces is going to affect grain production for months to come.  Even though Ukraine harvested a record 84 million clean weight tonnes of grain in 2021, more than 20 million tonnes of that have been trapped in silos since Russia invaded Ukraine and subsequently blocked its ports.  That has knock-on implications.  In countries like Kenya, the price of flour has trebled.  Worldwide, 95 million people could fall into poverty as a result of the conflict according to the World Bank and 47 million could fall into acute hunger.<br/><br/>If we look at this through the prism of our sustainable development goals, there is massive retrenchment in our progress.  Goals 1 and 2, for example, are no poverty and zero hunger.  We have travelled so far back in such a short space of time.  This will also affect goal 5, gender equality, because as is always the case in conflict and crisis, women and girls disproportionately bear the brunt.  The chief executive of D&oacute;chas says 23 million people are at risk with crisis hunger levels in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, the area referred to as the Horn of Africa.  Jane-Ann McKenna said Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine has exacerbated the crisis in east Africa because it imports 90% of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia.  The UN tells us that one person is likely to die from hunger every 48 seconds in the region.  Around 5.7 million people are acutely malnourished, which has long-lasting developmental implications.  Some 350,000 children could die by the end of the summer.  These numbers are so big and so mind-boggling we become immune to them.  We do not hear them.  The situation was put to us in very real terms at the committee by Paul O&rsquo;Brien, who humanised it.  He said that in the Horn of Africa, there are parents making a decision about which of their children they are going to feed today.  As a parent, I found that extremely difficult to hear.<br/><br/>We have to accept that, as the UN foreign policy chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said, this is a real war crime.  Food generation is being weaponised, maybe not in Europe but further afield, just as energy is being weaponised here in Europe.  We have to take account of the fact that this is also a multiplying factor of climate change.  At least, climate change and this conflict are working together to produce a crisis of unprecedented proportions across the developing world.  We have to acknowledge that rich industrialised countries like ourselves have contributed about 95% of historical emissions, whereas Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, where this crisis is unfolding, produce less than one tenth of 1% of the global total.  I will read out a long quote from NPR's Africa correspondent Eyder Peralta.  It is important because it is first-hand testimony from where the crisis is at its worst.  He stated:</p><blockquote>	If you look at satellite data, this is the worst drought in 40 years.  But if you look at the 120 years of records kept by Ethiopia, this is the worst drought ever recorded.  Some places have already gone years without rain, and the U.N. is predicting that the next rainy season will also fail.  And so they're warning that if the world doesn't do more, we could be looking at a situation like the one in Somalia in 2011, when 260,000 people, most of them children, died of hunger...<br /><br />It's all about climate change.  Ten years ago, this was an area full of cows and green pasture.  People here are nomadic herders.  And now this place looks like a desert.  It's sand and rocks.  And in some places, the acacia trees, which are these thorny trees, have dropped all of their leaves.  The people we've talked to say that over the past seven years or so, they have slowly lost their livestock.  Some people who had hundreds of goats and cows say they've all died.  And as we've been driving, we've seen very few cows.  The ones that we have seen look skinny and sick.  And sometimes in the middle of these dusty fields, we've seen the carcasses of cows and sheep who just couldn't get enough to eat.<br /><br />We've been to small villages that are now totally abandoned.  People have been living without water for years, and now that their livestock are dead, they've been left with no choice but to go to the bigger towns to find a job or some help.  And the context is really important here.  Remember that livestock is the wealth and life in this region.  Many people don't farm, so the cows and goats and camels are the food.  So the animals represent not just their savings, but everything that was carefully built by their ancestors.  So when someone here tells you that they've lost all their animals, what they're telling you is that they have lost their home, their wealth and their livelihood, that they have lost everything. </blockquote> <p>What should we do about this, as a small actor on an international stage?  What should we be thinking about as we go out to the Council of Europe?  D&oacute;chas has told us we should be able to lead at international level, call for radical mobilisation of aid and use our voice at the table to demand action.  That is not just the table in Europe but also the UN Security Council.  We need to act now.  The crisis is unfolding before our eyes.  As we hold the pen on the conflict and hunger file at the UN Security Council, we should leverage that.  We should draw attention to it.  We should be making sure our response to the Ukraine crisis does not subsume all else and all our other ODA budgets.  Irish Aid has a proud track record but it is one built on consistency and long-term delivery.  We need to continue that consistency to build capacity within our partner countries so they become more resilient to shocks of this kind which, unfortunately, will become more common in the future.  We should be looking to promote the principle of loss and damage internationally ahead of COP27, which will take place on the continent of Africa.  We should be giving clear commitments and clear parameters on climate finance, because a just transition cannot be something we just talk about in Ireland for Irish citizens.  It has to go beyond our shores and must encompass everybody.<br/><br/>Regarding the World Food Programme and food supply chains, Germany and other countries are working on enabling grain export via land routes, or so-called solidarity lanes.  This needs to be discussed at the Council meeting.  It would release at least some of the crops that are sitting in silos in Ukraine, blockaded from its ports.  At home, we can vindicate the programme for Government commitment to commit 0.7% of our gross national income to ODA by 2030.<br/><br/>I may have strayed far beyond the shores of Europe but we are all connected.  Crisis and instability in one part of the world affects everywhere else.  We have seen this over and again.  The crisis of refugees in the Mediterranean is one clear example.  This is something I would like the Minister of State to bring to Europe, to make sure the eyes of Europe are not solely on itself but also on people within the developing world who are bearing the brunt of this crisis.</p></speech>

That delegation included representatives from six national fishing organisations and two co-ops, one based in Greencastle in north Donegal and the Galway and Aran co-op.  We had representatives from right around the coast.  It was a powerful delegation and they made the case for our fair share of the fish in Irish waters.  At that meeting, we also engaged with the director-general around what supports could be given to the industry to help it deal with the fuel crisis that is going on right now.  The fishermen we speak to all around the coast are struggling to go out to water with the increase in fuel costs and the impact that is having on them.  They are struggling to make a living as it is because we do not get a fair share of the fish in our waters and now they are struggling with the impact of Brexit due to the loss of even more fish and quota.  That is the context in which those fishermen come into this crisis.</p> <p> I am sorry to say to the Minister of State that even though in the likes of France and Spain there have been significant interventions to support the fishing industries there and considerable supports have been given to them, nothing additional has been given to our fishing community in Ireland.  There is the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, fund, which comprises money given to Ireland to compensate for the further decommissioning of our fleet.  We can park that money aside because it comes from the European Union to compensate our fishing communities for the loss of &euro;43 million every year, or &euro;250 million and even more when we add on the knock-on impacts.  The real issue is there has been no central Exchequer funding to support our fishing communities, who are on their knees all along the coast, while the French Government and the Spanish Government, and no doubt other governments if we check this further, have given significant supports.</p> <p> The director-general of the European Commission who deals with fisheries, Charlina Vitcheva, has reported that the Commission is waiting on Ireland&rsquo;s proposals.  Nothing has come from Ireland to support our fishing communities.  When the Taoiseach attends the Council meeting, will he put forward proposals to help our fishing communities cope with this crisis?</p></speech>

I am horrified that over the nine pages, there is not a single word about bringing the war to an end or about the way in which we have used our voice in Europe and on the UN Security Council.  What are we doing, as a proud, neutral country, to stop this horrific war?  I did not hear anything about that in his contribution.  I heard that we have time to look at new candidate countries to enlarge the EU and time to talk about different matters that arise at various other meetings, but no sense of urgency in respect of the absolutely illegal Ukrainian war perpetrated by Russia.  Up to 19 June, there had been 4,569 civilian deaths, of whom 304 were children, while a further 5,699 people had been reported as injured, with the real figure, of course, reaching much higher.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Taoiseach referred in his contribution to &ldquo;many predicting that the war in Ukraine may be long&rdquo;.  What is his opinion on that?  What are we saying as a country?  Are we saying it is okay to have a long war, with the devastating consequences of even just the figures I outlined, not to mention what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh referred to in the context of the consequences for other countries, not least those in Africa, and for the millions of people who are under threat of starvation at the moment?  At what stage will we take courage in our hands, recognise that as a small, neutral country we have a role in promoting peace and realise that the consequences of this war are far greater than those relating only to Ukraine or its neighbouring countries?  This has the most serious consequences for the world, including the prospects of a third world war and a catastrophe of climate change.  The Minister of State knows that, as does the Taoiseach, yet over nine pages, the latter&rsquo;s contribution did not even mention it.</p>  <p>  It did not address any of the hypocrisy in regard to how we treat some countries and some refugees completely differently from other countries and other refugees.  I acknowledge we have to react and I fully support the effort to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people who are here, but one must at some stage begin to look at the hypocrisy in our policy, which is determined by the bigger boys in Europe and not by our voice, a voice that should have a moral component given our experience and our history.  We are here today parsing a contribution that, conveniently, omitted any reference to what Ursula von der Leyen stated last week, namely, &ldquo;Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective.&rdquo;  Does that not encapsulate the emptiness of the language regarding what is happening?</p>  <p>  What does it mean to say Ukrainians are willing to die for the European perspective?  What does &ldquo;the European perspective&rdquo; mean?  We give additional money, and rightly so, in order that the International Criminal Court can function more effectively, but is that the sole purpose of the money we have given?  We have gone from giving a couple of hundred thousand euro, I understand, to giving a couple of million euro.  Is that to make that instrument more effective?  If so, I welcome that.  Is it to deal simply with Ukraine and with Russia&rsquo;s crimes against humanity or will we look at other countries that have already been referred to the International Criminal Court, such as Israel&rsquo;s behaviour and what it has done to Palestine?</p>  <p>  Where is the answer from Europe and where is this on the agenda in the context of the Amnesty International report that has been with the Government for months on end, which has described as apartheid the system operated by Israel when it comes to Gaza, Palestine and what is happening there?  Where is the reference to that?  How will we keep our integrity as a neutral country if we use our voice only with some conflicts and not with others?  Where is our voice on the deal being done with Israel for the importation of oil?  There is this misuse of language and a failure to deal with the catastrophic consequences of what we are allowing to happen, and all the while we talk about enlarging and expanding a European project without using our voice to say we should halt for a moment and should remind ourselves that the most important thing is to use every diplomatic sinew in our body to stop this war.</p></speech>

I might begin by addressing Deputy Connolly&rsquo;s concluding point.  She indicated we should stop what we are doing, but I am not sure whether she was suggesting we should stop the expansion of the European project.  I think that if she spoke to the citizens of Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova, whose very existence is currently threatened, she would find they certainly would not appreciate us calling for a stop.  In that regard, I welcome the fact those three countries have achieved candidate status for accession to the European Union.</p>  <p>  There has been considerable talk about the potential for or likelihood of global food shortages in the coming months and years because of the war, although I will not go into that given my party colleague Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh did so in great detail.  I support Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s call for the fast-tracking of a Magnitsky Bill, something that has been referred to in this House a number of times.  If we wish to get to the core of the Russian money that is financing the war, we should seek to fast-track that Bill.</p>  <p>  One item on the agenda of the European Council over the coming days will concern the outcome of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  In many respects, as I read through the 49 proposals and 48 recommendations in the document, I felt it was almost as though the Green Party had had a strong hand in writing it, given it goes very much into the core areas of food, transport and energy.  In many ways, what the Conference on the Future of Europe has come up with aligns closely with what the Government is trying to do and, indeed, what the Green Party has been expressing for a long time, notwithstanding that there are gaps and blind spots in this country.</p> <p>By reading the document, one can see where those are.  Proposal 1 refers to an objective to develop a climate-responsible agriculture system to safeguard the environment, biodiversity and ecosystems.  I wonder whether we are doing that, especially with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan, which is being proposed to the European Commission very shortly.  It does not seem to me that we are aligning with this particular objective.</p> <p> When I talk about agriculture, I talk about the carbon impact of agriculture.  One aspect of the proposals of the Conference on the Future of Europe is quite interesting.  There is a reference to animal welfare, which is something to which I have admittedly not paid much heed in the past.  I was on a ferry to France recently, and approximately 20 of the trucks on board were full of week-old calves.  While the trucks were shiny and well-maintained, one could not help but feel that the system whereby we have expanded dairy in this country in the past number of years in such a way that we have a huge number of male calves being produced cannot be seen as anything but mad.  We are sending these low-value animals over to Europe, often in deplorable conditions, and to North Africa, where their fate is even worse.</p></speech>

More urgent, however, is the issue with the French Navy and the fact that, as we speak, looking at data from maps, its ships are within the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ, at the moment.  Even though the French Navy has stated that it has moved its exercises out of the EEZ, all indications are that part of these exercises will overlap with a part of the Irish EEZ.  A number of weeks ago, we had discussions in the D&aacute;il about the Russian exercises that were due to take place off the south-west coast of Ireland.  The exercises being carried out by the French are no different from what the Russians were proposing to do.  In fact, it could be argued that the intensity and scale of the exercises being engaged in by the French is bigger.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will remember that we spoke about the impact that loud noise, acoustic activity and sonar activity have on marine wildlife, particularly cetaceans, during the debate to which I refer.  The French naval exercises, which are happening now and which will continue over the next few days, are occurring at one of the most well-known hotspots for whale and dolphin activity, namely, at the Porcupine Seabight and in and around the continental shelf.  This is a well-known hotspot for species like sperm whales and pilot whales.  These are deep-diving species that rely heavily on sonar and high-frequency clicks to hunt.  Any acoustic activity has a serious detrimental impact on that.  We saw where the British Navy had to concede that its activity off the west coast of Scotland and west coast of Ireland led to a mass stranding event involving whales and dolphins.  This is an issue.</p>  <p>  In the short term, we urgently need to reach out to those in the French Embassy to ask them to cease this activity or at the very least move the activity further out into deeper waters where we do not have the same frequency and number of cetaceans.  As a country and at European level, we need to have discussion about these military exercises.  They are proven and known to have an impact on sperm whales, pilot whales and other whale and dolphin species that are already under severe threat from other pressures.  That point needs to be made.</p>  <p>  It is not just wildlife that is impacted.  Obviously, the fishing sector will be affected as well.  Livelihoods are at risk because this high-volume acoustic activity is known to also displace fish stocks.  That will have a detrimental effect on marine wildlife but also on people who earn their livelihoods from fishing.  I will very briefly raise a final point similar to that on fishing.  We need to go back to Europe and ask for a derogation in respect of some type of potential help and support for the those in the Irish fishing sector regarding the costs relating to fishing and cost of diesel and how these are impacting on their livelihoods.</p></speech>

He is on the record on several occasions saying that he does not see what purpose is served by the ongoing pursuit of Mr. Assange and, most importantly, that enough is enough.  On Friday, in response to the British Home Secretary's decision to approve Mr. Assange's extradition, Australia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister also echoed Prime Minister Albanese's words.  Earlier that day, French MP, Mr. Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon, spoke out and said that if he had become Prime Minister, Mr. Assange would have been made a naturalised French citizen and requested he be sent to France.</p><p>Julian Assange's extradition would be a major blow to press freedom, freedom of speech and western liberal values.  This man suffered appalling treatment for three years in Belmarsh prison, which the UN described as torture.  Before that, he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy because he correctly believed the US was trying to seize him.  Not only was it planning this, it has been alleged that it had also considered assassinating him.  Earlier this month, the Spanish National High Court summoned President Trump's former Secretary of State to explain the alleged assassination plot.</p><p>It is time this man was set free and allowed to live in peace.  President Biden said something very important on World Press Freedom Day.  He sated that we must &quot;hold to account those that seek to silence voices essential to transparent, trustworthy, and responsive governance.&quot;  Nobody has done more to promote these values than Julian Assange.  He revealed major war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.  His organisation, WikiLeaks, published more than 90,000 US military documents relating to the Afghan war and almost 350,000 relating to the Iraq war.  Those two countries are still in a state of devastation following the wars in question.  Major news outlets like the <i>The Guardian</i>and <i>The New York Times</i>relied heavily on his work.  In 2011, <i>The Guardian </i>was awarded newspaper of the year at the press awards because of its partnership with WikiLeaks, which makes its relative silence on his ongoing persecution so disappointing.  The US has charged him with hacking Government computers and espionage because of his publishing activities.  He did not have computers or steal files, however.  These documents were leaked to WikiLeaks by Ms Chelsea Manning and other brave whistle-blowers.  Today, Chelsea Manning is a free woman.  It is well past the time that Julian Assange became a free man.</p></speech>

Prices are 40% above the EU average.  Part of that is down to the electricity prices we are paying, which are some of the highest in Europe.  A unit of electricity here costs 26% more than the EU average and the electricity companies - every single one of them - are making a killing in terms of bumper profits.  In other countries in Europe, governments have been forced, under pressure from below, to bring in windfall taxes on these super-profits.  We should do the same.  The 50% tax on these mega-profits would bring in &euro;300 million, which could be used to rapidly roll out attic insulation and retrofitting to help people cut energy usage and energy bills.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the issue of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver.  Last week, the EU and others blocked the calls for a meaningful TRIPS waiver to allow poorer countries to produce Covid-19 vaccines locally without paying massive money to the big pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>Shamefully, the Government and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, have backed this very bad deal.  Seven out of every eight people in low income countries are not fully vaccinated due to artificial scarcity caused by big pharmaceutical companies to protect their patents and profits.  The WTO ministerial conference deal pays lip service to the idea of a TRIPS waiver, but fails to deliver even a suspension of the patents.  As Oxfam says, it is a fudge aimed at saving reputations, not saving lives.  It is shameful, and the Government's support for it is a disgrace.  We should scrap the patents and speed up the global roll-out of vaccines to save lives and stop new variants.</p> <p> I also wish to raise the scandalous and illegal treatment of refugees by the Greek Government.  It is engaged consistently in what are illegal pushbacks of refugees who are fleeing from horrific situations, such as those coming from Syria.  The UN Special Rapporteur on migrants has described pushbacks at land and sea borders as having become "a de facto general policy".  In March, 30 Syrian asylum seekers, including two pregnant women and seven children, were confined on an islet in the Evros river for six days following an alleged pushback operation by the Greek authorities.  The police arrested them on the Greek shore of the river, detained them for a day and handed them over to hooded men who took them by boat to the islet.  Will the Irish Government support calls for an independent investigation and an end to these pushbacks?</p> <p> Finally, I will mention the refugee camps.  These camps, so-called migration centres funded by European money, are nothing short of prisons.  A new report has found that one in five people in the camps have been in de facto detention for two months.  The camps are exactly like a prison.  They are extremely isolated and kept away from centres where people could integrate and so forth.  There must be an end to the policy of fortress Europe.  We should be welcoming refugees.</p></speech>

It has to be made clear at the next European Council meeting that one cannot replace dependency on one rogue state with dependency on another rogue state, the other rogue state being apartheid Israel.  The Government is opposed to using gas from Russia because Russia annexes and occupies Ukrainian territory, but it wants us to replace it with gas from Israel, which annexes and occupies Palestinian territory.  Where is the consistency in this?  Again, Israel is getting a free hit.</p>  <p>  During her recent trip to Israel, Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU and Israel are bound to be friends and allies.  Israel is a state that operates a cruel system of apartheid that is completely at odds with the values of the European Union.  Israel should not be welcomed as a friend and ally.  We must ensure that the EU stands up for freedom and justice and does not cosy up to apartheid states such as Israel.  Ireland must lead the way on this.  It must let its voice be heard.  It must lean forward and take a risk.  This gas comes from an apartheid, terror state that steals Palestinian land and executes journalists, women and children with impunity.  That seems to be okay for this Irish Government.  It will condemn, but there will be no consequences.</p>  <p>  To follow up on the comments of my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, the British Government's decision to extradite Mr. Julian Assange to America to face the rest of his life in prison is disgraceful.  Julian Assange is being extradited to the US not because he committed a crime, but because he exposed a crime.  Nobody should be imprisoned for shining a light into dark corners.  Julian Assange should be freed, not thrown to the wolves, which is what is happening now.</p>  <p>  The Helms-Burton Act introduced by the United States has been causing hardship for Cubans for decades.  It has had a crippling effect on how Ireland and the EU support trade and solidarity with Cuba.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has spoken out on the Irish position on the US embargo of Cuba.  He said: "[Fundamentally,] Ireland believes that the [US] embargo [on Cuba] serves no constructive purpose and that its lifting would facilitate an opening of Cuba's economy, to the benefit of its people."  These are important words, and I commend the Minister on calling it out as it is.  However, we have to see continued pressure from the EU and the US to bring an easing and eventual end of this brutal embargo.  I commend the members of the Cuba Solidarity Forum Ireland, who have been securing medical supplies and personally transporting them to hospitals in Cuba.  In recent weeks, I read how the children's transplant waiting lists in Cuba were growing longer due to the Helms-Burton Act.  The tactic of the US is one of the most cruel and inhumane possible.  We must see an end to the blocking of sales of medical supplies from Ireland and EU member states to Cuba.</p></speech>

On Friday, it will be four months since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine so it is fitting and appropriate that the agenda of the EU summit is dominated by the Ukrainian crisis.  That is as it should be.</p>  <p>  First, I welcome that it now appears Ukraine and Moldova will officially be recognised as EU candidate countries once that is endorsed by the remaining member states.  That is a good thing.  Ireland, on balance, has benefitted enormously from our interaction with the European Union over the last 50 years, and the same opportunity should be extended to other countries as well.  It has been a long-standing ambition for both Moldova and Ukraine to join the European Union and this is a great opportunity for them to do so.  My big concern, of course, is that even if they get in, we are not sure how much of Moldova and Ukraine will be left after the Russian army is finished with them.  We must remember that were it not for the determination of the Ukrainian people and the arms sent to them by the international community, most likely all of Ukraine would now be in Russian hands.  I welcome that development and I look forward to an EU-wide endorsement of their candidacies thereafter.</p>  <p>  On that basis as well, I strongly welcome the fact that significant commitments will be made, according to the agenda, regarding further support for Ukraine.  It is very important that we do not have conflict fatigue regarding what is happening there.  Ukraine needs continued political support, economic support, military support and humanitarian support.  Having listened to the Taoiseach's comments earlier, I welcome the fact that Ireland's contribution to the European Peace Facility is being increased from &euro;33 million to &euro;44 million.  That is a good thing in light of the less than ideal circumstances in Ukraine at present.</p>  <p>  It is also appropriately on the agenda that we focus on the indirect consequences of the conflict in Ukraine.  There are three crises running hand-in-hand - the cost-of-living crisis, the energy crisis and the food crisis superimposed on that.  It is self-evident that the only way to tackle a cost-of-living crisis is to tackle the cost of living.  There has been a great deal of back and forth in the Chamber in the last few months about the cost of fuel.</p> <p>One side says the cost of fuel should be reduced while the other side says it is fixed at a European Union level and we cannot tamper with tax rates.  Surely it is just a political decision to fix the tax rates.  On that basis, it should be a political decision within the gift of politicians to change.  If it needs to be changed at a European Union level, there should be an opportunity to do so.</p> <p> We should also be able to reduce the cost of tolls in order to reduce the cost of living for heavily indebted commuters.  We know the energy crisis is going to get worse as the northern hemisphere winter approaches.  Putin knows that and it is part of his strategy.  He wants to put the maximum squeeze coming up to the northern hemisphere winter.  This is the longest day of the year, so every day between now and the year end it will get darker and colder.  It is very important from that perspective that we emphasise the need to find different sources of fossil fuels outside of Russia and also that we try to accelerate the use of renewables, especially solar panels, to diversify our energy sources.</p> <p> In terms of the global food crisis, we know that Putin is weaponising food.  We know that there are some 20 million tonnes of grain in silos in Ukraine, which it is trying to export but it cannot.  The European Union should do everything possible to facilitate the export of those food supplies by road, rail, air and even by sea.  The Black Sea is currently sealed off by the Russians, but it is part of international waters and I see no reason an international naval force cannot go in there and secure a corridor from Odessa to Istanbul and allow merchant vessels to pick up the grain and move it back to the rest of the global community that is desperately in need of food in the coming months.  I know there are risks associated with that, but there is a greater risk from doing nothing.  There is an opportunity here given that the Black Sea is part of international waters, and the international community would be well within its rights to open up a corridor from Odessa to Istanbul, provided the Turks are agreeable to that, and get the food flowing to where it is needed most in poorer parts of the world.</p> <p> We are all familiar with the fact that Russia threatened Lithuania in the past 24 hours because it sealed off its land border between Belarus and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.  That is completely unacceptable.  Ireland and the wider European Union should stand in solidarity with Lithuania as well.  There is only a very small population there and Russia can still supply its enclave of Kaliningrad by air and by sea, unlike Ukraine.  What Russia has done is completely unacceptable.  In summary, I welcome the proposed agenda.  I wish the diplomatic negotiating team well and I look forward to hearing of the decisions taken on its return.</p></speech>

There are only two points to which I would like to refer ahead of the European Council.  The first is in relation to Russia's ongoing brutal war in Ukraine and the very welcome news that the European Commission has recommended candidate status not just for Ukraine but also for Moldova and Georgia.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is currently in Georgia, having previously visited Moldova a number of weeks ago under its Chairman, Deputy Joe McHugh.  We must ask ourselves what candidate status, which the European Council will approve this week, entails.</p>  <p>  We are very good at showing demonstrable signs of solidarity, understandably, with the Ukrainian people.  Every night, the Houses of the Oireachtas are lit up brightly in the Ukrainian colours and we are flying their flag.  We have contributed to Red Cross fundraisers.  The European Union has responded with six packages of sanctions as well as providing financial and lethal aid.  Although I state my regret that Ireland is not part of the complete EU support for Ukraine, this is a situation where we need to be practical about who our allies are because, to be absolutely clear, Ukraine is fighting for all of Europe at the moment.  Unfortunately, there is a danger that too many people in the west are simply becoming tired of the war in Ukraine and they are not paying attention to the absolutely savage fighting and continuous atrocities that are still being committed by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine.  Kyiv may no longer be under siege but parts of Ukraine are going through nine rounds of hell at the moment.  We cannot take a backward step.  Therefore, I will go back to my point about the tangible impact of candidate status for Ukraine.  We know Ukraine's aspiration to join the EU is not a new step, and there have been roadblocks in the way in terms of the rule of law and governance issues but, crucially in terms of finances and also the important reconstruction of the country, what is being called at a European level a Marshall plan for Ukraine, is something on which we need to take action now rather than it being planned to happen in a couple of years' time.  As the Secretary General of NATO said this week, unfortunately, this war is going to be with us for quite some time.  If we look at the approximately &euro;36 billion of Russian assets that have been frozen by European Union member states, including just under &euro;1 billion in Ireland, these now need to be seized and ploughed back into Ukraine.  The ill-gotten bounty of Russian corruption and warmongering needs to be taken from the Russian leadership and the oligarchs and stooges who surround Putin who tried to hide their money around the world and ploughed back into rebuilding Ukraine's roads, schools, livelihoods and homes that are being robbed from the innocent Ukrainian people.</p>  <p>  We talk about the six rounds of sanctions.  Let us be frank: they are simply not enough.  If they were enough - at this stage we are more than 100 days since the outbreak of this latest iteration of the conflict - the Russian regime would be close to collapsing, but it is not because it has so many outs.  We can see how Russian oligarchs have been able to move their money away from London, Paris, Dublin, Brussels and wherever else, to other outposts of the world that are simply not taking the same approach to Vladimir Putin and his despotic regime's invasion of Ukraine that right-thinking countries in the EU, the UK, the United States, Japan, Australia, Norway and elsewhere are taking.  That is why it is absolutely crucial that, following the European Council, the European Union starts to apply pressure as a global leader.  The European Union is a global leader when it comes to the economy, democracy, values and socially, but one could ask what we are looking for from our partners.  The countries around the world which have very lucrative trade deals, partnerships and so much else with the European Union rely on this partnership in so many areas, yet they see no problem facilitating Vladimir Putin, his oligarchs and his regime's ability to get around European sanctions through their countries and banks.  That is something on which the EU must start to show its teeth.  We cannot simply rely on the United States to put in huge amounts of money if the EU, which has the power to do this, is not prepared to look at other countries, be it the United Arab Emirates, India and say their continuing ability to facilitate the Russian regime is simply not acceptable.</p>  <p>  One issue that should be on the European Council agenda, but will probably only be referred to in the margin notes, as opposed to as a stand-alone issue, is the fact that once again we see the British Government acting deplorably when it comes to its international commitments and agreements, signed not very long ago with the European Union.  The trade and co-operation agreement that is so important to Ireland economically in terms of ensuring that our exporters have continuing access to the UK, but equally that so many people can continue to bring in goods from the UK without the burden of tariffs or quotas, is under threat due to the United Kingdom's inability to meet its commitments in the protocol.  When I say "meet its commitments" I am not talking about the rigorous implementation trope that is thrown back at European and Irish leaders by certain unionist commentators, I am talking about the ability of the British Government to not just meet its commitments but to do so in terms of the engagement with the joint implementation committee of the withdrawal agreement.  The fact that the British Foreign Secretary has withdrawn from the implementation committee since 24 February tells a sorry tale.  The European Union, through Vice President &Scaron;efčovič, has presented a comprehensive set of proposals to address the accepted difficulties in the operation of the protocol but we have not seen anything in return from the British Government.  Rather than engaging in the process, we have seen the British Foreign Secretary putting her own political ambition first, upping stumps and simply disengaging from the process.  Again, rather than coming back with a comprehensive plan of acceptable solutions and an ability to work through the obvious problems identified by business leaders in Northern Ireland the British Government has simply put the wrecking ball through an international agreement.  It is the British Government's continuing recklessness that is causing instability in Northern Ireland.  The problem is not the protocol; it is Brexit.  We have a British Government that has decided the solution to all the problems it has created with its nonsensical Brexit is to act unilaterally and to threaten to break international law.</p> <p>It is using Northern Ireland as some sort of bargaining chip in the internal power play of Conservative Party politics and as a British Government distraction technique for the next time there is an awkward partygate scandal, or a fuss about rendition flights for refugees to Rwanda, appointments, potential by-election defeats, rail strikes and everything else.  It is such a retrograde step that, to be honest, after six years, I am sick of talking about Brexit.  We need to move on.  Europe and Ireland need to move on but, most important, the people of Northern Ireland need to be given the chance to move on and enjoy some element of stability this British Government is failing to deliver. </p></speech>

Will our Government protect the hard-won freedoms and sovereignty of our people and our foreparents?  Will it continue to hand away our freedoms to the EU and international globalists, namely, the World Economic Forum and the WHO?  That is the question I have for the Taoiseach, who would not even stay in the Chamber for the debate.  How can we as a nation protect our sovereignty and independence while, at the same time, we act as cheerleaders in the EU?  We are not neutral any more, as far as this war is concerned, or anything like it.  Members of the Government should not cod themselves by thinking we are.  It is as if they think we are a mighty power.  We are a small, independent state.  We should be treated like that and respected as a neutral country, as we always were.  We should not hand back the keys to our country to European globalists at every opportunity.  It is nothing short of disgraceful.</p>  <p>  Quite honestly, I get sick and tired of listening to Deputy Richmond every time he comes to the Chamber.  He is a great cheerleader for Europe.</p></speech>

The protection it offered to millions of refugees fleeing the war has made headlines all over the world.  Ireland has been very supportive of the refugees.  We have opened our doors to them and, if anything can be done in this country, we always wear our heart on our sleeve and we help everyone we can help.  However, how will Europe look on the Government for not protecting the people or their economy?  Will it ask questions about why Ireland did not avail of Europe's toolbox and ignored its recommendations on reducing VAT below 5%?  Ireland is 100% reliant on oil and gas with no alternatives.  The Government has single-handedly put Ireland at risk and has ignored concessions and recommendations from Europe.  They are the facts.</p>  <p>  Our first job in this country is to help and protect the people we asked to elect us to come to the House to protect each individual county.  That is what we are here to do.  We are the best in the world at helping everyone else but our Government has now shown it is the worst in the world for protecting our own.  Those are the facts and it is sad to see. </p></speech>

It is not serving the best needs of the people of Ireland who are suffering at present from the high cost of fuel.  If we have to suffer from the absence of fuel in future, maybe from September or October onwards, that will be devastating for people.  It is worrying for their safety and incomes.

He said:</p> <blockquote> 	Even when a country is at war, you don&rsquo;t suspend any of your prohibitions on equality.  [He added] Nigerian children wait weeks and months for documentation so they can attend school, whereas Ukrainian children get documentation promptly from [the] same institutions. </blockquote>  <p>In the short term, there are tens of millions of people who need protection.  Will the Taoiseach raise these concerns and statistics at the European Council summit?  Will he and other EU leaders continue to turn a blind eye to what is happening on the ground in places such as South Africa?  It is unfair to treat little children differently.  We should treat them the same.  I do not want to see a two-tier system for how we assist people who are seeking our help.  </p></speech>

I do not mean to be smart-alecky but there is increasingly a bit of a disconnect.  The Taoiseach is making statements that are very much in tune with what Dr. Ursula von der Leyen is saying but I wonder how in tune she is with the masses of Europe.  She comes from a particular background, as we all do, but the old aristocratic elite of Europe is reasserting itself.  We see the expansionist tendencies of that aristocratic elite also reasserting themselves.</p>  <p>  I will preface my comments by saying, because otherwise they will be intentionally or otherwise misinterpreted, I have the utmost sympathy for Ukraine as a state and the Ukrainian people.  I have nothing but condemnation for the Russian aggression that is taking place.  Nevertheless, it is taking place in response to a fear of EU and western expansionism and, in particular, a fear of western military expansionism around NATO.  Although the Taoiseach has stopped short of making pronouncements on that, he has called for the EU to agree to Ukraine becoming an accession country as quickly as possible.  Again, that plays to a particular elite in Europe and its expansionist ambitions, which have some part to play in the cause of this war.  That is no different than Russia's expansionist ambitions but at least it is not pretending.  It states it is not ashamed of what it has done.  Russia may have much to be ashamed about, but it says it is not.  At least, the fact it says it is not ashamed means there has been some minor degree of critical analysis on its part.  I do not see any critical analysis from the European elite as it continues to advocate for EU expansion.</p>  <p>  If we look at reports regarding countries that have not acceded to the EU, there are countries that have been accession countries for a long time, for example, Turkey.  There is not a whole lot of movement on that.  Serbia has accession status, as do Macedonia and Albania, but Bosnia and Herzegovina was refused that status a couple of years ago.  I had a very quick look at the reasons before coming to the Chamber.  One of them is the fight against corruption and organised crime in that country is hampered by a lack of harmonisation of legislation across the country.  That is a key concern for the European Union.  We should compare that to its treatment of Ukraine.</p> <p>According to Transparency International's 2021 corruption perceptions index, which is a scale of the least to most corrupt nations, Ukraine ranked 122nd out of 180, making it the second most corrupt country in Europe, with Russia being the most corrupt.  Moldova, which has something in common with Ukraine in the form of the threat on its eastern border around the Transnistria area, was ranked 105th, making it one of the most corrupt countries on the face of the planet.  Yet we want them to be made accession countries as fast as possible.  It is as if we learned no lessons from the difficulties with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in particular, where combating corruption and organised crime became more difficult after their accession.  Once they were granted accession status with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and so on, the political impetus became unstoppable.  Nothing was done to counter the corruption beforehand and it became very difficult to counter afterwards, yet we have not learned from that because we want to serve the expansionist ambition of a European elite.  Our Taoiseach is very much on that elite's coat-tails.  Sometimes, I listen to the man and wonder whether he has been promised a job.  What is the story?  He is saying everything and anything that comes from the technocratic and aristocratic elite in Brussels without any regard for its impact on his own State.<br/><br/>Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I have no problem with the fact that Ukrainian children are getting services in Ireland quickly.  However, I have a problem with the differentiation between peoples.  We need to learn.  We have a problem with the oligarchs in Russia, and rightly so, but what about the oligarchs in Ukraine?  According to <i>The</i><i>Washington Post</i>, which is a fairly reputable newspaper, &quot;Ukraine's oligarchs are united against Russia&quot;.  It then explains why: &quot;Ukrainian oligarchs engage in politics with one primary goal: defending their wealth and property.&quot;  Are we going to bring them into the EU?  Our Taoiseach wants us to.  I do not.</p></speech>

The agenda for this week's meeting of the European Council is being discussed by EU affairs ministers at the General Affairs Council meeting today, at which the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is representing Ireland.  Hence, the reason I am in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  The June European Council will return to economic issues.  As the House will be acutely aware, the international economic outlook is serious.  The uneven receding of the pandemic around the world has seen the emergence of inflationary pressures, a situation that has been exacerbated by the indefensible Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The economic impacts are significant, including a sharp rise in energy and commodity prices.  The most recent figures published on Friday show that euro area annual inflation was 8.1% in May and 8.8% across the EU.  The European Central Bank has indicated that interest rates will begin to rise in a graduated way from July.  While we do not know how matters will unfold in the global economy over the period ahead, clear risks are already apparent within the eurozone and across other developed economies.</p>  <p>  This week's meeting will generally endorse the country-specific recommendations for this year's European semester process.  The European semester is the annual cycle of economic and fiscal policy co-ordination among EU member states.  It brings together the different strands of the EU's economic governance framework, whereby member states co-ordinate their economic policies to support growth and jobs.</p>  <p>  In May, the European Commission published its analysis of relevant issues in each member state.  This analysis provides the analytical underpinning for country-specific recommendations.  The Commission's assessment is a broadly positive one, reflecting Ireland's strong economic performance prior to, and in the recovery phase from, Covid-19.  The report noted that Ireland was the only EU country to avoid recession during the pandemic and that our labour market had emerged from the pandemic fairly unscathed.  However, it also noted that challenges remained.</p>  <p>  We are broadly happy with the four country-specific recommendations being agreed for Ireland this year.  They are consistent with national policy orientations that have been firmly established already.  The specific recommendations for Ireland cover, in broad terms, fiscal policy and investment; implementation of our national recovery and resilience plan; the circular economy; and reducing reliance on fossil fuels and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy.  These were discussed by ministers at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 16 June, insofar as employment and social policies were concerned, and at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 17 June, insofar as macroeconomic and structural policies were concerned.  Approval is expected at General Affairs Council meeting today of the integrated country-specific recommendations for transmission to this week's European Council.  More generally, the House will recall that the Government welcomed the spring package when it was produced by the Commission on 23 May.</p>  <p>  It is good to see the return of country reports and country-specific recommendations this year.  These are key aspects of the European semester process and help to drive progress on structural reforms.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the European Commission for its useful analysis in the country report for Ireland.  It is undoubtedly an important input into our national dialogue, including yesterday's national economic dialogue in Dublin Castle.  I particularly welcome the focus on energy policy and realising the potential of our vast renewable resources, which is in line with our national policy objectives.</p>  <p>  I expect that this week's European Council will welcome the fulfilment by Croatia of all of the convergence criteria as set out in the treaty and endorse the Commission's proposal that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023, as recommended by finance ministers last week.  As the House is aware, Ireland marks 20 years of using the euro this year.  Croatia's adoption of it will be a further significant milestone in the history and evolution of the single currency area.  Croatia will be the 20th EU member state to adopt the euro as its currency.  It follows Lithuania, which joined the euro as its 19th member state in 2015.  It is only within the last three decades that Croatia was embroiled in a terrible war.  The fact that it is now set to join the single currency is positive for both the people of Croatia and the entire EU.  It has our best wishes as it advances its preparations for the changeover from the kuna in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  EU leaders will meet in euro summit format on Friday, 24 June.  This will provide them with an opportunity to hear directly from the president of the European Central Bank, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the president of the Eurogroup, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on the latest assessment of the economic outlook.  Last week, the Eurogroup issued a statement on the future of the banking union, with an agreed focus in the near term on strengthening the common framework for bank crisis management and national deposit guarantee schemes.  The EU framework has been significantly reinforced over the past decade and the European Commission has been invited to make legislative proposals as a further step in strengthening the banking union.</p>  <p>  The Conference on the Future of Europe has been an unprecedented experience of transnational deliberative or participative democracy, with many worthwhile recommendations emerging from the process.  Steered by three co-chairs representing the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, it has been driven by an executive board consisting of an equal representation of the three institutions as well as observers from key stakeholders.  Citizen engagement was supported by an innovative multilingual digital platform, where any European could share ideas, and by national and European citizens' panels.  I was pleased that one of the four Europe-wide citizens' panels met in Dublin in February to finalise its input.</p>  <p>  Inclusivity and listening to all perspectives was the core philosophy of Ireland's domestic engagement in the conference.  This was led by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, who worked closely with European Movement Ireland on Ireland's national programme.  This included a number of sectoral and regional events and events with Irish people living in the EU.  The Minister of State also held a series of consultations with young people, the LGBTQI community, new Irish or migrant communities, Travellers, islanders, Gaeltacht communities and community groups.</p>  <p>  During the closing ceremony in Strasbourg on 9 May, President Emmanuel Macron, on behalf of the Council Presidency, the President of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, received the final report, which contained 49 proposals and more than 320 specific associated measures.</p> <p>The proposals reflect nine broad topics, including a stronger economy, social justice and jobs, education, culture, youth and sport, digital transformation, European democracy, values and rights, rule of law, security, climate change, environment, health EU in the world; and migration.  Each of the recommendations is presented in the final 336-page report, which also aims to provide an overview of the various activities undertaken in the context of the unique process that the Conference on the Future of Europe has been.  Ministers will have a further political exchange on the conference at today's General Affairs Council and I expect that this will include ensuring high priority to showing citizens that the EU institutions are listening to them and will follow up on their recommendations.  EU leaders are expected to take note of the proposals set out in the final report of the conference at this week's European Council meeting.  This will include inviting effective follow-up by the three institutions, namely, the Council, the Commission and the Parliament, each within their own sphere of competence and in accordance with the treaties, and ensuring high levels of transparency for Europe's citizens.</p> <p> We welcome the assessment carried out by the Council secretariat and the Commission, which showed that a large proportion of the recommendations can be implemented within the current treaty framework or through new or amended EU legislation.  Other specific measures would require treaty change to be fully implemented, including issues relating to the balance of competence in fields such as health and education; broadening the use of qualified majority voting; and treaty-based institutional matters.  It is clear that the recommendations of the conference therefore include suggestions that can be implemented quite quickly, as well as some that are more ambitious and wide-ranging.</p> <p> As we embark on more detailed consideration of the recommendations, our guiding principle should be the question of how we can best prepare our Union to continue to meet the needs of its citizens into the future.  This includes respecting important principles such as subsidiarity, while protecting and strengthening the commitment to our shared values.  Ireland is ready for this debate.  We will work to constructively shape our new future and are open to considering treaty change if this proves necessary.  We should first, however, do what we can within the existing framework.  Our focus for now will remain on the most immediately realisable actions that can clearly respond to the expectations of our citizens for better engagement on decisions directly impacting on their daily lives.  I look forward to further discussion of the outcome of the conference over the period ahead.  I wish to thank Members again for their active participation in this debate.  The Taoiseach will report to the House following this week's European Council.</p></speech>

Today, the Government approved my request to seek the House's approval to opt in to this European Commission proposal for a directive combating violence against women and domestic violence.  Commission President von der Leyen's political guidelines highlighted the need to prevent and combat violence against women, to protect victims and to punish offenders as a key priority for the Commission.  The European Parliament has also repeatedly called on the Commission to propose legislation on violence against women, domestic violence and gender-based cyberviolence.</p>  <p>  Violence against women is gender-based violence directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately.  It includes all acts of gender-based violence that result in or are likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering.  Domestic violence is a form of violence against women, as it disproportionately affects women.  It occurs in the family or domestic unit irrespective of biological or legal family ties, either between intimate partners or between other family members, including between parents and children.  Women are disproportionately represented as victims due to the underlying patterns of coercion, power and control, or all of these, with such violence being a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women.  It was fitting, then, that this proposal was published on 8 March this year, which was International Women's Day.</p>  <p>  The proposal aims to make the current EU legal instruments relevant to combating violence against women and domestic violence more effective by filling identified gaps in protection, access to justice and support for victims of these heinous crimes.  It also seeks to align EU law with established international standards, most obviously the Istanbul Convention, which is widely recognised as the most far-reaching legal instrument to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence.  While Ireland ratified the convention in 2019, the current EU proposal aims to ensure the application of minimum standards in all EU member states, including those that have not yet ratified it, and those that are considering withdrawing.  Currently, no specific EU legislation comprehensively addresses violence against women and domestic violence.  This directive will be the first act specifically addressing this type of violence.</p>  <p>  All member states address violence against women and domestic violence in legislation and policies, albeit to different degrees.  The different approaches can create legal uncertainty about rights for such victims across the Union.  While the EU already supports member states in addressing this kind of violence by using funding, policy measures and relevant horizontal legal instruments, further targeted legislative action at EU level is necessary to make the existing measures more effective and to further strengthen EU instruments to combat violence against women and domestic violence by laying down minimum rules.  For the member states that are parties to the Istanbul Convention, which Ireland is, the EU measures would support the convention&rsquo;s implementation.  The current proposal would enable further co-ordinated measures across the EU and enable EU-level enforcement.  With the proposal, the Commission aims to strike the balance between ensuring that the obligations it lays down are effective and leaving flexibility for the member states to take into account national specificities and needs when implementing its rules.</p>  <p>  In January, this House debated a motion on violence against women, where it was recognised by all Deputies that we need to do more.  However, shifts in long-held mindsets and changes in behaviours do not occur over weeks, or even months, and we need to continue to work as hard as possible to see real changes happen.  Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms is a priority for this Government.  It is also a personal priority for me and as Deputies will know, I have been working for the past 18 months on the goals and desired outcomes of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which I will bring to Government in the coming weeks.  I know the House is as committed as I am to achieving our goal of a society where there is zero tolerance for all forms of violence against women and the strategy will be the most ambitious one to date.  Realising this goal requires a range of actions and a collective effort.  In tandem with the strategy, we must also be part of a collective effort at an EU level.  I do not need to remind anyone of how often the issue of violence against women comes to the fore.  There have been too many tragic cases and too many times when we have we called for more to be done.  I have met many victims and their families, and the level of trauma and pain they have experienced cannot be described.</p>  <p>  Violence against women and domestic violence are pervasive throughout the EU and are estimated to affect one in three women, with one in five women having suffered domestic violence.  Looking at the more specific types of violence, the Fundamental Rights Agency&rsquo;s 2014 EU-wide survey on violence against women outlines that one in ten women reported that they had been victims of sexual violence, and that one in 20 had been raped, which are extraordinary figures.  Cyberviolence is just as prevalent.  In 2020, it was estimated that one in two young women experienced gender-based cyberviolence.  It is well established that women in general more frequently experience cyberviolence based on their sex or gender, in particular sexual forms of cyberviolence.  Cyberviolence particularly impacts women who are active in public life, as Deputies in this House can probably attest to.  This can have the effect of silencing women, hindering their societal participation and undermining the principle of democracy as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that many of the measures proposed in this directive are already part of Irish law, such as: the offence of rape based on consent; the criminalisation of female genital mutilation; and the criminalisation of certain forms of cyberviolence.  The directive also calls for preventative measures, including by raising awareness and by training professionals who are likely to come in contact with victims.  My Department regularly runs awareness campaigns in this space, including the Still Here campaign, which we ran during Covid restrictions, and which garnered positive feedback.  The training of professionals is also a big aspect of my Supporting A Victim's Journey plan, so again, what is being proposed is not new for Ireland and we welcome it.</p>  <p>  The directive is comprehensive and as such there are some measures required that may require a tweak to existing law and practice, and some are more targeted at civil law countries which will need to be fully explored.  Since the UK's departure from the EU, Ireland is the sole country with the Protocol No. 21 article, in other words, where we have to opt in as such.</p> <p>It is essential we utilise this at an early stage to ensure we can participate in the discussions and that the final text of the directive takes account of our unique position as much as possible and is shaped to accommodate our common law system as much as possible.</p> <p> There is a strong reputational aspect to be considered for opting in to this directive.  Along with publication of the third national strategy in the coming week, under Ireland's presidency of the Council of Europe I will host a conference of Council of Europe justice ministers on the topic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence this September.  Given the crossover of timelines between this opt-in and the new strategy, and the significant public attention on this issue in recent months, promoting work on this issue domestically but not agreeing to a common approach at EU level may appear contradictory to our EU partners, particularly at a time when solidarity is more important than ever.  We should demonstrate to the EU how we are serious about tackling violence against women and domestic violence, and utilise our Protocol No. 21 opt-in to participate in this measure.  I commend the motion to the House.  </p></speech>

It is our hope that the proposal complements and will reinforce the State obligations under the Istanbul Convention, rather than acting as a substitute for them or duplicating them.</p><p>I pay tribute to Catherine Casey and the work carried out in the Adapt centre in Tralee, which provides a 24-hour service by telephone, involving well-being, domestic violence advocacy and a complete wrap-around service.  There were 90 admissions in 2021 but only 30 to 32 bed spaces.  County Kerry should be prioritised in any accommodation review that takes place.</p><p>Although the State has ratified the Istanbul Convention, there is a decent argument that we do not live up to much of it.  Domestic violence shelter provision is perhaps the most glaring example, though I commend the Minister's personal passion for this type of activity and hope it continues into the future.  She informed the justice committee not long ago that the Department would be examining the establishment of services directly, which will address the dearth of places around the country.  Direct involvement by the Department would be most welcome, rather than outsourcing to anybody else.</p><p>The proposal at least sets out minimum standards regarding certain offences, although crimes against women are not crimes as set out within the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Strictly an approach of criminalisation will not work and provision of shelters will be key.  More broadly, access to decent employment, social protection payments, housing, childcare and wrap-around services, as evidenced by Catherine Casey and her team in Tralee, all help.  When women can access the resources, they are less dependent on abusive partners, so the Government's responsibilities in those areas are crucial for vulnerable populations and people such as abuse victims.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 was crucial in this respect and prompted the Government to move its own legislation in the area.  The Bill enjoys broad support across parties and in the NGO sector.  Women's rights are workers' rights and <i>vice versa.  </i>In addition to domestic violence leave, progress should be made on a child maintenance agency, which would speed up the payment of maintenance, reducing poverty and vulnerability among single parents who have experienced an abusive partner.  Some colleagues of mine have made proposals in this area and the Government's own plans seem slow to come forward.</p><p>Another area I am glad to see being addressed is the collection of data on violence against women.  We just spoke on this in the justice committee.  The collection of data in relation to sexual offences and violence is most important.  That should be moved on and improved.  The deficit in that is pronounced across the EU but is especially troubling in Ireland.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100033#HH00400"><p>Today is the longest day of the year but every day must feel like the longest day of the year for women and their children enduring domestic violence.  Men are victims too and often have a great reticence about coming forward because of the stigma around that but the fact remains it is mainly women who are the victims of domestic violence.  There is the thump because he was in trouble at work, the dig because she spoke to her mam or sister or the slap or pull simply because he can and the children hiding behind the sofa, under the table or in the wardrobe wondering if it is their fault that Daddy is so cross with Mammy.  Maybe they could have behaved a bit better.  Their poor mother is thinking at the same time, "Well, at least when he's walloping me, he's leaving them alone".</p>  <p>  Teach Tearmainn is a refuge in my country of Kildare and it gives a first-class service to women at the receiving end of violence in the home.  However, it needs more space, investment and staff.  It has four apartments and they are gorgeous.  I was at their opening but four is not enough.  Three of the counties surrounding Kildare, namely, Laois, Offaly and Carlow, have no refuges.  As well as taking an overflow of women fleeing from Dublin, Teach Tearmainn is also taking women and their families from these counties.  Transitional housing is needed and with the housing situation being so bad, it affects refuges across the State.  Women and their children have nowhere to go and some have sadly decided to return to an abusive partner because at least then their children have a home.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister on the way over with the help of the app, and she mentioned the Supporting a Victim's Journey plan.  It needs to look at transitional housing as well because, with the disaster that is our housing system, there is a shortage of houses to rent.  It is inexplicable that a Government that says it is committed to protecting women and children has no dedicated capital expenditure budget line in any Department for domestic violence safe accommodation provision.  It is extraordinary that the Minister for housing has decided the primary responsibility rests with Tusla.  That does not make sense, though, to be fair to Tulsa, it has advised that at least 60 new family units are urgently needed.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has stated that the State is meeting its obligations under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation with wrap-around services, such as psychological care and childcare.  I hope the Minister will agree with me that there is something of a Disney quality to that statement and a sense that if we say it, maybe it will happen.  We know to our cost in housing and health that this is not the way it goes.  Women and their children should not have to put up with this.  I acknowledge that the Minister has been positive in respect of this issue and has demonstrated and expressed that she wants to improve these things.  I welcome that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100033#HH00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a directive to combat violence against women and domestic violence.  It is important that progress is continually made in responding to violence against women but it is also important to ensure we have a range of supports for victims that are comprehensive and accessible.  The key elements of the proposal include: first, the criminalisation of rape, female genital mutilation and cyberviolence; second, safe reporting and risk-assessment procedures; third, respect for victims' privacy in judicial proceedings and right to compensation; fourth, support for victims; and, last, better co-ordination and co-operation.  These are minimum standards and their importance cannot be overemphasised but minimum standards should not be exhaustive.  We should aspire to greater standards for prevention policy, supports and care.</p>  <p>  We need to know if the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will include a timeframe and budget for the urgent delivery of additional family refuge places and wrap-around services such as psychological supports and childcare.  The ability of people to plead domestic violence can be made more difficult by difficulties accessing emergency housing due to the shortage in housing supply.  The Minister for housing said the primary purpose of homeless current expenditure is for councillors to provide accommodation for those unable to provide it from their own resources, not specifically to provide for victims of domestic abuse or violence.  Neither is there a dedicated capital expenditure budget line in any Department for domestic violence safe accommodation provision.  Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation for victims of gender-based and domestic violence, is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is the current position of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the primary responsibility for the provision of refuge capacity is with Tusla.  Such an overlap in terms of departmental responsibility hampers our ability to meet demand and people who are fleeing domestic violence pay the price.</p> <p>While the capital assistance scheme is available to local authorities and approved housing bodies for refuges, the Department is one step removed from being proactive in this regard.  This distance between the Department and people's needs is reflected in the acknowledgement by the Minister for Justice that Ireland is not meeting its obligation under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation with wraparound supports such as psychological care and childcare.  On top of that, earlier this year, we learned how Cuan Saor had been operating at full capacity since the pandemic began, resulting in the centre being unable to meet demand.  What can we expect of the third national strategy as regards refuge spaces?  Will a budget be provided so that our ability to meet the immediate needs of victims of gender-based and domestic violence is not dependent on fundraising at a time of rapidly increasing inflation?</p></speech>

As we know, it has now been just over three months since the Commission published the proposal for a directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence.  That was on International Women's Day and, of course, it is now midsummer.  It is very welcome to see this proposal.  Preparations have been extensive and have included stakeholder consultation and a detailed impact assessment report.  The purpose of the initiative to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence is to combat sexual, domestic and gender-based violence, to ensure the effective prevention of such violence and to ensure that sexual harassment and cyberviolence with cross-border dimensions are addressed effectively.</p>  <p>  What is most remarkable is that, as the Minister has said herself, there is no EU legislation that comprehensively addresses gender-based violence and domestic violence and that this directive will be the first to address specifically this type of violence.  It is remarkable that is still the case in 2022.  I suppose it reflects the reality that, for a long time, domestic violence was not taken as seriously as other forms of violence within the criminal justice system not just in Ireland but elsewhere.  Many of us who have practised criminal law over the years will recall phrases like "It was just a domestic" being used to belittle or diminish the significance of the harm caused.  I have worked for years with Women's Aid, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Safe Ireland and other great organisations on the front line that are providing services for survivors and victims.  When speaking with survivors and victims, it is evident that, for far too long, there has been a culture in which violence against women and children in the home has been essentially tolerated and certainly not tackled with the urgency required.</p>  <p>  In recent years, with the #MeToo movement and the move against sexual harassment with the horrific murder of Ashling Murphy and the outcry around the country earlier this year, we have seen an understanding and a renewed intent to ensure that this sort of violence will be addressed effectively.  Measures have been taken.  I am thinking of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  These were major reforming legislation.  We also passed legislation to criminalise female genital mutilation on foot of a Private Member's Bill I brought forward.  All of these things were done in the last few years and have greatly improved the position of survivors.  I am proud to be the chairperson of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I am grateful to the Minister for her engagement with the committee, particularly on recommendations 37 to 41 of the Citizens' Assembly, which seek to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The assembly recommended that, among other things, all Government action to prevent such violence should be co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for a national strategy.  It is therefore very welcome indeed that the Minister has taken that on and is that Cabinet Minister.</p>  <p>  Of course, we are very anxious to see the publication of the imminent third national strategy, which has been promised for some months.  We had hoped it would be with our committee in March or April so that we would be able to review it.  We certainly hope it will be published imminently.  The Minister might be able to say precisely when because, clearly, it is crucial if we are to build on the other improvements and measures.  I acknowledge the welcome that stakeholders have given to Supporting A Victim's Journey and to other initiatives like the Still Here campaign the Minister referenced.  However, we need to see the publication of that strategy and the resourcing and funding of refuges.  All of us are very conscious that there are nine counties in Ireland where there is no refuge.  Everywhere in the country I have been in recent months, I have heard about the scarcity of places and resources for those seeking to flee violence in the home.</p>  <p>  The other question we all have to ask in a debate like this is a more fundamental question about tackling a culture in which it is still the women and children who typically have to flee the home while the perpetrators of so-called domestic violence remain there.  I recall a justice committee hearing on domestic violence many years ago where a survivor disclosed the abuse he had suffered as a child and asked in anguish why it was that women and children were still forced to flee and why we could not see the perpetrator removed from the home.  That would require a fundamental shift in culture but it is necessary.</p>  <p>  We met today with an Australian Labor adviser, Stephen Donnelly.  He told us about the emphasis Labor in the state of Victoria puts on violence in the home.  They call it family violence rather than domestic violence to emphasise the more human side of it and that this is violence of the most intimate nature perpetrated within the home and usually within the family.  The key message Labor had to tackle this was that, if this sort of violence was perpetrated against women and children by strange men, there would be an urgent, immediate and effective set of measures implemented to tackle it and stop it happening.  The Minister spoke about zero tolerance.  I entirely agree with her.  We must bring a zero-tolerance approach to bear and see this as the deeply harmful and deeply destructive behaviour that it is.  We must move swiftly to see the publication of the national strategy and measures taken to address this horrific sort of violence against women and children.</p></speech>

It outlines key principles around support for victims and survivors, better co-ordination in State services, safe reporting and respect for victims' privacy in judicial proceedings.  All of these have to form the basis of a State architecture that is designed to respond to the needs of women, children and men affected by domestic violence.  However, I am regrettably sceptical that the directive will have any practical impact.  There are large gaps between our international commitments and our policies in this area.  For example, as we all know at this point, the Istanbul Convention standard is one refuge space for every 10,000 people while Ireland provides one space for every 10,000 women, leaving us with 50% of the recommended capacity and very little infrastructure for male victims.  The need for more domestic violence refuge spaces is abundantly clear but, instead of ensuring we meet the international benchmark, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth refer to a clause in the convention that allows fewer refuge spaces.  The Minister will, therefore, forgive me if I am cynical about the difference this directive will make.</p>  <p>  If we want to make real and sustained progress, we must be guided by the work of support and advocacy organisations.  Women's Aid, Safe Ireland and many smaller organisations such as YANA in north Cork are at the coalface of this very complex issue.  They are the experts and we need to listen to them.  The Government has to provide the resources and adopt the policies these organisations are seeking.  They have concrete proposals that will make a significant difference to the lives of vulnerable women and children.</p>  <p>  The West Cork Women Against Violence Project recently launched its report, Listen to me. Support me. Believe me. Help me: Listening to Survivors of Sexual Violence and their Supporters in West Cork.  This report includes recommendations based on the lived experience of survivors and their supporters.  The report highlights the importance of a comprehensive, intersectional and accessible support service in west Cork and has lessons for all other rural areas that lack specialist supports.  It recommends training on trauma-informed approaches and survivor-focused procedures for front-line staff, management and other professionals.  This obviously includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the Judiciary, but also GPs and staff in local authorities and social protection offices.  All officials with whom victims and survivors have to interact need suitable training.  The report also calls for a relationships and sexuality education and awareness campaign.  Current relationships and sexuality education is completely inadequate and inconsistent and features antiquated opt-outs for parents and schools.  Moreover, it is unclear how committed the Minister for Education is to reform in this area.</p>  <p>  In November, the Government passed but delayed the progress of a Social Democrats Bill guaranteeing comprehensive and evidence-based relationships and sexuality education.  At that time, I urged the Government to allow the Bill to go forward.</p> <p>In January, I repeated my call.  Five months later, I am calling for it again.  We need proper sex education that will contribute to a culture of change in how women and girls are viewed and treated.</p> <p> The report recommends resourcing appropriate community-based prevention and early intervention.  This is about a whole-of-government approach and providing support at the point of need.  State services need to be available locally and need to work with community organisations.  Through the leadership of organisations such as West Cork Women Against Violence and You Are Not Alone, YANA, this is happening in Cork.  However, all stakeholders need capacity to deliver comprehensive and interlinked structures.</p> <p> GP practices are often the place where women go for assistance.  However, these practices are overstretched as it is and out-of-hours cover is a problem in rural areas.  Family resource centres are an invaluable asset for all in the community, but especially for those fleeing domestic violence.  They are hubs for a variety of services and are vital to reaching those vulnerable groups.  The support and funding they received from the Government in no way reflects their local importance.</p> <p> Currently, both Bandon and Skibbereen family resource centres in my constituency are in search of a permanent home.  One of them has moved seven times in the last few years, which uproots all the services they provide to people who are really desperate and particularly women fleeing domestic violence.  I am working with them to find solutions but it should not be this way.  The Government needs to recognise their value and fund them accordingly.</p> <p> The directive on combating violence against women in domestic violence is only as good as the policies and the resources deployed.  If the cost-of-living crisis and housing crises get worse, the risk of increased domestic violence rises.  Support services have outlined the solutions; it is now up to Government to implement them.</p></speech>

Such violence is a manifestation of historically unequal power relationships between men and women.  We should bear that in mind every time we look at this subject because there are so many aspects of trying to address that problem in the sort of society that has grown up over hundreds of years of relying on women to reproduce the next generation at no cost, to do the care in the home at no cost and to devalue and undermine the role that women play in society in general.  It is a legacy issue but it is one we can address with a lot of action.</p>  <p>  For most people, it is disappointing that despite signing the Istanbul Convention in 2015 and ratifying it in 2019 when Deputy Flanagan was Minister, in 2022 we are still way behind in facilitating the spaces and supports required for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence.</p>  <p>  I want to give a shout out in a proud way to two areas.  One is Carlow, where our local councillor, Adrienne Wallace, has been doing wonderful campaigning work.  Carlow is one of the nine counties that has no refuge.  According to Councillor Wallace's figures, in the first nine months of 2021 it was revealed that 500 incidents of domestic violence were reported to the Garda in Carlow and Kilkenny.  While there is a refuge in Kilkenny, it is totally inadequate as we can see from those figures.  That can be repeated throughout the country.  Based on the 2015 Istanbul Convention, we should have 472 refuge places but we only have 143.</p>  <p>  There is an urgency in dealing with issues in the courts, such as the victim-blaming experiences that women have, being asked about their sexual histories, how much they had to drink, etc..  Even their private counselling notes are being used in cases.  Therapy notes are not allowed to be used in the context of prosecutions relating to any other crime.</p>  <p>  There is the outstanding issue other Deputies have mentioned, namely, the need for a proper, non-ethos-based sex education system.  In the previous D&aacute;il, we tabled a Bill on this matter.  I believe other Bills are still waiting to be dealt with.  It would be great if this initiative came from the Government, but we cannot afford to wait for it.</p>  <p>  There is the important practical issue of having a safe home to live in.  One of our councillors in Dublin City Council ,Hazel de Nort&uacute;in, has advised that in Ballyfermot alone, dozens of houses have been abandoned by women and children, particularly during the Covid crisis, because they had to get out.  Some 70% of those women and children are in homeless services.  The same is true across the country.  We need to strengthen the legislation for local authorities to be able to intervene and decide that a family home is a family home and no abuser within that home should be allowed to stay but the family itself should stay.  We need to do a considerable amount to raise awareness on this issue.  We need supports that are localised.  Local authorities should have liaison officers.  In Dublin City Council we are trying to get a liaison officer who actually knows the families, deals with them and ensures that they have the wraparound services.</p>  <p>  I want to finish on an issue I raised with the Taoiseach some time ago.  Poland has very severe legislation that refuses abortion on the grounds of rape until a person goes to court and proves that they had actually been raped.  That is impacting on hundreds of women who fled the war in Ukraine, who were raped and who are now living in Poland but cannot procure abortions.  A Bill will be debated before the Polish Parliament today and on Thursday.  On Thursday at 1 o'clock, we, the National Women's Council of Ireland, a number of feminist groups and others will be protesting outside the consular section of the Polish Embassy on Eden Quay.  We are asking people to support that protest.  The protest is against what the Polish Government is doing.  The EU and justice ministers, including the Minister, Deputy McEntee, need to shout out about this.  It is a war crime to rape a woman.  There is no way they can prove that they were raped by Russian soldiers and, hence, there is no way they can procure abortions.  This points to hypocrisy within the EU.  This is happening under our noses as a consequence of a war crime.  We should be shouting about it and really putting pressure on the various states to ensure that practice is ceased.  Women should have proper access to reproductive care, but particularly in the case of the war crime of rape.</p>  <p>  I welcome that this proposed directive is trying to strengthen the Istanbul Convention, which indicates that there have been weaknesses in how it has been implemented across the EU.</p></speech>

I support it for number of reasons.  It modernises our procedures and, as the Minister said, standardises them to a minimum standard, at least, across the European Union.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on three areas.  It is good that there is an emphasis on cyberspace.  People need to realise that these types of crime do not just occur in the real world but can also occur in the virtual world.  There is an emphasis on cyberstalking, cyberharassment, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and also incitement to hatred and violence in cyberspace.  It is good that it is codified and standardised across the European Union.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the directive places emphasis on safe reporting and risk-assessment procedures.  All Deputies recognise that this type of crime lends itself to under-reporting.  There is emphasis on improved and increased pathways so that a female victim can report this type of crime and can do so in a child-friendly, accessible manner, especially online.  That is a good way because sometimes female victims might not be able to leave the house without exposing themselves to further danger.</p>  <p>  Healthcare workers are no longer bound exclusively by the right of confidentiality.  If a healthcare worker comes across a situation where they believe there are reasonable grounds to believe that a female victim is likely to sustain further or physical abuse, they can report it to the appropriate authorities as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  There is provision here that full compensation is payable to a female victim even during criminal court proceedings.  It is good that female victims can claim damages and can claim back their healthcare costs.  They can claim damages for physical or psychological harm or even for loss of income.  That is a definite step forward.</p>  <p>  I welcome the motion, but I echo the comments of other Deputies to the effect that prevention is better than cure.  These are all punishments and sanctions, and rightly so.  However, the emphasis should be on the education aspect which is so important and should start as early as possible with a change of culture and a change of behaviour.  I welcome the directive and look forward to its swift implementation.</p></speech>

Domestic violence should be fought at every level.  We must ensure we make a home a happy and safe place for everybody.</p>  <p>  In saying that, I must talk about the services we have in County Kerry.  We are grateful for the resources we have but we will always be seeking more.  I am speaking of services such as the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre.  I compliment Ms Vera O'Leary from that centre and the excellent people who have worked with her over the years and who work with her now.  I sincerely thank Ms Catherine Casey from the Adapt service which is much needed.  I hate the fact that the service is much needed.  We need more resources that will act in a complete and encompassing way and a wraparound service, working in conjunction with the people in housing.  We need sheltered housing provisions to be put in place because we must ensure that people are safe at all times.  Of course, people should not have to leave their homes.  One's home should be a safe place.</p>  <p>  I also sincerely thank the Garda in Kerry for the purple tie day it organised on 29 April.  I thank Garda Fidelma O'Leary and all the garda&iacute; in Kerry who attended that occasion, along with many people from other services and politicians, including Deputy Pa Daly and others.  We were there to support them on a special and good day.  It showed people who are vulnerable or in unsure circumstances that in our county, we are all there to support and help them.  I respectfully call on the Minister to ensure that at all times as much funding as possible is available.</p></speech>

As is the case in respect of every legislative procedure, it could have been better but it could also have been much less ambitious.  The advancement of technology has enabled us to connect and share important information, to speak up and raise awareness of human rights violations.  However, it has also provided additional fertile grounds for gender-based violence against women and girls to an alarming extent and with little accountability.  It has fuelled the perpetration of insidious, harmful actions by partners and ex-partners but also by anonymous individuals.  It has created an environment in which violence against women and girls seems to have been normalised by society.</p>  <p>  Lockdowns imposed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic only amplified this long-standing problem, with a high number of instances of online sexual abuse.  Both men and women can experience instances of online violence and abuse, as was clear during the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp court case.  However, women are considerably more likely to be victims of repeated and severe forms of harmful actions online and with the help of technology.  Every day we hear about women and girls who have been victims of, to name but a few, non-consensual images or video sharing; intimidation and threats via email or social media platforms, including threats of rape and death threats; online sexual harassment; stalking, including with the use of tracking applications and devices; impersonation; and economic harm via digital means.</p></speech>

All too often, our laws are just not tough enough with regard to sexual violence against women or online threats and harassment.  All too often, we hear of cases where there is undue leniency.  We need tougher laws.  We need to ensure we can curb this type of behaviour and prevent it.  The only way we can prevent such behaviour is by having a tough response.  Unfortunately, the responses are in many cases not tough enough.  That leads to women having to suffer and that is not right in the Ireland of 2022.</p>  <p>  I commend the Garda for all it does.  Our domestic violence services across the country, and particularly in my constituency of Laois-Offaly, do fantastic work.  The real gaps exist in the justice system and the lack of justice for women.  There is a need for much tougher laws.</p></speech>

I do welcome the directive and the fact we are opting into it.  I welcome the fact that opting in will give us a voice in the final drafting of the directive.  It will do away with the gap that exists in respect of effective legislation.  There is a patchwork of legal instruments in place at present.  There are positive things in the directive and I have no difficulty supporting it.  I do, however, have a little difficulty as a result of my cynicism at this point.  That is a luxury I cannot have as a politician because one stands here to tell people that things can be done and things can change.</p><p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive speech which set out much of the legislative background.  After the UK's departure, it is significant that we are the sole country with an Article 21 protocol.  I thank the Minister for all of that.  I take exception to the portion of her speech in which she stated, &quot;However, shifts in long-held mindsets and changes in behaviours do not occur over weeks, or even months, and we need to continue to work as hard as possible to see real changes happen.&quot;  We did not ask for anything to happen overnight.  I have repeatedly referred to the task force from a quarter of a century ago when former Deputy Eithne FitzGerald was the relevant Minister of State.  The task force produced an excellent report that highlighted all the things that needed to be done and how they should be done.  Unfortunately, it never happened.  I recognise the Minister's bona fides<i></i>and she has confirmed that repeatedly in the D&aacute;il.  That report was produced in 1997, which was 20 years after the first refuge came into being in Ireland as a result of an enormous struggle by women on the ground.  None of the services for women suffering domestic violence or gender-based violence has ever been proactive.  They have come as a result of women, children and good men, and their suffering.</p><p>The task force that was established in 1997, which is a quarter of a century ago, was supposed to change everything.  It set out that a strategy was needed.  The one recommendation that jumps out to me is that programmes for violent men that confront violent behaviour must be developed and expanded.  That was stated a quarter of a century ago.  That is one of the major aspects with which we have not even begun to deal.  I have mentioned before in the D&aacute;il the collaborative effort between the Rape Crisis Centre and the Manuela Programme in Galway to roll out to the schools an educational project.  I gave the Minister some details of that and I am not sure what follow up there has been in that regard.</p><p>I apologise for my cynicism but it is difficult because following on from that report, many promises were given.  There were three items, part of a trinity, of which the audit of interdepartmental structures was one part.  We finally got that audit and it identified how fragmented the services had been.  The second national strategy ran from 2016 to 2021.  The Department of Justice's audit of structures found a lack of effective oversight of implementation of the second strategy,  a fragmented approach and a lack of action on decades of recommendations.  Oversight responsibility was held by an interdepartmental senior officials group which is nominally accountable to the Cabinet but in practice has never reported.  That was the second strategy.  I could outline many other criticisms.</p><p>Now we have two parts of the trinity, namely, the general audit I have mentioned and the audit on structures.  We are still waiting for the third national strategy.  It was due at the end of 2021.  That was changed at the end of March and we were told it was coming within a few weeks.  As each Deputy asked, we were told it was coming soon.  We are still told that is the case.  If the Minister can be bluntly honest with us, what is the delay in producing the strategy?  We need to know that before we even begin to talk about the implementation of the strategy.  What is causing the delay six months after the end of the other strategy?  We must remember the history involved and the serious crimes that are being perpetrated on a daily basis against women and children; violence that is also being watched by children.</p> <p>If I am to have trust in the Minister, and I told her I would work with her, then words have to mean something.  When will the strategy be published?  What has caused the delay?</p></speech>

As I said out the outset, it is absolutely vital that we opt in, not just to show that we are committed to dealing with this issue but also to make sure, at the very outset, that we are part of the discussion and conversation regarding any changes that may be necessary as this protocol is developed and legislation is drafted in order that it will work with our domestic legislation here and with the legislative basis that exists here.</p>  <p>  More generally, there is a lot of work happening.  To respond to Deputy Connolly, the strategy will be published with an implementation plan.  It is not the case that we will publish the strategy and then have to work it out.  What is almost complete - it is in the final stages of sign-off before being published in the next week or two - is a very detailed implementation plan with dates, actions, information on the Departments carrying out those actions, information relating to funding and so on.  The plan will be very clearly set out and will take into account all of the things Deputy Connolly mentioned, including the audit, the restructuring that is needed and the drive we need in order to implement change.  What is different this time is that it is not a strategy without an implementation plan.  We will have all of that together.  I appreciate that it is taking longer than people would like but it is a whole-of-government strategy with quite a number of Departments involved.  I am sure everyone appreciates that when so many Departments are involved and when one engages in consultation with the public and others a number of times because one wants to get it right, it does, unfortunately, result in delays.  It will be published very soon, in a matter of weeks.  Definitely before the D&aacute;il finishes up for the recess but probably in the next two weeks.</p>  <p>  More generally, a great deal of work is under way in any event, irrespective of the strategy, some of which Deputies have already mentioned.  Again, I thank Deputies for their support.  This is an other opt-in that has come at short notice.  We were not given too much time to pass it through the Houses, but it is really important.  We have already opted into the Istanbul Convention.  However, there are countries that have not yet ratified it or that are considering pulling out.  It is important, therefore, that we show leadership in this regard and are at the table and seen to be leading on what all Deputies here have identified as such an important issue.</p></speech>

I would like to thank my colleagues for their support, particularly Deputy Cullinane, our party spokesperson on health, and Deputy McDonald, our party leader.  This motion calls on the Minister for Health and the Government to state clearly their position on the future of the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  It also calls on the Minister to put forward proposals to protect and enhance emergency and critical care services at Navan hospital.</p><p>Last week, the HSE announced the final stages of downgrading the emergency department at Navan hospital, to commence on 30 June.  This is the wrong decision.  Emergency departments across the State are suffering from ongoing and chronic overcrowding.  In May, the average wait time for admission to emergency departments across the State stood at 11 hours, which is almost three times the Sl&aacute;intecare target of four hours.  It is clear that the hospitals closest to Navan do not have additional capacity.  At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, in May, 31% of patients waited over 12 hours in the emergency department for admission, while in Connolly Hospital, the figure was 48%.  This is the reality in hospitals across the State.  Now is not the time to reduce emergency care capacity in our hospitals and to even consider such a move in the current climate is baffling.  Just this week Mr. Sean Egan, director of healthcare regulation and the lead HIQA inspector, pointed to the risks associated with such a move.  He was speaking in the context of Limerick University Hospital, which is one of the most overcrowded hospitals in the State.  Mr. Egan rightly pointed out that the closure of smaller emergency departments in the region has contributed to that situation.  Why would we want to repeat the same mistakes again?</p><p>I pay tribute to the people of Meath who have fought tooth and nail to protect their emergency department for more than a decade.  They have done so tirelessly and will continue to do so, if necessary.  They have done so because they see the shambles caused by bad Government policy and they refuse to allow the same to happen to their community.  We stand with them.  The manner in which this was announced was a further insult to those people and a clear display of the chaos that lies at the heart of this Government.  The day after the HSE made the announcement, it was directly contradicted by the Minister.  The North East Doctor on Call service and healthcare unions have said that they were not consulted on the proposal.  The Government Deputies in Meath have stood in silence or paid lip service to the issue.  The people of Meath deserve better.  They deserve more than mixed messages from the Government and the HSE.  They deserve better than having to constantly take to the streets to battle to protect their health services, which they have been doing for over a decade now.  They deserve accessible and high quality health services and clarity from this Government.  They deserve to know, once and for all, where the Minister and his Government stands on the future of Navan hospital.  Is the Minister committed to protecting and enhancing emergency and critical care services at Navan hospital?  I hope that the Minister and his Government will give that commitment to the people of Meath tonight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100037#MM00600"><p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Guirke, on tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity to debate this issue, which is really important.  There was a meeting last week of Oireachtas Members, HSE officials, clinicians and others who work in the hospital group and very frank and important exchanges took place at that meeting.  As the Minister knows, a document was circulated by the HSE which made the executive's intentions explicitly clear.  It included dates and made it very clear that the ICU and high-dependence unit beds would close and that the emergency department as we know it would close and be replaced with a medical assessment unit.  As we know, in a level 2 hospital, such a unit is at a much lower level and can be aligned to a local injury unit as opposed to an acute medical assessment unit or an acute medical unit aligned to a level 3 or level 4 hospital.  This is a downgrading of the hospital from level 3 to level 2; we cannot call it anything other than that.  This is closing the emergency department as we know it and the Minister cannot say anything other than that if this plan goes ahead.</p>  <p>  Clinicians should have their say.  It is really important that everyone in this Chamber listens to what clinicians and those who work in the emergency department have to say.  It is also important that we listen to what medical experts outside of the hospital, including GPs, have to say.  We must listen to everybody who has an opinion.  We also have to listen to patients, to the people of Navan and Meath and arguably, to the people of Louth who will be affected by this closure if it goes ahead.  We must also listen to hospital management in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, the Mater hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I have engaged with many of those individuals already.  I am in listening mode and believe it is important that we listen but we must also learn from past mistakes.  We must understand that what is happening in Navan, or what is being proposed, has happened elsewhere.  In some hospitals, the Minister might argue, it has worked but in other hospitals it has not.  What the people of Navan, Meath and Louth will look closely at is what happened in Limerick.  Emergency departments were closed in Ennis, Nenagh and in St. John's Hospital in Limerick.  People were told at the time that this would result in better access to emergency department care and specialist trauma care in the mid-west region and that centralising all of the emergency care services into one emergency department would deliver better outcomes and faster access to emergency care.</p>  <p>Any objective analysis of what has happened in University Hospital Limerick - the Minister does not have to take my word for it, as a HIQA report was published last week - shows how chaotic, difficult, challenging, understaffed and under-resourced the accident and emergency department in that hospital is.  That accident and emergency department is now a single point of failure for that entire region.  If that emergency department is full, there is nowhere else for people to go.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will be aware that the average wait time in the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is almost 15 hours, which is well above the already very high average wait time of 11 hours across the other acute hospitals in the State.  That is the difficulty and the challenge we have.</p> <p> I put it to the Minister that we need to be very careful as we look at what is happening across all of the emergency departments and the unacceptably high wait times that people are experiencing.  As my colleague said, the Sl&aacute;intecare targets stated that nobody should be waiting for any longer than four hours.  That is not happening.  In some hospitals in Cork and in Limerick, patients over the age of 75 have, on average, been waiting more than 20 hours in an accident and emergency department, some of them on hospital trolleys.  The Minister may have heard the harrowing story of a lady who spoke to RT&Eacute; recently about how her husband had died on a hospital trolley and about the lack of the dignity and the lack of respect that was shown to him and is shown to many other people.  It is completely unacceptable.  I do not believe that we should proceed with closing the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, at this time.  There are too many unanswered questions.</p> <p> In my closing remarks, I must address the broader issues in our emergency department services.  We need a plan to reduce those wait times.  I do not know what the HSE's plan is to achieve the Sl&aacute;intecare target of four hours.  When I speak to people in hospital management they tell me that in some hospitals, not all, they need more inpatient beds so they can admit patients more quickly.  We know this.  They also tell me that they need more community beds.  Even when they try to put a discharge plan in place for many patients, they cannot get access to recovery beds or rehabilitation beds because we cannot get home help workers to provide the intensive homecare packages to the extent that we want.  Millions of home help hours are not being used because we cannot get the staff, so people cannot get transferred back into their homes.</p> <p> We also have problems with access to GP care and out-of-hours GP care.  Our colleagues from Meath will tell the Minister that this is a real difficulty.  One of the challenges, and one of the things people are being asked to do, is that the medical assessment unit would be GP referral only, and that the consultant in the medical assessment unit with the GP would have to agree to admit a patient.  That is not going to be realistic.  All of these challenges and unanswered questions create a reasonable fear and a reasonable suspicion that this is not the best way forward.</p> <p> I ask that the Minister supports the motion.  I will listen to what he says this evening and what his view is.  We are aware of what the HSE's view is.  It has put it in black and white.  We now need to see what the Minister is going to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100038#NN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The HSE's plan is very clear, and it was spelled out in black and white, but it is just a plan.  This is surprising because it has had 13 years to prepare it: nine years if one starts the clock from the small hospital framework.  We are still none the wiser as to the Government's plan, and this includes the Minister's amendment here tonight.  Frankly, this is disgraceful.</p><p>We are aware the HSE has a plan and Deputy Cullinane outlined some of the detail of that.  It states it has legitimate concerns for safety but in my firm opinion the HSE's so-called solution will make matters worse.  The concern is that in the region of 2,000 patients would present to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, who the HSE believes should go directly to Drogheda.</p><p>The medical assessment unit that is proposed to deal with up to 90% of the patients currently presenting to Navan will not work.  I want this on the record of the D&aacute;il.  It will not work because it is GP referral only.  Our GPs are already overworked and overbooked during the day, and it is even worse at night.  What will happen?  If a person is ill at home, he or she will go to the door that will accept them.  It will not be five a day or 2,000 a year.  Up to 20,000 people per year would present at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  They may not be appropriate presentations, but they will be there and there is deep concern about this.  We are hearing this spelled out in detail from clinicians on the front line.  There is deep concern that those people who are currently presenting to Navan will all, or in very significant numbers, present to Drogheda and lead to worse outcomes and worse safety rather than better.  I wish to spell this out clearly.  We have heard from GPs and, while there are differences of opinion in the medical world, I believe that in practical terms this is exactly what will happen.  I encourage the Minister to listen to that.</p><p>The suggestion that there is no alternative to this proposal is simply not the case.  At the meeting last night, we heard from one clinician who said that the only alternative to this proposal was to quadruple capacity at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and to turn it from a 107-bed hospital to a 400-bed hospital.  The idea that no hospital could exist if it was not a 400-bed hospital is just outrageous.  Within the medical profession, there is a belief that to bring Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, up to a model three hospital rather than downgrading it, it needs an extra emergency department consultant; two extra consultant surgeons; and two extra consultant anaesthetists.  That is the proposal there and I believe the Minister should take it on board.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that we have a clear proposal from the HSE that is scrambling.  Anybody who attended that meeting last Monday in good faith could not be convinced that the HSE has a coherent plan to deliver a safe service for the people of County Meath.  The ambition for increased capacity in the acute services was the subject of ongoing discussions.  There was no clear plan for increased capacity in community or general practice.  In fact, we heard that everybody has problems in terms of general practice.</p><p>I have had enough of Ministers in my county and at a senior level acting as observers and commentators.  I heard it on LMFM and read it in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i>that they are leaning one way and leaning towards closure, or they are leaning the other way and leaning towards keeping it open.  It is simply unacceptable.  We see the same here with the Minister's amendment.  In effect, with the Government's amendment, the sword or the axe will continue to hang over Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  It is simply unacceptable.  The Minister outlined that several important issues would have to be fully addressed.  What does the Minister mean?  What are the proposals and what is the plan for the hospital in Navan?  I want to lay it fully on the agenda that the proposal from Sinn F&eacute;in is to retain the service and enhance the services at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  That is the solution for it.  There is no other credible alternative.</p></speech>

It is not an exaggeration to say that I have literally lost count of the number of constituents who come into my offices telling me the health and hospital services are stumbling from crisis to catastrophe.  As the two-tier system has become very much entrenched in healthcare, we now have that very clear delineation between private and public.  Coupled with this, we have the undervaluing of hospitals' accident and emergency departments, such as that in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, which are failing people when they are most in need of urgent care.  For years, people throughout the State have had to march, lobby, campaign, write letters and take to social media in an effort to save their services in their hospitals and in their accident and emergency departments.  This is all against the perceived dismantling of healthcare services.</p>  <p>  In June 2022 my neighbouring constituents in County Meath are campaigning to save their accident and emergency department in Navan, and not for the first time.  The Minister need not think that some of them are going to come across to Mullingar.  In January 2021, there were 75.5 whole-time equivalent vacancies.  As of June 2022, that figure has skyrocketed to 125.42 whole-time equivalent vacancies in Mullingar hospital.  The patients could use the waiting lists as wallpaper.  Waiting times in accident and emergency departments are through the roof and staff are at the end of their tether.</p> <p>That is before we even get to disability intervention therapy services or respite care, which has carers and loved ones so distressed and disillusioned they are literally in tears.  Has this become so commonplace that the Minister and Members of Government are utterly unaffected by the sight of distressed citizens taking to the streets with placards in an attempt to save the hospital services on which they rely?  There is no doubt that successive Governments have done a merry dance, which this Government seems to be perfecting.  The people of Navan deserve so much more than this, as does every person with an urgent medical need in this country.</p></speech>

The Minister knows this because in 2013, he supported the closure of our local accident and emergency department in St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown.  At that time, while in opposition, the Minister fully supported the downgrading and closure of that emergency department.  He said that the reconfiguration would save lives in Wicklow and improve the quality of emergency care for the people of Wicklow.  Over 21,000 people who used the accident and emergency department in Loughlinstown were thrown into an already overwhelmed St. Vincent's University Hospital, which simply could not and cannot deal with that increased demand.</p>  <p>  As we stand here, there are 42 people lying on hospital trolleys in St. Vincent's.  Last week, an aunt of mine was one of those people.  She is a cancer patient.  She has ovarian cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer.  She collapsed on the street of Wicklow last week.  She was rushed into St. Vincent's, bypassing a hospital that the Minister supported the closure of, and was left lying on a trolley in St. Vincent's for four days and three nights.  She went through suffering, pain and indignity.  That is my aunt but I am conscious there are many other people in similar situations.  They are not looking for preferential treatment.  I am not raising my aunt's case looking for preferential treatment.  They are looking for dignity and respect.  They are looking for a bed.</p>  <p>  What the Minister is trying to do, supported by his Government colleagues and the HSE, is replicate the disaster visited on the people of Wicklow for the people of Meath.  I will not stand idly by, like the Minister did in 2013, when he supported the closure of our local accident and emergency department.  He is culpable for the failure of the local medical services in Wicklow and for the suffering people like my auntie and thousands of others have had to endure because of his failures.  We cannot stand idly by and allow the Minister's failures be visited on the people of Meath.  He must stand up to support the local services.  He must support this motion.  He failed Wicklow.  He cannot be allowed fail other counties.</p></speech>

There are aspects of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion I agree with and I also agree with elements of the contributions made this evening.  However, what is most noticeable about the Sinn F&eacute;in motion is not what it says, but what it does not say.  The vast majority of doctors and nurses working in Navan hospital are warning us, including the Deputies as their directly elected representatives, that the current situation is not safe for some patients.  They are telling us that over 2,000 people a year arrive at the emergency department who could be at serious risk because the specialist care they need is not available.  They told Deputy Brady the same thing about the hospital in Loughlinstown.  I was in the room when the senior clinicians told us all, including Deputy Brady, that people in Wicklow could die-----</p></speech>

It is an insult to the brilliant men and women who are working in Loughlinstown hospital.  If he was to bother taking any time to talk to them about what the best successes in healthcare have been recently for the people he and I represent, they would point to Loughlinstown hospital.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in and other Opposition Deputies have a choice.  They can play politics and ignore the warnings from doctors and nurses, as Deputy Brady did and continues to do, or they can have an honest conversation about finding the best outcome for people in the north east with regard to emergency and urgent care.  To that end, I have tabled an amendment stating that the HSE and clinicians in the hospital have clinical concerns about the safety of the emergency department but also that the north east Doctor on Call service has expressed concern regarding reports about the acute medical assessment unit.  There are also clear concerns from clinicians in other hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, that their patients and services would be impacted under the current proposal.  Critically, no Government decision has been taken regarding the HSE's proposal for the transition of the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  The motion goes on to say that "several important issues, including additional capacity in other hospitals impacted, EDs, as well as the continued ability of people in the Navan area to access emergency and urgent care, would need to be fully addressed before any proposed transition by the HSE could be considered."</p>  <p>  Navan is an acute general hospital with 62 medical beds.  It does not provide paediatric or obstetric care.  It does not provide an acute surgical service.  Ambulances bypass the emergency department for several conditions that cannot be catered for at the hospital.  As part of the reconfiguration the HSE is looking to implement, it is proposing investment in more patient care in Navan.  However, for any proposal to be considered, we would need to be satisfied on several levels.  I am not satisfied and neither are the Government or Members of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge that.  Legitimate questions have been raised by Members of the Oireachtas regarding issues including access to the medical assessment unit, the capacity of the National Ambulance Service, local access to GPs, emergency and other resources in Drogheda and other hospitals, the use of injury units and more.  All these issues have to be addressed and they have not been addressed to my satisfaction, to the satisfaction of the Government or, I dare say, of this House.  We are all agreed on that.  I have met with senior clinicians in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and they told me they do not currently have the resources required to cater for the additional patients who would have to go through their emergency department.  For all of these reasons, I have instructed the HSE not to proceed at this time with any proposed reconfiguration at Navan.  We need to allow for meaningful discussion and engagement with elected Members on all sides of the House and other stakeholders, including the community and clinicians.  We need to assess all of that in the round and then decide where we are going.  I want to be very clear on this.  For the reasons I have raised and Members of the Government have raised, and indeed for reasons raised this evening, the Government position is absolutely clear.  I have instructed the HSE not to proceed with what it had intended to do on 30 June.</p></speech>

At the outset, I stress that we all want what is best for the people of Meath and the surrounding counties.  That includes our family members and friends.  We want to ensure everybody gets the best possible healthcare, that we have appropriate access to that healthcare in appropriate timeframes and that we are seen in the best possible places by the best possible people.  That needs to be said clearly.  That is what we all want.  There have been understandable concerns about the proposed changes to Navan hospital.  These changes started with the publication of the small hospitals framework.  We all agree not every hospital can be a large hospital and have expertise in every field.</p> <p>Equally, no document should be thought of as concrete, and as times change and as populations expand, we always need to be open to the fact other options are possible.</p> <p> That framework was followed closely by the closure of the acute surgical unit and then the movement of the stroke unit, both of which decisions have resulted in, understandably, a clear concern about patient safety.  A total of 1,700 of 2,000 patients were referred to equipment where the resources were simply not there.  I do not doubt, and I am sure none of us does for a moment, the genuine clinical concern.  I do not in any way contradict it; how could any of us given it is clear medical evidence?  In the same vein, however, as the Minister outlined, I do not think any of us doubts the concerns raised by clinicians and medical experts in other departments and other hospitals, namely, that relating to the possible transfer risk if we were to close the Navan hospital accident and emergency room to avert that possible risk.  The fear is that we would be simply transferring one kind of risk to another hospital, whereby there would be an increase in the number of patients attending an emergency department in Drogheda that is overstretched and overloaded.</p> <p> While I acknowledge the wonderful staff who work in each hospital, it is important to stress there are different opinions and it is important all opinions, views and clinical expertise be taken into consideration.  It is only fair and right that all of us in this Chamber, where we have a role when it comes to health in funding and capacity and where we have to answer questions about the decisions we take, should ask questions, get clarity and be able to tell the people we represent that they will get the best possible healthcare.  In recent days, weeks and years, I have raised, along with others, questions relating to, for example, patient numbers and types.  Since 2019, there have been about 22,000 presentations to the Navan hospital accident and emergency department, 2,000 or so of which comprise critical patients who have been mentioned, while one third relate to GP referrals.  Where should the remaining 10,000 or so patients go and how will they know whom to go to?  We need clear answers for all these questions.</p> <p> How will the medical assessment unit work?  There was a welcome letter from some GPs today stating they had been engaged with in regard to our hospital in Navan and that they support it.  There is another letter, however, from North East Doctor on Call, which is part of the same group, stating it has not been engaged with and that its doctors do not support it.  We need clear answers as to how this will work.</p> <p> On capacity, our neighbouring hospitals are under severe strain.  We have been told by clinicians in Drogheda that the capacity is not there and that we would be simply transferring a risk, and that additional capacity will be built into the system, yet a capital plan announced only a few weeks ago did not include resources or additional capacity for Drogheda in this context.</p> <p> Many questions still need to be answered and we as public representatives deserve answers to them.  I am very grateful to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, who has committed to looking at all these questions and ensuring they will be answered.  I refer not just to capacity in Navan hospital and access to services in the proposed medical assessment unit but also to the National Ambulance Service and the capacity in the surrounding hospitals. </p></speech>

We are also asking that the Government, once and for all, end overcrowding in emergency hospitals.  Only major investment in our health service will finally change this situation.  The way this has been handled is atrocious.  It is becoming a feature of Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s tenure as Minister and of how the Government does business.  There has been confusion and mixed messages from the HSE and the Government, and we need the latter to outline exactly what its plans are for the Navan hospital accident and emergency department and its plans for the emergency services in Meath and Louth generally.  He said he has instructed the HSE to pause, but for how long?  It is the Government&rsquo;s policy to close the emergency department in Navan hospital, as outlined in its small hospitals policy.  Which is the Minister saying?  Is he saying the intention is not to close it, or that the Government is going to pause doing so while the public outcry remains and then give the HSE the nod to move swiftly on with implementing its policy?</p>  <p>  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is the largest hospital in the area and, under the Government&rsquo;s hare-brained plan to close the Navan hospital accident and emergency department, it stands to reason the number coming to it will increase very significantly, as clinicians have told the Minister.  This influx of additional patients is going to put unbearable pressure on the hospital and the plan cannot go ahead for that reason.  North East Doctor on Call has indicated that the proposal to make the acute medical assessment unit in Navan hospital accessible only by means of a GP referral will place significant additional pressures on GP services.  That was not thought out either.  It will compound the matter.  The doctor-on-call service recently had to reconfigure its out-of-hour services, which it has stated is because of acute doctor shortages and the underfunding of services, and it has told Navan hospital that it will not be put in a position whereby it will have to manage acute and serious presentations.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister give clarity?  Either it is his Government&rsquo;s policy to close the emergency department in Navan hospital or he is going to tell the HSE to halt it completely and go back to the drawing board.  Which is it?</p></speech>

The downgrading of services is well known to people in Munster.  I encourage people from the Meath area to look at what happened in Ennis and Nenagh, where there was a downgrading of services, staff shortages, the closure of units and the promise of a centre of excellence in Limerick.  Last week, a HSE report outlined serious problems in Limerick hospital relating to patient flow, inpatients, dignity and privacy for patients and staffing levels, yet the two hospitals in counties Clare and Tipperary were downgraded and services put in there.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister quoted on the radio yesterday, although I am not sure whether it was accurate, as saying there was a fear due to the current climate that operations will be postponed due to Covid, but that is already happening in University Hospital Kerry.  For the past seven weeks, elective surgeries have been suffering because of a lack of staff and early closing hours, and the number of day procedures has reduced.  Moreover, trolley numbers have increased by ten times on the figure in 2012, and by 40% year-on-year to last December.</p>  <p>  Over the weekend, I spoke to a former neighbour of mine in Rock Street, Tralee, who has ulcerated feet.  He is suffering because he cannot see a podiatrist, given there is no podiatrist in all of Kerry.  He has to travel to Cork twice a month to see someone there, spending &euro;100.  On occasion, he has been on the way at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and has got a text message to tell him he will have to return.  He relies on the community services and his GP.  Part of his toe fell off on Thursday night and he spent 12 hours waiting for an ambulance before he was seen, after which he was sent back to the same services as before.</p>  <p>  There is a fear in Kerry that services will be downgraded.  I urge my colleagues up the country to ensure that will not happen in Navan.</p></speech>

I commend Deputies Guirke and O&rsquo;Rourke on highlighting the downgrading of Meath regional hospital because centralising expertise is worthy and all very well.  Nevertheless, doing so implies the rest of the health service around it is working well, but in the Navan area and, indeed, throughout the health service, it is not.</p>  <p>  A total of 1.3 million people are awaiting healthcare and the two neighbouring hospitals, Connolly Hospital and Drogheda hospital, are at breaking point.  The local GPs are on their knees and there are just too many patients.  We all have a lot of constituents coming to us saying they cannot get a GP, so a GP referral just will not work.  The GPs who are there are just exhausted, overworked and undervalued.  They are exasperated by dealing with a hospital system that is perpetually in crisis.  Who in the name of God looked at this healthcare disaster and thought we should close the emergency department and critical beds in Navan hospital when the surrounding hospitals are simply out the door?</p> <p>Who in the Minister&rsquo;s Department agreed that this would be good idea?  It certainly was not the people who live in my neighbouring county of Meath.  I am sure it was not the local healthcare providers in Connolly Hospital or Drogheda either.  It seems that the Department of Health does not have a notion of what is going on.  It is like the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the effects of the increase in the cost of living, because the Government making the decisions is so far removed from the people who must feel their effects.  We see what is happening in Meath from the perspective of our hospital in Naas and we want to make sure that Naas is okay.  I have spoken to the Minister about trying to get the maternity section back in Naas.  We want that and we have wonderful staff in Naas General Hospital.  The Minister knows I am campaigning to get the Coombe antenatal clinic reopened there and they are talking about not doing it.  Local care is progressive and especially with climate change coming upon us, local care should be our aim.</p></speech>

I commend my Meath colleagues on bringing this motion forward tonight.  The downgrading of any services and centralising emergency departments only cause a funnel and it is like gridlock, which I heard some of the earlier speakers say.</p>  <p>  In May, the Minister visited Cork where the average waiting time at Cork University Hospital, CUH, is 28.8 hours.  At the Mercy University Hospital in Cork, it is 26.8 hours.  It was said earlier that anybody over the age of 75 must wait an average of 14 hours for admission to a bed from the emergency department.  I live a long way from Navan but I see the same thing happening again.  I see something similar in County Tipperary where they are downgrading as well and no doubt we will be here in a couple of weeks discussing that.  Even from listening to the Minister earlier, I understand where he is coming from.  The problem is that we should be retaining and enhancing services, however.</p>  <p>  From listening to the debate coming tonight from the Government's side of the House, it seems to be going away from what the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended, which was that everything be community-led and that prevention is better than cure and people should be able to access services.  The issue around GPs was mentioned a while ago.  If this is going to be the situation in Navan, I would hate to get a heart attack and have to look for a GP referral.  It is not possible.  I think we really have to go back here.  There has to be a massive upgrading because I suspect this is across the board.  I see it in my own town and we spoke about it many times.  Again, they are downgrading respite services and mental health services and trying to push them all into a central area.  The resistance is frightening because it makes things almost impossible to access.  I have seen it in many reports and I read pieces today.  It is about access to services and we are taking away the vital services.  I heard the Minister say that some of the services are not being provided.  That is what the speakers on this side of the House said - invest in it and enhance it.  We cannot funnel everybody in one area.  It is going to end up in gridlock and what happens when we have a funnel like that is that everything piles up and gets dumped and nothing will work.  I ask the Minister to please support the motion from this side of the House.</p></speech>

I am more than familiar with Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  Outside of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, it is the medical facility with which I am probably most familiar .  That will be the case for any resident of the Drogheda, south Louth and east Meath areas.  It is a valued and very valuable piece of health infrastructure in our region in the counties of Meath and Louth.  I say counties Meath and Louth deliberately because I represent Louth and a very significant part of the east of County Meath.</p>  <p>  I also say this because no Louth-based Deputies were invited to the briefing with the HSE on 13 June.  That was wrong; we needed to be.  I will tell the Minister exactly why and I think he knows why.  If the Minister proceeds with the plan to finally close the emergency department in Navan, and I acknowledge that he put on the record this evening his intention to pause that - for how long we do not know - then he knows he will be dealing with a whole host of new problems.  The Minister articulated that in his response this evening.  That problem is even more overcrowding in emergency departments and on the floors of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  This plan has been badly organised, badly planned, badly thought through and incredibly poorly executed.  I say this because neither the Minister, the HSE nor the RCSI Hospitals Group over the past week could tell me precisely how many new beds and what additional capacity would go into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, in the event of this move going ahead, to deal with the additional demand that would inevitably arise were the emergency department in Navan to close.</p>  <p>   We got some sense of this from a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister issued to me this evening in which references were made to ten additional beds.  Anybody who is familiar with Meath and Louth will tell the Minister that ten additional beds, even in the context of the current demand, notwithstanding the Minister's ultimate plan for Navan, simply would not cut it.  We know today that 521 patients were awaiting admission to a hospital bed across the country and 441 were in emergency departments.  Those are the figures from across the country.  I know too there are pressures today, as there are every day, in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</p>  <p>  I am very familiar with one case because it was raised with me today.  Hardly a day and certainly a week does not go by, notwithstanding the very hard and dedicated work of the staff at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, without me being informed of a difficult situation in which an often elderly, frail and vulnerable person might find himself or herself.  As I said, that is notwithstanding the commitment and dedication of staff to resolving all the problems that present themselves at emergency departments.  I will give the Minister one case that illustrates the wider point.  A family were in touch me today about their dad, who is a very elderly man with dementia and an acute respiratory problem.  He was in the emergency department in Drogheda waiting for a room since 8 a.m. this morning.  He is now in a multi-bed situation in one room.  His family got in touch to tell me the circumstances he is in and the way he is being accommodated at the moment given the pressures on the hospital are not appropriate for him.  I think the Minister would accept that himself.  The man's daughter signed off her first email to me this morning by saying, "and they are talking about sending patients from Navan to this hospital".  That is what she said I think she speaks for all of us - she speaks for me.  She is right to be concerned and the clinicians and staff in the hospital are right to be concerned.  The Minister expressed that himself in his remarks this evening.  He confirmed that the clinicians in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, whom he has met, are concerned about the consequences of the closure of the Navan emergency department on an already stretched hospital.</p>  <p>  This is not the first time that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has been in the firing line and has had to accommodate additional numbers of patients as a consequence of a closure of an emergency department in our community.  I want to take the Minister back to the late 2000s and the initial reconfiguration programme, with which we will all be familiar, under a former Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  That Government made the decision to close the emergency department in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.  Let us look for a minute at how that went for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  As a resident of the area, then as a councillor for the area and later as a Deputy, I remember the chaos at a time when investment in our public services was stretched because of the collapse of the economy.  In 2010, the year before the full impact of the closure of the accident and emergency department in the Louth County Hospital became apparent, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, annualised trolley watch figures from Drogheda suggested that 3,484 people were on trolleys in the emergency department at one point or another in that year.  In 2011, after the closure of Dundalk, 7,449 citizens had been counted on trolleys at one point or other across that year; a more than doubling of the figures before the emergency department in Louth County Hospital was closed.</p> <p>There is a direct and very severe causal relationship between the closure of emergency departments in the region and the impact on stretched resources at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Now it appears, notwithstanding what the Minister said tonight about the pausing of his approach to the Navan ED, that he is still preparing the axe to fall.  The sword of Damocles is still hanging over the emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital because it appears that the HSE and the Department of Health are preparing to do the same thing again.  They are incapable of adequately preparing and of learning the lessons of recent history in the north east.</p> <p> Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, as Deputy O'Rourke and others know, has historically been the poor relation in terms of centres of excellence in this country when it comes to investment.  It is the de facto regional hospital but it never received the appropriate resources to bring it to the next level.  It is the regional trauma centre.  We are very proud of our hospital and of the great work that the dedicated and committed staff do there.  We all rely on them and their expertise and dedication.  One thing that the system never reflects in the hospital's budgets is the fact that it is also the hospital and ED of choice for many people in the Fingal area of north County Dublin, often because of pressures in Beaumont Hospital and other hospitals on the northside of Dublin.  It is also a fact that many cases that one would ordinarily expect to be dealt with in the emergency department of Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry, for example, make their way to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  Even without the extra resources that would be needed as a consequence of the inevitable decision that the Minister will ultimately take regarding Navan ED, the case for significant investment in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital should be clear.</p> <p> The Minister should also be mindful of what I will say next.  We now have a perfect storm of circumstances arising that could lead to a real potential catastrophe in the provision of healthcare in the area.  It is a letter that all local Deputies received from North East Doctor on Call, NEDOC, the doctor on call service, last Thursday night.  It is an absolutely explosive letter that acknowledged that because of GP burnout, the burdens on GPs in the area who are involved in the NEDOC co-operative and, importantly, because of underinvestment from the HSE, it plans to reconfigure its services and reduce the hours of operation from early August.  We potentially have a situation where the ED in Navan closes, there is huge pressure on Drogheda and there is an imminent threat hanging over the NEDOC service as well.</p> <p> This is being handled in a cack-handed way.  I am glad the Minister is reflecting on how he will proceed on this, although I cannot help but think he is only reflecting because of the political fallout from a decision that seems to me to be inevitable and on which the Minister and the Government have made up their minds in any case.  The Minister has to be clear on what the timeline is.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital staff and the people of the region need reassurance that the service is not going to suffer when the Minister inevitably makes the decision to close the door of the emergency department in Navan, which will have huge implications for the provision of healthcare in our area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-06-21a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100042#RR00200"><p>I have been following this story for the past week and during the debate tonight and I am struggling to figure out exactly who is in charge.  Is it the management that is running the hospital or what input does the Government have?  The Taoiseach made his position quite clear earlier today regarding UHL.  He said the HSE is directly responsible for the running and the management of hospitals and that the Government will not interfere in that.  I am struggling to find out why Navan is different.  The HSE announced early last week that the emergency department in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, would be closed to critically ill patients from next September.  Within minutes, senior Government Ministers were stating the opposite, that it had not been sanctioned by the Government and that it would not be closed.  We are in the unfortunate situation where the clinical director in Navan hospital, Mr. Gerry McEntee, had to go on the defence in the media against the words of the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The closure of Navan emergency department was decided by a Fine Gael Government and Fine Gael Minister for Health in 2013 in the framework document on securing the future of smaller hospitals.  That document provided for nine smaller hospitals changing from model 3 to model 2, with the closure of their emergency departments as a consequence of the shift.  When every party in this House came together in agreement on Sl&aacute;intecare, it was not only a commitment to universal healthcare free at the point of use but also a commitment to an evidence-based healthcare system, to end the tradition of using healthcare as a political football where resources were often distributed in accordance with the constituencies of Ministers of the day, rather than where the need was most acute.</p>  <p>  The situation in which Navan emergency department has found itself is bleak, to say the least.  The clinical director could not have been clearer in his assessment, stating that the emergency department is a risk to the lives of critically ill patients and that they are not afforded the best chance of survival.  When family members or an ambulance service bring critically ill patients to Navan they do so in the belief that the emergency department will deliver life-saving care when that care is needed.  Why would they not so believe?  The absolute least we should expect from an emergency department is that it would have the skills and resources to do the best it can to save someone's life.  We expect the same standard of care in every emergency department in the State, whether it is in Beaumont Hospital or Navan.  However, that is not the reality for the people of Meath.  Emergency department nursing staff, physicians, surgeons, anaesthetists, junior doctors and every HSE official connected to the hospital have all raised the concern that the emergency department in Our Lady's Hospital is unsafe.  We cannot ignore the voices of the medical professionals who are working day and night to care for the people of Meath and who are making it clear that they do not believe they can continue to provide emergency care to critically ill patients.</p>  <p>  Local hospitals are incredibly vital components of our communities.  Of course, they provide employment but, more importantly, they provide a sense of security.  Living within a short distance of an emergency department is comforting, especially for older people or those with additional healthcare needs or, indeed, people who want to ensure they can visit so they can have some oversight of a family member.  It is absolutely understandable that local communities want to retain the hospitals and are anxious about the potential impact on their access to emergency care when a closure is imminent.  The logic behind the closure of small emergency departments is well supported by evidence.  Small emergency departments are just not viable, not in terms of cost but in terms of patient safety.  The critical mass is not there to ensure staff are trained properly.  I believe there are only 64 beds in Navan hospital.  Approximately 300 beds are generally needed for a critical mass that would allow for specialisation.</p>  <p>  The emergency department in Navan is already bypassed by ambulances carrying heart attack and stroke victims because it is known by medical professionals that it is safer to bring them to Drogheda.  However, family members who are transporting a loved one who has suffered a stroke will go straight to Navan.  It is unacceptable that these patients would receive a lower level of care just because their families do not know about the internal way the health service is run in that hospital.  Cover in the emergency department is not provided by consultants but by agency registrars who are not specialists in emergency medicine.  The hospital is not accredited for junior doctors so it cannot attract the staff it needs.  As the smallest intensive care unit, ICU, in the country, the staff who are there do not get the necessary experience to be properly trained on the job in the way that staff would be or are in busier hospitals.</p>  <p>  The writing has been on the wall for the emergency department in Navan since 2009, with official commitments given in 2013.  That is nine years the Government and the HSE had to plan for an orderly transfer of critical care from Navan to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, if that is what the plan was.  Why have we once again wasted time, with years of kicking the can down the road and delaying important decisions until we get to a point of crisis?</p> <p>We do not appear to do planning in this country.  We just wait until the crisis happens and then try to work back from it.  This could and should have been an orderly transition.  The necessary resources should have been in place in Drogheda well in advance of the transfer.  An increase in ambulance cover should have been provided.  Fundamentally, the local community should have been informed every step of the way.  Their care and concern should have been addressed.  There should have been constant communication with the local community, assuring them that their access to emergency healthcare would in fact be improved, not worsened.  None of that has happened.  This is an exercise in the failure of planning and preparation.  It is a pattern that is well evident at this point.  The plan for transitioning smaller hospitals from model 3 to model 2 has always been very clear.  The larger hospitals would receive more resources and training to become centres of excellence, with larger catchment areas and more specialisation.</p> <p> A census of the population has just been taken.  We talk about that as a basis for planning services.  We even roll out advertisements about that.  In 2016, County Meath had a population just short of 200,000 and the census will reveal that has increased significantly.  County Louth is a growing area, as is Fingal, which is adjacent to it.  We talk about using demographics and the census statistics to design services, but it is very difficult to see what kind of thought has gone into this entire catchment.  While the new model 2 hospitals will become busier than ever, providing a range of care, from minor injury units, step-down rehabilitative care, scanning centres, laboratories, etc., the latter has been largely successful, the former not so much.  The HSE tends to give a lot of promises in relation to the resourcing of emergency departments and the standards that will be achieved but it often does not follow through on that.  People do not believe the HSE.  That is part of the problem.  Is it any wonder people are opposing the closure of the emergency department, inadequate as it is, when the HSE's track record is so poor?  We only need to look at the impact of the closure of Loughlinstown hospital on St. Vincent's, or the impact of the closure of the emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals on University Hospital Limerick, UHL, which was mentioned earlier in the debate.  As we know, UHL was subject to a damning HIQA report last week.  The problems with overcrowding in Limerick can be tracked back to the closure of the two emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh.</p> <p> County Meath has one of the fastest growing populations in the country but it is very difficult to see how that has even been factored in.  The average wait time in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda is already reported to be 14 hours but the HSE is predicting very low numbers of patients transferring from Navan to Drogheda.  That waiting time is already too high and the population in the larger catchment area is only going to grow.  It is essential that the problems faced by UHL are not replicated in Drogheda.  Medical staff in Drogheda are already quite concerned about their capacity to take patients.  Again, we have heard that already this evening.  The concerns of the medical professions in Navan also need to be at the centre of this debate.  They know the situation on the ground.  I am sorry, I have gone over time.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the people in Navan and the region for mobilising and coming out in their thousands to defend and seek to ensure the future of their hospital.  They are absolutely right to do so.  I understand there is another protest planned for 9 July.  It is only through those people-power mobilisations that the hospital and emergency department in Navan will be defended.  I would prepare those people by saying that they will hear all sorts of positive soothing noises, in particular from Government Deputies in the area telling them not to worry; that it will be okay and so on, but the people who have been mobilising and campaigning for so long know that what is being attempted here is really death by a thousand cuts.  If the Government and the HSE are not checked or stopped by a movement which says "No" and that it needs to continue to have a full, proper emergency department in Navan, then that process will continue.  It is only people power that will be able to stop it.  When campaigners who attend protests and meetings wonder if it will be okay and that there is a medical basis to the logic of centralisation, which is always the argument they try to make, I would just tell them to look at the experience of the mid-west region.  On a daily basis, the same arguments were made then in terms of the closure of regional hospitals.  It was said that it makes sense and that we had to centralise hospitals, but the resources were not put in place in Limerick and the result is that there is massive overcrowding on a daily basis.  The disaster of this process of centralisation, which in reality becomes an excuse for cutbacks and downgrading, is just witnessed on a daily basis in Limerick and in the mid-west region.  That is why this plan must be stopped.</p>  <p>  One of the good points made in the motion is about the extraordinary waiting times for emergency departments at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  What struck me when looking at them is that we are talking about nine, 11 and 12 hours across the State as an average.  In Tallaght Hospital at the moment, the average wait time for someone going to the accident and emergency department is 18 hours.  It is scandalous.  The figures across the country are scandalous.  That is just the average.  People are left waiting significantly longer than that.  The wait time in the accident and emergency departments in Tallaght, Drogheda and Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown is an emergency, but it is no accident.  The waiting times are the result of decades of neglect of the health service by successive Governments underfunding hospitals, running the staff ragged, not providing the investment into hospitals to expand capacity and not bringing private hospitals into public ownership, but instead continuing with the logic of a two-tier health service - almost a three-tier health service.  That only works if there is a problem with the public tier, whether that is the first, second or third tier.  The private tier will not make any money if the public health service provides the sort of service that people need.  Instead of downgrading hospitals, we need investment to improve hospitals across the board, to hire more staff, support the staff that we have, and to build a top-quality Irish national health service that we can be proud of.</p>  <p>  I want to take the opportunity to raise some other health-related points with the Minister in terms of the current situation regarding Covid.  One point I want to make is that there are now 200 health workers who have been long-term sick with Covid, who now face having the sick leave scheme they are on being closed down at the end of this month.  The Minister is saying it is not happening.  I hope that is definitely the case.  They are workers who helped to keep the health service running during the crisis.  Many of them caught the virus through their work and are now suffering debilitating long-term Covid.  What has been reported is that the Government was planning to pull the rug out from them, scrapping the paid leave scheme, and failing to engage with SIPTU.  If the Minister is saying that is not going to happen, that is very welcome news.  In this debate, the focus should be on Navan, but it is important for the Minister to make a statement about what is happening in terms of the Covid situation.  The INMO's members are the people on the front lines.  They are ringing the alarm bells in terms of the levels of hospitalisation.  More than 600 people are in hospital and the rate of increase in hospitalisation is more than 16% week on week.  In comments from the Minister or the Government in the media generally we hear a lot of talk of living with Covid, but if that is to mean anything, the Government must do some things to enable us to live with Covid.  We cannot just continue as normal and say we are living with Covid, because then the results will be tens, then hundreds then thousands of unnecessary deaths, both through Covid and through the impact on the health service generally.</p> <p> We need to see a plan and action on living with Covid.  I will quickly say a few things.  We need to get back to a situation where people are wearing masks inside, on public transport, in crowded spaces and so on.  The best way for the Government to signal that, and for it to happen, is to send out quality FFP2 or N95 masks, the kind of masks we get for free in Leinster House, to people in their homes, to have them available at public transport locations, such as bus stations, train stations, etc., and just try to renormalise the idea we need to go back for a period to wearing masks, where people possibly can do so.  There should be big public health advertisements around it and so on.  Let us invest in this; it makes sense to do it.</p> <p> I was disappointed to see the free antigen tests for relatives of those who have Covid have now been removed.  We should encourage as much testing as possible throughout the population in order that people find out when they have Covid as quickly as possible.  Antigen tests should be made free to all.</p> <p> I will make a final point on ventilation.  It is now more than six months since we passed the Bill giving workers the right to clean air through ventilation and filtration, including in schools.  On that day, 1 December, the Minister of State, Deputy English, said not to worry, the Government was not just pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing us and was very eager to have this implemented, that it might make sense to do it through regulation, to which the Government was very open, and that he would give us a call-----</p></speech>

Meath&quot; </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>There is a palpable sense of anger in County Meath at present regarding the Government and HSE plan to shut down Navan accident and emergency department.  That department is without doubt the most important piece of health infrastructure we have.  For us, it is a life-and-death issue.  I attended the discussion on the future of Navan's accident and emergency department in the Department of Health last Monday.  I was shocked, and the Minister must have had a sense of shock as well, because in all the presentations we received from the HSE on that day, no reference was made to overcrowding.  The context of the crisis engulfing the accident and emergency system in this country was never mentioned.  It is incomprehensible that the Government would consider closing our accident and emergency department at a time of record waiting times.</p><p>The HSE figures show that people are waiting up to 12 hours in Drogheda's accident and emergency department.  At Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown just before Christmas, the staff had to come out on a picket due to the overcrowding conditions they were enduring in their accident and emergency department.  The Mater Hospital, Dublin, and the Regional Hospital Mullingar have asked patients not to arrive in their accident and emergency departments due to overcrowding.  Last week, 546 people were on trolleys throughout the State and that is in the middle of summer.  At the meeting last Monday - I was amazed by the sentence - I heard the HSE state that people keep turning up at accident and emergency departments.  Orthopaedic treatment and elective surgery in the hospital at Navan were suspended during the winter months because of the pressure on its accident and emergency.  It is unbelievable the Government is seeking to close an emergency department that was overcrowded just a few months ago.</p><p>I have no faith in the HSE.  I am told to have faith but it is impossible to do so.  These are the people who closed the emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals.  These are the people who made the decisions that are precipitating the crisis in UHL at present.  Under their stewardship, and this is very important, adverse incidents have jumped from 79,000 in 2017 to 105,000 just last year.  That is an increase of 32% in the number of people who have suffered due to mistakes in clinical care.  Extreme incidents, which include death and permanent incapacity, rose from 375 people in 2017 to 579 people just last year.  The main cause, and this is crucial, is the fact the staff the Minister manages and is in charge of are under such extraordinary pressure.</p><p>Information I have received through a parliamentary question to the Minister has shown that if Navan accident and emergency is closed, it would push thousands of patients from a hospital group, Ireland East Hospital Group, with a lower level of adverse incidents into the RCSI Hospital Group, which has the highest level of adverse incidents in the country.  I asked HIQA whether it has ever carried out an investigation into this; it said &quot;No&quot;.  I have asked HIQA if it has ever carried out an investigation into the effects of the closure of an accident and emergency department on patient outcomes.  It has said &quot;No&quot;.  This is because we do not do investigations in this country into decisions made by senior HSE staff or Ministers that have enormous repercussions on the lives of people in this country.</p><p>The HSE is proposing a replacement for Navan, namely, a GP referral medical assessment unit, MAU.  It states it will be a 24-hour service.  How in the name of God can it be when GP offices close at 6 p.m. and when North-East Doctor on Call stated it would not accept patients who would normally have been dealt with by Our Lady's Hospital in Navan?  The idea that it will be 24 hours is absolute nonsense.  I will direct this key point to the Minister of State because he knows it as well as anybody else; it is nearly impossible as a person new to the county to get a GP.  People are going to Dublin and elsewhere to get GPs.  If someone wants an appointment with a GP, it could take up a fortnight to obtain one.  Does anybody in their right mind think that a person suffering an emergency, or an accident or ill health, will ring his or her GP and wait for a fortnight to get a referral to an MAU?  It will not happen.  People will circumvent the MAU and go straight to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</p><p>I draw the Minister's attention a report published by the HSE a number of years ago.  The report in question is available on Lenus and states that the new regional hospital should go to Navan because of the burgeoning population there.  The HSE spent millions on that report and it is now pegging it into the bin.  In late 2010, the Minister of State, Deputy English, and five other Fine Gael representatives stood outside the hospital in Navan and promised that a new regional hospital would be built in five years.  It is nowhere to be seen.  Mr. Thomas Lynch promised in front of 10,000 people at a march in Navan that he and Fianna F&aacute;il would protect the accident and emergency department.  He is now making arguments in public for the closure of that department.  I will mention the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion.  It is not strong enough.  It studiously avoids calling on the Government not to close Navan accident and emergency.</p><p>I am proud to have been chair of the hospital campaign for the past ten years.  We will not give up.  We will fight for the retention.  We will bring thousands of people onto the streets on 9 July.  If the emergency department closes, it will cost significantly in human terms but it will also cost in political terms.  There is no Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Deputy in Roscommon.  That should be remembered when Deputies vote.</p></speech>

The emergency department closed and was replaced by a minor injuries unit.  At the time, that meant patients in the north- and mid-Louth area who got chest pains or abdominal pains, or were involved in road accidents, had pregnancy-related conditions and more, would have to pass Louth County Hospital in Dundalk to get treatment in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  From that day on, the minor injuries unit opened from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week for patients who presented with non-emergency conditions, and people with strokes and other rehabilitation needs could use the 35 remaining beds, which were known as step-down beds.  In February 2010, the HSE stated that Louth County Hospital was changing but not closing, but the opening of a new emergency department and medical assessment unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital paved the way for the closure of the 24-hour accident and emergency department in Louth County Hospital and the transfer of acute medical services to Drogheda.</p>  <p>  The same situation is now happening in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  On Monday, 13 June, it was reported that the emergency department in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan is to be closed and replaced by a medical assessment unit.  Emergency patients were informed they should go to other hospitals and that 80% of the people who go to the emergency department in Navan would continue to be treated in that hospital.</p> <p>It was also stated that the hospital did not meet safe clinical standards for some patients.  These are mixed messages.</p> <p> On Tuesday, 14 June, the Minister stated that no decision regarding the HSE's proposal for the transition of the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, had been granted by the Government.  He also stated that the HSE had clinical concerns about safety and that the ability of people in the Navan area to access emergency and urgent care would need to be fully addressed before any proposed transition by the HSE took place.  On the same day, the T&aacute;naiste stated that the Government had not sanctioned the closure of the emergency department at Navan.  It is no wonder that people in Navan and its surrounding areas are confused.  These are mixed messages.  What is happening is similar to the situation at Louth County Hospital, with tens of thousands of people marching and people talking about all of the lives that have been saved at the hospital and its excellent staff.</p> <p> At the moment, all roads seem to be heading towards Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I must pay tribute to its staff for turning the hospital around.  In recent years, it used to be at the top of the list of overcrowded hospitals in the country.  Now, it is one of the best performing and busiest hospitals in the country.  It has 14-hour waiting lists and patients there receive a high standard of care, but I fear that, given the extra catchment area and the current resources and staffing, the position could get worse.  I am concerned by the population covered and the level of investment.  The Government promises plenty of money but none of it seems to land.  The situation in Navan should not be used for political point scoring.</p> <p> I have always said that your health is your wealth.  Please, let us all work together and stop sending different signals.  Let us consider the patient and what is best for everyone.  The communication lines have been dreadful.  Both the HSE and the Government are sending the wrong signals.  The HSE says that it has concerns about the safety of the emergency department at Navan.  This is a bad signal to send at a time when all health services are under pressure and concerns about additional capacity at other hospitals and the ability of people in the Navan area to access emergency and urgent care have not been addressed.</p> <p> This situation has been ongoing for years.  The Minister has let the people of Meath and surrounding areas down.  He promised for years to meet them, but when he met them, he gave them bad news.  I personally believe that he did not have the balls to do that on day one.  Please, sit down with the relevant people, sort the situation out and look after people's health.</p></speech>

We have seen what happened in Monaghan, Ennis and Nenagh.  Ministers act as if they are bystanders at a wake.  All they are missing is the snuff.  They might make the caointe c&aacute;in.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, allowed a wonderful hospital in Carrick-on-Suir to be closed in the middle of Covid - it was used for Covid - and denied the people of her own area, but she will have to deal with them at the ballot box.  I do not know what to say to the Minister.  I always said that the previous Minister, Deputy Harris, would go down in history as the worst Minister for Health ever, but Deputy Stephen Donnelly is surpassing him by the hour.  He is inept.</p>  <p>  The HSE is out of control.  Former taoisigh, Mr. Bertie Ahern and Mr. Brian Cowen, told me that they were going to disband the HSE.  No one in the Government has the gumption to do it.  The HSE is out of control.  The Government might as well be rubbing Vaseline to you know where on a sow.  The HSE does not care about or respect the Government.  It does not respect the patients or elected representatives.  Community nurses, who do a fabulous job in my area, are being moved around for the second time in three years out of fear that they might get to know the people or start feeling empathy towards them.  It is blackguarding of good, honest workers.  Then there are the people in the layers of bureaucracy who are missing in action, MIA.  We can see what is happening in Limerick.  When Nenagh, St. John's and Ennis hospitals are closed, all of the people will be pushed into Limerick.  It will be catastrophic.</p>  <p>  I spoke to Mr. Jonathan Irwin today - a campaigner for sick children, today is his 81st birthday and I wish him well - to see what was happening with the children's hospital.  T&aacute; s&eacute; imithe.  It cannot be seen above ground.  It will cost more than &euro;2 billion now, but those opposite will rub their hands in glee and get their pensions, and to hell with the people.  I remind them that, under the Constitution, they are elected to represent the people, not conglomerates.</p></speech>

We also demand that the Minister for Health immediately remove any reference to the closure of these services from the small hospitals framework.</p>  <p>  I know exactly how the people of Navan feel.  Just last year, I had to drag the Government through the gutter to keep services at Bantry General Hospital open to the public.  A crisis that was flagged well in advance arose when the hospital had no anaesthetist cover.  The people of Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head, Beara Peninsula and parts of west Kerry were left in a scandalous way.  I have no doubt that if not for people power last year, the hospital would have been downgraded.  Bantry General Hospital is one of the best hospitals of its type in the country and I thank our staff for making it the best.  Without them, we would have nothing.  It is sad to think that, if we do not keep our eye on the ball, cuts will be made.  Consider the endoscopy unit at Bantry hospital.  There were promises after promises.  If we had a block laid for every promise, the unit would have been built ten times over.  I promise the people of Bantry that I will keep the Government accountable until the work on the endoscopy unit begins.</p>  <p>  I urge the politicians as well as the public who are served by Navan hospital to fight tooth and nail.  If they accept the closure or downgrading of services, which many people did in west Cork until I launched the Save Bantry Hospital campaign, they will be closed or downgraded.  Consider the fight that we put up for funding for Clonakilty Community Hospital to bring it up to HIQA standards.  That is a right that the people of Clonakilty and the great hospital staff serving them should have, but I needed to drag and kick successive Governments into providing funding to get it across the line.  Hospitals can be the gold standard.  We have that in Schull community hospital, for which we fought and fundraised.  Credit is due to the former Minister, Dr. James Reilly, who delivered the funds to give us a state-of-the-art hospital after others and I met him many years ago.  The hospital is getting glowing reports from HIQA.  I thank the hospital's management and staff for their professionalism down the years and for working with the public on making it the leading community hospital in the country.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, would listen to me.  She was in Bantry last week but turned her back on the ordinary people by not even inviting me.  Now she is talking while I am trying to discuss this urgent matter.</p></speech>

The manner in which they and staff have been treated by the management of UHL is shocking.  Last Friday's HIQA report on UHL confirmed everything that we in the Rural Independent Group had highlighted in the D&aacute;il about overcrowding on trolleys in corridors, but the management structure is where the failure lies.  Why did HIQA take so long to come on board?  The Minister carried out a surprise visit to the hospital, yet he found nothing wrong.  HIQA responds to incidents that are reported by line managers, doctors and other professionals, but serious incidents at UHL were not reported in the national incident management system, NIMS.  Why was this the case?  This is where the problem lies.  Incidents there were not reported by the line managers.  That is why HIQA took so long to figure out what was wrong there.  Under UHL's management structure, people were silenced and had to sign non-disclosure agreements to cover up the incidents.  That is why HIQA was not involved for so long.  Now, I need the Minister's help to ensure that the management of UHL steps down immediately and an investigation is put in place.  Given that the management put so many people in harm's way, cases should be taken against its members through the courts if they are deemed negligent for what they have done to the people of Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and north Kerry.</p></speech>

Speaking on behalf of the Rural Independent Group, we demand the full retention by the Government of accident and emergency services at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  I am grateful to Sinn F&eacute;in for again giving us an opportunity to debate the important issue of health.</p>  <p>  It is annoying for the Opposition that the Minister is doing everything in the world except listening.  Last week, he did nothing to endear himself to anyone, including his colleagues, when he did not keep to the practice.  All members of the Government seem to be doing it now, with Ministers going around the country and believing it is okay to march into a county without informing their colleagues, with whom they are supposed to be working in conjunction.  Even though the Minister is in government, he is supposed to be listening to and working with the people in opposition.  If what is happening is nothing else, it is the height of bad manners.  The Minister is not the only one doing it.  He and other Ministers are going around and not informing representatives who are working on behalf of the people in their constituencies.  All it would involve would be a simple email.  In Jackie Healy-Rae's time when he was in the D&aacute;il, God be good to him, a Minister would not go anywhere without notifying everyone about what he or she was doing because that was the proper thing to do.</p> <p>Enough about that.</p> <p> I want to highlight what is happening in County Kerry.  Over the past ten days, I have been monitoring what has been happening in the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry closely.  Up until a couple of hours ago, I was speaking to people in management there to find out what is happening.  They are at crisis and breaking point.  They are doing everything they can to deal with the amount of people who are going in there.  Their kindness, work ethic and ability to do their jobs is second to none but they need more management and resources and they are not getting it.  Animals can get better and quicker treatment than people can now, and that is a fact.</p></speech>

I concur with everyone else here in asking that Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, and its accident and emergency department be kept open because it is most important.  As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae stated, our accident and emergency department at University Hospital Kerry in Tralee is clogged up day after day.  We have highlighted this here so many times, and the same thing is still happening.  Even today we are hearing that there are 21 people on trolleys and last Thursday and Friday 17 people were on trolleys.  That is not good enough.  No mention is made of the number of people who are waiting on chairs.  When they run out of trolleys, people are put on chairs and they are not counted at all for some reason or another but they are human beings.  When they get sick they go to hospital and they need attention, which they are not getting.  I am glad to take the calls I get on this at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. from an 89-year-old or a 91-year-old woman or man on a trolley and their families are so concerned.  They often say that maybe they should not have taken them into the hospital at all because at least they would be in bed at home.  That is not good enough.</p>  <p>  We have to increase capacity and the number of workers.  I compliment the workers in University Hospital Kerry and in our community hospitals throughout the county, like Kenmare Community Hospital, Killarney Community Hospital and Bantry General Hospital, where we also go.  I compliment the workers on the service we get from them when they are under so much pressure.  The Government has to wake up.  We need to increase capacity at University Hospital Kerry.  We are waiting for consultants and we cannot get nurses.  Why is it that we cannot recruit consultants, nurses or staff in University Hospital Kerry and yet Cork University Hospital and the bigger hospitals have no problem in doing so?  Is it the way the HSE is not offering them enough?  Then we heard this morning that HSE officials or consultants are getting &euro;700,000 per year.  There is no man or woman in this country or in any part of the world worth that kind of money.  The Government has to wake up.  That would comfortably employ 12 people but to give it to one person is ridiculous.</p></speech>

I partially heard the Minister's response to it.  What I heard was slightly surprising in that, on the one hand, the Minister accused Sinn F&eacute;in of playing politics and not going with the clinical advice and, on the other hand, it appeared that he overruled the clinical advice and said they were not going ahead as previously planned.</p>  <p>  UHL and what can go wrong have been brought up on a number of occasions.  The clinical advice at the time was that we needed to consolidate the provision of emergency medicine at UHL, and that is what was done.  On 15 March, there was a surprise visit by HIQA to the hospital.  That was not the first surprise visit; there was one back in 2014 since that consolidation of emergency services was done and a damning report was provided by HIQA back then.  Rather a lot has happened since.  A new accident and emergency department has been built, kitted out and staffed.  There was a surprise visit to the department on 15 March last.  Notwithstanding that, not a lot has changed.  It was a damning report.  I see the Minister nodding in agreement.  I have not heard the Minister comment on it yet but I expect that I will hear him do so.  More than the Minister commenting on it, I expect to see something happen at UHL because it is inadequate.  I cannot go into the matter any further.</p>  <p>  I have accompanied elderly and vulnerable relatives to the hospital and, like many people across Clare, you pray and hope they will not have an accident and be brought there or end their days in there.  The HIQA report stated that the hospital failed to provide dignity to patients.  Everybody wants dignity as a patient but that is especially true for an elderly person in their last moments.  They want dignity, and it is not being provided there.  I had an elderly relative who had a fall in a healthcare setting and an ambulance was being brought.  I begged them not to bring an ambulance and I had to sign forms so that they would not be brought to UHL.  Instead, I bundled that person, who had lost their mobility, into a car and brought them to another healthcare setting and, thankfully, they received the care they needed.  If they had been brought to UHL, they would have sat in a wheelchair or on a trolley in overcrowded conditions, with the attendant risk that they would get an infection - and this was pre Covid - because hospitals are places where, inevitably, despite the best efforts of everybody, people are sick.  If you are there waiting for a long period, you have an increased likelihood of at least encountering an infection there.  That is not something that would worry me terribly on my behalf because I hope I am reasonably healthy but when you have an elderly person whose immune system is inevitably compromised by the conditions that beset them it is a different environment and it is not safe.</p>  <p>  This is being visited upon the people of Navan now.  I do now know whether the accident and emergency department in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, is perfect.  It probably is not and I know the clinical director has recommended that the move take place.  For God's sake, let that move not take place until there is adequate and sufficient capacity in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I heard Deputies who represent Navan say that, and I have heard Deputies who represent Drogheda, including Deputy Nash, say that.  That is exactly what happened in Limerick.  I will not recite the HIQA report.  I know the Minister has read it.  The report refers to: "Circumstances such as the hospital being the only Model 4 hospital in the Midwest region, combined with the hospital experiencing unprecedented numbers of presentations of COVID-19 and non COVID-19 cases to the emergency department."  One of the factors, which is repeated throughout the HIQA report, is the fact that it is the only model 4 hospital in the region.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that it is clinically recommended that accident and emergency department consultants, doctors and nurses have to see a large number of patients to keep their skills up and it is not considered best practice to have small accident and emergency departments where there are small numbers going through.  I appreciate all of that but the alternative we have put in place in Ireland, of which UHL is an example, is not best practice either because it was found that the consistent overcrowding there poses a risk to patients.  It is not that the staff in there are reckless or that they are not doing the best they can; it is simply that the overcrowding poses a risk.  While there is a risk for patients from being in a small emergency department like in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, or in Ennis General Hospital, when it was there, there is equally a risk when the alternative is massive overcrowding.</p>  <p>  What is going to be done about UHL?  I asked the Taoiseach if he was going to take responsibility for remedying this into his Department and if not, what would be done to ensure the situation in Limerick would be remedied.  I know he is not here to defend himself but the Minister for Health is here as is the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, so either of them can defend him.  His response was highly disingenuous.</p></speech>
