The European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted last night that, following those votes, a hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable.  His remarks were effectively endorsed by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party colleague, Mairead McGuinness, MEP, this morning in a radio interview.</p>  <p>  Nobody wants a hard Brexit.  We all cannot reiterate that enough.  However, the indecision of the Westminster Parliament may land us in one, either by accident or by design on the part of some MPs.  However, the one shred of light is that the customs union proposition may be the most politically palatable given that the division on it last evening was lost by only three votes.  The British Cabinet is currently meeting.  As we know by now, we cannot anticipate what it will decide.  Many businesses, farmers and fishermen, as well as communities on the Border and across the island, are petrified as to what will happen on Friday, 12 April.  Last Friday was supposed to be Brexit day but the date was kicked to 12 April, which is only a week away.  If what those eminent people stated this morning comes to pass, we may end up, by accident, in a situation nobody wants.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on the Government to ensure that we are adequately prepared and to begin communicating what are the plans.  We all received a Government leaflet this morning which indicates that without the EU-UK withdrawal agreement "avoiding a hard border will be more challenging and will require detailed discussions".  It also states "In that scenario the outcome, including practical arrangements for citizens and businesses ... will be made public as soon as possible."</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will meet President Macron today and the Chancellor Merkel on Thursday.  Several weeks ago, the Chancellor Merkel asked if Ireland was prepared for what could be a hard Brexit and stated that in the absence of a deal there would be no Irish backstop.  She asked the Taoiseach to outline how the Single Market would be protected between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  She urged officials to get a move on.  The Taoiseach has confirmed in the House that contacts are taking place between Ireland and the European Commission about protecting the Single Market but that he would not share papers or documents.  Is that still the case?  What is on the agenda for the meeting between the Taoiseach President Macron.  Is it about protecting the Single Market and planning for the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Where will today&rsquo;s and Thursday&rsquo;s discussions lead this island?  What is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s view on the likely outcome over the coming days?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200003#A00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for asking his question and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on this matter.  I agree with Michel Barnier and others when they say that, as the days pass, a no-deal Brexit looks like a real possibility.</p><p>Of course, we hope that will not be the case but the country needs to be ready if it is.  The Government is very much focused on working with all other parties in this House to ensure we do everything we can to prepare Ireland for that outcome, which would put huge strain and pressure on many sectors across the country.  We are well prepared in many ways and we go through the detail of that preparation on a regular basis with stakeholders and many others.  State agencies are constantly reaching out and speaking to different sectors and businesses on what they need to do to prepare for Brexit.  I will bring two Brexit papers to Cabinet this evening when it meets at 8.30 p.m. on the Taoiseach's return from Paris.  I assure the Deputy that the no-deal Brexit preparations have intensified significantly in recent days and that will continue.</p> <p> On the difficult issue of how we respond to the challenges of an all-island economy in the context of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union and, therefore, Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, being outside of the customs union and Single Market without any deal in place, we have always said that is a very difficult challenge to respond to for us, as a Government, and the EU collectively.  We have a dual responsibility to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market, of which we are very much a part, and Ireland will not to allow a situation where the UK leaving the European Union without a deal drags Ireland out of the Single Market with it.  We cannot allow that situation.  By that I mean that a response that involves checks in EU ports on all Irish products is not a runner.  That would cause significant damage to our economy and we will not allow it.  What we need to do, and what we are doing now, is to intensify our discussions with the European Commission on how we respond to the dual responsibility of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and relations on this island as best we can while, at the same time, ensuring that we can reassure other EU countries that Ireland is protecting the integrity of the Single Market that we all share.  The Taoiseach has referred to the conversations that have begun on that issue.  There was a meeting last Friday and those discussions will continue into this week.  We must find a way to protect the Single Market's integrity but also avoid physical infrastructure on the Border.  That is something on which we do not have an agreed plan we are working this week, and into next week if necessary, in the context of a no-deal Brexit.</p></speech>

Hope is no longer a strategy.  The T&aacute;naiste has hoped for a long time but, whether by accident or design, it seems we are moving towards a hard Brexit.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke of the challenge of protecting the Single Market while maintaining an all-island economy and said the Government was discussing detail.  Surely that detail should be shared with the House.  It is detail that is relevant to every single citizen of this island, in all 32 counties.  We are their representatives.  I presume that detail is being discussed in Paris today and will be discussed with Chancellor Merkel on Thursday.  However, it is not being discussed in this House.  The Government needs to share that detail and involve us in its planning.  I presume the Taoiseach and President Macron are not discussing their Kylie collections today.  They must be discussing this level of detail.  This House should have some knowledge.  We do not want to be given the entire negotiating strategy but we should have knowledge of the principles and key commitments to which the Taoiseach will sign up with President Macron and Chancellor Merkel on behalf of this island this week.</p></speech>

We will need to continue to work out a plan with the European Commission if the British Government does not follow through on its commitment to solve this problem on this island through regulatory alignment, as a strategy in the context of a no-deal Brexit just as it was committed to in the context of a withdrawal agreement being agreed.</p>  <p>  Let us not forget that as early as December 2017, before a withdrawal agreement was designed or approved, the British Government committed to Ireland and to the EU that as a default position, it would solve the Border challenges on the island of Ireland through regulatory alignment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200005#C00800"><p>Over the last number of months, we have regrettably borne witness to the scale of the crisis facing our health service on the watch of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The debacle surrounding the cost of the national children's hospital rumbles on, nurses and midwives have had to engage in industrial action, one-in-seven consultant posts is vacant and support staff have announced their intention to ballot for industrial action.  All the while, hospital waiting lists continue to grow and hundreds of patients are left on hospital trolleys, day in, day out.</p><p>Last night, in Cork University Hospital, there was a status black escalation declared, with patients attending the emergency department facing extreme delays of up to 12 hours and with services reaching breaking point.  A status black escalation is declared, I understand, when the hospital is at maximum capacity and when it is deemed unsafe to admit further patients.</p><p>There is a capacity crisis in the health service and this is very concerning.  There were 70 people on trolleys in Cork University Hospital this morning, with 570 people on trolleys across the State.  Yesterday, in Limerick, there were more people on trolleys than in Dublin's nine hospitals combined, according to the INMO.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is shocking.</p><p>There are also reports that during the status black escalation up to eight ambulances were lined up outside the accident and emergency at Cork University Hospital waiting to hand over patients.  I am told that one of those ambulances was forced to wait for more than four hours.  That is the sort of situation that puts patient and staff at serious risk and it is unacceptable.</p><p>We have raised the capacity crisis over and over again with the Government over the past number of years - nurses were on the picket line raising this very issue just over a month ago - and all we see by way of response is inaction and indifference on the part of the Minister.  They are the ones who insisted that Deputy Harris remain <i>in situ</i>when we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, tabled a motion of no confidence in him.</p><p>What we need is a robust response.  Last night, in the T&aacute;naiste's own city, things got so bad that a black escalation, the highest level of escalation possible, was declared.  Staff tell us that it is the worst they have ever seen.  The T&aacute;naiste must surely agree that this demands an adequate response.  Can he tell me what is to happen at Cork University Hospital in the first instance, given this escalation over the past 24 hours?</p><p>More generally, what is the Government's plan to respond to the capacity crisis in a manner that will get to the root cause of the problem and address the crisis sooner rather than later?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  She had many questions but I will deal with those relating to Cork University Hospital, CUH, a facility I know well.  This morning, the number of patients waiting on trolleys in Cork University Hospital was 55 and the Health Service Executive, HSE, trolley system reported 431 patients waiting on trolleys nationally.  This is an increase on the same day last year when there were 296 patients on trolleys.  The number of patients waiting on trolleys at Cork University Hospital this morning is exceptionally high.  The HSE has confirmed that South/South West hospital group personnel were on-site and community teams were actively seeking additional community beds to support discharges.  In addition, the national director of acute hospitals in the HSE will visit CUH today.</p>  <p>  The HSE identified specific issues and challenges on the site.  The first was a significant capacity demand mismatch, with high rates of attendance and admission and a low rate of discharges.  The hospital remains in full capacity protocol, with the highest trolley count this year on the site.  Key actions are now under way in Cork University Hospital to improve the position for patients and these include full mobilisation of all resources, escalation meetings with both the group chief executive officer and chief compliance officer and meetings scheduled with consultants.  There is to be a review of diagnostics and cancellation of diagnostics tomorrow and Thursday.  Community health organisation representatives are on the site to review patients for transfer to step-down facilities and there will be identification of patients to expedite transfers to local rehabilitation units.  There will be utilisation of private capacity, with five beds being made available in the Mater Private.  There will also be use of private ambulances to transfer patients.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that a serious challenge has arisen in CUH as of last night and again today.  We are responding with the seriousness that is needed.  We need to and are putting the extra resources and the priority systems in place to respond to that in accordance with the needs of patients there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200006#D00300"><p>The status black escalation, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, is essentially a declaration that a hospital is no longer safe.  In Cork University Hospital, as I said, the position was unsafe for patients in the first instance but also for staff.  Some of those staff, who have worked within the system for decades and up to 30 years, told us directly that they have never seen the like of this before.  It was dangerous.  I described the scenario for the T&aacute;naiste, with ambulances lined up outside the hospital and one that I know of that waited for more than four hours to hand over a patient.  This is a very serious accident waiting to happen and it is playing out on this Government's watch.  I am advised that the actions described by the T&aacute;naiste, including the various meetings, are standard procedure in any event for hospitals on a full capacity protocol.  The T&aacute;naiste has not described for us any kind of emergency intervention commensurate with the crisis that has unfolded at this hospital.</p>  <p>  I ask the T&aacute;naiste again what additional action this Government will take to intervene in the case of Cork University Hospital.  When will he accept there is a capacity crisis within the system?  What are the plans of the Minister for Health and the Government to address it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200006#D00400"><p>I know Cork University Hospital well and I know many people working there.  I accept that today there is huge stress on the system in the hospital and the management is responding to that as best it can.  There are two issues.  The first is today's pressure, which is difficult for the staff on site.</p><p>They are working together to deal with that.  The medium-term issue here is about capacity, which is why the Government is increasing capacity and has been doing so month on month.  It will continue to do that.  If we look at the increasing number of beds being funded and provided, we will see it moving in only one direction.  The truth is we need more beds in our system.  We have the budgets and plan to increase the number of beds, not just in Cork but in other parts of the country.  The Deputy mentioned Limerick.  There is a commitment to increase bed capacity in Limerick through a 60-bed modular unit that is funded and committed to this year.  There is a recognition that more investment and more capacity are needed and they are provided.  In the short term, particularly through winter months, we need to ensure that management systems are in place that, in general terms, deliver reductions in the number of people on trolleys.  There is an acute problem in Cork that was seen last night and again today which is getting the emergency response that is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1240" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200007#E00200"><p>Regarding Brexit, the world and its mother are conscious that Westminster and its parliamentary system are chaotic.  It is a shambles of epic proportions and it is difficult to comprehend the magnitude of the disastrous management of Brexit by the UK Government and Parliament.  That incompetence underlines how crucial it is to have stability of Government here and to have our Oireachtas united in defence of the national interest.  It is fair and appropriate to acknowledge the solid contribution of the T&aacute;naiste during a time of pending crisis by striking a correct balance throughout a complex process.</p>  <p>  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the T&aacute;naiste is aware that the UK and Ireland are each other's largest export market for food and drink.  Therefore, it is the sector that is most exposed to any negative economic impact of the UK Brexit decision.  Borders and tariffs between the UK and Ireland would have a disastrous effect on our agricultural industry.  Therefore, access to the UK market is crucially important in all negotiations.  If access is curtailed, a substantial trade agreement must be the main objective in negotiations whereby free trade for agricultural products and food between the UK and Ireland is established.  </p>  <p>  Proper contingency plans are needed as beef farmers are threatened with income reductions of up to 40%.  The UK is a high-value market for beef with prices usually above the EU average.  We are also aware that the UK leaving the EU potentially reduces the CAP budget by up to &euro;3 billion annually.  Teagasc estimates that farm incomes could fall by 26% putting the livelihoods of some 100,000 farmers involved in livestock and beef production in danger and resulting in thousands of job losses.  This level of fallout will have catastrophic consequences throughout rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  What plans are in place regarding a contingency trade agreement that will alleviate concerns regarding our access to the UK market and guarantee a free flow of agricultural products moving from here to the UK with the highest standards of quality being maintained?</p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about substantial structural and adjustment funding aids, which will be necessary for our farmers to ensure there is a smooth transition period and that trade either continues or resumes.  Is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied with the level of preparation regarding the bloodstock industry and the movement of race horses and bloodstock between here, Northern Ireland and the UK?</p></speech>

In a no-deal scenario, there will be a very significant support package for farmers in the Republic.  We are working with the European Commission to ensure the Commission plays its role in that as well.</p><p>We are fortunate to have a Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development who understands the Irish agriculture industry very well.  However, in the context of a no-deal Brexit and the imposition of tariffs not only between Britain and Ireland, but also, potentially, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with goods coming south, the all-island economy as it functions today, from an agrifood and agricultural perspective, would be significantly disrupted.  Therefore, our focus now is on working with the European Commission on how we would respond to that to keep people in business and protect farm incomes.</p> <p> The beef industry is particularly impacted in this regard.  Of the 130,000 farm families in Ireland, 100,000 get some income from beef, and 70,000 get all their farm income from beef.  Of all our beef exports, 53%, which is about 85% of all the beef produced, is exported to the UK, which is the highest-paying market in the world.  If one imposes significant tariffs on what is a tight-margin business, one does a lot of damage.  We are aware of this, which is why this is not an inexpensive problem to which to respond.</p> <p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and they have been preparing a contingency no-deal plan.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to have a contingency trade agreement in place, either between Ireland and Britain or between the EU and Britain, in the short term.  This is why the British Government published its contingency plan regarding tariffs and the approach on the island of Ireland in the context of a no-deal.  If a no-deal happens, Ireland and the EU and the UK will act independently of one another to protect markets, but it will be a very difficult period if that happens.  As I said, we are in the process of finalising a detailed and significant plan to support farming through a no-deal, should it happen.  The supports for farmers have already begun.  In the most recent budget there was a package of approximately &euro;78 million for farmers.  I think about 830 farmers from Tipperary have applied for the new beef support programme, which is a &euro;20 million plan, but we need to be straight with people here.  If a no-deal Brexit happens, the pressures on agriculture and farming in Ireland will need a significant Government and EU response, and they will get that.</p></speech>

Farmers and beef producers in Tipperary and throughout the country are concerned for their futures.  They seek assurances from the Government, the kinds of assurances the T&aacute;naiste is giving us today, that contingency plans will be in place to protect their livelihoods.  They need to be confident that the Government will stand by the industry by providing the necessary market conditions and the financial support for survival.  If he could, the T&aacute;naiste might refer to the bloodstock industry.</p></speech>

I assure other Deputies that our plans are not based on hope; they are based on putting detailed contingency arrangements in place that are funded to deal with all eventualities.</p>  <p>  Regarding the bloodstock industry, and I think this is also the case with the movement of animals from South to North in a no-deal scenario, there will be challenges in protecting against the spread of disease, so the appropriate systems will need to be in place to ensure that the integrity of the herd in the Single Market, from a disease management point of view, is protected.</p><p>That will pose difficulties because we will not support checks on the Border.  This is part of the conversation we are having with the European Commission about how we might be able to do that.</p></speech>

The plan and the extremely faulty process associated with it have been subject to questions and concerns.  Those questions have yielded few answers to date.  The provision of effective and affordable broadband services across the country is, of course, a priority.  We are, however, yet to be convinced that the provision of such services will be done in a cost-effective, transparent and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  Serious concerns have been raised about the ability of the single remaining bidder, a consortium led by a US investment fund, to deliver on the project in the medium and long term.  As a country, we are proposing to heavily subsidise the construction of a network that the private sector will then own.  The same consortium, Enet, managed the metropolitan area networks, MANs, contract up to relatively recently.  During that time, there was an absence of price transparency and we had some of the most expensive broadband in Europe.  We cannot afford to heavily subsidise infrastructure only to find that it is underused.  </p>  <p>  While we were initially told the cost of the national broadband plan would be around &euro;500 million, the Government and departmental officials have now conceded that the ultimate cost will be multiples of that figure.  I expect the T&aacute;naiste will respond with arguments about the importance of servicing rural Ireland.  Will he guarantee that rural Ireland will not suffer as a result of initiatives being removed from Project Ireland 2040 to pay for the national broadband plan?  The lack of competitive tension in the process, with only one remaining bidder, raises the question of whether the Government is certain the process is robust.  If it proceeds, will it be the best possible deal?  Is there a plan B or are we likely to be bounced into something that looks like it will cost billions rather than hundreds of millions of euro purely because we have supposedly gone too far in a flawed process?  This smacks of lessons not having been learned from the national children's hospital shambles.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has previously warned that the national broadband plan may not proceed if there is a no-deal Brexit.  We all hope such a scenario will not arise.  If the national broadband plan is a casualty of a no-deal Brexit, could that mean, given its importance, that Project Ireland 2040 will require a complete revision?  How much has been set aside in Project Ireland 2040 for the national broadband plan?  I ask that question given the Government has conceded that the national broadband plan will cost multiples of &euro;500 million.  From where is the extra money likely to come?  What other projects earmarked in Project Ireland 2040 are likely to suffer as a result of the significant extra funding that will be required?</p></speech>

We all have a responsibility to work to that end.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across Ireland and a State intervention in those areas, mostly rural, where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.  The national broadband plan has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  In 2012, fewer than 700,000, or 30%, of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high-speed broadband.  Today, 74% of premises can access high-speed broadband.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has said that he wants to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  He has stated he will bring a proposal to Government for approval before Easter, in other words, in the next couple of weeks.</p><p> The ultimate cost to the State of delivering high-speed broadband to more than 500,000 premises in the intervention area was always going to be determined by the procurement process relating to the national broadband plan.  This was part of its design and enables the subsidy required to be identified in advance of the Government making a final decision to proceed.  We will, therefore, be making a decision with our eyes wide open in respect of cost.  It is clearly not going to be cheap.  We will now have to make a decision on whether we want to proceed.  The cost is high due to the significant ambition of the project and the scale of the build.  This one-off intervention will provide broadband to approximately 540,000 premises and will involve the laying of fibre along more than 100,000 km of road across 96% of the landmass of Ireland.  It will result in high speeds of 150 Mbps, which will increase to 500 Mbps by the tenth year.  The customer charge needs to be the same in rural and urban areas.  The plan involves operating the network in a future-proofed way for the next 25 years.</p> <p> The Minister is trying to ensure that the test the Deputy suggests, that this be cost-effective, transparent, and sustainable into the future, will be met.  He will have to bring a proposal before Cabinet and we will need to make a collective decision.  I suspect there will also be a lot of outreach to other parties in this House to ensure that this is done in a fully transparent way.  If we make the decision to go ahead with the plan, we will be investing with a full understanding of what it will cost and of what we will get for that expenditure over the next 25 years.</p></speech>

Will Project Ireland 2040 have to be revisited?  From where will the extra money come?  We have been told by the Taoiseach and departmental officials that it is going to cost multiples of &euro;500 million, so what is going to fall out of the Project Ireland 2040 plan?  These are very important questions and we want to hear an answer to them.  We were told that the outline of the tender would be brought before the D&aacute;il in advance of a contract being signed.  Will that be subject to a vote of the D&aacute;il?  That is important.  These are the questions I want answered.</p></speech>

I do not know what the cost is going to be; it has not come before Cabinet yet.  As a result, I am not able to give the Deputy an answer.  Without that answer, I cannot give her an indication of the implications of that cost in the context of Project Ireland 2040.  I would have thought that was self-evident.  We need the Minister to bring a proposal before Cabinet and, ultimately, before this House first so that we can make a decision as to whether it represents value for money with regard to what we are trying to achieve at the end of a long process.  One of the reasons this has taken time is that only one entity is still tendering.  This means that the cost-benefit analysis needs to be very robust in order to ensure that the State gets full value for money.  That process is now coming to an end.  The Minister will bring a proposal to Cabinet for its consideration when he has one ready.  We will then have a much clearer understanding of what this will cost and I will then be able to answer the questions the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste may know that Electric Ireland and PrePayPower have announced price increases for gas and electricity, raising the cost of living further for ordinary working families.  This follows on from an increase last year despite the fact that we in this State already have some of the highest energy costs in the EU.</p>  <p>  The announcement comes just days after the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il came together to propose imposing carbon tax increases on those who can least afford them.  Any increase in carbon taxes on top of the price hikes will hit each and every household.  Carbon tax increases will not change behaviour or help the environment, but they will put further pressure on families in the midst of a growing cost-of-living crisis.  Will the Government do the right thing and take the prospect of increasing carbon taxes off the table and give those working families a break?</p></speech>

It makes a very strong case, not only for investing in changing the way we produce power at a business and home level, but for carbon tax forming a part of the solution to encouraging a change in behaviour.  No one is proposing a dramatic increase in carbon tax in the short term.  Rather, we are talking about setting a target for 2030 and incremental increases until then so that people can know the trajectory of this cost and be encouraged to consider more sustainable and renewable ways of heating their homes.</p></speech>

That has led to important improvements in air quality and it is estimated to have saved 350 lives per year through the reduction in smog and particulate matter in the atmosphere.  A nationwide ban on smoky coal was announced by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, in 2015 following discussions he had with the European Commission.  A year was given to prepare the industry for that transition but it appears the current Government is dragging its feet on this commitment, even though towns across Ireland desperately need this measure.  A person from Enniscorthy contacted me because air quality in the town has exceeded a dangerous threshold on several occasions.  That is replicated in many other smaller towns.  We understand the ban will now take place from September of this year.  A number of suppliers are awaiting a decision by the Government before they invest while many others have invested already.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the ban will be implemented from September onwards?  When will the statutory instrument be signed?</p></speech>

This was not as straightforward as it might sound.  It is impossible to justify the use of smoky coals in this day and age but a transition period was needed because many small business operators were continuing to supply that type of coal.  It is the Government's intention to move ahead with this ban.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

Today, for the fifth day, 500 paramedic and ambulance crews are out on strike, with a sixth day scheduled for 10 April.  The Government has appointed a new chief executive officer to the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, who will earn &euro;300,000 a year, a very handsome sum indeed.  That should enable him, at the very least, to attempt a solution to this dispute.  Does Mr. Reid want to pick a row with 500 medical staff over their choice of representation while the HSE and the Government are up to their proverbials in several health crises?  Can we find a solution?  This group of workers is simply asking that they be represented by an organisation of their choice.  For the third time, the HSE has been written to by the machine of the State, the Workplace Relations Commission, asking it to come in and negotiate on this issue and it is still refusing to do so.  Will &euro;300,000 a year allow the HSE boss to sort this out or what will it take to stop the escalation of this dispute?</p></speech>

Why is the Taoiseach able to write to Kylie Minogue asking for a meeting but is unable to write a letter to the HSE asking it to recognise a group of workers in a union of 500?  Is it by any chance because the Minister for Health is being dictated to by a larger union or is it now Government policy only to deal with unions that it believes toe the party line?  What is going on?  Why is this happening?  These workers are using the slogan, "Our union, our choice", and that should be recognised and respected.</p></speech>

The 24-hour accident and emergency departments in Bantry and Mallow were closed a number of years ago and now, despite the concerns of people in west Cork, ambulances must transport patients to Cork University Hospital.  Those in the west of the county are worried about capacity at the hospital and they even came to the D&aacute;il in buses in order to protest and highlight the issues.  Yesterday evening, a code black notice was issued in Cork University Hospital because the emergency department was completely overcrowded.  Eight ambulances were backed up at one point.  This left west Cork with a depleted ambulance service.  Ambulance staff - whom we know cannot even have their own union - due to end their shift at 8 p.m. had to work until 3 a.m.  The emergency department was totally overcrowded, with reports of people sitting on the floor and queueing out the door.  This morning, 70 patients were waiting for beds in Cork University Hospital.  It is clear there is a lack of capacity in the hospital to deal with the extra patients resulting from the closure of the 24-hour accident and emergency department in Bantry.  Will consideration be given to opening the emergency assessment units in Bantry and Mallow for longer hours and possibly on a 24-hour basis?</p></speech>

In recent times we have been informed that cervical tests were being delayed because of a lack of capacity in the laboratories that test them but over the weekend it was reported that women paying privately receive their results in two to three weeks, which is brilliant for them but not for the 78,000 women who have been waiting up to 28 weeks.  They are all being done by the same laboratory, MedLab.  I want clarification on what is happening.  Why is this happening?  How can a private smear test be prioritised over those of the 78,000 women to whom I refer?</p></speech>

The Minister for Health single-handedly caused this backlog and he has failed to get to grips with it.  MedLab treats patients and deals with women in rural Ireland, so women in all of the rural constituencies wait much longer than others.  The wait to get a smear result has increased from five or six weeks to eight months.  Women are being informed that their tests have expired and that they must come back in for further repeat smear tests, having sought repeat tests in the first instance because they were worried.  These repeat tests were meant to provide reassurance.  What is the Government doing to fix the problem?  Where is the extra capacity?  Where are the additional resources?  When will the backlog be cleared?</p></speech>

This is a capacity issue.  We cannot develop increased capacity in Ireland in the short term so we need to source it in other parts of the world.  This is what the HSE is endeavouring to do and, for the first time, I have a note which suggests that it has secured capacity and is trying to finalise contractual arrangements in this regard.</p></speech>

The average national income is &euro;38,500.  A person who earns &euro;38,500 would require almost ten times that amount in order to afford to buy an average house in Dublin.  Fine Gael in government has been promising an affordable housing scheme for at least five years.  The T&aacute;naiste did so on many occasions when he was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We have yet to see the regulations for an affordable housing scheme.  The Government has been long-fingering this for at least two years.  Local authorities are waiting to see what the Government is talking about with regard to affordable housing.  They have umpteen sites that could be developed for affordable housing, which is much needed, but there has been an undue delay regarding to the regulations.

Although the zones have not by any means brought rent affordability to where it should, they have, at least, had an impact in keeping rents in the areas worst hit by rental increases closer to being under control.  However, there has been no definitive indication by the Government as to whether it intends to renew the rent pressure zone legislation at the end of the year or under what set of circumstance it would so do.  Many people would face enormous rent hikes if the zones lapsed and are living with that uncertainty.

All Members know there are plans for the N4 and N5.  However, the hold-up in the work on the N5 is extremely concerning.

The out-of-hours service is a genuine problem.  Let me give the example of a young man who has a long history with the service.  He self-harms but when he arrives at the service out of hours, there is no registrar and nobody there to see him.  There is a junior registrar on call but that person is also working in the main hospital and is seeing patients there.  A backup service is supposed to be in place but the young man sits and waits for four to five hours without any service and then has to go.  This has happened on numerous occasions because of the current circumstances at St. Columba's.  I want the Government to commit to proper staffing.  A new mental health service is being built on the grounds of the Sligo University Hospital but we need proper staffing.

In this context, there is concern that physical damage was done by the HSE orthodontic service in the Dublin-mid-Leinster area between 1999 and 2002.  The HSE commissioned a report into this complaint.  The report, which was compiled by two independent external dental professionals from the UK, was provided to the Department of Health in 2015 but has not yet been published.  An audit of the 7,500 children involved has been carried out.  Why has the report not been published?  When will the audit into the unpublished report be completed?</p></speech>

It was raised with me by Deputy Calleary earlier.  The statement of concern relates to concerns raised by two consultant orthodontists about the delivery of orthodontic services in the Dublin-mid-Leinster area between 1999 and 2001.  The concern relates to interrupted orthodontic treatment.  In some cases, braces were left in place for longer than required.</p></speech>

Last week, I tabled a parliamentary question to look for figures for the past three years.  According to an article by Evelyn Ring in this morning's<i>Irish Examiner</i>, over &euro;1.2 billion has been spent on biological drugs in the last three years.  In the same period, just &euro;2.2 million has been spent on biosimilar drugs.  I have pointed out time and again that an annual saving of &euro;100 million is available to the HSE if it uses biosimilar products.  That &euro;100 million could be spent on drugs like Spinraza, which is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy.  Alternatively, it could be spent on the autism services that I am continually following up with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Nobody is taking up this possible saving.  What do we have to do to get efficiency in the HSE?  It is scandalous that this money is being left behind year after year.</p></speech>

Last week, an 86 year old man who attends a day centre in Virginia received a letter from the HSE requesting a &euro;4 charge on his daily returns.  Elderly constituents of mine who attend the millennium club in Tydavnet, County Monaghan, have received similar letters requesting &euro;4 daily payments.  It does not sound like much, but it is almost &euro;1,000 at the end of the year.  I raised the same matter with the Taoiseach last week because people with disabilities have also received letters asking them for money for their public transport.  My constituency has very little public transport.  The charges being implemented by the HSE will affect the most vulnerable people in Cavan-Monaghan - the elderly and people with disabilities - and will exacerbate rural isolation.  As a result, they will have to stay at home.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to intervene to see what is happening here.  It is a matter of communication between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The free travel pass should be acceptable.  These people should not have to pay to travel to their ordinary day services.</p></speech>

With these concerns in mind, I met with the Dublin Port Company recently regarding its capital development plans and rationale for prioritisation in the context of Brexit, as well as the specifics with regard to cruise berths.</p>  <p>  At the meeting, Dublin Port outlined the ambitious development programme under way to provide additional cargo handling capacity to cater for our growing economy.  Given space constraints, it was explained that cruise berths will have to be limited for a period from 2021 onwards to allow this construction work to take place, while ensuring the port can continue to handle large cargo volumes.  It is expected the period of disruption will be two to three years and will impact on three cruise seasons.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, Dublin Port confirmed it will operate a full cruise season in 2019 and 2020.  Although the subsequent temporary reduction in berths available to cruise calls is regrettable, the company intends to build cruise calls back to 150 ships for the 2024-2025 season.  The company is also considering the potential for a significant additional investment which would increase capacity for cruise liner berthing to over 200 ships.  Consideration of that investment is at an early stage and would be conditional on some factors outside of Dublin Port's control, such as securing the necessary finance and securing long-term guarantees from the cruise industry.</p>  <p>  With regard to the wider tourism industry, in my meeting with the company, I emphasised the need for the Dublin Port Company to take account of the broader impacts of its commercial decisions.  This includes the effect on sectors supporting the cruise tourism industry or serving cruise visitors, not just in Dublin but in other ports and associated regions.  While Dublin Port is important in attracting cruise liners to Ireland through Dublin, the benefits that accrue to other ports around our coast are significant.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, Cobh continues as a dedicated cruise berth and will remain so post Brexit.  The Port of Cork is working with Belfast Harbour to see if it can take some of the additional business which may be lost as a result of Dublin Port's infrastructural works.  In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the development and promotion of the cruise tourism sector.</p></reply>

The stakeholders claim there was very much a lack of information given to them on this point.  I accept there are capacity issues at the port because of the significant growth in its freight business.  That in itself must be welcomed.  However, it should not be to the detriment of the leisure cruise industry.</p>  <p>  While freight might be more profitable for the port, the company has a responsibility to ensure key tourism sectors are protected also.  Last year, 442,000 visitors on cruise liners came to Dublin which contributed &euro;50 million to the economy, not insignificant by any manner or means.</p>  <p>  I know from an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that the Minister met with the chief executive officer of the Dublin Port Company last month.  Does the Minister meet regularly with the company on its growth and needs, given its centrality to the economy?  Was he aware of this announcement in advance?  Has he met with the key stakeholders and representative group of the cruise line industry?  The Minister said this will only be a temporary arrangement and that a significant investment will be made.  He also made the point that no funding has yet been secured for that investment, however.</p></speech>

There is no lack of communication normally.</p>  <p>  The chief executive has made it quite clear that this is a temporary blip.  There is no intention that the reduction in the number of cruise ships will last for more than two years.  It is expected the numbers will go up subsequently.

Are the resources for that investment ring-fenced?  If not, how can the Minister be confident that this will be a blip and a short-term problem?</p></speech>

The Deputy is well aware of the pressures of freight and cargo on Dublin Port.  It is not a matter of making a choice of one or the other.  It is about ensuring cargo is secured and there is enough space for it.</p>  <p>  I was surprised by the timing of this particular announcement, although people were aware of it brewing.  A significant investment in the port is needed.  The company has made it quite clear that it will be looking to the cruise industry to contribute towards that investment if it is going to complete the necessary construction to bring numbers up from 160 to 200 liners.  The company predicts confidently that it would be possible if the investment were forthcoming.  I am also confident it is forthcoming because Ireland has a great future in this regard.</p><p>On cruise tourism, the Deputy asked about stakeholders.  I have already asked the main stakeholders to come to a meeting in about two weeks' time to discuss the matter raised by the Deputy in the broader national interest.  </p></speech>

While the Government does not regulate sport, Sport Ireland is an independent statutory body whose functions include responsibility for governance oversight of NGBs.  All of the sporting bodies that are funded by Sport Ireland are required to comply with high standards of good governance, including appropriate financial oversight.  Sport Ireland periodically reviews governance and oversight in the bodies it supports.</p>  <p>  I have made it clear that all sporting bodies in receipt of public funding must take appropriate steps to adopt the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.  The Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 recognises the importance of good governance for the effective and efficient running of sport and it includes an action that Sport Ireland will oversee a process to have all national governing bodies and local sports partnerships, LSPs, adopt the governance code by the end of 2021.  I, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and Sport Ireland have made it clear that future funding for NGBs and LSPs will be conditional on compliance with the principles of the governance code.  After 2021, NGBs and LSPs that are not fully compliant with the code will be at serious risk of losing their Sport Ireland funding and will be required to explain their position.</p>  <p>  While I have had no direct engagement with the association mentioned by the Deputy regarding its compliance with the governance code, at my direction, officials in my Department contacted the association to underline the importance of introducing maximum term limits for members of its board.  A decision on term limits was taken in early February at an extraordinary general meeting of the association and brought the association into compliance with one of the requirements of the governance code.  The association is not yet fully compliant with all of the requirements of the code.  In the current circumstances, I would welcome full compliance sooner rather than later.  Clearly, the recent media reports regarding the organisation have raised serious questions about governance and financial controls in the organisation.  Sport Ireland is engaged with the organisation to clarify these matters and when the necessary clarifications have been received, Sport Ireland will report to me.</p>  <p>  In the interests of due process and natural justice, it is important that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the organisation be given the necessary time to ensure that all matters are addressed thoroughly by the association.  I do not wish to comment today on any possible outcome from this ongoing process.  However, I can say that I will publish the material that I receive from Sport Ireland.  I expect to receive material from Sport Ireland this week and I will publish that material as soon as possible, most likely by the end of this week.</p></reply>

I put the question in light of the news that the Football Association of Ireland had just recently changed its rules to allow long-serving board members to remain <i>in situ</i>for an additional four-year term.  Of the 11 members of the FAI board, seven have served more than 11 years, two have served more than 15 years and John Delaney, who was on the board, served 17 years, including 14 as chief executive officer.  This clearly contradicts the governance code because the recommended term limit is nine years or three terms of three years.</p><p>I also ask the question in light of the recent financial irregularities which have come to light since I asked my question a month ago.  The response of the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, at the time was that governance was a matter for the FAI and Sport Ireland and he had no engagement with the FAI regarding the code.  He also said he understood that the FAI is on a journey to the adoption of the code.  Given all that has recently come to light, that is one hell of a journey the association is on.  Does the Minister stand over that response?</p></speech>

As I said, I will release whatever material Sport Ireland sends to me to the Deputy and anyone else who wants it, hopefully by the end of the week.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State correctly informed the Deputy, Sport Ireland is responsible for governance.  I understand the FAI has established a governance committee whose remit is to ensure the association is compliant with the code.  The Deputy will know that on Monday, 4 February, members of the FAI ratified the introduction of eight-year term limits for board members.  Sport Ireland understands this to be a maximum of two four-year terms.  As part of the rule changes and in order to avoid an immediate loss of experience and expertise, it agreed that any board member who is a chairperson of a standing committee or the national league executive committee and who has served for more than ten years on the board may be re-elected for up to four years.  Sport Ireland supports the adoption of the governance code and views the introduction of term limits for directors as an important step for all funded bodies on the journey and transition to adoption of the governance code by 2021.  As I said, I would prefer if the FAI had been fully compliant by now but it will be fully compliant by 2021.</p></speech>

He did not answer that part of the question.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity to do so today.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to imposing penalties.  If, for instance, the bridging loan of &euro;100,000 is deemed to be in breach of the governance code on the basis that Sport Ireland was not informed, at what stage would the Minister consider imposing penalties?  What must happen before the Minister will consider imposing penalties as this is not clear?</p>  <p>  Is the Minister satisfied that Sport Ireland's oversight procedures are sufficient given that all of this happened while it was responsible for oversight and under its watchful eye, as it were?</p></speech>

That is out of the question.  Sport Ireland has robust arrangements in place attached to the funding it provides to sporting bodies, including the Football Association of Ireland.  As part of Sport Ireland's normal processes and procedures relating to the annual grant cycle, national governing bodies in receipt of grant funding are required to submit a copy of their financial statements.  This must include a statement from their auditor that each grant was expended in accordance with the approved submission of the grant funding.  An absolutely compelling case has been made over the years that funding should be held from any national governing bodies that are not abiding by the governance rules established for their particular category.  That is a principle that we must keep to and we will do so.  We are giving some of them, perhaps a large number of them, a little time to get their corporate governance into order.  If they have not done so by 2021, funding should be withheld.</p></speech>

The big change in the preferred route is the method by which the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, propose to deal with those issues.</p><p>The NTA-TII proposal is now to move forward immediately on two fronts: developing MetroLink from Charlemont to Swords and also completing the green line capacity enhancement project already under way.  They now propose to defer the third element of the previous proposal, which is to tie-in the metro with the existing Luas green line and extend metro services southward along that line.</p><p>The Luas green line expansion programme, which is already under way, will see extended trams begin to arrive this year and will by 2021 see all 26 trams extended to 55 m and also introduce eight additional trams and increase capacity by approximately 37%.</p><p>It is also proposed incrementally to increase capacity further on the green line over the medium term so that it can handle around 11,000 passengers per direction per hour, which is an increase of approximately 70% from today.  Then in the longer term, perhaps 20 years from today, the tunnelling work proposed to be completed now as part of MetroLink will facilitate a later tie-in with the green line.</p><p>I welcome the level and depth of public engagement with the project so far and commend the NTA and TII for the proactive way in which they have engaged with communities and the public at large.  There is a series of further public information sessions planned for this round of public consultation, as well as a wealth of information published on the MetroLink website.  I recognise also that there are still issues which require consideration and consultation with different groups and NTA-TIl are committed to doing just that.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In so-called &quot;megaprojects&quot; like this, the importance of this period of front-end planning is well recognised internationally as being crucial to a project's overall success.  I also think it important that we approach projects such as this in as open and transparent a manner as possible in order to deal with some of the misinformation and confusion which can arise.</p><p>In terms of timelines, this phase of consultation will end on 21 May and the NTA-TII will then finalise its business case for submission to my Department and ultimately the sanction of Government.  They expect to apply for a railway order in Q2 next year and then, subject to planning, to move forward with construction during 2021.</p></speech>

I cannot hold the Minister, Deputy Ross, responsible for all of that.</p>  <p>  There is scepticism out there as to whether this will ever be delivered.  It is the fifth time there have been proposed changes in Deputy Ross's tenure.  Is the route being designed around the Cabinet table or is it being designed by the NTA and TII because, during a Topical Issue debate a number of months ago, in response to two Government Deputies the Minister stated there would be no separation of metro north and metro south?  Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted for the most recent project which will see the metro stop at Charlemont?  On what advice was this route change undertaken?  Were other options, such as extending the route in the south-west direction, looked at?  What impact will this have on the delivery of MetroLink?  As I asked at the outset, when is construction of this project due to begin and due to end?</p></speech>

First, this current consultation phase will run until the end of May.  The NTA and TII will then work on finalising a business case for submission to the Government.  The Government must then approve the business case before it can progress to planning.  The NTA then expects a railway order application by the second quarter of 2020.  A statutory consultation process will be held by the board and, dependant on planning etc., construction is hoped to start in 2021.</p>  <p>  This was not designed around the Cabinet table.  Deputies, Senators, councillors and Ministers are entitled to their opinions as they represent a large number of people, but there has been a public consultation going on at various times and at various stages of this project.  Indeed, members of the public, as other representatives, are entitled to contribute to that.  No doubt they have done so in an orthodox and regular way.</p></speech>

The Minister might be a little more specific, even in terms of which quarter in 2021.</p><p>I will ask again: has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted for the most recent iteration of the project.  That is a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question.</p><p>On what advice was the route change undertaken?  Were external consultants brought on board in relation to this change?

Those considerations have been made on a thorough basis and the judgment has been made that there is not the population there to merit a Luas extension to there at present.</p>  <p>  There are plenty of other candidates for Luas extension.  There are plenty of others which are in the transport strategy as well which the Deputy would be aware of.  They include the Luas green line to Bray, the Luas cross city to Finglas and the Luas to Poolbeg.</p></speech>

It also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme, RTP, which now operates under the Local Link brand.</p>  <p>  The NTA has advised that in 2018 it embarked on a process to procure transport co-ordination units, TCUs, branded as Local Link offices, to manage the contracted bus services funded under the RTP.  The NTA's objective was to establish a process for the procurement of TCUs which is fully in line with all EU and national procurement requirements.  The Deputy will appreciate that the procurement of TCU's was run by the NTA and I have no role in the process.</p>  <p>  I understand that the existing TCU agreements were due to expire on 31 December 2018 and that the NTA concluded that new TCU agreements must be awarded pursuant to a competitive contract process.  Under the procurement process, tenderers were permitted to tender for up to four lots out of a total of 20 lots.</p>  <p>  The NTA has confirmed that it intends entering into funding agreements for the provision of transport co-ordination unit services to the preferred tenderers.</p><p>The NTA has also confirmed that this procurement process will cause no reduction or change in transport services.  The impact of the process will be a change in the local level management of the services but not a change in the services themselves.  The outcome will allow TCUs to plan for the longer term with greater certainty, as well as ensuring best value for money for public funds.  Moreover, it will allow the NTA to define services required and continue to monitor performance in the delivery of those services, as well as protecting the NTA and the TCUs from any potential state aid issues.</p> <p> The Deputy has specifically referred to for-profit and non-profit companies in his question.  The NTA has confirmed that all companies performing TCU duties on behalf of the NTA over the 2014 to 2018 period were registered charities.  The NTA has also advised that all the preferred tenderers to perform TCU duties on behalf of the NTA over the 2019 to 2022 period are also registered charities.</p></speech>

Following the tendering process, Clare Accessible Transport has lost the contract and the transport co-ordination unit will now be transferred to west Limerick.  The National Transport Authority has responsibility in this regard but my question relates to quality.  As a result of awarding the tender to a Limerick company, a very successful model will be broken up; it is demonstrated as one of the most efficient in the country, according to the NTA's report from 2018.  The transfer of the co-ordination unit to Limerick will reduce the quality of the service as it was a bespoke service that operated six days per week.  A person could book transport one hour in advance and the system was very flexible, allowing buses to go to people's homes to pick them up.  The service is 100% disabled-accessible but we are concerned that the transfer of the unit from Clare to Limerick will reduce the quality of the service and interfere with its flexibility.  It will not lead to the betterment of patients and people in County Clare.</p></speech>

As a human being, I am absolutely sympathetic with what he says and as a representative I can understand his point of view.  If he says quality has suffered, particularly with respect to accessibility with some of the buses, I regret that on a personal level.  My understanding is this process is carried out by the NTA under European Union rules.  As the Deputy knows, this procurement is something in which I cannot and will not interfere under any circumstances.  On the other hand, I am perfectly happy to convey what he said to the appropriate quarters so they can be aware of it.  As far as I know, the Deputy is not querying the process but rather the result.  If he is querying the result, it is a somewhat different area.</p></speech>

These are not-for-profit companies that do not have the resources to go to the High Court if they feel a service is going to be reduced.  As I said, Clare Accessible Transport has integrated its transport co-ordination unit with the provision of service through its drivers.  The quality of service provided by Clare Accessible Transport is above the national standard but the tendering process does not recognise that fact or that this integrated service is flexible and a community-based service that links with the HSE, disability services, hospitals and the people it transports.  This delivers the bespoke service that is required but which is not being picked up in a tendering process.  The flexibility and integration elements were not picked up in a tendering process, which is the difficulty for Clare Accessible Transport.  It is also restricted in expanding its services.  Although it has applied to the NTA to expand and develop new routes, it has had no response from the NTA in that regard.  The quality of service and the expansion that it would like to bring about has not been recognised with the tendering process.</p></speech>

My understanding is that as a result of the procurement process, there is no change in the transport services, although there is a change in the management of services at a local level.  The procurement service allows TCUs to plan for the longer term with greater certainty and it ensures best value for money for the public purse.  It also allows the NTA to define services that are required and properly monitor performance and delivery of the service.  It protects the NTA and the TCUs from potential state aid issues.  It is an EU-specified procurement process and it must be respected as such.  It should be pointed out as well that all the applicants were from not-for-profit companies but they could have come from for-profit companies as well.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.165.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200020#S00800"><p>I was listening to the Minister's discussion on metro south.  I was very glad that last week the Taoiseach, in answering questions about the project, indicated that the Government would be willing to consider alternative route options, possibly including one to University College Dublin and Sandyford.  I know representatives of the NTA, at a committee discussion of the matter last week, indicated it would require some sort of direction from the political system for it to activate that, as the authority is constrained by its regulatory system.  It would have to wait for another review of the whole Dublin transport strategy, leading to a delay of two or three years, which we cannot afford.  I am keen to find out how the Department and the Minister might be able to support that consideration of alternative alignments by assisting the NTA or giving direction that it may need to allow it in a timely manner.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200020#S00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The Deputy is aware of the current status of the MetroLink project both from my earlier answer and the briefing session the National Transport Authority arranged for Members last week.  The Taoiseach was correct in that the project has a great deal of appeal and all projects should be considered if they appear sensible on the surface, although they must come under serious examination.  There must be appropriate consideration in this regard.</p><p>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in improving public transport in the city and the country.  Since publication of the emerging preferred route last year, the Deputy has been vocal in expressing his views and the views of some of his constituents about those initial proposals that had been put forward by the NTA.  The views of everyone who made a submission to last year&rsquo;s consultation process, all 8,000 of them, were carefully considered by the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland and they informed the development of what is now known as the preferred route.  Members of the public and in this House now have another opportunity to make their views known on this route and I encourage them to do so.</p><p>I have heard various metro routes proposed by people in recent months and I have no doubt more will be proposed in the coming weeks.  However, proposals are sometimes put forward for areas where the population and transport demand levels now and in the future simply do not need metro levels of service: many areas, including those mentioned by the Deputy many times, can be very adequately served by other high quality public transport options that can be delivered at lower levels of cost and disruption.</p><p>It is well recognised internationally that transport planning, particularly of this city-region scale, cannot be undertaken on the basis of an individual Deputy's preferences or disparate ideas.  It has to be rationally and logically planned with careful evaluation of the actual transport needs and the capacity required to meet those needs.  The Deputy would appreciate this, having being involved with decisions of this sort.  I know he supports such a process: he made similar comments in the House last week.  It is why a previous Government with which he is not unfamiliar introduced the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which established what we now know as the NTA.  It is why that Act requires the NTA to develop a 20-year transport strategy, covering all modes and the entire greater Dublin area.  It is why that Act stipulates stringent requirements upon the NTA to consult the public, the Oireachtas and local authorities in developing that strategy.  It is why that Act requires the draft strategy be submitted to the Minister to allow the Minister make his or her views known and, if necessary, amended before it is approved.  The Deputy knows that the establishment of this statutory framework was long sought and long fought.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>I really fear we are trying to undo the hard-won progress that we have made in terms of strategic transport planning.  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s desire for better public transport and I share it.  I do not, however, believe we serve the interests of anybody in attempting to up-end a carefully constructed strategic framework designed to look well into the future and plan our transport infrastructure needs.  The Deputy&rsquo;s ideas on different possibilities may well be worth consideration and that consideration will be given, but it must be given within the framework that exists.</p><p>When the NTA starts reviewing the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as it is obliged to do every six years, in accordance with the Act, all options are on the table.  That review must be completed by 2021, so work will start during 2020 on it.  Last week the Deputy in this House reiterated his desire not to hold up MetroLink and I share that desire.  I also have no desire to interfere in the improvements that have been introduced, and which the Deputy supports, to how we strategically plan for our transport future.</p></speech>

It is a variation in this sense.  There is a real case to be made for Terenure-Rathfarnham but we can put that to one side because the Taoiseach has done so and concentrate on the UCD-Sandyford option because that has various characteristics.  First, there is very high demand for transport.  Second, it is a variation in the sense that it would address the long-term objective, which is already set out in the transport strategy, of upgrading the capacity capability of the green line.  The Minister will know this more than anyone else because it is his constituents who will be discommoded if that was to be put back 20 years in respect of what the alternative possible approach would be now.  I know the NTA is concerned and feels that under its legislative measures, it could not look at any variation because its statute requires it to do a full transport strategy and so on.  That is why I asked the question.  In respect of the Government coming to the view that there is something to be gained by not waiting 20 years to address that capacity issue on the green line and looking at the other routing because it also brings major transport benefits, from day one, it would see very high patronage and does not have any of the disadvantages referred to about low patronage areas.  It could continue from where it is currently planned to stop with the far exit at Ranelagh on to Sandyford.  There are about four stations and six km of routing that is ultimately doable.  If the Government wanted to proceed with that, how would it suggest it?</p></speech>

Any suggestions he makes are very worthy of debate in this House and they will go into the mix when the review commences.  When it concludes, it can review the general transport strategy in a way the Deputy approved of thoroughly in the past.  That is the system and process it will go through.  In the meantime, the Deputy's favourite project, the south western Luas, has been looked at and a judgment has been made for the moment at least that this is not worthy and does not merit prioritisation in terms of the Luas at the moment because the population is not adequate to merit it being built and the expense.  That does not mean that the Deputy should not suggest others and that they should not also be considered in the context of the review, which the Deputy knows is coming up.  I would welcome him doing so because this will be soon and no doubt, the Deputy will be in power in 2021 when this comes into being.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has ruled out that route alignment and has said explicitly that he sees sense in the UCD-Sandyford route, which I also see sense in.  What I am saying is that rather than just leaving this process to continue, intervention from the Government is required if it believes that provides real benefits.  It needs to consider what it must to do to assist the NTA to be able to look at that option so that rather than it being a two-phase process, when that tunnelling machine comes through and finally comes to rest in Ranelagh, as is currently proposed, it does not stop there but continues straight on towards Donnybrook, UCD, Stillorgan and Sandyford.  In that way, it would bring a number of transport benefits, including the fact that we would be able to cope with the long-term growth on the green line.  Does the Government have no responsibility to help progress that?  I believe it does.  It needs to work with the NTA or indeed other parties here if it believes it has sense and give the NTA the direction to do the modelling and assessment of that route option so it can be done in a timely manner.</p></speech>

I assume he has now dropped that south western project he had in mind.  I notice that he has abandoned it.  That is all right then.  I see nothing wrong with him dropping one project one week and taking up another project another week.  It is somewhat volatile but he is entitled to be volatile in this business and to drop one project he has championed for a long time, to say it is no good and to accept the opinions expressed to us that his project was never a runner in the first place.  That is fair enough so let us have more ideas from him.  It would be very useful if he produced a large number of ideas on the transport strategy because we will have a review of that strategy.  It is coming up in the next 18 months and will conclude in 2021.  The Deputy will be able to have an input into that within the constraints to which he objected but which he was so prominent in setting up in 2008.</p></speech>

The second interim report, which the Minister promised me would update us on the progress made to date, did not say anything.  It was basically blank.  The first interim report highlighted how an audit in 2010 by the International Civil Aviation Organization observed that while the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, had established a mechanism for oversight of search and rescue co-ordination, there was no effective oversight of those entities for which it was responsible.  In that context, what is the progress regarding this report and when will it be properly published?</p></reply>

First of all, I again wish to avail of this opportunity in the House to offer my sincere condolences to the families, colleagues and friends of the four crew members who lost their lives - Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, Winch Operator Paul Ormsby and Winchman Ciar&aacute;n Smith.  I am also acutely aware that both Paul and Ciar&aacute;n remain lost at sea.</p><p>I recall for the House that under international convention, European regulation and domestic law, the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, is the national safety investigation authority for aviation accidents and incidents.  While it is located within my Department, it functions independently of me and my Department.  Regulations provide for investigations to be held in private and are confidential.  The sole purpose of such investigations is the prevention of future accidents and incidents and not to apportion blame or liability.</p><p>I can again confirm to the Deputy that in line with its usual procedures, the AAIU commenced its investigation into the tragic loss of R116 immediately on notification of the accident.  The investigation has since published a preliminary report, AAIU Report No. 2017-006, which was published on 13 April 2017; an interim statement; AAIU Report No. 2018-004, which was published on 16 April 2018; and a brief second interim statement, which was published on 1 March 2019.  All these reports are publicly available on the AAIU website.  I was advised of the status of the second interim statement into the tragic loss of R116 on 28 February 2019 prior to its publication on 1 March 2019.</p><p>As I have previously advised the Deputy, no final report may be made to the Minister or made public until the draft report has been provided to interested parties for a 60-day confidential comment period following which any comments received must be considered and responded to by the AAIU.  In that regard it is not possible at this time to provide the Deputy with a date for the publication of the final report.</p><p>I would, however, note that it is in no way unusual for the report not be finalised at this stage.  It is important that the investigation be thorough while also being as expeditious as possible, both to fulfil the national and international legal obligations on the AAIU and, indeed, out of respect for those who tragically lost their lives.  For example, when the AAIU investigated EC-ITP, the Metroliner that crashed at Cork Airport on 10 February 2011, the final report was published on 28 January 2014.  For international comparison, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the UK investigated an accident involving a Super Puma helicopter, registration G-REDL, which crashed in the UK on 1 April 2009.  The final report was published on 24 November 2011.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House  </i></p><p>The Accident Investigation Board Norway investigated an EC 225 Airbus Helicopter, which crashed on 29 April 2016.  The final report was published  in July 2018.  The Italian Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Vol investigated a Ryanair aircraft that crashed in Ciampino, Italy on 10 November 2008.  The final report was published on 20 December 2018.  I hope this additional information is of some help.</p></speech>

For ten years, the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA, has been raising concerns with successive Governments and Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the IAA's effectiveness in fulfilling its safety, regulatory and oversight obligations.</p><p>We know that the first interim report into Rescue 116, published last year, highlighted a continuing lack of clarity on individual and collective responsibility for oversight of all aspects of search and rescue, SAR, aviation operations in Ireland.  What happened?  In May of last year, the Minister said he had asked his officials to review current oversight arrangements without delay.  The Irish Air Line Pilots Association, which says it has been highlighting this matter for more than a decade, stated around the same time that it was seeking an early meeting with the Minister to address these issues.  Did it get this meeting?  The first interim report called on the Minister to conduct a thorough review of oversight of search and rescue operations.  In January, he said he had initiated a review, work on which was ongoing.  Essentially, these issues have been raised since a 2010 audit but the gaps remain.  Why has the review the Minister initiated not concluded?  These matters are incredibly urgent and I am extremely worried about the lack of serious detail that is emerging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200022#U00200"><p>The Deputy's questions merit answers.  I will answer the question about what my Department is doing on foot of safety recommendations issued in the interim report, which I think is what the Deputy is addressing.  The safety recommendation was that I "carry out a thorough review of SAR aviation operations in Ireland to ensure that there are appropriate processes, resources and personnel in place to provide effective, continuous, comprehensive and independent oversight of all aspects of these operations".  My Department immediately set about commissioning a report by suitably qualified independent experts with strong international experience.  The review process and the report were also the subject of peer review by various search and rescue entities in other jurisdictions.  The report was published on the departmental website on 21 September 2018.  There was a follow-up to the report on oversight of SAR aviation.  Following publication of the Aerospace Qualified Entity, AQE, report on SAR aviation oversight, I committed to implement in full and without delay the 12 recommendations contained in the report.  As matters stand, good progress is being made in line with timelines set out in the report.</p></speech>

I certainly do not have the answers but I will keep asking the questions.  There are issues with search and rescue oversight in this State - on that I am absolutely clear.  There is a lack of clarity and there are gaps in responsibility.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Irish Aviation Authority specifically, does the Minister think the current corporate governance structure of the authority is appropriate for good safety regulatory oversight and enforcement?  In particular, I would like him to comment on the following characteristics of the Irish Aviation Authority.  Is the IAA good for oversight?  Uniquely among national aviation authorities, the IAA is not subject to legislation on freedom of information is not subject to investigation by the Ombudsman, has a commercial mandate in aviation and has the power to write its own statutory instruments without direct input from an elected body.  I am deeply concerned by the lack of an independent aviation safety oversight regime and the fact that the IAA has a variety of characteristics that would appear to work against its being effective and transparent.  In the specific case of Rescue 116, there are issues with rescue and oversight.  IALPA, which represents the pilots at the coalface of this, has been asking the Minister these questions.  Is it not about time he started listening to them?</p></speech>

I will consider that in view of what she has said.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question about the Irish Aviation Authority, recommendation No. 12 in the AQE report was to ensure that the IAA is involved directly by the Irish Coast Guard in the aviation regulatory aspect of the contract with the operator to ensure consistency in the application of relevant regulations and processes.  I am happy to report that the IAA and the Irish Coast Guard are engaging in regular discussions on this and work is advanced on identifying a more permanent mechanism to enable this type of engagement to continue in accordance with the recommendation in the AQE report.  As Minister, I will continue to provide updates to the Air Accident Investigation Unit on the progress in implementing these actions.  I committed to implement in full and without delay the 12 recommendations contained in the report and, as matters stand, good progress is being made in line with the timelines set down in the report.</p></speech>

When can they expect to hear word back?  This year, under a new system, which is very much welcome, invalid applications will be considered.  Will the Minister outline the process in respect of clubs whose applications are deemed invalid?  Will they have an opportunity to rectify issues with their applications?  What is the timeline involved in this regard?  For clubs that did not have an opportunity to apply this time but now wish to do so, does the Minister envisage that another scheme will be opened up soon after this one?</p></reply>

Over the years, the programme has transformed the sporting landscape of the country, with new and improved facilities and equipment in practically every community.</p>  <p>  The 2018 round of the sports capital programme closed for applications in October, with a record 2,337 applications submitted, seeking a total of &euro;162 million in funding.  Of these applications, 186 were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme but in respect of which corrected documents were submitted subsequently.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7 million in allocations to 170 projects was announced on 17 January.  This is something Deputy Heydon and others sought, and it was very well received by the applicants in question who would otherwise still be waiting for funding.  We were glad to facilitate this funding.</p>  <p>  Work is now under way on assessing the new 2018 applications.  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their applications during the assessment period.  Many Deputies, including Deputy Heydon, have raised this matter in the past.  We were very glad to introduce this facility in the new round to give people who apply for sports capital grants - volunteers mainly - an opportunity to have their applications fully assessed and not invalidated.  While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed.  Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the sports capital programme is announced.  However, there are a number of non-personal sports equipment grants within this number, and we hope in the coming weeks to be able to make allocations to over 600 clubs that have applied for those grants, if possible.  This would be helpful to many clubs coming into the summer period.</p>  <p>  In answer to the final aspect of Deputy Heydon's question, as soon as we make the final allocations under the 2018 round of the sports capital programme, which I hope will be in autumn, we will carry out a full review of the 2018 round with a view to initiating the opening of the next round of the programme.  I hope that will take place before the end of the year.</p></speech>

For those volunteers who have put forward applications which for some reason were deemed invalid, giving them an opportunity to rectify matters is definitely important.  Will the Minister of State clarify how this will work?  Will all clubs receive a letter stating whether their applications are valid or invalid or will only clubs that had problems with validity get letters?  When does the Minister of State envisage these letters will start to issue?  How much time will the clubs have to rectify problems with their applications?  If there are title deed issues, I presume not all of those will be able to be rectified but I presume the clubs will be given an opportunity to do so.  I note that the Minister of State said it will be the third quarter of this year before we have the final decision.  He might expand on which specific grants he may be able to allocate earlier.  Are they purely for equipment, as opposed to infrastructural projects?  He said he believes those grants may be allocated in the next month or two.</p></speech>

Examples include rowing clubs looking for rowing boats and boxing clubs requesting punching bags etc.  It might also include Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, and soccer clubs seeking lawn mowers, as well as gyms looking only for gym equipment.  Those types of applications are what we refer to as equipment-only applications.  The total funding sought for those 635 applications is about &euro;19 million.  Logistically, we can group those applications and have them in the next couple of weeks.  We hope to do that instead of those clubs having to wait with everybody else because the applications from those clubs are usually smaller.  We will try to do that as soon as we can and try to facilitate as many clubs as possible as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Regarding other grants and applications, departmental officials hope to write to everybody at the same time if there are issues.  I refer to a document being missing, an inaccuracy and all of the things that would previously have invalidated an application.  In those cases, the applicants will be written to and given a set time to submit the corrected document or documents.  The officials will then reassess the applications.  There is no more we can do if some remain invalid after that because of the logistics involved.  Those applications that are valid will then be assessed with all of the others.  As was stated, we hope the applications will then be eligible for allocation of funding in the autumn.</p></speech>

When might clubs expect feedback?  I also have question about the large-scale application grants.  The closing date for applications is later this month.  I refer, in particular, to St. Conleth's Park, which is the county ground in Newbridge.  The slogan "Newbridge or nowhere" became famous last year for good reason.  The GAA did not want us playing a major championship game in our home ground.  We are not proud of the state of our stand in Newbridge.  We are, however, very proud of our football, ladies football, camogie and hurling teams.  They play in St. Conleth's Park but our infrastructure could be much better.  We need a large-scale infrastructural grant, as the Minister of State is aware.  Given the application deadline, when does he anticipate a decision will be made on those projects?  Kildare GAA is putting in its application currently.</p></speech>

The window anticipated for correction of documents is two to three weeks.  We would otherwise have a prolonged application and processing period.  We will try to be as swift as possible with that element of the process.  The Minister and I were very keen to introduce the large-scale sporting infrastructure fund.  Our Department is frequently approached with requests for funding greater than that provided for in the traditional sports capital programme.  We are glad to state we have secured capital funding for the large-scale sport infrastructure fund.  We are currently receiving applications.  The deadline is 17 April and we will start processing the applications received after that.</p>  <p>  Initial feedback from officials in the Department indicates that scheme is going to be heavily oversubscribed.  It is traditionally a feature of the regular sports capital programme that demand, unfortunately, far outstrips the funding available.  We will, however, try to be as fair as possible to the applicants and as strategic as possible in the allocation of funding.  We know there is pent up demand given the difficult period we are still arising from and the lack of investment that resulted from the economic crash.  We will try to be as fast as possible in freeing up the finance for what we know are very necessary sporting infrastructure projects all over the country.</p></speech>

As he is aware the maintenance, renewal and operation of the rail network is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand local residents have recently met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to discuss the issue in detail.  Project Ireland 2040 states the priority funding objective regarding mainline rail is the maintenance and renewal of the existing network so that it continues to provide a safe and reliable infrastructure enabling the provision of quality rail services for passengers across the country.  This means ensuring "steady state" levels of investment in our rail infrastructure each year for the foreseeable future.  A significant and recurring capital investment of around &euro;200 million is required from the taxpayer every year.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform Deputy Burke that the funding I have secured under Project Ireland 2040 means we are in a position to provide this "steady state" level of funding.  This is significant and welcome progress.  It will deliver benefits to passengers across the network, including Westmeath, by allowing for increased levels of investment in things like signalling, ballast cleaning and track relaying.  That will improve passenger journey experiences and may lead to better journey times.  Another key area of interest for Westmeath rail commuters is the need for increased capacity and services.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently examining how best to source additional rolling stock as efficiently and effectively as possible while ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are exploring two options.  One is the purchase or lease of second-hand fleet units and the second is the purchase of additional carriages to augment the existing commuter fleet used on the Mullingar line.  The Deputy will be aware that the first option is complicated by the different gauge of the Irish rail network compared with international norms.  The NTA, however, has recently advertised seeking expressions of interest.  It is currently considering the responses received, as well as the second option to purchase additional carriages.  I expect a decision on the medium term response to the capacity challenge will be made very shortly.</p></speech>

Mullingar commuters face significant challenges daily.  This issue, however, specifically concerns Killucan train station.  I was reading back and this issue was first raised in 2001.  Much time has passed since then and various groups have brought this matter to the attention of different Ministers and Irish Rail.  Deputy Penrose received a reply to a parliamentary question on this matter in 2015.  It was stated an assessment was made that it would cost about &euro;1.5 million to make the station operational again.  I understand the station was closed in 1963 and signal functionality ended in 2005.</p>  <p>  The local community has great interest in this project.  It has been frequently raised with me.  One critical aspect is a dual line across from the station.  It is the only dual line all the way down from Enfield.  The train stops roughly eight times a day at that location.  Will the Minister agree to meet a delegation from that community?  Requests have been sent to the Department over the years.  I would also like to know if the Minister will ask Irish Rail if there might be any other avenues of funding that could be explored for regeneration.</p></speech>

Information from <i>www.delvinvillage.com</i>, a community website, indicates locals have maintained a long-standing campaign to reopen Killucan rail station.  The group is Killucan Station Action Group, KSAG.  In February 2019, some 50 people attended a meeting in a local pub under the banner of KSAG.  I gather it was agreed at that meeting that the next step would be to meet Mr. Jim Meade of Irish Rail and, separately, the chief executive of Westmeath County Council to discuss the matter further.  This was facilitated by various Deputies.  It would appear KSAG was encouraged by that meeting.  The group appears to believe the next step is to ensure Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the county council work together in developing a business case and then examining whether funding might be available through the Project Ireland 2040 rural regeneration and development fund.  I encourage KSAG to do everything it can to promote this project.</p></speech>

Planning to reopen the station is a significant task for a community to undertake and colossal work has been done so far.</p><p>I would also be grateful if the Minister would determine whether funding might be available or permitted under the various rural recreation and development infrastructure funds.  The Minister for Community and Rural Development, Deputy Ring, has made a significant investment in Kinnegad of late by providing priming finance to assess a significant project affecting multiple areas throughout the town.  There is significant interest in this station among the commuter base in Kinnegad and Killucan and the surrounding area.  Many commuters travel approximately 15 km in the wrong direction, to Mullingar or Kinnegad, in order to get a train or bus travelling to Dublin.  This would be a huge asset to the community.  I would be grateful if the Minister could secure guidance from the Department.  I am fully aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is given a budget and that the CEO of Irish Rail has a duty to put forward projects within that funding.  In the decade prior to 2001, 12 stations were reopened, so there is significant precedent for such an action when a business case is put forward.</p></speech>

It was a cross-party meeting with representatives of the groups in the community.  It was very productive.  I support my constituency colleague in his request and I seek the support of the Minister because the CEO of Irish Rail reports to him, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  While the CEO has set out a clear platform regarding the next steps - and I have no doubt that the community groups will embrace those next steps - reopening the station is not on any Government or Irish Rail plan at the moment.  The initiative would benefit from the Minister's political support.  We all know of the importance of trying to get people out of cars and onto public transport.  This station is located in a densely populated commuter belt that would benefit from its reopening.  It would be most welcome if the Minister were to add his political clout and that of Irish Rail to the project.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Burke's request, I am happy to receive a delegation and to look at this issue with it if the Deputy thinks that would be worthwhile.  As Deputy Troy stated, such a meeting would be open to all parties and all groups of Deputies, as it should, because it is an issue on which the local community can unite.  I would ask to receive a business case before this is done.  We are lacking any solid business case at the moment.  Although the need for this reopening may be very acute in the area and may be felt by a large number of residents, a business case must also be made if there is to be any possibility or chance of this being progressed.  While I do not have any figures, I have already outlined how the priority areas for investment have impacted on the rail network in Westmeath.  I have not yet received any proposals in respect of Killucan station, however.  Any such proposal would need to be based on a robust business case which complies with the public spending code and would be subject to the availability of funding.  As the Deputies can see, our funding is currently fully committed but that would not stop me meeting a delegation comprising interested parties, themselves and other Deputies.</p></speech>

The valley runs from the global brand name, Blarney Castle, up to the Gearagh and on to Gougane Barra, immediately adjacent to the Wild Atlantic Way.  A sl&iacute; na saoirse, or freedom trail, could be developed to attract people from the cruise liners that bring thousands of people into Cork Harbour.  I would like the Minister of State to look at how we can get that moving and how the machinery of the State can be brought together to promote the Lee Valley and wider area to give the place the opportunity to develop its tourism potential.</p></reply>

I absolutely agree with him that there is huge potential in that part of Cork.  It is a very beautiful and interesting part of the county which has a rich built heritage, a rich history and a rich culture.  There is enormous potential in the area, which fits in very well with the experiences we are rolling out such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, the tourism agencies of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have operational responsibility for the development and promotion, both domestic and overseas, of regions such as the Lee Valley.</p>  <p>  As part of this, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is engaging in a programme to extend the concept of the Wild Atlantic Way to the wider region, as distinct from the Wild Atlantic Way route.  This encompasses areas that are not on the Wild Atlantic Way route but that are part of the wider hinterland.  The main growth opportunity for these areas is to attract the visitor already coming from or going to the Wild Atlantic Way.  The Lee Valley has been designated part of the Wild Atlantic Way region and is included in all of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's development, promotional and business-support activities.  The agency will be working with businesses on the ground and hosting a number of workshops in the area.  At these workshops it will explain how opportunities can be maximised and how to make the most of the Wild Atlantic Way region brand.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also currently reviewing their itineraries on the Wild Atlantic Way website.  It will be working with tourism businesses in the Wild Atlantic Way region to showcase experiences on the new Wild Atlantic Way website later this year to create an awareness of these experiences and grow visitor numbers to the area.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I understand that Tourism Ireland is working with Cork Airport and tourism industry partners to highlight Cork as a stand-alone destination and also as a gateway to both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  In this context, Tourism Ireland recommends that tourism businesses from the Lee Valley register on the industry opportunities website for a range of opportunities to promote their businesses across the world.  For more detail, I have asked both tourism agencies to provide the Deputy with further information on their work in the Lee Valley area.  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will contact the Deputy directly in that regard.</p>  <p>  Later this evening I will be attending the Meitheal exhibition in west Dublin.  This is F&aacute;ilte Ireland's biggest event this year, at which it will be showcasing all parts of the country to people from 22 different countries.  Next week I will be in North America with Tourism Ireland, leading a major trade mission aimed at continuing to grow the number of visitors from North America.</p></speech>

The different workshops being offered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland are very much focused on beds and on the availability of accommodation as distinct from promoting the product and the area.  Indeed, the advertising for the workshops held over the last year was - we will be generous - very focused.  Not many people actually got to see the advertisement and have the opportunity to attend.  While the plans sound great, they are not being translated into action in the way the Minister of State indicated.  Will he outline the detail of the promotion of the region or the timeline of when it will take place?  There is great urgency in the Macroom and wider Lee Valley area.  The development of the new bypass will mean that east-west traffic will move faster through the area.  We want to ensure that there is a real opportunity to grow the area's tourism potential.</p></speech>

There needs to a collaborative approach between industry, local communities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Cork County Council.  In recent years, there has been a devolution of authority in respect of tourism development to local authorities.  That is very welcome because the ground-up approach is very important and preferable to the national agencies being responsible for everything.  I have seen some really positive developments all over the country in that regard.</p>  <p>  I draw to the Deputy's attention a scheme that was launched last week.  It is aimed at creating destination towns.  The concept is to get people to stay longer and spend more in areas that have not traditionally been considered locations for tourism and in which people have not traditionally tended to seek accommodation.  The point of this is to develop authentic and off-the-beaten-path experiences.  This scheme would suit the Lee Valley area very well and I encourage the Deputy to liaise with Cork County Council, which has a responsibility to apply to that scheme in respect of potential candidate towns.  That is one avenue.</p><p> When F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland get in contact with the Deputy as a result of today's discussion, I advise him to ensure that there is ongoing collaboration.  In my experience, one builds a product through constant collaboration and co-operation between agencies and all stakeholders.  The Wild Atlantic Way is only a couple of years old and, as such, is only a fledgling experience.  These initiatives take time to build up, but it is worth building solid foundations for them and working at them.</p></speech>

We have great potential and a great offering, but the focus seems to be on beds as distinct from the experience, the offering and the promotion of same.  There is an urgency, as we want to develop the area and not miss out on the opportunity just because traffic is passing by on the bypass.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the new scheme, which sounds positive, especially for smaller counties.  Two towns will be able to gain.  In a county the size of Cork, however, the scheme will be more diluted.  Could there be a further focus on, and additional funding for, larger counties so that they can at least have an equal opportunity?</p></speech>

I do not doubt that great work is already under way on the ground in the Lee Valley.  We are constantly learning from one another and best practice.  In my county, for example, the Reeks district is a new and up and coming brand that has made great progress in recent years.  It would be helpful to examine what people there are doing and the model they have applied.  The Munster Vales to the Deputy's east have done brilliant work in recent years.  These are the types of experience and brand from which other areas can learn and, in turn, they can learn from what is happening in the Lee Valley.  There are strengths, weaknesses and opportunities in each area.</p>  <p>  The destination towns scheme is not the only avenue of F&aacute;ilte Ireland or departmental funding.  We have a greenway fund and numerous other capital funds are available through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I advise the Deputy to be constantly aware of the types of funding available across the whole of government.  For example, rural regeneration funding and other Department of Rural and Community Development funding can be helpful for developing tourism products.</p></speech>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  The House will understand that the operation of Bus &Eacute;ireann services is a matter for the company, with oversight by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The NTA has entered into a contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of bus services in the State.  In accordance with the terms of that contract, the day-to-day operation of those services is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company is required to meet performance obligations in respect of service delivery, such as punctuality, services operated, vehicles in service and customer information.</p>  <p>  The NTA has invested in a significant improvement to subsidised bus services in Cork city.  This has included the provision of cross-city services, increased frequency on existing services and new services linking residential areas to places of employment and education.  Further investment has been made in the city bus fleet, which is 100% fully accessible, and an increase in capacity through the purchase and deployment of double decker buses.</p>  <p>  Regarding the area raised by the Deputy, the NTA has advised that it is planning to implement improvements to bus services in three separate phases during 2019.  This is part of a general review of bus services in the greater Cork area.  This review includes the Macroom-Cork corridor, including services from Kilmurry, Crookstown, Cloughduv, Aherla and Ovens currently provided on route 233.  Phase 1, which was implemented on 13 January, is a significant development of route 220, with a doubling of the frequency to every 15 minutes and the provision of a 24-hour service.  Phase 1 has resulted in a significant increase in passenger numbers.  Phase 2, which is due for implementation in the middle of 2019, includes a new service between Ringaskiddy and Cork Airport via Ballygarvan and Carrigaline.  Services on the Macroom-Cork corridor, including route 233, are part of the phase 3 improvements, which the NTA has advised are also expected to be implemented in the middle of 2019.</p></speech>

While I recognise that he is not involved in day-to-day issues, he is responsible for policy.  Significant policies are outlined in Project Ireland 2040, which refers to improving the fleet and taking on the challenge of escalating traffic congestion.  Anyone travelling on the N22 and trying to get off the Ballincollig bypass at Ovens bridge knows that traffic congestion is escalating.</p>  <p>  It is important that there be improvements to this bus route, which serves the wider area.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is positive towards this and is keen to make improvements, but as we saw with route 220 in Ballincollig, there seems to be a bottleneck, in that getting approval from the NTA is a slow process.  The NTA answers to the Minister, so I call on him to challenge it to implement policies as quickly as possible so that people can enjoy the benefit of bus services.</p></speech>

One of the principal pillars of that policy is to get people out of their cars and onto buses.  The Deputy and I are working in the same direction, as we want to improve the frequency and efficiency of bus services on route 233.  I will improve services anywhere I feel it is advantageous in the sense that I will promote them and provide funding for the NTA to use wisely.</p>  <p>  All parties are united on this issue.  Everyone has his or her own particular patch that he or she wishes to see looked after.  As a matter of policy, we are generally being successful in moving people onto buses, which is reflected in the greater frequency of services in Cork, Dublin and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  A draft Cork metropolitan area transport strategy is being finalised by Cork city and county councils in partnership with the NTA.  This strategy will provide a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services across the Cork metropolitan area for the period up to 2040.</p></speech>

There should also be a service each day for the likes of Coachford, Ballingeary and Inchigeelagh as opposed to the occasional service that is currently in place.  Will the Minister add his political clout to the scheme?  There is willingness on the part of Bus &Eacute;ireann to make the improvements.  They are included in its plans.  Time and again, however, the bottleneck in such schemes lies with getting approval from the NTA.  The NTA answers to the Minister.  Will he highlight this issue with it and ask it to prioritise implementing the policies so that services on, for example, route 233 can be made more widely available to people locally?</p></speech>

This matter has been ongoing for some years.  It first arose in January 2016 when the then Government thought it was unveiling a capital plan for hospitals.  We discovered at the time that there was no money in the capital plan for these three hospitals.  The Government realised in the course of the general election campaign that something had gone wrong and that was not what the Government intended.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who was a Minister of State at the time, stated that the matter was so serious that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, would begin an investigation.  The investigation has now gone on longer than any tribunal and we have never been informed of the outcome.</p>  <p>  There have been numerous announcements by Ministers of State over the time, including Deputies Jim Daly and McHugh, but there has been very little progress.  We had a meeting here last year and it was promised that we would meet the Minister for Health, the Secretary General and the chief officers of the HSE but that never happened.  The Minister of State at the Department of health, Deputy Jim Daly, attended that meeting and gave what he thought was good news but nothing has happened since.  It was stated at the time that there would be regular contact with the action group but there has been none.</p>  <p>  We want to stop the nonsense and put in place a strategy to proceed with the development, refurbishment and extension of these three hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200026#Y01000"><p>I am delighted to be sharing this matter with Deputies Gallagher and McConalogue.  It is a pity that the Minister for State, Deputy Jim Daly, is not here.  He called the people of Donegal strange last week.  He stated that he wanted the opportunity to answer this question and, when we give him the opportunity to do so, he is not here.  It is a bit strange that he is not here to outline the future of the three hospitals.</p>  <p>  This issue first arose three years ago.  The HSE and Government stated very clearly that long-stay beds were to close at St. Joseph's and Ramelton and that the same thing was close to happening at Lifford Community Hospital.  It is now three years later.  Up to 2,000 people took to the streets last week and there was a packed hall of community representatives who wanted answers.  They have been fobbed off for the past three years.  The then Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, went on Highland Radio and other stations in Donegal to inform people about multimillion euro sanctioning of grants, yet we know that not a red penny was sanctioned for those projects at that time.</p>  <p>  We need to put our money where our mouth is.  The community will only believe that the old plan is in the bin, where it belongs, and that the future of these hospitals is viable when the funding is granted and refurbishment is carried out.  Get rid of all the spin and let us deal in substance.  Has funding been approved by the HSE for the upgrade of St. Joseph's and Ramelton in order to maintain long-stay and short-stay beds?  What is the current position in respect of Lifford?  That is a campaign that needs to be mounted and won because we need those beds in our community in Lifford to complement what we already have in St. Joseph's and Ramelton and what we will have in Letterkenny.</p></speech>

Those who work in them provide a tremendous service to people within their community.  The last Government decided, in 2016, to close the long-stay beds in St. Joseph's in Stranorlar, Ramelton and Lifford and that they would not be reopened.  It is only because of the work that has been carried out since then by the "Save our St. Joseph's" action group under the leadership of Fr. John Joe Duffy and community hospital action groups in Ramelton and Lifford that the Government has reversed its policy position on closing the three hospitals.  We still do not have a hard and fast commitment from the Government on funding, or a start on the work at St. Joseph's and Ramelton hospitals that the Government has committed to in theory in order to bring them up to HIQA standards.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, was very sensitive when I raised the issue with him in the House last week.  He claimed not to understand Donegal politics after I brought to his attention the march which was attended by Deputies Gallagher, Pearse Doherty and other public representatives and local community members in the Stranorlar and Ballybofey areas.  The Minister of State and his colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who is present, and the Minister for Health, need to show they will come forward and stop the types of false promises we have seen in the past and deliver the funding to ensure these hospitals are brought up to HIQA standards and those long-stay beds are secured for the future.  We also need to increase the capacity of long-stay beds within our community hospital sector in Donegal in order to meet the demand that will arise in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister of State is unable to be here because he is attending an important meeting with senior officials about scheduled and unscheduled care and delayed discharges.  He has asked me to convey his apologies to the Deputies.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar, Ramelton Community Hospital and Lifford Community Hospital.  Community hospitals are an essential part of our national infrastructure and we are determined to maintain our public stock.  The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high but we do recognise that many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  However, without these units, many older people would not have access to the care they need.  On that basis, we need to upgrade our public bed stock.  This is the aim behind the five-year capital investment programme for community and nursing units announced in 2016.</p><p>This provides the framework to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.</p> <p> At a meeting on 7 November 2018 with public representatives and local delegations, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, advised that the policy position to replace St. Joseph's, Stranorlar, and Ramelton community nursing unit had been revised.  The HSE's social care directorate and its national capital and property steering group accepted recommendations from HSE CHO1 to retain and upgrade both facilities, in the context of future capacity requirements.  This revises the original decision to replace the existing long-stay residential beds on both sites.  It further revises the scale of the proposed new unit at Letterkenny from the original 130 beds to 110 beds.  Importantly, the decision to revise the proposals was informed not just by the technical and feasibility studies on the physical infrastructure at these two sites but also a broader analysis of population projections and national planning norms carried out by the HSE.</p> <p> The redevelopment of the Lifford unit on the existing site is not deemed viable.  The need for additional beds and the potential to develop a new facility on a greenfield site will be reviewed further post-2021, when new census data are available and the capital programme has been advanced.  The existing unit at Lifford will continue to operate in the intervening period.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, advised at the November meeting, he welcomes the community continuing to engage with the HSE at local level, as appropriate, regarding further ideas and proposals for community-based options that may be considered.</p> <p> The Department and the HSE are engaged in a process to finalise the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  In developing its capital plan for 2019 and future years, the HSE must consider a range of issues, including the expenditure that is contractually committed, the HSE's annual requirement for meeting risks associated with clinical equipment, ambulances and healthcare infrastructure and the total capital Exchequer funding required for major capital projects.  The HSE's capital plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond and this plan is being finalised.  Once the HSE has finalised its capital plan for 2019, it will then be submitted to the Minister for consideration.</p></speech>

The issue is becoming muddier and muddier.  I refer the Minister of State to his script, which is from the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  It states the HSE is still working on the plan for 2019 and also refers to expenditure on contractual commitments.  There is nothing clear in it to state funding will be provided for any of the units in Donegal.  I hope the Minister of State will bring it to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that while he tried to impress on us that it was totally clear it would be moving in 2019, he also stated there were contractual commitments and annual requirements on meeting risks with associated clinical equipment.  This is not clear.  We are looking for a very clear and unambiguous statement that money will be provided for a design team to be appointed as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has made it very clear, and I admire his honesty, that the decision was reversed.  We know the initial decision was to close these hospitals at the expense of another.  Where will the patients go if they must be discommoded while works are being carried out in these hospitals?</p></speech>

At least the old plan to close down the hospitals is gone officially but the problem is we have been told things over and over again by Ministers that simply are not true.  Ministers told us on the radio that the answers given in reply to parliamentary questions from Deputy Gallagher and others were not accurate statements of events and that comments made outside the House are the accurate statements.  People are saying, "show me the money".  The problem is that not a penny has been sanctioned for the work to be carried out in Ramelton or at St. Joseph's.  This is the issue.  It is the start of April and it still has not been sanctioned.  In December, the Cabinet met for three hours and sanctioned hundreds of millions of additional euro for the national children's hospital.  For three years, people have been taken to the streets in Ramelton, in Stranorlar with regard to St. Joseph's and in Lifford and they have not got a bean from the Government in terms of a commitment.  When will the project be signed off?  Will there be a commitment in it that the design team can be allocated?</p></speech>

They need to see the works commenced, the plans designed and the funding allocated.  I want to zone in specifically on the situation with regard to Lifford Community Hospital.  The response from the Minister of State today, and the responses we received previously, indicate that the Government does not plan to upgrade the existing hospital on the existing site, that the Government does not see it as viable but that it has no plans to look until after 2021 at what the future might hold.  Councillor Gerry Crawford in the area has done lot of work on this.  He raised it as recently as the March meeting of the HSE's health forum.  Again, he was told it will be 2021 before the Government looks at future plans for Lifford Community Hospital.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the HSE to start to identify a new site in Lifford so work and planning can commence to ensure there is a community hospital and long-term beds in the Lifford area to serve the community there as well as the communities in Stranorlar and Ramelton.</p></speech>

I understand he was to respond to the Deputies last week but the debate was withdrawn.  I will deal with the points raised.  Deputy Gallagher spoke about the 1,000 people on the streets.  Of course, we must listen to their views and I will bring his concerns to the Minister.  His fundamental question on where those patients will go is very relevant.</p>  <p>  With regard to what Deputy Doherty has said, we accept the old plan has gone.  He said the local people need to see where the money is and when it will happen.  It will have to be some time in 2019.  The Deputy wants more specific dates and timelines and I accept that point.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, asked me to stress that St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar and Ramelton Community Hospital will be redeveloped through the HSE's capital programme, while the potential for redevelopment in Lifford will be further reviewed after 2021, when new census data will be available and the capital programme will have been advanced.  The national development plan provides for the continuation of the programme of replacement and refurbishment of community nursing units and long-term residential care facilities for older people.  The Department has consistently stated that the HSE is responsible for the delivery of healthcare infrastructure projects and it is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise and plan projects, subject to available funding in the coming years.  The Department and the HSE are engaged in a process to finalise the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  The HSE's capital plan will determine the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the total available capital funding and relevant priority of each project.  All health capital projects at various stages of development, such as community nursing units in Donegal, are included as part of this process.  Once the HSE has finalised its capital plan for 2019, it will be submitted to the Minister for consideration.  Of course, I will bring back the points raised by the Deputies today, particularly on the new site in Lifford and all of the other concerns.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200028#AA00100"><p>I call on the Department of Health to commit to providing additional ambulance fleets and personnel in the north west in order to reduce response times in the region.  Unfortunately, lengthy ambulance response times are not unusual there.  They are, however, unacceptable.  People in rural areas are treated deplorably when it comes to access to out-of-hours health services.  It is now evident that if more than one emergency arises at a time in the Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon area, our communities must wait up to two, three or four hours for emergency services.  The lives of people in the north west are as important as those of people in cities or elsewhere in the country.</p>  <p>  I accept that there are challenges in providing services in rural Ireland and that we cannot expect to achieve the same turnaround times as are experienced in urban areas.  However, the response times in rural areas could be and need to be vastly improved.  The waiting times for ambulances are too lengthy.  The current situation in County Leitrim in that regard is totally unsatisfactory.</p>  <p>  More and more ambulances are being called away to cover larger centres.  The dispatching of ambulances from one county to cover another due to the lack of paramedics on duty at any one time, as often occurs with the ambulances assigned to Leitrim and north Roscommon, is totally wrong and leaves people highly exposed.  Our ambulance service often deals with life or death situations but it does not have the capacity to deal with the call-outs it is receiving.  Fatalities may be inevitable.</p>  <p>  We need a new ambulance unit in Carrick-on-Shannon and extra personnel to manage the fleet there.  People in rural Ireland are losing confidence in the ambulance service, which is a pity because, as all Members know, its staff are dedicated, committed and very helpful.  I am sure that the families of several Members have called 999 seeking an ambulance - I know mine has.  It is sad that the staff are losing confidence, but it would be very sad if the people who need the service also lose confidence.</p>  <p>  The ambulance stationed in Carrick-on-Shannon serves south Leitrim and north Roscommon but at times may be as far away as Monaghan, Mayo, Tullamore or even Mullingar, leaving no ambulance cover in its primary area.  It is very alarming that there are only ever two ambulances on call for the entire County Leitrim.  Those ambulances may not be available if an emergency call comes in as they may be covering for other ambulances in urban centres or responding to other emergency calls.  What is more alarming is the lack of action on the part of the Government, which seems unconcerned about this issue or the fact that elderly people may have to wait from two hours to five hours for an ambulance.  People have contacted me with concerns and I have passed on those details to the HSE.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no short-term cover available for ambulance staff, meaning ambulance cover may be dropped if staff members are out sick as the minimum required number of staff members would not be met.  That is the sad reality.  Ambulance staff work around the clock, with a 20-hour shift not being unheard of for staff in the north west.  That is completely unsatisfactory and it is dangerous.  I am sure the Road Safety Authority does not condone unsafe practices such as the hours being worked by ambulance drivers.  I know exactly what I am talking about on this issue and the people who have been affected.  The current practice is wrong.  Those people are worn out.</p>  <p>  Access to out-of-hours health services in County Leitrim is extremely limited.  The HSE promised to implement measures in terms of new personnel, ambulances and first responder schemes in Leitrim and north Roscommon as advised by the 2015 capacity review that was published in 2016 for the National Ambulance Service.  Some 24 new recruits to the ambulance service were passed out quite recently, but all of them were posted to major urban centres.</p></speech>

I am pleased to inform the House that 12 additional staff have been approved for deployment in the north-west region for 2019.  These staff will provide additional emergency capacity to the region in the coming year.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has furthered several developments in order to address the issue of response times and ambulance cover in the north west.  In Border counties, the National Ambulance Service works closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order to provide a more responsive service for patients.  An EU-funded pilot of a new community paramedic model of care in Border counties has been completed.  Community paramedics safely and effectively provide care in Border counties, with a consequent reduction in unnecessary ambulance journeys to emergency departments and hospital re-admissions.  On resources in the north west, under the first phase of the programme two community paramedics were assigned to Buncrana, County Donegal.</p>  <p>  The capacity review published in 2016 identified particular difficulties serving rural areas such as the north-west region.  It indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responders, CFR, schemes.  The National Ambulance Service continues to work with local CFR groups across the region to enhance services.  I am pleased to state that the Government is fulfilling its commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the number of CFR groups year on year.  In the north west, 19 CFR groups are currently linked to the National Ambulance Service and 14 other groups there are in training to provide first response in emergency medical situations.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and there have been several important service innovations and developments.  A single cohesive strategic plan for ambulance services, entitled Vision 2020, has been developed by the National Ambulance Service.  It sets out the actions necessary to implement the various recommendations and to address the range of other demands facing the ambulance service.</p>  <p>  The national emergency operations centre has been established and is the location for the receipt of emergency calls and dispatch of emergency resources.  The National Ambulance Service has visibility of all available paramedic resources and vehicles in real time, ensuring that the closest available resource is dispatched to an emergency.</p>  <p>  Other recent developments include the development of alternative pathways to care.  The "hear and treat" clinical hub went live in the national emergency operations centre in March last year.  It diverts some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and frees up emergency capacity.  It is anticipated that such initiatives will help to improve the availability of ambulance resources nationwide, including in the north west.</p>  <p>  In recent years, additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year, its budget increased to an unprecedented &euro;168.6 million, which will support it in continuing to deliver a high quality service throughout the country, including in the north west.</p></speech>

The current situation could not be allowed to continue because it is neither acceptable nor safe.  I have previously raised the first responder scheme in the House because it makes sense to roll it out in the north west.  Fire fighters in Dublin are trained to paramedic level, meaning that paramedics are available 24-7.  This should also be the case in the regions.  Last year, vital discussions on this issue took place between the National Ambulance Service and the national directorate for fire and emergency management.  I welcome the information provided by the Minister of State in that regard.</p>  <p>  The capacity review published in 2016 indicated that community first responder schemes are a practical way to improve first response times in rural areas.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State mentioned such schemes and I welcome that they are being considered.</p>  <p>  With 12 new recruits being assigned to the area, it is important that a second ambulance be based in Carrick-on-Shannon in light of the demand in the area for services.  As the population of the county is widely dispersed and because the ambulance based in Carrick-on-Shannon may be called upon to provide services to nearby centres such as Monaghan and, in particular, Mullingar, possibly to cover for an ambulance which may have been moved to Dublin, it is crucial that a second unit be based in Carrick-on-Shannon in the future.</p></speech>

I accept he was one of the Deputies who was very involved in raising the first responder issue previously.</p>  <p>  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, I assure the House that the National Ambulance Service is focused on continuing to improve service in the north west and throughout the rest of the country.  The improvement is being implemented through a multi-annual reform programme.  Through the National Ambulance Service reform plan, Vision 2020, new developments are being progressed in order to continue to deliver a high-quality service.  Recent developments, such as the new community paramedic model of care, will divert some lower priority patients from the busy emergency departments.  I will inform the Minister of other issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It concerns Shannon Heritage and how it is enabled to run tourist attractions in County Clare, particularly Bunratty Castle and Folk Park.  The latter is an important component of Shannon Heritage and attracts international and national visitors throughout the year, numbering up to 350,000 annually.  Therefore, it is one of the leading attractions in Ireland.  It is the jewel in the crown of Shannon Heritage.  Shannon Heritage has a difficulty in regard to how it can fund the development of the attraction.</p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage is part of Shannon Group, which consists of Shannon Airport, Shannon Heritage, Shannon Commercial Properties and the International Aviation Services Centre, located at Shannon Airport.  Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is just one of the attractions that Shannon Heritage manages and develops.  It also looks after King John's Castle, Limerick, Craggaunowen, County Clare, Knappogue Castle and Walled Garden, and Dunguaire Castle, Kinvara.  It has expanded beyond the region to develop other attractions, including Malahide Castle and Gardens and the GPO Witness History heritage experience.  Therefore, Shannon Heritage has a broad portfolio.  It has to be commercially viable to exist.  This is the difficulty.  It has to generate income from its own resources, yet it is looking after many historical sites dating back centuries.  It has to maintain and develop these attractions with income it generates with very little State support, particularly from the museum service.  It is a custodian of historical sites but it is limited in its capacity to develop them.  The Government, therefore, needs to recognise the cultural significance of the portfolio Shannon Heritage looks after.</p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage currently has an &euro;8 million development plan in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The former will provide &euro;3 million and the latter &euro;5 million.  Shannon Heritage does not have the money for new acquisitions, yet it has to develop its own sites.  I ask that the State play a more active role in supporting Shannon Heritage as a custodian of our historical sites, the treasures of our country, and develop them into modern tourist attractions.  Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is running into difficulties and does not have a modern element.  It needs to be upgraded to attract visitors.</p>  <p>  Shannon Heritage is intimately connected to Shannon Airport.  Through the development of Shannon Heritage sites, we can increase the throughput in the airport.  As the Minister is well aware, Shannon Airport has the capacity to increase its numbers.  It has about 1.8 million visitors at present, and this number could be increased to 4.2 million.  Shannon Heritage is a component of how one can improve the number of passengers going through Shannon Airport.  I would like the Minister to respond to these points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200029#BB00400"><p>I thank Deputy Harty for raising this important matter.  I understood Shannon Heritage was flourishing and I believe it is flourishing.  From what Deputy Harty is saying, I understand it needs more support, not only to be the custodian of the portfolio he has so eloquently described but also to develop and encourage more tourism and ensure greater numbers of tourists.</p>  <p>  In line with its tourism development remit, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is responsible for developing and promoting the tourism potential of the various counties and regions of the country.  It does this primarily in line with the relevant tourism experience brands, which provide the overarching context for related marketing, enterprise supports and tourism product development.  </p>  <p>  Having just debated another issue with me during Priority Questions, the Deputy is probably a little bit tired of me saying somebody else is responsible for what he feels I should be able to do.  We have deliberately put in place State agencies to keep me and other Ministers semi-detached from the power to give grants and supports so they may be given in a way that cannot be interpreted as politically motivated.  What I have to say does not mean there is disinterest on my part in setting policy, which I do, but it is qualified by the fact that my unwillingness to identify and give direct support to a project is because political motivation might be suspect and I might be thought to be yielding to pressure from the Deputy in doing so.  God forbid that would ever happen.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Shannon Heritage, one of the companies owned by Shannon Group, is also heavily involved in the operation of tourist attractions at Bunratty and in the surrounding region.  Such attractions provide reasons for visitors to come to these parts of Ireland and for the Irish public to enjoy their own important sites and attractions.  Accordingly, Shannon Heritage's ability to attract visitors to the region is an important driver for the tourism sector, which, as we all know, is a key employer in our rural economies.  We are all indebted to Shannon Heritage for its contribution to Irish tourism and its enthusiasm and ability to attract visitors.  Since Shannon Group's establishment in 2014 as a commercial State body, I understand it has undertaken a significant restructuring of the Shannon Heritage company, invested some &euro;5 million in improving assets and heritage attractions, and managed to double visitor numbers over the same period.  It is a good story.</p>  <p>  I understand Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is Shannon Heritage's anchor attraction.  Since 2014, I am informed that the company has invested around &euro;2.5 million in upgrading the facilities at this site and has just commenced the planning phase for a major upgrade of the park, on which it has been liaising with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority.  In this regard, I am pleased to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland awarded a stage one development grant of &euro;200,000 for this project under its large grants scheme &mdash; for technical assistance support.</p>  <p>  I understand that, in 2019, Shannon Heritage plans to continue to invest further in the heritage assets operated by the company, building on the work undertaken in previous years addressing the historical underinvestment prior to 2014.  I am pleased to learn that the company is working closely in partnership with Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland &mdash; particularly with the visitor attraction teams working on the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East &mdash; in addition to the local authorities, to enable further growth to visitor numbers to the mid-west.  I welcome the fact that Shannon Heritage is also collaborating with Clare County Council on its new tourism strategy.  It is the first time a local authority has partnered with another State company to create a tourism strategy, one which is focused on the dispersion of visitors around Clare to benefit all areas.  Working with all these partners, I am informed that Shannon Heritage's vision for the future is to be recognised as Ireland's leading operator and developer of tourist attractions, attracting 1 million more visitors annually by 2025.</p></speech>

Since Shannon Heritage looks after so many historical sites, it involves the Ministry with responsibility for tourism.</p><p>It also involves the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and perhaps the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Minister might want to consider involving other Departments as part of a co-ordinated approach to how these historical sites are looked after by Shannon Heritage.</p> <p> As the Minister has rightly said, Shannon Heritage is a commercial semi-State body, which means there are constraints on how it can access funding.  The Rock of Cashel, which is a very popular visitor attraction, can attract funding from other streams, but commercial semi-State bodies are precluded from doing likewise.  It is important to recognise that there may be a cross-departmental aspect to this matter.  Shannon Heritage wants to concentrate on attracting visitors to the west and bringing them through Shannon Airport.  A co-ordinated effort should be made to support the endeavours of Shannon Heritage, which wants to improve the quality of the product it presents to those who visit Bunratty Castle and Folk Park.  I am not sure whether the Minister has ever visited this fantastic visitor experience, which needs to be upgraded.  A co-ordinated approach needs to be taken across various Departments.  Consideration needs to be given to how Shannon Heritage can access funding in order to cross-promote the other elements in its portfolio and deliver increased traffic through Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

I recognise the success of Shannon Heritage in everything it has done to attract tourism to the area mentioned by the Deputy.  I would hate the message to go out from this debate that something is wrong or something is afoot.  I am sure the Deputy is right when he says that there is a great deal of potential to bring more people to the area in question.  He has signalled that this could be achieved with the support of the Government.  I will happily let F&aacute;ilte Ireland know the context in which this debate has been held and what the Deputy has had to say.  He has made a very good case, particularly for the Shannon Heritage owned sites in the mid-west, which he argues are in need of a more attentive custodian or a better promoter.</p>  <p>  I would like to point out one or two facts about Shannon Heritage which are relevant to this debate.  I recognise that it has been successful.  Last year, annual growth of 4% in visitor numbers was recorded across all the attractions operated by the company.  Since 2013, visitor numbers have more than doubled across Shannon Heritage's eight daytime visitor attractions and four night entertainment experiences, including the world famous Bunratty medieval banquet.  In 2016, the company's activities generated over 253,000 bed nights.  I understand the Deputy's plea for a custodian.  He has made the case for a possible link between the Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Transport, Tourism and Sport in the promotion of Shannon Heritage.  Both Departments have an interest in it.  However, it would be a pity not to recognise the success of Shannon Heritage in promoting tourism.</p></speech>

The Phoenix Park is Dublin's green lung.  It is the people's park for the people of Dublin and indeed for people from all over Ireland.  It receives significant numbers of tourists.  It is one of the largest walled parks in a city.  It is of vital importance to Dublin's environmental ecosystem.  The Minister of State might not appreciate the degree of surprise in the community when a detailed document of just under 200 pages in length was published a couple of weeks ago without any advance notice to local organisations and local residents, who are very much dedicated to the Phoenix Park.  I have a small copy of the document in question, which is dated October 2018 but was published very recently.  People were given three weeks to submit their views on this complex document.  Unfortunately, no copies of the full document were made available to public representatives of the neighbourhoods adjoining the park or to residents' associations.  I persuaded the awfully nice parks staff to give me a loan of a copy.  I know that a representative of the Navan Road residents' association has also got a loan of a copy.  I do not know what has happened in the OPW, but documents like this have simply not been made available.</p>  <p>  I have a number of suggestions to put to the Minister of State.  They could make the whole process much better and lead to very good consultation between citizens and the people who have been putting forward these proposals.  First, given that the two-week extension announced by the Minister is not enough, especially as the overall consultation period encompasses St. Patrick's Day and Easter, I suggest that the period be extended until the end of May so that this 200-page document can be examined in some detail.  Second, I suggest that copies of this document be placed in libraries and community centres in the areas surrounding the park.  This would give the public an opportunity to look at it.  Third, I suggest that the authors of the study meet and consult the public, residents' associations and others who are interested in the park.  The engineers involved in BusConnects, which was initially a computer desk-based survey, would confirm that the consultations which have been held in that instance have helped them to understand local geography and topography in various parts of Dublin.  I think a similar approach should be taken in the case of the Phoenix Park.</p>  <p>  I agree with the document's description of the OPW as one of the stakeholders in the park because the OPW has been looking after the park for many years.  The document also suggests that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is a stakeholder.  I do not know where the Department comes in.  The other stakeholder mentioned is F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The people of Ireland, including the residents of the areas of Dublin adjoining the park, are not mentioned on the list.  Given that the Government is all about spin and communication, it should appreciate that the Phoenix Park belongs to us all.  What is the Minister of State's vision of the purpose of this document?  Where is the budget provision for it?  There are many good proposals in it.  I have advanced many of them previously.</p></speech>

It was first opened to the public in 1747 as a place of enjoyment for all the citizens of Dublin.  Today, the park is enjoyed by 10 million local, national and international visitors each year.  It plays a central role in the life of Dublin city.  It is a sanctuary from the city, an important sports, recreation and public amenity and home to a range of institutions, including &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, Dublin Zoo, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na headquarters and the US ambassador's residence.  As the world's urban population doubles from 3.5 billion to more than 7 billion over the next 40 years, parks and open spaces will become even more critical elements in the creation of vibrant cities and healthy communities.  Therefore, the Phoenix Park will be central to how Dublin city continues to evolve as a great place to live, work and visit.  From the local to the global, the Phoenix Park is beloved by Dubliners and international visitors alike.  This was borne out recently when it won various awards, including the <i>Irish Independent</i>best local attraction for 2019 and a gold medal at the 2018 world urban parks awards.</p><p>In 2018, with funding from its strategic partners F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Office of Public Works, OPW, commissioned a review of the visitor experience in the park.  The Phoenix Park visitor experience strategic review proposes a roadmap for how this amazing resource can make a greater contribution to the tourism economy through sensitive enhancement of visitor infrastructure, along with the preservation of its unique heritage features.  In this plan, the OPW seeks to realise the park&rsquo;s potential as one of the truly great parks of the world, while also ensuring the unique features which make up the park will be conserved and protected for the enjoyment of generations to come.</p> <p> Through a competitive tender process, Denis Byrne Architects was awarded the contract to undertake the review.  Its objectives and requirements were to review the future tourism development potential of the Phoenix Park, to prepare a development plan for the Phoenix Park visitor centre and to prepare a development plan for the Magazine Fort.</p> <p> The draft Phoenix Park visitor experience strategic review addresses the first objective, namely, to review the future tourism development potential of the Phoenix Park.  The review examines five zones in the park, considering themes of welcome, history and heritage, activity and well-being, as well as of identity, biodiversity and connectivity with the city in the context of the current and future potential visitor experience at the Phoenix Park.  The report sets out 29 recommendations which, if implemented, would increase the park&rsquo;s contribution to the tourism economy, while, at the same time, ensuring the unique character of the Phoenix Park is conserved and protected for the enjoyment of generations to come.  All recommendations will be subject to an OPW review, funding allocation and the statutory planning process.</p> <p> The second objective in the brief is to prepare a development plan for the Phoenix Park visitor centre.  The existing visitor centre complex is over 25 years old.  Up to 1.7 million visitors were recorded at the complex in 2018 and the existing facilities are no longer fit for purpose.  A new visitor centre is required which will provide interpretation of the park, caf&eacute;, retail and welfare facilities.  Sustainable transport and parking facilities will need to be provided to include buses, cars, cyclists and pedestrians.  Any developments or redevelopments proposed will be subject to the statutory planning process.</p> <p> With regard to the third objective, to prepare a development plan for the Magazine Fort, it is proposed to conserve the fort and open it as a living history experience unique in Dublin.  As part of the review, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Waterways Ireland and Dublin Zoo were consulted.  Currently, the public is being asked for its observations.</p></speech>

In his response, the Minister of State never once mentioned the people of Dublin and the people of Ireland whose park this is.  Instead, he spoke about development which includes retail.  Why does the Phoenix Park need retail?  It is our premier environmental and ecological gem.  Is the Minister of State proposing that it will be turned into some kind of shopping centre for a visitor experience for people stepping off cruise ships?  People around the park do not want that.  We want artisan caf&eacute;s which employ local people and use Irish products.  We do not want large multinational companies dominating the significant tourism offering of the park.  Neither do we want it to cancel out the rights of Dubliners and the rest of the country who use the Phoenix Park.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will know some of the many songs associated with the park such as the &ldquo;Zoological Gardens&rdquo; and what one is likely to see at certain times.  The Phoenix Park is famous in Irish history.  The Magazine Fort restoration has been under way for several years.  I hope the Minister of State will manage to get the regular input of funding to restore this magnificent fort to be on a par with some of the French forts which people may be familiar with from their holidays.</p>  <p>  I am a little concerned that the Independent Alliance has a bias against Dublin&rsquo;s north and west sides, feeling that we are not posh enough for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who is sitting beside the Minister of State.  We value our park and we want consultation on its development.  He will get nothing but positive input from the residents&rsquo; associations in Castleknock, the North Circular Road and Oxmantown Road.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200031#DD02200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p><p>The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to ensure the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and its review committee are not destroyed, but are instead retained for posterity.</p><p>I will now outline the Bill's key provisions.  It provides for interaction between the redress bodies and the National Archives to determine which records should be disposed of and which should be retained.  It also provides that on the dissolution of the bodies, their records are deemed to be records of the Department of Education and Skills and transferred to the custody of the National Archives; that on their transfer to the National Archives the records will be withheld from public inspection for a period of not less than 75 years; that access to the records may only be possible at that point when regulations are made by the Minister; and that a number of provisions of the National Archives Act 1986 will not apply to the records.  This mainly covers the disapplication of provisions that govern access by individuals and Government Departments.<br/><br/>The historical context for this Bill is important.  It is almost ten years since the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse published its final report, popularly known as the Ryan report.  The commission was established in an atmosphere when the scale of abuse in the residential institutions was only becoming known.  However, without the benefit of the commission&rsquo;s work and the testimony given to it, the truth of what happened in these institutions might never have been made public.  <br/><br/>The commission and the Residential Institutions Redress Board, which was established to provide financial redress to survivors of abuse, are key elements in the State&rsquo;s response to institutional child abuse.  The Ryan report is an exemplary work which rigorously charts the history of the residential institutions.  It exposes the scale and systemic nature of the abuse which was perpetrated within them and the failings of those who managed and supervised the institutions in allowing this abuse to continue to take place.  While those institutions no longer exist, it is important that the history of institutional abuse is preserved and not forgotten.<br/><br/>It is also important that those who suffered abuse were provided with redress.  As I have said, the Residential Institutions Redress Board provided financial awards to those who suffered abuse, while the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee provided for the independent review of such awards where applicants so wished.  The redress board has virtually completed its work, with just a very small number of cases yet to be finalised.  Some 16,650 applications to the redress scheme were accepted, with 15,600 awards offered to survivors or their families.  Costs of &euro;1.25 billion will have been incurred under the redress scheme, including awards, legal costs of applicants and administration costs.<br/><br/>The national counselling service and the family tracing service provided by Barnardos are other important elements of the State&rsquo;s response and are available to former residents.  Funding of &euro;12.7 million was provided to the now dissolved Education Finance Board to enable it to provide grants and supports to former residents and their relatives to assist them in accessing educational services.  The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, which operates under the name of Caranua, was established in 2012.  Caranua administers the fund of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the congregations as part of their contribution to the costs of redress.  To date, it has expended some &euro;91 million, including administration costs, engaging with and funding supports for survivors.  It has received more than 6,500 applications and more than 5,000 individuals have received support.  <br/><br/>In addition to these measures, my Department has engaged professional facilitators to support the planning of consultations with survivors on their experiences of redress and on how they might be supported into the future.  My Department has also convened an interdepartmental committee to examine how existing State services can support the needs of survivors.<br/><br/>I turn now to the nature of the records to which the Bill refers.  These are highly sensitive and personal documents.  The records of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the review committee are essentially the applications for redress made by individual former residents.  These records would include much personal data, including, for example, detailed family information regarding the individual applicant and perhaps others such as parents, siblings, spouse or children.  They could include details of the circumstances leading to the individual being placed in a residential institution and details of the abuse suffered in the institution and its impact, etc.  Detailed medical and psychological reports regarding the individuals which may also be on file.  The views, if any, of the relevant management body on individual applications made to the redress board may also be included, together with papers regarding the determination of a redress award.  The records are also likely to include information regarding alleged perpetrators of abuse, based on the information provided by victims.  This information was not contested and the individual against whom an allegation was made may not be aware that such information exists in the records.<br/><br/>The records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse contain the papers of both the commission&rsquo;s investigation committee and its confidential committee.  This includes personal testimony of former residents, members of congregations and other individuals who testified before the commission.  Again, this testimony contains details of abuse of various forms and committed by various persons.  It was certainly the view at the time of the establishment of the commission that, without assurances of confidentiality, it would have been very difficult to persuade people to engage with the commission.  Without that engagement, the light which the Ryan report shone on the abuse would have been dimmed significantly.  <br/><br/>It is, I hope, apparent from this summary of the very sensitive and highly personal nature of the records in question why mechanisms to ensure confidentiality, including the disapplication of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts, were enshrined in the legislation establishing the bodies.  The Acts in question are the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.<br/><br/>The ultimate protection provided in the Acts was for the disposal and destruction of the records of the bodies once they had completed their work and prior to their dissolution, which is also provided for in the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  However, it is also the case that, with the growing state of knowledge about institutional abuse, to which the work of the commission and redress board made a significant contribution, concerns arose in relation to the destruction of the records.  In this regard, a motion on the Ryan report, which was adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 June 2009, noted &quot;the desirability that, in so far as possible, all of the documentation received by and in the possession of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is preserved for posterity and not destroyed.&quot;<br/><br/>The Ryan report is a comprehensive account of the extent of the abuse that was perpetrated and its impact on the individuals concerned.  However, even in some 2,500 pages, it could not tell the many personal stories of those affected.  Retention of the records will ensure that these stories are kept.  The records also contain testimony from those involved in the operation and supervision of the institutions.  This is information which is also of great significance in understanding this dark period in our history.  These are, therefore, historically important records which could, in time, become primary source material for historians and family members seeking to undertake genealogical research or simply to understand what their father, mother or other relatives suffered while in an institution.  <br/><br/>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the current legislation, which would see the records destroyed, to establish a new Act, which would seek to balance the need to retain the confidentiality that was promised to those who provided personal information with the need to preserve what are important historical records.  There is no doubt that the question of destruction of the records - the current <i>status quo</i>- or retention is complex.  The timing of release is also significant.  On the one hand, it requires weighing in the balance the original assurances of confidentiality, the associated provision for the destruction of the records and the sensitive and personal nature of the records.  On the other hand, due consideration must be given to the wider public interest in ensuring that the history of child abuse in the residential institutions is preserved.<br/><br/>I am aware that when the draft scheme of the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny, there was significant concern about what would be the impact on individuals if the records were released.  Some of those concerns have been amplified by the coming into force of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Cognisance of those concerns has been reflected in the drafting of the Bill and in the context of the data protection impact assessment which my Department will publish in due course.<br/><br/>I am also aware that there is a spectrum of views.  Some favour disposal of the records, some want their immediate release and others support retention for varying periods and-or release with redaction.<br/><br/>These matters required careful consideration and that consideration has been given in the development of the Bill before the House today.  The Government has been supportive of the intention behind the D&aacute;il motion and has been anxious to give that intention effect in a way which takes account the sensibilities and rights of those persons who are named in the records.</p><p>The result of that consideration, which includes significant legal advice, is that the records should be retained and transferred to the National Archives, but that they should be withheld from public inspection for a lengthy period.  This period is specified in the Bill before the House today as being at least 75 years.</p> <p> I will now address the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is short and contains only 11 sections, a number of which are standard provisions.  I will now outline them.</p> <p> Section 1 defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides a mechanism for the disposal of records not requiring to be retained.  As would be expected in archival processes, not all the records of the bodies will warrant preservation.  For example, there will be routine administrative records on file.  Decisions in regard to the disposal are, in my view, best left to the bodies themselves with the director of the National Archives having the final say in the matter.  Under this section, the bodies will certify that particular records or classes of records are not required to be retained and the director, on being satisfied that the records in question do not warrant preservation, may grant an authorisation for their disposal.  Records must be disposed of confidentially.  These provisions are similar to those in section 7 of the National Archives Act 1986 and reflective of the normal practice the National Archives would go through when assessing records for preservation.  The section also provides for the inspection of records by the director and for the making available to the director by a body of records for the purposes of the section that may otherwise be prohibited from being disclosed.  This provision is required in order to overcome the restrictions on access set out in existing legislation.</p> <p> Section 3 provides that the records of the three redress bodies will, on the dissolution of the bodies, become records of the Department of Education and Skills and be transferred to the National Archives.  The records will then be withheld from public access for a period of at least 75 years.  Release of the records will be contingent on regulations being made under section 6 of the Bill.  It is important to note that if no regulations are made, then the records cannot be released.</p> <p> As the records will come under the scope of the National Archives Act 1986, it is necessary to provide that the definition of "archives" in that Act should include a record transferred under section 3(1) of the Bill.  Section 4 makes provision for this.</p> <p> Section 5 provides that a number of sections of the National Archives Act 1986 will not apply to a record transferred under the Bill, while other sections will not apply during the sealing period.  This is to ensure the integrity of the confidentiality provisions.  Essentially, any provision of that Act that provides for access to records is being dis-applied.  For example, under the 1986 Act, a Department could retain a copy of a record transferred to the National Archives or could requisition records back from the National Archives.  This will not be possible in the case of these records.  Once records are transferred to the National Archives, they may not be disposed of during the period for which they are sealed.  The existing right of persons to inspect archives in the custody of the National Archives must also be dis-applied.  As the Bill contains provisions regarding the disposal of records and the transfer of records to the National Archives, the existing provisions set down in sections 7 and 8 of the National Archives Act are being dis-applied.</p> <p> I mentioned earlier that access could only take place if regulations are made and section 6 makes provisions for this.  Such regulations can be made no earlier than 12 months prior to the expiry of the 75 year period and following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  The regulations do not prescribe the specific issues that should be addressed in the regulations as it is not possible at this remove to specify what those issues might be.  As I mentioned earlier, the regulations will consider arrangements in regard to the release of the records based on the circumstances prevailing at that time, and not now.  However, the regulation making provision requires that the Minister of the day, when proposing to make regulations, must have regard to the impact that any resultant disclosure of information may have on the well-being and emotional state of persons alive at the date of the making of the regulations.  This enables any concerns that there may be that the release of the records may have an effect on persons still alive at that time to be taken into account.  Positive resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas are required before any regulations are made.</p> <p> Sections 7 and 8 provide for the removal of the existing power of the redress bodies, set down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, under which the bodies would determine or make arrangements for the disposal of their records.  Other amendments to those Acts are also being made.</p> <p> Section 9 continues the existing restriction of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to records transferring under section 2(1).  Sections 10 and 11 are standard provisions dealing with expenses, citation and commencement.</p> <p> When the draft scheme of this Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny, the substance of concerns raised related to: the right to privacy; the right to a good name; and the issue of legitimate expectations of confidentiality.  I must stress again that these issues were given detailed consideration.  That is reflected in the measures in the Bill in respect of: the duration of the period of retention and the provisions in respect of the timing of the making of regulations; and the requirement to take into account the impact of release of records on persons alive at the time of the making of the regulations.</p> <p> Questions have also been raised as to why the existing provisions of the National Archives Act 1986 would not be sufficient.  I acknowledge that the National Archives Act 1986 provides for a certification process to limit access to records that could potentially be open for access after 30 years.  However, this provision does not give sufficiently robust assurances regarding the treatment of the records.  This is especially the case when account is taken of the fact that their retention represents a substantial change of approach relative to the process of destruction that is provided for in the existing legislation governing the bodies.  It is precisely for this reason that the lengthy withholding period is being proposed.</p> <p> I should at this point make it clear to the House that the records which are already extant in my Department in respect of industrial schools and reformatories do not come within the ambit of this Bill.  They will be treated under the general provisions of the National Archives Act as they apply to departmental records.  In addition, certain personal records of persons who were committed to industrial schools are held by my Department and are accessible under freedom of information.  That position remains unchanged under the Bill.</p> <p> Questions have also been raised as to whether the records might be released on an anonymised basis and consideration has been given to this approach.  However, it has a number of deficiencies which are as follows.  First, it would rob the records of much of their historical significance.  The Ryan report itself already presents an anonymised, or, to be strictly accurate, pseudonymised, account of the residential institutions and the abuse which took place within them.  Therefore, relative to that report, anonymising the records would take away much of the additional significance of the records themselves.  Second, anonymising the records would not be without risk that personal information could be revealed, either through an administrative error or by inference from the remaining content.  Lastly, the anonymisation of the records would represent a massive and costly undertaking, given that there are in excess of 2 million individual records involved.  This, of itself, would not be reason enough to rule out this approach, but in light of the other drawbacks I have alluded to, it must also weigh on the considerations.</p> <p> As I have said, there are arguments on both sides in favour of destruction or retention and on the timing of release of the records.  It is unlikely that those arguments will be conclusively resolved given the differences of view which have been expressed on the matter.</p> <p> The Government is, however, anxious to respond to concerns from survivors that their experiences will be forgotten.  That is why, on Committee Stage, I intend to bring forward a proposal to provide for a review of the operation of the Bill after 25 years.  While not being prescriptive, I envisage that such a review will provide an opportunity to look at the situation of survivors and at any developments in relation to the history of the various institutions in which abuse took place - a so-called "archipelago of institutions" which, regrettably, extends beyond those comprehended by this Bill.</p> <p> The Ryan report recommended that a memorial to survivors be erected.  Unfortunately the proposals for the erection of such a memorial on a site adjacent to the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Square in Dublin failed to receive the requisite planning permission.  Memorialisation is a recurring theme for survivors of institutional abuse and while I would like to move forward with memorialisation in relation to the residential institutions for which my Department had responsibility, I see merit in taking a whole-of-government approach to memorialisation, especially given what we now know about the interconnectedness of these institutions.</p></speech>

So much has been revealed in the past 25 years or so about child sexual abuse, particularly in the church and institutions, as well as some sporting bodies.  It must be stated that while it was revealed in the past 25 years, I have no doubt there was an acceptance in society for some of this.  People knew what was going on and turned a blind eye due to inappropriate deference to certain authorities, particularly the church and the State.</p>  <p>  We are really discussing the consequences of the Ryan report today.  That report showed that a failure on the part of the church and the State led to the systematic institutional abuse of children, with lives destroyed, maligned or ended as a result.  It is vital for future generations that the experience of those who suffered at the hands of those in positions of power is not lost.  Long after the victims have died, their testimonies will bear witness to a stark period in our country's history.  I know there has been some discussion about the merits and demerits of the Bill.  However, the fundamental merit of the Bill, and the reason we support it, is that these records will be publicly available.  Up to now, that has not been the case.  The Bill, therefore, represents a step forward.  In some ways, it implements the D&aacute;il motion from 2009 put forward by the Taoiseach of the day and subsequently accepted by all parties.  It sought that records would not be destroyed and this Bill allows the preservation of those records, which is important.</p>  <p>  We also recognise that the Bill comes about because of learning after the fact.  We also accept that the Bill brings challenges and compromises.  Having discussed the matter with officials and looked at the record of previous Ministers dealing with the legislation and the pre-legislative scrutiny, there were a number a compromises.  The Government is acting in good faith with the Bill.  I am not wedded to every aspect of the Bill and every time limit but I accept that the Government gave careful consideration to the matter before coming up with its proposals.  I am willing to listen to the debate to see what points can be made before we make a final decision.  We will certainly support the Bill on Second Stage and want it to move to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  In 2009, after the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen, met victims, the Government brought forward a motion to the effect that, where possible, the documentation of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse should be preserved.  Certainty with respect to these records was not guaranteed at the time due to legal advice.  The interviews and other records of these inquiries had been given in total confidence, and we must bear that in mind.  They were not initially intended for use in other forums, and that is why the Minister is bringing forward this required legislation.  These circumstances mean that we are in a difficult position and that the passing of this legislation will be difficult.</p>  <p>  The records held by the State were gathered for a particular purpose, which was to establish the facts in the inquiry, which did a fantastic job in that respect.  It brought this horror to our attention.  Let us be honest, however, as some of the facts that were in the report were quite well known to people in different communities where some of this abuse was taking place.  There is absolutely no doubt that the country turned a blind eye to it in that regard.  The records of the commission were originally to be destroyed following the completion of its work, as is standard.  However, following the findings in the report, there was broad acceptance that the testimonies and records provided in the creation of these reports were of vital historical significance.  The Ryan report is of vital historical significance.  I accept the Minister's point that the Ryan report goes into considerable depth and detail in what it describes of the horror and the historical position.</p>  <p>  After the Ryan report and following a meeting of the then Taoiseach and the victims, as well as the D&aacute;il motion, there was significant support for the retention of records.  Everybody in the House agreed that the records should be retained, and nobody stated that the original position should have obtained.  We will change that with the legislation, which is significant, and it should be acknowledged that this part of the Bill is not controversial and should be welcomed.  It is a positive decision to retain records, as if we do nothing or the legislation stalls, these records will not become public at any point.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the historical silence and the blind eye that was given to these scandals, so it would run counter to everything we have learned to destroy those documents.  It is vital that they be recognised as part of a history that some people may wish to forget; we should never forget it.  The question then becomes how we can achieve this while respecting the wishes of those who shared their experiences in total confidence so we could learn the truth.  We must put in place measures to ensure records of such importance are preserved, while simultaneously respecting the real stories and deeply personal testimonies of the individuals engaged with redress bodies.  I have been informed that the documents contain a number of allegations and that if they were published prematurely, the allegations might not stand the test of court action.  This is an avenue into which the Oireachtas should not lead the State.  Reopening matters with the accidental release of unredacted or incorrectly redacted information would be a grave disservice to all those who gave their time to this report and investigation.  Furthermore, in situations where survivors who participated in these investigations do not wish to disclose their personal experiences, we must respect and protect their wishes.</p>  <p>  I see some merit in the suggestion from certain campaigners that the records should be released in anonymised form.  I am willing to listen to the arguments for that, although I am also willing to listen to the counterarguments that the Minister might address if he is not willing to agree to that suggestion.  If I were making the decision, the first consideration would be the cost.  I presume any amendment put down in this respect would be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle because it would be a substantial cost to the Exchequer.  I wonder who would do the job in a confidential way, as it would be an absolutely massive undertaking.  Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to listen to the arguments on this but my initial instincts are not supportive.  Nevertheless, we can work collaboratively to get the right result in the end, or at least the best possible compromise.  Essentially, we are compromising on the legal advice.  The more information the Minister can give on that legal advice relating to the 75-year period, the more helpful it would be for the debate.  I know that, as a matter of course, the Government does not issue the advice of the Attorney General.  However, it would be extremely helpful for the Minister to go into as much detail as possible in that regard, either in his reply or on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has apparently raised concerns about the security of information if such a project of anonymisation was implemented and I share such concerns.  I also accept the point that the Ryan report goes a considerable distance in covering this matter, although it is not by itself the full record of the evidence taken in the process.  The Department has also raised concerns about the scale of the project and mistakes that could be made in the 2 million sealed records.  This is very understandable but, again, I am perfectly willing to listen to counterarguments, particularly on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The Minister has explained to us that the proposed 75-year limit is aimed at achieving the retention of these records and the protection of those who gave testimony, essentially ensuring that those involved will have passed away when the information is released.  The length of time in this legislation in no way diminishes the findings or the work of the commission, the residential institutions redress board and the review committee.  I pay tribute to those involved in that difficult work.  I will approach the legislation by understanding that this is an issue of compromise and everybody in this House wants to do right by the victims.  I would certainly be extremely cognisant of any legal advice that the Government has described in good faith for the 75-year period.  I know from various interactions that there are different views on this.  Some people representing victims can see the point while others totally disagree with it.</p>  <p>  We have already started the debate.  We will have a much more detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I look forward to that.  We will engage in the process in as constructive a fashion as is possible, with the needs of victims and history in our mind.  History has an awful habit of repeating itself.  We may all be horrified by child sexual abuse in this country but more people seem to pay no regard to what happened in Nazi Germany, for example.  Those lessons of history about that particular evil should be remembered and the lessons of history in this country about child sexual abuse should always be remembered.</p><p>There are so many competing reasons for the debate that will take place in respect of this Bill but first and foremost, it must be about the victims of this terrible abuse and ensuring it never happens again.</p></speech>

When debating it this evening, we need to be mindful that what we are discussing are the records of people's lives.  They are the records of hurt, abuse, violence, marginalisation and fear.  We need to be very careful about making decisions without adequate outreach to the survivors of abuse, their families and the advocacy groups that speak on their behalf.</p>  <p>  We obviously have concerns that without new legislation, the records will be disposed of with the dissolution of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee.  However, at the same time, to seal and withhold these records from public access for a period of 75 years raises question marks.  It seems an unreasonable period of time preventing any access.  I also worry about the reference in the Bill deeming the records to be the records or possession of the Department of Education and Skills and the proposal to transfer those records to the National Archives.  These records are the horrific lived experiences of the residents in all these institutions who suffered at the hands of this State.  They belong to the survivors and families and nobody else.  We must never forget what went on in these institutions or white wash them from our memory or that of future generations.  It is part of the past and we must acknowledge and face that.  We must remember that generation after generation will remember the pain and suffering caused at the hands of church and State.  Are we not doing this by locking these testimonies away for 75 years?  Are we nearly repeating the negative history all these people suffered?  We have had redress and the various schemes and apologies.  Are we now saying to these people that these records will be sealed for 75 years?  I know nobody wants the records to be destroyed.  That is fairly obvious but there must be some happy medium or way of meeting in the middle.  I know the Minister said there are mixed views or stories but I would say that the majority of survivors or certainly those from whom we have heard are very concerned about this and concerned that they are being failed again at the hands of the State.  They were obviously failed in the worst way possible but here we are in the same boat.  Some common sense must be applied here.  We need consultation with the survivors' groups and families and to look at whether there is some way of meeting in the middle.  A period of 75 years seems extremely excessive.  We do not want to cause even more hurt and add even more insult to injury to people who have already suffered so horrifically.  We will have more discussion on Committee Stage.  I welcome that but we need to look seriously at this to see if there is some way that we can avoid leaving it for a full 75 years.</p></speech>

The Ryan report very clearly called for this valuable information to be preserved and not destroyed and that is correct.  On the back of that, there should have been widespread consultation with survivors and their families to reach some sort of consensus as to the future of these files.  As far as I can see, that did not happen and instead we are told that the Government is going to seal this material in the National Archives until almost 2095 thereby making it inaccessible for future generations.</p>  <p>  There is clearly an option that would involve either redacting or anonymising these files so that no individual can be identified.  How did the Government explore this?  I do not buy the excuse we saw reported recently in the media where the Department of Education and Skills claimed that anonymising these files would rob them of their historical significance.  The files would not be permanently altered.  Anonymised versions can be released and the full files released at a later date.  I do not see how releasing anonymised versions of the files could in any way undermine the right to privacy and confidentiality of those who engaged with the commission or the redress board.  I saw one survivor quoted in the media as describing the sealing of these files as another cover-up.  This person says she is aware of some survivors who want their files released after their deaths so that their families know what they went through.  She also notes that some survivors may have a very different view but they should at least have been asked.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister when he says it is essential to ensure that we never forget the abuse that was perpetrated against innocent children and that future generations can be made aware of and understand what took place but I fail to see how completely sealing these documents for the rest of the century and even after that and only making them available for scrutiny under very strict conditions in any way achieves that.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to survivors and their families and to have consultations about this.</p></speech>

The Minister acknowledged that 75 years is a lengthy period of time.  It is a long time.  We have collectively acknowledged that those records should not be destroyed.  There is agreement on that.  I note the previous suggestion of colleagues that we should try to move towards some form of consensus because I think that might be possible.  In the period between now and Committee Stage, the wise thing to do might be to engage with survivors' groups because the survivors are concerned that this is an attempt by the State to cover up.  We should bear in mind that these people bear the scars of repeated cover-ups by the State and those who ran the institutions in which these people lived.  These people lack trust and for good reason.  This is nothing to do with any individual in this House.  History shows these people that where it is possible to cover up, a cover-up can and will happen.  We must remember that what is contained in these records are deeply personal stories of hurt, abuse and people who were treated horrendously at the hands of the men and women running these institutions.  While they may not be able to talk to their families about it while they are alive, they want their stories be available so that their families can understand what they went through.  There is a value in us having those stories to refer to.  It is really important that we never forget what happened and that those records would be available in a format that is sensitive to the needs to the survivors, be it in an anonymised or redacted format however that can be achieved.</p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is clear.  We will not oppose this legislation going on to Committee Stage but it is our intention to table amendments and to engage on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to engage with the survivors' groups in the intervening period between now and Committee Stage.  I understand the Department does this in any event.  I also urge the Minister to examine what can be done.  He has heard the concerns of the people here this evening.  I ask him to examine what can be done for the survivors.  Some of them have taken to the media but the vast majority could never do this.  They are at home, they are worried and they believe they will be white washed out of history again.  That is a genuine concern so I urge the Minister to use the time between now and Committee Stage to engage with survivors and look proactively at what options can be explored in terms of making this information available and ensuring people's stories are not hidden or covered up, which neither the Minister nor anyone here wants to do.</p><p>There must be a way to handle this sensitively.  Not everyone will want his or her story to be available and I know there are challenges in anonymisation because even with an anonymous account it might still be possible to identify the person.  There are mixed views, as the Minister himself said, but 75 years is a very long time for this to take.</p> <p> As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the legislation proceeding to Committee Stage, but we are hopeful that when it gets to Committee Stage the Minister will have had an opportunity to engage with the survivors and to come back with proposals that sensitively and respectfully acknowledge what the survivors themselves want because they must be central to this process.</p></speech>

I am talking about Christine Buckley, who was in the Goldenbridge orphanage along with many other girls.  Anyone who knows the history of Goldenbridge knows that the children there were treated horrifically.  There was an ordinary day school beside it, and it is still there.  It is a very good school and is beside St. Michael's Estate in Goldenbridge.  In fact, one of the founders of Fine Gael is buried in the graveyard adjacent.  The second person I wish to mention is Mary Raftery, a very fine RT&Eacute; journalist who died far too young, as Christine Buckley did, and who played a key role in the production of the RT&Eacute; documentary series "States of Fear".  A number of other people wrote books about this.</p>  <p>  In Dublin, when I was a small child and until about 20 or 30 years ago, if a little girl was bold she was warned she could end up in Goldenbridge, and if a boy misbehaved he was told he might go to Artane.  I think there are other Deputies here who know about this.  I recall that when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il some years afterwards, the question of what had been happening in these institutions became a public affair.  In the case of boys, the stories about Artane and the boys' band started to tumble out.  Of course, people took great pride in the band every all-Ireland final day.  There was the question of what happened in places such as Daingean and in Letterfrack.  All these institutions and many others besides were bywords for appalling savagery to children.  The children were beaten and starved.  Then, to add to all that, the revelations of sexual abuse gradually came out.  This is the background to the Bill.</p>  <p>  When I was in government, I recall advising the then Taoiseach that in no circumstances should the records be destroyed, that they are the lived history of all the people who lived in the institutions.  I therefore welcome the Bill.  At that point, however, the key was to ensure that the records were saved because, frankly, many people, for reasons of defence of the institutions involved in the abuse, wanted the records of what had happened and the evidence that had been given destroyed.  I therefore welcome the fact that the Minister and his Government have agreed to hold onto the records, but 75 years is too long.  It is so important that the stories and the information we know are passed on to our children and grandchildren in order that never again as a country will we live through this abuse and never in any of our names will it happen again.  I remember being amazed when all this information came out in the D&aacute;il that so many Members had simply never heard of the institutions.  They did not know.  I suppose they came from nice middle-class families.  The only institution middle-class people might have been put into was a psychiatric hospital.  Enough people were put into those as well.  We as a State institutionalised people.  The records are incredibly important as a testimony of the things that went wrong in Ireland as well as the many wonderful things and wonderful people.</p>  <p>  I really hope the religious orders are not acting as some kind of mental block on this information being revealed because, of course, not all the nuns and priests were abusers.  Many of them actually helped and looked after children and probably saved their lives.  However, there were many who beat, starved, disrespected and abused the children.  There are two sides of this story and we need to remember that.  It is not pleasant going back into it.  Many of the people who were personally affected are now much older and passing on, but from one and all I have heard, "Please ensure that the records are not destroyed."</p>  <p>  I remember when the commission was set up.  It was a horrendous experience for many of the people who went to it in its first few years, particularly many of the men because they genuinely had never told anyone.  I think the women may have shared their experiences in the institutions a little more than the men did.  Of course, many of the boys who were in institutions, particularly if they were musical, found careers in the Army.  Many of the people who have served with such distinction in our Defence Forces got into the Defence Forces having left one of the institutions.  This is therefore a very complex history.</p>  <p>  Part of this opened up when children came back from America as young adults in the 1990s looking for their information because they had been adopted from Ireland and taken to America, and we now know an awful lot more about that.  They came to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I was Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development at the time and Dick Spring was both T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Essentially, with the help particularly of the civil servants in the Department, but also of the people in the National Archives such as Ms Catriona Crowe, those records were saved.  They could have been put in a skip and just lost.  Those people in many cases therefore got access to their records.  We know from the story of Philomena and her son how difficult a process this was.</p>  <p>  We are living in a different era now, and the Minister is right to be cautious because these are people's very personal data.  I honestly put it to the Minister, however, that the period of 75 years is excessive and uncalled for.  The National Archives provide for a period of 30 years.  Personally, I would go for a period of 25 years.  I also believe that an anonymised project could be done.  I heard Deputy Thomas Byrne, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, say he was very worried about the potential cost of this.  Fianna F&aacute;il - Bertie Ahern and Michael Woods - did a deal with the religious orders.  How much did that cost us and how does that cost compare with the cost of looking at the records and making them anonymous but making the stories available?</p><p>The Minister referred to that matter and it is mentioned in summaries of the Bill.  In the early years of the previous Government there was a proposal to have a memorial to people who lived this experience and to the survivors.  That recommendation was not accepted.  Other recommendations, however, have come from all over the country suggesting there should be memorials and a museum.  People could go there to grasp the experience, just as they can go to a museum to experience what it was like living in a Dublin tenement or, indeed, being Jewish in Berlin.</p> <p> We need somewhere like that.  There are already a number of locations in Ireland and in Dublin.  I refer to former laundries in the centre of the city which could be utilised to tell the story of what happened to people.  I support the Bill, as do others.  On Committee Stage, however, I will move to have the period these records are sealed reduced.  I understand others will do the same.  The Minister should be guided on this by the people who are alive and who lived in these institutions.  He should also be guided by the many people who wrote about their experience in the institutions.  All the people I have met want the story told so we as a people will never be tempted to be involved in something similar again.</p> <p> We do of course have our own dilemmas regarding children, not least homelessness.  We are not stating this generation is fantastic.  We are struggling to get things right and we can acknowledge people then may have struggled as well.  What happened to people, however, was dreadful.  It left long shadows and deep scars.  The commission eventually began to work in a much better and more respectful way in dealing with the people who gave evidence.  Later commissions of inquiry have shown much more respect to people recounting what happened to them.</p> <p> I welcome this Bill and the Labour Party will support it.  We will, however, also seek to have the period the records are sealed reduced.  We will do that in a spirit of listening to the survivors and what they want.  They want the records kept and we all agree with that.  It is good that is secured.  The survivors also want a memorial to what happened and we can discuss further how that might be done properly.  In addition, they want this material made available in an appropriate and much shorter timeframe.  They do not want it made available in 75 years.  Catriona Crowe has suggested the material could be made available on an anonymised basis.  I would be perfectly happy with that.</p> <p> I do not think the cost can be anything close to that of the redress scheme.  I refer to the deal struck by former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the late Minister and Deputy, Dr. Michael Woods, of Fianna F&aacute;il in the dying days of one Government and the start of another.  We could move to have proper respectful remembrance and memorials similar to those commemorating dreadful events in other parts of the world.  Children and visitors could learn and hear the story of what happened.  We have since heard more stories, such as those from Tuam and the homes in Cork and Roscrea.  I refer also to what has been happening more recently with St. Patrick's Guild, which involved tens of thousands of children being adopted.  This Government, unfortunately, has still not been able to provide adopted people with access to their records.  That is another issue that needs to be addressed.  I am glad this Bill has been published.  We will support it but we would like the Minister seriously to consider changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200037#KK00200"><p>The preservation of the records of the three inquiries would be welcomed by everybody.  It is probably overdue in many ways.  The fact that positive act, and the legislation being proposed to do that, would also contain within it one of the more regressive, unhelpful and draconian elements of legislation is appalling.  It strikes a chilling tone.  This is being enforced in respect of citizens who have already been violated by this State.  I find that utterly shocking.  I realise this legislation is being pushed because of the lack of other legislation before the House due to uncertainty with Brexit.  It is completely unhelpful that this is being rushed because of that vacuum.</p><p>The first thing to state is that the sealing of records or archives for 75 years is unprecedented, unnecessary and extreme.  I will oppose this tooth and nail.  I am shocked by it.  The Minister needs to clarify what records we are talking about and why.  We have heard allusion to sensitivity regarding survivors etc.  Many administrative records are also included, however.  They are not testimony but they will help us understand how the commission operated.  If those records are buried, that will fulfil the worst expectations people have regarding a cover-up.</p><p>The National Archive Act 1986 provides for officers of Government Departments, with the consent of the Department of the Taoiseach, to certify that the release of departmental records which are more than 30 years old in some circumstances:</p><blockquote>(a) would be contrary to the public interest, or<br /><br />(b) would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or<br /><br />(c) would or might cause distress or danger to living persons...</blockquote><p>That clause already exists and it is adequate to protect any information or any person in need of protecting.  The excuse, therefore, of why we need this gagging order inserted does not hold water.  The sensitivity and interests of the people who might be damaged regarding information they gave in confidence is already protected under the legislation to which I referred.  Why, therefore, are we doing this?  What is being gagged?  We do not know the wishes of the people who gave the testimonies.  We know some are deeply distraught at even the mention of this legislation.  Can the Minister state what percentage of the people who gave evidence before the commissions wanted the records sealed for 75 years?  Were the survivors consulted about this proposal?  Were alternatives considered and given?  How many people were asked or given options about how to preserve their records?  Do they have a copy of their own testimonies?</p><p>We know people who gave testimony to the mother and baby homes commission have not been given a copy of their own testimony.  I do not think that is adequate or fair.  The former head of the National Archives, Catriona Crowe, has already been quoted here.  That is appropriate and not an accident.  I am going to quote her again because she is the foremost authority on archives in this State.  Archives are the public's information and part of our history.  Ms Crowe recently stated there was no clear reason why people should be denied access to copies of their own information.  Such access would be entirely in keeping with modern data requests.</p><p>Ms Crowe gave the example of the Military Pensions Act 1924, and related Acts, that required applicants to submit detailed information on military actions in which they were involved from 1916 to 1923.  A copy was given to the applicant in every single one of those cases.  Why are the survivors of abuse not given the same respect?  The survivors themselves have asked that question.  The files created under the Military Pensions Act dealt with serious conflicts, including the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War.  Those conflicts involved many sensitive issues but they were not subject to a gagging clause.  There was no problem with them at all.</p><p>Even after the controversy around the Boston tapes, nobody mentioned imposing a 75-year rule.  In those examples nobody saw fit to have a 75-year rule, yet there is to be a different set of criteria for the victims of industrial abuse.  This is the story of those people's lives.  They have been treated differently and disrespected all of their lives and the same will apply to their records after their deaths.  It is the final insult for so many people.  </p> <p> Catriona Crowe raises very important questions about the legality, or lack of legality, of the proposals because the legislation will, in effect, disable parts of the National Archives Act 1986 and place records beyond the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  This is a step which will weaken citizens' rights to access vital information about themselves and which, in the era of the GDPR, is potentially illegal.  As other Deputies have said, this clause will obviously have an incredibly negative effect on public discourse and will reinforce a culture of silence and shame with regard to issues of child and sexual abuse.  It cuts across educational and cultural awareness of these issues.  In that sense, it is incredibly regressive and unbelievably disproportionate.  I cannot see any logic in it whatever.  </p> <p> It is ironic that this Bill is being dealt with shortly after the UN special rapporteur on child and sexual abuse made statements in which she singled out the damage that can be caused by the culture of silence.  We are perpetuating this culture in this Bill because one of our last dirty little secrets will be locked up for 75 years.</p> <p> Let us consider the reasons we keep archives and why they are so important.  In the first instance, we keep archives to ensure that our knowledge of the past and of human social life in all its varieties - good and bad - remains available for the future.  It is very important that records are preserved and we welcome that part of the Bill.  However, withholding them for 75 years instead of the standard period is not justified given that, as other Deputies noted, records can be anonymised and sensitive material redacted.  Furthermore, the legislation also provides a safety valve, as I mentioned.  </p> <p> The 30-year rule is now considered too stringent.  The United Kingdom has passed legislation to transition to a 20-year rule by 2022.  It is absolutely inevitable, with or without Brexit, that Ireland will follow suit with regard to that clause.  We have to do so in the interests of academia and scholarly access to information.  Ireland will follow and have a 20-year rule because researchers and students need to have archival access at the same time.  Otherwise, there will be an imbalance and a bias in historical research that will not be helpful for humanity across Europe.  It is inevitable that the 30-year period will change.  Despite the move towards a 20-year rule, we are adopting a 75-year rule for this special situation.  We should not engage in limiting our understanding of history or our research options.  We should be trying to manage our archival resources in a thoughtful manner on a par with our European neighbours, rather than resorting to excessive gagging legislation which will hinder future research.</p> <p> To hold back particular records for a much longer period than is the norm sets a very worrying precedent and arouses justifiable suspicion.  Many of the survivor groups already feel there has been an incredibly inappropriate delay in dealing with the conditions their members experienced and addressing the criminal activity that took place in the institutions.  Those conditions and that activity were ignored and covered up and these people had no recourse to the justice system for most of their lives.</p> <p> In the UK, an escape clause is used to block the release of archives after 30 years.  Where do these exceptions normally apply?  In Britain, they are applied to files relating to matters such as the Westland affair, the Gibraltar killings and the Falklands War.  In other words, they are applied to files relating to incredibly controversial events.  Most of us believe that these files are being gagged beyond 30 years because the British State has something to hide in respect of these matters.  That is the reason.  Does the same reason apply in this case?  Is that why we are doing this?  It looks very much like that is the case because there is no other logical explanation for this approach.  Survivors see it as a cover-up.  The only precedent relates to extremely controversial international events in respect of which the State has something to hide.  There in no other precedent.  Unless the Minister can give me a good reason not to do so, I will strenuously oppose the Bill.  This is not just important for the victims but also for history and future generations.</p> <p> The Cambridge historian, Richard J. Evans, who is coincidentally speaking in Trinity College this evening, was a key expert witness against the racist anti-Semite and falsifier of history, David Irving, in an historic trial in April 2000.  Irving falsified the history of the Second World War in many of his books in order to deny the Holocaust.  Evans testified against him as an expert and his expert witness testimony systemically traced the false footnotes and misleading references cited by Irving to their archival sources.  Through that process, he was able to discredit Irving's false history of the Second World War.  It was an incredibly important case and a lesson for all of us.  If those resources and archives had been gagged or buried, it would have allowed charlatans or racists like David Irving to present their warped view of history unchallenged.  Historical scholarship has to have the ability to reach reasoned conclusions on the basis of careful examination of written evidence.  That is all we are asking for.  We cannot engage in obstruction of the historical record, which is what this looks like.  We need to have the capacity to know what happened to all of these people when they are no longer around to tell us themselves.  That is absolutely vital.  To impose any special clause on that is to do them, their families and their testimonies an enormous disservice.  I am very unhappy about this.</p> <p> There is a certain irony in discussing this legislation in the era of fake news and the rise of the far right.  Accuracy and truth are hugely important.  Burying the truth causes major problems.  It is something that we, as a society, cannot afford to do.  As we have done here many times before, I salute the efforts of the victims and those who had the courage to speak up, speak out and come forward to testify against the perpetrators of violence and sexual abuse.  Many of those perpetrators remain unaccountable for the heinous crimes they committed.  To call for an exceptional seal on those records for 75 years creates the impression that something is being hidden.  It is a case of shame and stigma all over again and it is not helpful for healing.  Critically, it has no basis in Irish archival law.  </p> <p> I indicated earlier that in her report to the Human Rights Council last month, the UN special rapporteur heavily criticised Ireland for what she described as a culture of silence around issues of childhood sexual abuse and exploitation.  She had not even seen this legislation.  Wait until she does because she will add to her report.  She also highlighted the reason she singled this issue out as a cause for concern.  She said that historical precedents impact on the situation today.  That is absolutely the case.  If we do not learn lessons from the past, we cannot move forward into the future.  We know the State's response to the legacy of sexual abuse, incarceration, forced adoption and mother and baby homes has been a disappointment to the survivors.  Instead of support, redress, and access to justice, the State has engaged in denial, delay, gagging survivors and limiting the scope of investigations.  It has left people behind in respect of Bethany Home and the Magdalen laundries and has given indemnity to many perpetrators, including St. Patrick's Guild and the like.  It has let religious orders off the hook for the financial bill and traumatised many of the victims all over again through the establishment and mismanagement of Caranua.  This is part of that process.</p> <p> It did not have to be this way.  That is what really sickens me.  Other countries in which similar abuses took place, including Canada, the UK and Australia, did not deal with the issue in the way in which we are dealing with it - or not dealing with it as the case may be.  They moved faster and were more compassionate.  They issued apologies and dealt with redress.  They accepted the state's role in the abuses, held their hands up and allowed people to move on.  In this country, the permanent government has decided to dig in, protect the State at all costs and, I suspect, protect some of the religious orders as well.  This Bill is another part of that process.</p><p>The sealing of records has already taken place in terms of, for example, adoption records.  It helps no one and causes a lifetime of grief.  We cannot have that.<br/><br/>The Government is being disingenuous about the sensitivity of the files.  I do not mean the Minister personally, but that is the only conclusion I can draw from the legislation before us and the fact that the State has never acted in the interests of survivors of abuse or their families.  We have seen that time and again in the form of the Magdalen redress scheme, Caranua, Bethany Home, illegal adoptions and so on.  The State's approach in the first instance is to protect itself, not the survivors.  That is the hallmark of every option it takes.  It should be the victims who make the call to draw a line under something, not the State.<br/><br/>Catriona Crowe has done a great deal to highlight some of the institutional abuses that took place.  Her curiosity was raised when she found files that originated in another jurisdiction.  That led to her taking a closer look and discovering 1,500 documents relating to the illegal adoption of children to the United States.  Apart from the heartbreak of the families involved, the startling aspect of her uncovering of those historical records was the fact that the State, through officials in the then Department of External Affairs, had facilitated the illegal export of children.  It is no wonder that people are suspicious of the Government's intentions in sealing records, but the truth will out no matter how great the attempt to bury it, which is what this Bill is doing.<br/><br/>I will quote Catriona Crowe's remarks on this legislation in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>last week:</p><blockquote>The existing provisions of the National Archives Act are more than adequate to cover access to these records ...<br /><br />These records are vital for an understanding of the policies and operations of the commission, and there is no reason at all why they should be closed for 75 years.<br /><br />We should all remember that survivors should be the primary consideration with regard to these records.<br /><br />They were brave enough to give testimonies about their shocking treatment to the commission, and the emphasis now should be on establishing what they want, and as far as practicably possible, meeting their wishes.</blockquote><p>I have not met a survivor of these institutions who wants this legislation.  Survivors want the truth to come out, justice, a full acknowledgement, an apology and redress.  They do not want a continuation of the culture of silence that led to them being incarcerated in these institutions for so long and to so many people not being called to account for what happened.  I hope that we will see sense and, while preserving these documents, ensure that they are subject to the normal protections that exist as opposed to this special gagging clause.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-04-02a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200039#MM00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I appreciate their tone as well.  We are all very aware of the sensitivity around this matter.  I am also conscious of the legal responsibilities.  I have listened to individual contributions tonight, as I want to get this right for the people who have suffered and endured lives that, in many cases, are difficult to imagine.  Collectively, the House has that responsibility and duty.</p>  <p>  I will reiterate the competing imperatives in this legislation.  There is a legal onus, a legal interpretation and issues of confidentiality.  Many of the witnesses' contributions were given in confidence.  This is one of the competing imperatives for me.  The records contain findings of fault against individuals.  Due to the assurances of confidentiality, those allegations were not tested in the way they would have been in a court of law.  This is why there are serious concerns about the right to privacy, the right to a good name and legitimate expectations of confidentiality.  As a result, the legal advice is that early release of the records could be open to legal challenge from survivors and alleged perpetrators of abuse.  That is one argument.  Other arguments have been put relating to, for example, the period of time being too long, but there are competing parts.  For example, people have given information and testimony.  There are parents who have not informed their children about what happened but who, due to the structure of confidentiality, were comfortable and prepared to give this information.  I am very conscious of that aspect.  The lengthy period is to minimise the possibility of traumatising individuals who might be traumatised by the release of their records, for example, parents who never told their children about their experiences and people who had to go into detail about the abuse they suffered.</p>  <p>  I re-emphasise the importance of the Ryan report and memorialisation, matters that were raised by a number of Deputies.  The report is a very revealing history of institutional abuse and contains many stories of abuse - not just sexual abuse, but abuse in its many forms.  We must ensure that there is a continued awareness of the report, its contents and its findings.  I am anxious to consider further how best to achieve the memorialisation of the entire institutional experience.</p>  <p>  Regarding anonymisation, these records are fundamentally personal ones and, as such, the removal of all personal information would rob them of their true meaning.  The possibility of error is real and the accidental release of information could cause real trauma again.</p>  <p>  Issues with the consultation were raised.  Copies of the Bill were sent to groups.  At all times, officials and I were available to engage.  Officials are happy to meet survivors of abuse at any time, even between now and Committee Stage.  I take on board Deputy O'Reilly's comments about achieving consensus.  We have to try to work hard on achieving consensus.  These people have had to endure such suffering down the years and I do not want to add to that trauma through the words that we use in this House.  I am conscious of my own words.</p>  <p>  The Bill has been flagged for a number of years.  There was pre-legislative scrutiny of it in 2015.  Survivors provided their comments to the committee.  It was a mixed response.</p>  <p>  In many respects, Ireland is further advanced in terms of investigating child abuse and related redress schemes.  Therefore, there is limited international experience on which to draw.  Deputy Clare Daly stated that the period was "unprecedented".  She referred to Australia.  Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse recently completed its work.  It appears that its records will in due course be transferred into the custody of the National Archives of Australia and will not be open for access for 99 years.  Regarding the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, a restriction order was made prohibiting access to the inquiry's records for a period of 100 years, with some limited exceptions.  I sat down with my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  She had difficulty with the period of 75 years as a continuum.  As such, she suggested a review after 25 years.  I will be happy on Committee Stage to build that review period into the legislation.  Whoever is in government in 25 years' time will have a decision to make.</p><p>The Government of the day may decide to look at this in a different way.  That review at 25 years is being built in as a response to the 75 years in the legislation and it does exactly what it says on the tin.  It not only feels like a long time, it is a long time and does give the appearance - the optics - that there is something to hide here.  There is nothing to hide.  We, as a country, over the past 15 or 20 years have started to open our dark past and we must continue to talk about and articulate that.  We must ensure the next generation knows about our dark past.</p> <p> It is regrettable that child abuse may occur in a variety of situations and, notwithstanding the demise of the industrial schools and reformatories, it is vital that we have a strong and robust child protection system in place.  Deputy Burton made the point that we cannot sit back on our laurels and think it is okay today, it was bad in the past and it will be okay tomorrow.  That is not the case.  There are 3,700 children in emergency accommodation.  We still grapple with these issues today in a way that leaders grappled with issues in the past through their different constraints.</p> <p> The child protection guidelines which were first introduced in 1991-92 have been progressively strengthened, specifically in relation to child protection arrangements in schools.  The Department of Education and Skills issued guidelines to schools in three phases - 1991-92, 2001-04 and again in 2011.  The Department's procedures for responding to child protection concerns that are brought to the attention of staff employed by the Department were updated in February 2016, having been first issued in 1995 and revised in 2007.  Garda vetting is now on a statutory basis with the commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and the application for the new vetting procedures in the educational sector has been expressly provided for in the Teaching Council Acts.  The Children First Act 2015 was signed into law on 19 November 2015.  All remaining provisions of the Children First Act commenced on 11 December 2017.</p> <p> As part of my Department's ongoing work to improve child protection measures across the education sector, the inspectorate introduced child protection and safeguarding inspections in February 2019 as a new form of specialised child protection inspection.  The child protection and safeguarding inspections enable the inspectorate to promote best practice in the implementation of child protection arrangements in schools, monitor the implementation of the child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017 in a sample of primary and post-primary schools annually and publish written reports on the implementation of child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017 in the sample of schools inspected.</p> <p> The story of our residential institutions and the abuse which took place within them is a vitally important part of the history of our nation.  This story has been captured in the Ryan report which will stand as a testament to that abuse and the suffering that children endured.  I re-emphasise that Mr. Justice Sean Ryan did not call for the records to be released.  It is critical that as much of that history as possible is preserved intact.  In line with the spirit of the previous motion of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, this requires that the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board and its confidential committee be retained and not destroyed, as originally envisaged.  At the same time, it is incumbent on us to have due regard to the highly sensitive and personal nature of these records and the consequent risks and impacts which would be incurred and felt if they were released in the short term.  As I have said, the Retention of Records Bill strikes a carefully considered balance between these competing imperatives and I commend it to the House.</p> <p> The House must get this right.  It does a further injustice if it does not.  If there is something that I or the officials are missing, we are open to it.  Deputy Thomas Byrne set the tone tonight by saying that if there are things we can do here to do justice to the people who were served a grave injustice, we must be big, brave and open enough to do that.  I am willing to do work that needs to be done between now and Committee Stage if there is something we can do.  However, the competing parts here are very difficult.  The built-in 25-year review takes away from the length of the 75 years and the optics that something might be hidden here.  Nothing is being hidden.  We need to fully embrace our past.  People on all sides of this House, for example, are talking about reviewing history: this is part of our history and it is why it is so important to have this information and topic on the desks of our students for the next generation because I will not allow this to be swept under the carpet.</p></speech>
