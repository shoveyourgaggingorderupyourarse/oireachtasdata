    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900003#A00200"><p>Yesterday was a very bad day for tens of thousands of families and businesses that need breathing space in respect of their mortgages.  The announcement that mortgage breaks will come to an end after this week has caused a great deal of anxiety and stress.  These mortgage breaks gave homeowners and businesses some relief as the economic effects of the emergency and public health restrictions bit hard.  Nobody expected the mortgage breaks to go on forever but they should certainly have been maintained for as long as the pandemic continued.  In other countries, mortgage holders have been given breaks of nine months or even a year but that is not the case here.  Here, mortgage holders got a break of three months followed by an extension lasting a further three months.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, we learnt that the banks will return to business as usual but it is not a case of business as usual for many families and businesses.  There are families and businesses that will simply not be able to return to repaying their mortgages normally.  Leaving mortgage holders to go it alone and relying on the sympathy of the banks to deal with individual cases is, frankly, unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Yesterday's meeting between senior Government Ministers and the banks was a facade.  There was no real intent on the part of the Government to reach a solution that would help mortgage holders.  All of this is happening at a time when the cosy connections between the Government and the financial sector are once again on show.  We have learnt that the former Minister of State, Senator Michael D'Arcy, is leaving the Seanad to be appointed as CEO of a financial lobbying group.  In summary, all of this means that there will be no relief for struggling mortgage holders but a big job for a former Minister of State.  What does this say to the families and businesses that were relying on the Government to stand up for them and to go to bat for them?  This is the second former Minister of State at the Department of Finance to go through the revolving door from the Government into the world of high finance.  In fact, during yesterday's meeting, Ministers from the Taoiseach's Government sat on one side of the table while a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance sat on the other side representing the banks.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, has warmly welcomed Senator D'Arcy's new job.  He said that he understands why, after 20 years in public life, the Senator might wish to start a new chapter in his life.  He said that he will always be welcome should he decide to run for election again.  He went on to say that his new employers are fortunate to recruit someone of his calibre.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, another of the Taoiseach's colleagues in government, said something different.  He said that he has concerns about all of this and that he has shared those concerns with the Taoiseach.  We know that the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO, has certainly had concerns about this revolving door.  Over the last five years, it has approached the Government to seek changes to legislation that would give it the power to investigate and prosecute Ministers who do not adhere to the rules on cooling-off periods before moving to jobs with lobbying groups.  SIPO's approaches in this regard have been consistently ignored by the Government.  One has to wonder why.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has one point of view of the appointment.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has a different point of view.  He says he has concerns and that he has shared these concerns with the Taoiseach.  Will the Taoiseach set out for us his position on this matter?  Does the Taoiseach share the concerns of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan?  If he does, what are those concerns?  What action, as Head of Government, does the Taoiseach propose to take on this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900004#B00200"><p>There are two substantive issues contained within the question that the Deputy put.  In the first instance, I want to say that I fully understand the anxiety and stress that many individual mortgage holders, many people with personal loans and many small and medium-sized enterprises feel in terms of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on their capacity to repay loans and on the general economic situation.  It has to be said that the payment breaks were invaluable to thousands of people in respect of those breaks over six months.  Irish SMEs in particular had the highest share of loan repayment breaks up to September.  What is interesting is that quite a majority of people were in a position to return to normal repayments after the initial three-month payment break.  Elements of Ireland's payment break system compare favourably to other countries in some aspects, in particular the length of the payment break, the wide-ranging nature of the payment break and its uniformity across the system.  That is not the same in other European countries.</p>  <p>  The meeting yesterday was not a facade.  It was a genuine engagement, as there has been continuing genuine engagements between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and the T&aacute;naiste with the banks in terms of ensuring that people are treated fairly and seriously in a sensitive and sensible way.  Again, it is important to point out that the 30 September deadline refers to new applications for payment breaks after that date.  It is a regulatory application deadline set down by the European Banking Authority.  That is the key point in respect of that.  It is not the cliff edge, as has been presented in terms of various presentations.  There are various protections for consumers and people in mortgage arrears or in difficulties with their loans.  Those protections will continue.  Government will continue to engage with the banking system to ensure a sensitive and sympathetic approach is adopted.  People will obviously have to continue to engage.  The next phase is individually tailored approaches to individual loans with a view to providing alternative solutions and proposals for those borrowers in different situations, such as interest-only payments or different approaches that can be adopted by the banks.</p>  <p>  In respect of the former Senator and Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, I believe there should be an effective cooling off period.  I am not happy, or in any way comfortable, with people who have been in office taking up positions, particularly in the area they had jurisdiction over or responsibility for, immediately after or within months of having left office.  I believe the legislation should be reviewed.  Government agreed this morning that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will initiate a review of the standards in public office legislation in that respect.</p>  <p>  More widely, I have long been concerned at the fact that parties and movements can raise foreign donations to an extraordinary amount.  I think that should be examined by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Deputy McDonald's party has raised $15 million over the years in the United States.  I worry about that.  That money has been raised from big vested interests, from construction and financial elites, in the United States with which Deputy McDonald seems to have no difficulty.  Referendums have been influenced by large amounts of money the origins of which we do not know.  That is a more fundamental area to our democracy.  Some people have funded projects, including commemorative projects celebrating 1916 and so on.  My understanding is that one particular project - I am open to correction and Deputy McDonald might correct me - was funded by loans from abroad but there was a political agenda attached to that as well.</p> <p>I would favour a review and reform of the SIPO legislation.  Any cooling-off period should have the force of law and sanctions and penalties attached to it.  That review is on the way by the Government now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900005#C00200"><p>Tea and sympathy for mortgage holders is of no use to them.  Of course, some will be in a position to return to full payment of their mortgage sum but many others will not.  The question is why the mortgage breaks were stopped for families and businesses that still require them at a time when we are still in the grip of a public emergency, when additional restrictions have been placed on Dublin and Donegal, and when there is the very real prospect that will happen elsewhere throughout the country.  That is the issue.  The Government left this matter until the eleventh hour and demonstrated no serious intent to secure a continuation of those very necessary and invaluable, as the Taoiseach called them, arrangements for mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Farrell, have prepared legislation that will be published today in respect of reform of SIPO powers, particularly in terms of section 22, and allowing SIPO to investigate and make concrete sanctions against former Ministers or Ministers of State such as Senator D'Arcy, who has moved through that revolving door from politics to lobbying.  The Taoiseach should remember that last week, Senator D'Arcy was on his feet in the Seanad, addressing issues very close to the financial services industry and of great interest to investment managers.  This week, we learned that he is moving, changing and going to be a CEO for one of these organisations.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Taoiseach has agreed the law needs to be changed.  We do not need a lengthy review; we need this change to happen quickly.  We are happy to provide the legislation and I hope the Government will support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900005#C00300"><p>It does need a wide review, not just of this specific issue, which needs to be dealt with, but also of the influence of foreign money on Irish politics.  That is something that needs more rigorous inquiry in this country than has been the case to date.  I have been through a number of referendums.  That has been a concern for me and it continues to be a concern.</p>  <p>  It is also a concern that projects, organised by political parties but separate from them, seem to be funded by American money, with a political agenda but, on the face of it, circumventing SIPO guidelines.  That is something the Deputy needs to address.  She might correct me if I am wrong but that seems to have been the case for the alternative commemoration to the national commemoration of 1916, and the agenda that Sinn F&eacute;in represents of the continuing link from 1916 to the war in the North, the conflict and the murder and mayhem that ensued and that the party continues to endorse.</p>  <p>  These are very serious political issues, and while the Deputy may not think so, I do.  It is not one rule for one group of politicians and a separate rule for others.  I accept there has to be a cooling-off period.  I do not approve of a former Minister of State going into a post that he had responsibility for as an officeholder.  Nevertheless, the other issues I referred to also need to be faced up to once and for all and not fudged continually.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900005#C00400"><p>With figures increasing over the past week in respect of Covid-19, we all know now that we are at a crossroads.  I want to make a couple of points to the Taoiseach and get his response.  Dr. Ronan Glynn said we are going to be living with this for the next six to nine months and that it is going to be a very difficult period.  I am glad that he referred to that length of time because people needed to hear it.  I have said before in this House that when Covid came, it was the best time for us, as we had spring and then summer.  We are now facing into a very difficult six months.</p>  <p>  Over the weekend, I met Mair&eacute;ad, who is over the age of 70.  The one question she had for me was whether she would be able to see her only child, her daughter, who is working in London, at Christmas.</p> <p>I was taken by that because the whole lot of us in the political system, including the Opposition and the Government, need to sign a contract from now until Christmas with the public to say that we will work together and follow a roadmap, which the Government will lead, and then Mair&eacute;ad might see her daughter at Christmas.  Then we will need to do another three-month contract from New Year's Day until St. Patrick's Day so that we can break the back on the difficult six months that are ahead of us.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit to something like that.  None of us have all of the answers but we need to break this down for the public because they are fatigued and worn out.  We need to do it in bite sizes from here until Christmas and then from New Year's Day until St. Patrick's Day.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider what I have just said and the Labour Party is happy to sign up to working with the Government on that.</p> <p> I was taken by what was produced in the winter plan last week.  Beds are an important issue but there is no point in having the beds if we do not have the staff.  We need to be ingenious in how we will get all of these nurses, doctors and consultants in such a short space of time.</p> <p> The other issue I want to raise with the Taoiseach is non-Covid healthcare.  I have deep concerns about this, especially after talking to people working at different levels in the HSE over the last two weeks.  I know the Taoiseach will not have the answer to this today - I am not trying to catch him out.  I ask him to do a comparative analysis of coronary care and cancer care to see how many people are being treated and diagnosed month-on-month compared to last year.  I would like to know the answer to that because I do not know what it is.  Anecdotally, we have all heard of issues with the volume of people who may not be diagnosed this year and that is worrying because we all know that the longer it goes on the less chance one has of survival, particularly with those seriously acute conditions.  Could the Taoiseach provide that information to us?  I will ask the Taoiseach this question again next week in order that he can provide the answer.  I will give him a week to come up with the answer.</p> <p> Given what Dr. Glynn has said, will the Taoiseach consider a roadmap that is based around two pivotal dates - Christmas and St. Patrick's Day - so that the political class can collectively look at supporting that to get people through the next six months?  Will the Taoiseach carry out an analysis of non-Covid critical health issues so that we can see whether we are dealing with them appropriately, as we tried our best to do last year, for example?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his query and I would commit to that.  I have publicly said on a number of occasions that the implications of Covid will be with us right through 2021.  We need to take it in bite sizes and the immediate necessity is for all of us to take stock on our individual behaviours in reducing social contacts and the level of congregation in which we engage.  This is essential to get the numbers down and in some counties and cities to avoid having to be put on level 3, but it is within our grasp.  Limerick and other areas have proven that by getting the numbers down.  Cities are volatile at the best of times when it comes to Covid because one event or incident can lead to a significant outbreak, as we saw in Cork with restaurants and pubs in one or two areas leading to approximately about 70 cases of Covid-19.  The impact of that on our health services is significant.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern about non-Covid services such as coronary care and cancer care but it is essential that we tell people we want to continue non-Covid health services, to get waiting lists down and to improve diagnostics and speed at getting diagnostics.  However, a lot of that depends on our behaviour with Covid because the greater the number of Covid patients we have to admit to our hospitals and ICUs, the less capacity we will have to deal with coronary care, cancer care and other key ailments and diseases, etc., that affect the major organs of the body.  There is a contract and an objective there.  The better we behave collectively and individually, the better we give capacity and space to our front-line workers and hospitals to deal with non-Covid healthcare.  The winter initiative is about providing unprecedented resources of &euro;600 million over the next six months to alleviate capacity constraints.  It is also aimed at dealing with the resumption of health services and enabling diagnostics and operations to take place in parallel with our approach to Covid.</p> <p>That is the objective and it very much depends on keeping the lid on increasing cases and suppressing the virus insofar as we can.  I urge people to do that so people can see their children and grandchildren at Christmas in a meaningful way.  Whether they can will depend on our capacity to suppress the virus and get the numbers down and stabilised over the next number of weeks.  It remains the Government's position.</p> <p> On the winter initiative, we are also looking at increased and enhanced community provision around community diagnostics and around the prevention area in terms of community respiratory clinics.  This is to prevent people having to be admitted to hospitals in the first instance and particularly to accident and emergency departments.  That is our overarching agenda, along with the home care hours.  There will be a very substantial number of home care packages this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900007#E00200"><p>I say the following genuinely and I hope the Taoiseach takes it in that spirit.  We need a new contract with the people for the next six months broken into two blocs, as I said.  It would enable the lady I mentioned to see her daughter.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless I am concerned about what the Taoiseach said about non-Covid health services.  We cannot have a position of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We have to diagnose people with cancer or coronary issues.  Capacity issues arise because of Covid-19 but we cannot have one or the other, especially when it comes to issues like those I mentioned.  It cannot be one or the other; we must deal with both.  Otherwise, the number of people who will die from non-Covid diseases will be more than those who die from Covid-19.  I suspect that could be the case already but we do not know.  Honestly, I do not know and neither does the Taoiseach.  It is why I am asking him to revert with those figures.</p>  <p>  I am saying this genuinely as too many consultants and people working in the HSE have said the same to me that I have decided to say to the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il.  I have thought about this for a long time and we need the analysis to ensure we are managing our resources in the best way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900007#E00300"><p>I agree with the Deputy on our engagement with the public over the next three months and the three months after that.  By the way, we can stabilise the numbers and get them down.  We will do our best at the Government level.  I know the deputy Chief Medical Officer and his team will do likewise, as will the HSE.  This is important.</p>  <p>  We know from experience that too many people up to now and in previous winters were in acute beds for far too long.  When the acute phase of treatment was over, hospitals found it very difficult to find suitable placements, particularly when it came to rehabilitation.  Some 631 additional rehabilitation beds will be provided up to April 2021 as a key mechanism to ensure people can leave hospital promptly when their treatment is over to go to a suitable placement for treatment afterwards.  Approximately 4.76 million additional home care hours will be provided, which is also important, as are the additional acute beds in general hospitals and additional intensive care unit capacity.</p>  <p>  We will also utilise the private sector for diagnostics and operations for public patients over the next number of months.  I take the Deputy's point and the objective is to manage Covid-19 while also dealing with the non-Covid cases.  In the original lockdown period, for a variety of reasons, we could not do that but on this occasion we will go for it and attempt to do it.  Its success will be dependent on strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines and getting the numbers down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900007#E00400"><p>Waiting lists are at a record high.  It is all well and good to have a winter plan but we are still waiting for the detail of that plan and what will happen in each of our hospitals around the country.  It is difficult to see how our hospitals will cope this winter as some are already struggling and it is still only September and we are facing into a second wave of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  At the last Leaders' Questions session I contributed to in July, I spoke about a number of practical measures that could be taken to relieve this pressure.</p> <p> Patients are also waiting longer for tests.  Since April, during a period when only those who are really concerned with their health have gone to the doctor, 38 people have been added every single day to the waiting list for CT scans, MRI scans and other tests.  These people are waiting in constant pain.  Because of their delayed diagnosis, many will have very poor medical outcomes.  We need proactive measures aimed at treating patients as efficiently as possible and we can do this by taking some simple actions.</p> <p> As an example, I refer to the CT scanner at Portiuncula University Hospital in Ballinasloe, which has been out of action for 144 hours this month alone.  Despite this being the tenth time that it has broken down in the past 18 operational months, the HSE has confirmed that it will not be replaced until some time in 2022.  It is 63rd on the list for replacement, even though it has been out of warranty sine 2017.  Where is the logic in that?  These machines are breaking down in hospitals throughout the country.  This impacts on our waiting lists and adds to the overcrowding in emergency departments.  A perverse example of what is wrong with our health service is provided by a CT scanner just down the road in Roscommon University Hospital.  It can cater for many more patients but uses a different software system from the one in Ballinasloe.  This is despite the fact that for the past eight and a half years both hospitals have been meant to be working together closely as part of the same hospital group.  Is it not about time we had a small bit of joined-up thinking and started to get the basic things right?</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister for Health and the HSE about what is going on there.  To be fair to all concerned, Roscommon hospital has been advanced in recent years.  There were political rows about emergency departments and election commitments which perhaps were not grounded in the proper medical approach, but nonetheless effective investments were made in Roscommon hospital's outpatient and diagnostics capacity.  There is no reason the CT scanner there should not be used.  The Deputy has identified the issues around the CT scanner in Portiuncula.  It is faulty to say the least and is not operating to satisfactory levels.  It needs replacement, the sooner the better.  I will pursue that issue.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, had arranged up to 66,000 outpatient appointments at the end of August.  This supported public hospitals in providing access to diagnostics for patients as well as services for their outpatient departments.  The treatment purchase fund will now work on both the diagnostic and the operational side where outpatients are concerned, and it will work to procure additional private sector capacity where it is required to facilitate increased diagnostics along with procedures.  That will continue.</p>  <p>  It has to be said that Covid-19 did impact on the entire health service.  There is no point in pretending that Covid-19 or the lockdown did not happen or that there were not huge restrictions on hospitals which stopped a lot of elective procedures and diagnostics from happening for two or three months.  There has been something of a recovery in that regard, albeit constrained by guidelines provided by public health advice, which is important.  Patient safety in the context of Covid-19 is always at the forefront of these decisions.  Unfortunately this has negatively impacted on throughput, volume of procedures and volume of diagnostics.  Of that there is no doubt.  The work to improve the situation around diagnostics is continuing.</p> <p>I know the Deputy has for several years raised the issue of the situation in County Roscommon and the utilisation of the technology there.   He has been pursuing the issue for the past five to six years and may know operationally what is going on there on the ground and be familiar with the inability of the two groups in question to connect more effectively.  I will certainly pursue the matter and work with the Deputy and others to see whether we can get it resolved.</p></speech>

It is not just about the lack of upgrading of equipment or the purchase of a software package.  The issue of medical politics is also at play.  After I placed pressure on the then Government in 2015, it eventually installed a state-of-the-art telemedicine rapid access for stroke and neurological assessment, TRASNA, telemedicine stroke machine at Portiuncla University Hospital which would allow doctors at other hospitals to make life-saving stroke diagnoses of patients in Ballinalsoe, thus providing it with a 24-7 stroke service.  However, that never happened because clinicians within the Saolta University Health Care Group would not agree to operate the machine or another machine at Mayo University Hospital.  The same type of machines were installed in hospitals in Mullingar, Kerry and Wexford, as well as in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny.  How many stroke patients were treated using those machines in those hospitals?  These are basic things that the taxpayer is funding to a significant scale within the hospital system, but A is not joined up to B and then not connected to C and, as a result, patients' lives are being put at risk and hard-earned public funds are being wasted.</p></speech>

There should be a commonsense approach in these situations.  As I stated, I am not aware of the detail of the situation on the ground.  The Deputy is saying to me that clinicians within the Saolta group are not willing to use these facilities whereas clinicians in other HSE hospital groups are prepared to use them.  That seems to be the Deputy's assertion.</p></speech>

As soon as I have it, I will revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900009#G00600"><p>I wish to start off by registering my concern at the closure of beds in Killarney Community Hospital.  Its capacity has gone from 38 beds to 23 beds, a loss of 15 beds.  Bed numbers at St. Columbanus public nursing home have dropped from 92 to 65, a loss of 27 beds, including bed losses on the Fuschia ward which caters for patients with dementia.  These are savage cuts.  A total of 42 beds have been taken out of these hospitals in Killarney and I wish to register my concern about that.  What is the Government's plan in respect of people who get sick in the Killarney area?  Is it telling them not to get sick?  Is it telling people who are getting old and must go into a public nursing home not to get old?  The Government stated it would increase bed capacity around the country but it is closing beds in Killarney.  What is it going to do about this issue?  How is it going to cater for people who get sick?</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight on behalf of parents and families of adult children with intellectual disabilities that they have been badly let down since the start of the virus pandemic.  Very few daycare centre services are open.  Some of them open for two or three hours on one day per week, but that is not good enough.  A woman named Mary who lives in County Kerry has a 20-year-old son named Conor.  He is a big strong boy who needs routine and was doing very well in the service he was attending but it has closed.  She works in the public sector.  Her husband, who works for himself, has hardly worked since March because he has been minding his intellectually impaired son.  They have three other children but cannot bring them anywhere.  The children must make do and get to matches and other events by themselves.</p> <p>They need financial assistance to hire trained people to help them out.  Otherwise, many of these parents will be unable to continue under this pressure.  Their mental health is suffering.</p> <p> It is the same with families who have a partner or husband, mother or father, with dementia.  I refer to all the services of the day-care centres that the buses used to bring them to, such as Rockmount in Kilgarvan, four or five days a week.  Such centres are all closed.  There were wonderful highly trained people running all these places - Rathmore, Scartaglin, Castleisland and Knocknagashel.  The closure of these centres placed savage pressure on husbands and wives and sons and daughters.  The Government needs to provide financial assistance for the families.</p> <p> We need to talk about home help.  Old people who wanted to stay in their homes as long as possible are not getting the home help they should get.  This is putting more pressure on our hospitals and nursing homes by not providing more home help for them to stay in their homes longer.  That could happen if the services were provided for them.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to do something about these issues that I am raising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900010#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising two issues in his leaders' question.  The first relates to the closure of beds.  I do not know the specific local circumstances of Killarney or, indeed, Columbanus house which the Deputy mentioned.  I met with the HSE for the south region on Friday last.  They said they were actively looking for additional beds, in terms of community nursing beds and rehabilitation beds, with a view to making sure that there were proper placements and appropriate beds, for example, for patients who had left acute hospitals and who needed convalescence or nursing home beds.  It would appear to me that this may be a HIQA reconfiguration where HIQA would say one has to move from the wards to better single-room en suite accommodation.  That has been going on for quite some time and has had an impact on certain centres.  I do not know whether that applies here or not.  What I know is that quite a substantial amount of funding has been provided to enable the HSE in all regions of the country to procure and provide for additional rehabilitation beds and additional beds in nursing homes with a view to making sure that there is a proper flow through our acute hospital system on an ongoing basis from here right through to the middle of next year and beyond.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the specific cases, I will pursue them and get replies for him.  It is more, not less, beds we need to deal with the impact of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Second, Covid-19 has had an unfortunate negative impact on the provision of services for adults with disabilities, particularly in terms of day-care services.  Nonetheless, there has been a programme since August of restoring aspects of those disability services for as many people as possible.  For example, 19,000 people with a disability attend the adult day services.  I refer to the disability day-service locations which closed in March.  Day services reopened at approximately 40% capacity throughout August and early September.  The increased funding has been provided already so that the level of service available to people attending adult day services can be increased as well.  Additional funding has been provided in the winter initiative to provide for an additional services and additional volume of services, likewise for school-leavers and also intensive support packages to deliver to quite a number of individuals who are in a chronic situation.  There is quite a number of people in emergency situations which I am particularly concerned about, as are the services on the ground.  We intend to work with the service providers to see can we deal with those emergency situations more effectively than has been the case to date.</p></speech>

We read that the Government was going to provide more beds but the opposite is happening in Killarney which only has the one community hospital.  Where are people who get sick or need a short period of rehabilitation after an operation in Cork or Tralee general hospital supposed to go?  There has been a savage cut in Killarney.  We are told that HIQA has demanded this.  Where was HIQA for the last 20 years, when the same number of people were going?  There have already been ward closures in the district hospital in Killarney.  To close more now is absolutely scandalous and ridiculous when people are presenting with different things-----</p></speech>

I suspected that it might be a reconfiguration of the hospital because HIQA's guidelines said that what was there was not optimal.  I will get a report on it.  I met with the HSE South team last week.  The need for additional beds outside acute hospitals to provide placements for people is an area of considerable concern to it.  I know it is engaging with many providers to get additional capacity.  The money is there to get additional capacity and it needs to procure it.</p>  <p>  On disability, of the additional &euro;10 million, some &euro;7.5 million will go to disability day services.  There will be an extra day a week for over 14,000 adults.  The other &euro;2.5 million will go to 210 intensive support packages to enable young adults with complex or high support needs to remain at home and in their communities.  The packages are person-centred and tailored to the needs of the individual and their families.  It is a resource-intense area, but it is needed.  It will help people in their homes.  We must continue to build on that.</p></speech>

I ask that time be made available this week to discuss this issue and try to arrive at a solution that allows those vital services to continue.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will be aware that there was consternation last week at the failure of several organisations and the Minister to attend the committee on Covid.  I am sure he will agree that it is seriously problematic that NPHET will not appear before the committee again this week.  The Minister will be before the D&aacute;il on Thursday for two long sessions of statements, and rightly so.  That is welcome but NPHET must also be accountable and must engage with public representatives on very serious developments.  We need clarification on these matters.</p></speech>

It is a completely unacceptable situation.</p> <p>Before the weekend, I discovered from the Covid committee's secretariat that NPHET would not be attending again despite the consternation and debate in the D&aacute;il last week.  NPHET was due to attend today but will not be doing so.  I wrote to the Covid committee over the weekend to express my dismay about this situation.  It beggars belief that the acting Chief Medical Officer and NPHET will not appear before the Covid-19 committee in a time of rising infections and anxiety about the current situation and the Covid strategy.  It seems to suggest an unwillingness to have open and transparent discussions about the strategy.</p> <p> Furthermore, I will object once again to the order of the debates.  It is another example of why this manipulation of the order by the Government is a problem.  The Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will commence this evening, but several of the party and Independent groups will not get to speak in the first round of speeches.  That is unacceptable.  This is an important Bill about the future of forestry, but once again whole sections of the D&aacute;il will be excluded from the opening round of the debate.</p></speech>

Three weeks ago yesterday, we had a briefing for group and party leaders.  Last week, the Taoiseach promised that there would be another shortly.  When will we have that briefing?</p>  <p>  We are the Rural Independent Group, but because of the Government's manipulation, we will not get to speak tonight on the first round of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  That Bill is badly needed because untold damage is being done in rural Ireland and, indeed, urban Ireland in terms of the lack of timber for roofing in houses.  The Government continues with this charade every week.  Last week, I was sitting in the Chair when several Government backbenchers did not turn up.  The debate could not be followed.  It is not fair to the other groups if they do not know when they will be on because the people listed before them do not turn up.  Bills will collapse.  We will not let them if we can help it, but it will happen.  Even to the best of our ability, we cannot monitor these debates.  This situation is wrong.</p></speech>

First, our group will not have the opportunity to speak on the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill tonight even though we have tabled 12 considered amendments to it.  An opportunity needs to be facilitated.</p><p>Second, we have been promised briefings.  Statutory instrument after statutory instrument is being introduced in secondary legislation relating to Covid-19.  These instruments have far-reaching implications for every citizen in the country.  Some of them are contradictory and are causing abject confusion, but we have yet to receive a briefing on any of them.</p><p>Third, can I get clarity from the Taoiseach-----</p></speech>

It is the most powerful organisation in this State currently and the decisions it is making are having a significant impact on hundreds of thousands of people around the country, yet Deputies have not had an opportunity to tease those questions out and hold NPHET to account.  I know of Deputies who have asked journalists to ask NPHET questions, which is an incredible situation.

The Bill has been described as "shocking" by the Environmental Pillar.  The latter group, the Woodland League and others have expressed deep concern about the net deforestation that may now be happening because of the dysfunctional industrial, profit-driven forestry model in this country, which is doing nothing to protect or enhance biodiversity and doing nothing to reach our climate goals.

That is completely unacceptable and there is no justification for ramming the Bill through in this way.  I sought a briefing on the Bill from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service but none was available because of its late publication.  Yet the Government is proposing to ram through all Stages.  We have facilitated the Government in necessary emergency measures but what is happening now is a sustained, ongoing abuse of the democratic process that is going to lead to bad legislation in this case and possibly severe consequences for the Irish forestry sector.</p></speech>

It is totally ridiculous to have such important legislation debated in this way.</p>  <p>  I fundamentally oppose what Deputy Boyd Barrett is talking about.  Our concern is for real jobs and the real people who have trees planted.</p> <p>Tree huggers and tree lovers are holding up the Bill and clogging it up with frivolous amendments.  We want to stop people who live in the city objecting to plantations that are 100 miles and 200 miles away.  This is scandalous.  Families are being deprived of their living, they cannot harvest their timber, contractors are being deprived of their living, the mills are without timber and builders consequently cannot get materials to build houses.  It is farcical coming from Deputy Boyd Barrett, who is always talking about housing, that he is so short-sighted he cannot see this.  I ask him to go and plant some trees in his leafy backyard if he wants to.  He can see how trees grow and how we in the countryside mind them.  It is ridiculous.</p></speech>

I am not sure that anyone in this House has ever said we should end commercial forestry.

The Executive has taken its decision and has presented the Bill.  We also want to encourage native species, which have also been objected to.  In the rush to object to everything in July, everything was objected to-----</p></speech>

I will not waste the House's time with another vote as people will want to get on with other business but we had a discussion about the length of time that would be made available for the debates on Covid and on the winter plan.  A number of members of the Business Committee made it clear that we wanted a slot of two hours and ten minutes for each debate and that we wanted each debate to be taken separately.  The times have been reduced back to one hour and 45 minutes each which means that, yet again, smaller groups and parties will have ridiculously short speaking slots to respond to very important issues.  That is unacceptable.  It is another consequence of the Government's rigging of the speaking arrangements in the House.  It does a very serious disservice to the public and to democracy.  The slots should be as were requested at the meeting of the committee, that is, two hours and ten minutes for each debate.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Bloody Sunday families for their strength, stamina and determination.  This is another very disappointing day in their campaign for truth and justice.  I share that disappointment given the well-documented actions of the British army on that day.  The former British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said that what happened was "unjustified and unjustifiable".  Despite this, the families have been denied justice for nearly half a century.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will know, the British Government continues to block the establishment of the legacy mechanisms to which it signed up and which were agreed under the Stormont House Agreement.  Will the Irish Government continue to support the Bloody Sunday families in their campaign to uncover the truth of what happened that day?  Will the Taoiseach speak, as a matter of urgency, to the British Prime Minister to ensure that provisions made under the Stormont House Agreement are implemented?</p></speech>

The decision of the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to uphold the decision not to prosecute 15 former British soldiers in connection with the Bloody Sunday killings will come as a deep disappointment to, and will be met with anger by, the families of all of those killed by the parachute regiment in Derry in 1972.  Today's developments will bring back feelings of pain, loss and frustration for many.  I was the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, made his apology, which I felt at the time was very heartfelt.  I believe he got it right with regard to the manner, nature and candour of that apology.</p>  <p>  The families have been tireless in pursuing this issue and in seeking truth and justice.

As we all know, the outcome was that payment breaks will no longer be offered to borrowers who are in trouble due to Covid.  Statistics issued by the Central Bank show that more than 56,000 family homes were in mortgage arrears at the end of June.  There is a code of conduct for mortgage arrears in place to protect borrowers but, as the Taoiseach will know, it is very much weighted in favour of the banks.</p> <p>I am asking the Taoiseach in light of these statistics and the depth of concern that many in this House have for those borrowers who have been on to us.  Will the Taoiseach bring forward some form of amendment to strengthen the code and rebalance it so that borrowers are not at the whim of the banks to the degree that they are under the code at the moment?</p></speech>

The position is that the Government met the banks yesterday and more tailor-made responses to individuals from here on is the more appropriate response.  It is not a cliff edge although as and from the end of this month no new people may apply for the waiver or deferment of payments.  It has been invaluable to many people with mortgages and personal loans as well as many small and medium-sized enterprises as well.  The majority were able to exit after a period and return to normal repayment although others have been unable.  It is incumbent on the banks to behave properly and sensibly to such customers.  The Government will monitor that in the coming period.</p></speech>

He outlined how one case of the virus could lead to 56 cases.  It was an excellent graphic and it was incredibly appropriate.  I want the Taoiseach of speak to those who cannot reduce their networks.  In particular, I am speaking of schoolteachers, special needs assistants and people who are in contact with numbers of people daily.  They cannot reduce their networks.  What is the message for them?  In our school community at the moment there is anxiety around the number of contacts.  They seem to be getting left behind.  What is the Taoiseach's message to teachers and SNAs who are expressing a genuine sense of frustration, fear and anxiety about feeling unsafe in their workplace at the minute?</p></speech>

It has been the number one objective of our society collectively that our children would be back in a learning environment, because their life chances and development depend on it.  That said, in terms of the primary school system, mass testing to date and testing where it has occurred indicate transmission from children to other children is low.  The figure was as low as 0.5%, but I can be checked on that.  That was the latest in HSE data.  The acting Chief Medical Officer drew some reassurances from that aspect of it.</p>  <p>  The schools and the Department are in constant contact in respect of public health advice.  This morning, further substantial funding was made available to the Department of Education and Skills to enable the school transport system to fulfil the latest National Public Health Emergency Team advice in respect of school buses at 50%.  We are constantly working on making it safer and providing the resources to enable us to do that.  The schools put in significant measures as well and that is important to note too.</p></speech>

These workers want real talks unhindered by the introduction of non-union scab labour into the stores or the intervention of garda&iacute; against peaceful protests, which we have seen now in no fewer than three stores during the past five days.  The programme for Government raises the possibility of improving workers' rights in liquidation situations, a tacit admission that workers' rights may not currently be what they should be here.  Given all this, is the Taoiseach prepared now clearly, strongly and unequivocally to call for the withdrawal of non-union scab labour from these stores, to call for a stop to the involvement of the garda&iacute; in this peaceful industrial dispute and, last but not least, to call on KPMG to end its refusal to talk and to call for real talks to begin aimed at formulating a meaningful proposal for the workers with a view to ending this dispute?</p></speech>

There are legal frameworks governing this.  There is no point in pretending there are not, because there are.  I have spoken to some workers and, as I have said, I am not going to pretend that things can be done that cannot be done.</p>  <p>  I believe the law needs to be reviewed and changed especially in respect of honouring collective agreements or at least giving collective agreements the same level of parity as other creditors in terms of a liquidation.  That should happen.  Moreover, within the context of this specific dispute, meaningful efforts should be made so that, in addition to the statutory redundancy the Government is giving, workers could get more payments in addition to what they would be getting from a statutory perspective.</p></speech>

His home in Herbert Park, Dublin was the location of much planning and development during that revolutionary period.  Indeed, the <i>Asgard</i>gunrunning was organised there, as were many of the events of the 1916 Rising.  Cumman na mBan was founded there.</p><p>Today, the building lies in rubble in a shocking act of cultural vandalism.  Today at 6.30 a.m., against the motion passed by Dublin City Council with regard to listing the building, the developer demolished it.  This mirrors the experience with Moore Street, which lay for decades in dereliction.</p><p>Every Minister in the Government owes his or her office to the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women of 1916.

As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is aware, in terms of Moore Street there have been exhaustive discussions involving Deputies and Senators from both Houses.  This has resulted in conclusions that could enable the dereliction to end and the locations to be preserved historically in an appropriate way.  They allow for development to occur as well.  It took a long time in terms of Moore Street.  Something similar should have happened here, in my view.  I do not believe buildings of this historic value should be demolished in such a manner.</p></speech>

They paid their fees, including accommodation fees.  Then, the Government announced on Friday evening that these people would have to stay at home for two weeks.  The people are utterly confused and so are the young people.  They do not buy in to the Taoiseach or believe he is serious about this.</p>  <p>  As I said before, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have spectacularly dropped the ball on the messaging.  There are mixed messages.  Every parent was allowed to pay the money last Friday, register and pay the fees.  Then, the colleges told the students that evening after the close of business that they could not attend and would have to participate online.  Why would they not go?  They need some fun in their lives too.  We should stop knocking them.  What about golf-gate?  It has gone off the agenda completely.  If we keep demonising young people like this, then we will suffer for it.  We should praise them and give them a chance to live as well.</p></speech>

It was no coincidence that these workers have been campaigning for toilet and hand-washing facilities at the Spike Island Tours kiosk.  One had to get the union in to represent them to get toilet and hand-washing facilities.  When they went looking to discuss it, the board of Spike Island Development Company told them their personal issues were getting in the way of business.  This has to be dealt with.  These are State companies.  They have unfairly dismissed workers at least one month before their contracts were up.  There should be an intervention on behalf of the State to get these workers reinstated.</p></speech>

Nobody is knocking or criticising young people but, irrespective of age, people should not congregate in large numbers on streets in the middle of Covid-19.  Let us call a spade a spade; we cannot do it.  Whether people are adults or whatever age they are, we cannot congregate in large numbers.  The numbers might be in Galway because of college but they do not have to be students only.  There could be others who are not students who are congregating.  Congregation is problematic for the spread of the disease and the virus.  We need to be unequivocal about that.  Even though colleges are returning, in many cases the numbers of students coming back are much lower than normal.  When I was in touch with one university, for example, it had already, prior to any decisions last Friday, ordained that classes would be 80% online and 20% on campus.</p> <p> On Deputy Collins's question, I do not have the details of the specifics but, again, there should be no issue with proper toilet facilities for workers.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900018#R00600"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to repeal the Build to Rent and Shared Accommodation sections of the following guidelines issued to planning authorities thereafter, namely Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, March 2018. </blockquote>  <p>Every week, we hear of another co-living planning application, particularly in our large cities.  Yesterday, news broke of a 500-bed co-living development in Smithfield, Dublin 7.  At the latest count, there are almost 4,000 proposed co-living beds planned or in the planning process in Dublin and our other urban centres, which is in stark contrast to the number of planning applications for genuinely affordable homes for working people.</p><p>The question is how we got here.  In 2016, in the dying days of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, Deputy Kelly, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, introduced very controversial legislation that gave, for the first time in modern history, a Minister with responsibility for planning the power to unilaterally introduce changes to planning law without a vote of the Oireachtas.  That very controversial power has been used only twice, both times by Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the subsequent Minister at that Department.  In 2018, he published mandatory ministerial guidelines for apartment dwellings, a copy of which I have to hand.</p><p>While the majority of this document was in line with previous guidelines issued by the Department, two substantial changes occurred.  For the first time in planning history, in the modern history of the State, it was permissible to provide homes with personal living space of only 12 sq. m for an individual.  That is the size of a car-parking space.  For couples, the requirement was for personal living space of 18 sq. m.  Of course, there had to be further communal space but we know the problems with that.  The same regulations also introduced build-to-rent design standards that were lower than in the case of apartments currently being built to purchase.  There would be less dual aspect, less storage, more studio apartments, fewer lifts and stairwells and less car-parking space.  For some reason the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, thought that if someone was renting, he or she did not deserve the same design quality and quality of living as someone who owns his or her own home.  To be clear, our cities do not need glorified tenements for people.  The idea that someone would spend &euro;1,300 a month to live in a shoebox, without even basic tenancy rights because he or she would be a licensee, beggars belief.</p><p>These kinds of developments also have a significant impact on land prices and neighbouring developments.  Take Fumbally Lane in Dublin 8, for example, where a plot of land was bought by a developer for &euro;4 million a number of years ago.  There was a three-storey planning application, with a shop and retail on the ground floor and 35-odd family apartments.  In swooped the Collective, one of the world's leading co-living equity-funded investors, which doubled the price of the land overnight to more than &euro;10 million and then submitted a planning application on exactly the same floor space for 200-plus co-living units.  If anybody thought co-living was a good idea before Covid-19, imagine the idea of 40 or 50 people sharing a kitchen, a leisure space or a workspace.  It simply makes no sense.  These planning policies have significantly shifted investment away from affordable residential homes for working people, which are what we need.</p><p>In May last year, the now Taoiseach described such developments as &quot;battery cage-type accommodation&quot;.  He asked whether we were going back to the era of tenements and I could not have agreed with him more.  Two months later, his then Opposition housing spokesperson, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, stated: &quot;If Leo Varadkar and Eoghan Murphy want this bonkers policy so much, they should co-live together.&quot;  He urged Fine Gael to scrap co-living.  Deputy O'Brien is now the Minister.  He could, on his first day in office, have scrapped these appalling forms of accommodation, but instead he announced a review.  We only subsequently learned, in <i>The Irish Times</i>last week, that in fact his review is not focusing on scrapping it but, allegedly, on modifying it to allow multinational corporations to develop it.  A very good freedom of information request by Killian Woods from<i></i>the <i>Business Post</i>showed that the review has not even commenced.</p><p>The Bill seeks to do three things.  It will scrap the controversial power for Ministers to make dramatic changes to planning law without a vote of the Oireachtas, ban co-living and ban substandard design of build-to-rent properties for renters.  These are basic, simple planning regulations.  We need a Government that stands up for renters and working people, not backs the vested interests, real estate investment funds and global equity investors.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The work of the current Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on gender equality has been interrupted and delayed by the impact of Covid-19.  It was originally scheduled to hold meetings in the period from March to July and issue its report in the summer.  It has had to adapt its methods to comply with public health guidelines but will resume its work with online meetings in October and over the coming months, with the aim of reporting by June 2021.  I commend all the members of the assembly on their commitment to their work in the face of the challenges presented by Covid.  Their civic-minded dedication to completing their task will ensure we can make substantial advances on gender equality, based on their findings and recommendations.</p>  <p>  The experience of the current assembly in operating online will inform the approach to the other citizens' assemblies to be undertaken in line with the programme for Government.  The Dublin mayor Citizens' Assembly will be established with a new chairperson and new members following completion of the current assembly.  The programme for Government also provides for the establishment of citizens' assemblies to consider matters relating to drug use, biodiversity and the future of education.  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from the relevant Departments on the approach to be taken to these assemblies.  It is envisaged they will be established after the Dublin mayor Citizens' Assembly has completed its work, but the specific timing of each assembly has yet to be worked out. </p></reply>

There is a feeling that in the middle of a pandemic, all that momentum for radical drug reform that had been building for years, on issues such as drug use, addiction and recovery, has, unfortunately, been lost.  When the opportunity arose within the programme for Government to announce the potential for a citizens' assembly, it was seized on by those in this area as a great opportunity.  We hope the Taoiseach will give more of a commitment as to when and how that citizens' assembly might meet.</p> <p>The Taoiseach knows the issues around decriminalisation are very important, such as trying to take people out of the criminal justice system and treating drug use as a purely medical issue.</p> <p> I suggest that the Taoiseach has an opportunity, given that he has a Seanad space free.  While political parties will do whatever they can to make sure a particular candidate meets the criteria, and while I know it is the agricultural panel, would it not be quite powerful for the Taoiseach to do what he can to ensure that somebody who advocates for drug users and those in recovery could fill that space in the Seanad?  It could be somebody like Tony Geoghegan, Philly McMahon or Peter McVerry.  I know the criteria of the agricultural panel have to be fit, but at the same time, such an appointment would indicate to those who care deeply about this issue that the Government cares deeply about it and that it wants somebody in these Houses who has an intimate understanding of the complexities of it.</p> <p> Also, we need to know when the citizens' assembly will sit, because while I can speak about the health elements of this problem, for far too many families there is clearly a violent gang element to it as well, which is literally killing people on the streets in my constituency and throughout the country.  We need a firmer commitment from the Taoiseach along the lines on which I have spoken.  We need dates and we need to know the Government is on the side of these families and communities.</p></speech>

I have raised with the Taoiseach the value and importance of the community participation provision within the national drugs strategy.  I have brought to his attention that some within the apparatus of the State are less than enthusiastic about that community participation provision.  The Taoiseach has agreed with me on more than one occasion that this participative piece of the strategy is essential in respect of the issue of drugs, drug use and misuse and recovery.  I would also like to know what the plans are for this.  The dangers and harm that drugs can cause are present and real.  Therefore, there is an urgency for individuals and their families as well as for communities, many of which can be readily identified and which have suffered disproportionately from drug use and misuse and from a lack of State support for services and a viable recovery model.  In fact, I represent such communities.</p>  <p>  I know we will talk about the Government's shared island unit later.  It is appropriate and obvious at this stage, however, not least because of the position of Boris Johnson, his Government, its Internal Market Bill and all that has arisen around the Brexit discussion and debate, that there is a need to plan in real time for Irish reunification.  By that, I mean there is a need for a real-world discussion around public services, such as the health service, for example, as well as educational provision and the economic model of a reunified Ireland.  All of these are key and critical issues and they will take time to consider and plan for.  I have said to the Taoiseach before that it is a reckless mistake for anyone to bury his or her head in the sand at this point and to try to imagine that profound political change is not under way, because it is, and that will find constitutional expression.  I am raising that matter with the Taoiseach again and I would like him to consider the establishment of a citizens' assembly or a similar mechanism - I do not mind what it is called - that clears the space for that conversation on constitutional change and a reunified Ireland, that brings the conversation beyond politicians and invites the citizenry in its entirety to be part of this conversation, which we know has started in communities across the island in an organic and real way.</p></speech>

The existing Citizens' Assembly on gender issues has been delayed but it is meeting and engaging.  I am open to working out the logistics of the range of issues that we want to put before citizens' assemblies, but we have to be realistic as well.  The next one after the gender issues one is complete was meant to be the Dublin mayor Citizens' Assembly.  I will ask my officials to discuss this with other parties and work out the logistical requirements in the context of Covid-19 and essentially in an online format.  For the foreseeable future we are looking at how effective such meetings of citizens' assemblies can be and examining if we can run some in parallel, because there are three to four of them that people would be anxious to have.  Given the slower pace of them, as a result of Covid-19, there will be problems around that.</p>  <p>  I want to stress that in no way should that weaken the resolve and the work that is under way in tackling the drugs issue and the issues of recovery and a multidisciplinary response to addiction and recovery that is rooted in community and community participation.  That is still required, irrespective of whether or when we have an assembly.  There should be no let up in advances or progression on a range of issues around that because the world cannot stand still.  We have to keep making decisions and policy, while getting it right with the Citizens' Assembly approach.</p>  <p>  On a citizens' assembly on the Good Friday Agreement or on the question of Irish unity, I have set up a shared island unit within the Department of the Taoiseach, which is designed to scope out a range of issues about what it would be like to share this island and to examine how we can best share this island into the future, irrespective of people's views on the constitutional position.  The Good Friday Agreement allowed for that and the genius of it was that it essentially meant we did not have to talk about constitutional issues every single day, and rather we could get to work on putting flesh on the bones of a lot of what is in the agreement.  We have not succeeded in doing that within the institutions themselves because they have been too stop-start from the beginning of the agreement and have been in abeyance and suspended for a lot of the time.</p>  <p>  There is a North-South dimension which needs strong momentum and impetus, and that is something I am committed to doing with the existing bodies.  I am also committed to looking at investment in North-South infrastructure, which has been on the agenda for a decade.  We want to take the initiative on that and follow through on the commitments made by the Irish Government in respect of New Decade, New Approach agreement.</p>  <p>  There is a lot to be done.  As opposed to grandstanding and indulging in rhetoric all of the time, an awful lot more can be done on putting flesh on the bones of the Good Friday Agreement, making it work and enabling it to work.  In some respects, the North-South bodies have not been given the support and momentum they deserve.  They did great work in the early phase of the Good Friday Agreement.  Waterways Ireland, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland all do effective work, but they need new momentum and an injection of support from all sides.  The Irish Government will not be found wanting in that respect.</p>  <p>  Likewise, in terms of health we need to intensify cross-Border co-operation, particularly in paediatric, cancer and oncology services, to a far greater degree than has been done to date.  The community application of information technology, CAIT, initiative is one of the first and original initiatives on a cross-Border basis on health that has been added to in the utilisation of Altnagelvin hospital's oncology services and tertiary services for paediatrics.  There are two fundamentally differently structured health services, however.  In the North, it is essentially the National Health Service as experienced through the UK's historic model, although it is subject to a lot of pressure right now.</p> <p>Our model evolved differently because we did not have the same social insurance provisions in post-war Ireland as developed in post-war Britain.  In essence, that allowed for an initial voluntary hospital system to emerge from the beginning of the last century, which was religiously driven by various denominations, and then the State hospitals were introduced with the Health Act 1970.  This involved the expansion of health board hospitals and then State hospitals at St. James's and Beaumont.</p> <p> There was a very mixed evolutionary system in the Republic and that needs much reorganisation.  It is a big question in terms of the alignment of that with the structures in the health service in Northern Ireland.  With the shared island unit the idea is that we would commission substantive research to inform our perspectives.  That would be my approach in the first instance.</p></speech>

There was great co-operation across these Houses on the issue of injecting centres and decriminalisation.</p>  <p>  I will return to the Seanad matter for a moment.  The Taoiseach nominated Colette Kelleher to the Seanad in a previous Oireachtas and the Government took on the suggestion of appointing a Traveller representative.  It would be a strong sign if the Government could nominate somebody from the drugs field and who knows it intimately if it feels the drugs citizens' assembly would be delayed.  It would make good a Government mess around Senator D'Arcy if somebody of that stature in the drugs area could be nominated.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has a peculiar way of looking at the clock.  All the evidence in the real world demonstrates the State does not take the matters of drug use, misuse and, above all, recovery seriously.

I have been involved in that work as a former Minister with responsibility for health.  I worked very strongly at that and we made much progress in our time with a multidisciplinary response and the creation of new approaches.  The momentum must continue, and it will.  What I am saying is that must continue irrespective of when we have that citizens' assembly.</p>  <p>  On the Senator vacancy, in the first instance it is a Fine Gael Senator who has now left.  That person was elected as a Fine Gael Senator and in the first instance it is a matter for Fine Gael to consider how it feels it is best to fill the vacancy.  There will be some reflection on that but in the first instance it is a matter for that party.  I will not pre-empt the consideration of another party.  Others may want to nominate people as well to that position.</p></speech>

A shared island unit has been established in my Department in support of this commitment and its work is now under way.  The unit&rsquo;s work is being led by an assistant secretary, with two staff appointed and further assignments in train.  The work programme and related resourcing for the unit are being further developed.</p>  <p>  The unit will examine the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future in which all traditions are mutually respected.  This work will at all times be grounded in the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives for the unit.</p>  <p>  Research and dialogue are also at the core of the unit's work.  It is tasked with working collaboratively across the Government and with research, sectoral, business and community organisations, and with engaging with political and civil society representatives on an inclusive basis.  The unit will seek a broad base of contributions from across society on this island and work to ensure that people who have been proportionally under-represented in the peace process, such as women and new communities on the island, are fully represented.</p>  <p>  There are no plans for a civic forum or citizens' assembly on the constitutional future of the island.  As I have said, I do not believe that a Border poll could be constructively pursued in the current term of the Government.  It would have a very divisive impact.</p>  <p>  The Government respects and affirms everyone&rsquo;s right on the island to make the case for the constitutional future for Northern Ireland they wish to see, whether they are nationalist, unionist or neither.  The Good Friday Agreement and the two sovereign Governments explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both constitutional positions, which are deeply held.  I am and the Government is firmly committed to working towards a consensus on a shared future for the island in which all traditions are mutually respected.  The work of the shared island unit will support this and the Government will listen to and engage with the views of all communities and traditions on the island.</p>  <p>  Our approach will at all times be founded on realising the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement to sustain progress, deepen mutual understanding and further reconciliation.</p></reply>

That is why many supporters of the Taoiseach's party are leaving and joining Sinn F&eacute;in.  I can only speak from my experience in Mayo on that.</p>  <p>  This concerns me as the Taoiseach and his partners in the Government have not acknowledged their constitutional obligation to achieve a united Ireland.  There is no reference to the explicit commitment in the Good Friday Agreement for the referendum on Irish unity.  I have to ask the Taoiseach why that is so.</p>  <p>  Despite this, the shared island unit is tasked with a wide range of responsibilities, although I will not name them now.  The shared island unit must be capable of delivering progress in a wide range of areas that needs to be reflective of how it is staffed and resourced.  Expectation of a shared island unit are that it would establish a citizens' assembly, publish a White Paper on Irish unity and facilitate a Oireachtas joint committee to encourage structured dialogue North, South, east and west, which would also involve our diaspora and allow us to discuss how we share and shape this island.</p>  <p>  The hour has come for the Taoiseach to show me and people like me from all around the country that a shared island unit is a genuine attempt to unify our island.  The folly of partition is demonstrated over and over again, more recently with Brexit and Covid-19, and dismantling it, while always important, is now urgent.  Before he gives me a lecture about Sinn F&eacute;in having disregard for the Protestant, unionist or loyalist population, I tell the Taoiseach that I am a mother from the far west of Ireland.  I was born in London and I lived a very good part of my life in England.  I want the same opportunities for my sons as do mothers in east Belfast.  I want to see a good a respectful relationship between both our islands that embraces the Irish living in Britain and the British living in Ireland.</p></speech>

The first is the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and that document very clearly states the rights of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland.</p> <p>It calls for full Irish Independence.</p> <p> The second important document is the Good Friday Agreement.  Thankfully, that document helped bring the peace that none of us then believed was possible.  The truth at the very heart of that document is the idea that the will of the majority of the people of the North of Ireland should direct its future constitutional location.</p> <p> I have heard the Taoiseach argue against Irish unity on several occasions, and I have heard him argue against the majority element of the Good Friday Agreement as well.  Why does he oppose elements of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and elements of the Good Friday Agreement?  He uses the phrase "shared Ireland" all the time, as if "united Ireland" were somehow dirty words.  It shocks me that a leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, a party which once confidently supported Irish unity, would feel that way.</p> <p> I completely understand why the Taoiseach would be cautious.  It is absolutely logical to be cautious with regard to Irish unity, but the chaos that has been created in our country by the Tory Government, which affects our ability to trade, move people and do business between North and South, must have limits in light of our own self-interest as a nation.  There must be some point on that spectrum where even the Taoiseach would come to the view that Ireland's self-interest makes it logical to set up an all-Ireland forum to which we can bring civic and political views from across the island of Ireland, discuss the best ways to ameliorate the worst excesses of Brexit and start to plan for Irish unity.</p></speech>

The conversation on Irish unity has begun.  It has undoubtedly been sped up by Brexit and the madness of the Internal Market Bill.  We have recently heard mention of Bloody Sunday.   Last week I spoke about the case of Seamus Ludlow, who was killed by loyalists and members of the British Army.  The reality is that British rule in Ireland has never been good and Boris Johnson has just given everybody a reminder of that.</p>  <p>  It is straightforward.  The idea that we must tug our forelocks and cannot mention Irish unity serves no purpose.  It does not make us more liked by a certain section of unionism that may have a difficulty.  This question is happening.  Brexit makes it far more likely.  A huge number of people are now determining that they want to stay within the European Union, and if Irish unity is the way to do it rather than as part of the very dysfunctional so-called United Kingdom, this question may happen faster than anticipated, possibly faster than even we in Sinn F&eacute;in had anticipated or wanted.  The Government needs to prepare.  We need to look at the practicalities and have a full conversation about all the people who live in Ireland, including unionists, nationalists, republicans and beyond.  As I said in this House last week, Ireland has changed a great deal since I was 16 or 17.  The idea of a united Ireland that I had then probably does not relate to what a united Ireland will look like.  We need the Government to step up and put plans in place.  We need to allow a full conversation.  I accept the difficulties of Covid-19.  If an all-island forum needs to start as a partly online forum, so be it.</p></speech>

I would equally ask Deputy Conway-Walsh not to lecture me.  Since first coming into this House I have had a commitment to North-South relationships and to the issue of the future of this island.  That has been my principal interest.  I have worked hard behind the scenes and as a Minister to develop collegiate arrangements with people of all political persuasions in the North.  I do not need lectures from Deputy Conway-Walsh or from anybody on the Sinn F&eacute;in side of the House.  Working with others, Fianna F&aacute;il was essential to the Good Friday Agreement.  Fianna F&aacute;il enabled the Deputy Conway-Walsh's party to give up the gun.  Sinn F&eacute;in endorsed violence as the way to unify Ireland and did more damage to Irish unity than anybody else.  Sinn F&eacute;in continues to endorse that narrative of violence, not understanding that every time it does so it makes more difficult than ever to get a united Ireland or to get consent.</p>  <p>  When Deputy Conway-Walsh's colleague, Gerry Kelly, celebrates a prison escape which resulted in the murder of a prison officer, is that okay?  Does she think that advances the cause of Irish unity?  Of course it does not, nor does saying that Sinn F&eacute;in is more pure than Fianna F&aacute;il because of my position on a shared island unit.  That sums up Sinn F&eacute;in's view.  Its members see it as something to appease the base.  How many more votes can I win if I shout "united Ireland" more often than somebody else?  That is the essence of what I have just heard from the Deputies opposite.</p></speech>

I did not interrupt any other Deputies when they spoke.  I have been heckled since I began to speak and there have been efforts to interfere.  With the greatest respect, I would appreciate the protection of the Chair when I have the floor.</p>  <p>  Regarding the questions around the shared island unit, it is a noble objective to work with all sides to enable people to share this island together in whatever format into the future.  I have clear views on it and I want to work with people in that regard.  It is outrageous that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n would put those words in my mouth about Irish unity.  I never said that and I never would say it.  This is about people and about minds.</p>  <p>  I do endorse aspects of the Seamus Mallon approach, not the majoritarian approach or whatever particular formulas he had, but the ethos of what he said, that there were people in his own neighbourhood who had been there for 400 years and that it was about time we learned to share our homeland, so that people would live in neighbourhoods together rather than always opposing each other.  That is the spirit in which we should go forward on the island.  There is lots to engage on and we need to engage people, not just constantly polarise them through rhetoric and appealing to the base.</p></speech>

It must also deal with Brexit, which will have an impact.  Brexit must be dealt with in terms of the pragmatic impact it will have on people's lives, the economy, business and jobs.

Professor Brian MacCraith, former president of Dublin City University,  was appointed as chair of the commission.  The programme for Government has expanded the remit of the commission on the future of Irish public service broadcasting to become the Future of Media Commission, which will consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion.  The terms of reference have been amended in light of this expanded remit.</p> <p> Today, the Government approved the terms of reference and membership of the Future of Media Commission.  The commission is tasked with proposing how public service broadcasting aims should be delivered in Ireland over the next ten years, how this should contribute to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s cultural and creative sectors, and how this work can be funded in a way that is sustainable, gives greater security of funding, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money to the public.  The commission is also responsible for making recommendations on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s role, financing and structure within this framework and how this is overseen and regulated while having regard to our European Union obligations, including the requirements of the revised audiovisual and media services directive.</p> <p> The members of the Commission have been selected to capture a range of expertise in the various areas of public service communications and are as follows: chair of the commission, Professor Brian MacCraith, former president of Dublin City University; Sinead Burke, writer and academic active in social media and member of the Council of State; Alan Rusbridger, chair of the steering committee of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford and former editor-in-chief of Guardian News and Media; Lynette Fay, freelance broadcaster with an academic background in applied communications through Gaeilge; Nuala O&rsquo;Connor, co-founder of South Wind Blows and writer and documentary film-maker in the areas of music and the arts; Gillian Doyle, professor of media economics at the University of Glasgow; Mark Little, CEO and co-founder of Kinzen and founder of Storyful, a social news agency; Stephen McNamara, director of communications at the Irish Rugby Football Union; and Dr. Finola Doyle-O&rsquo;Neill, broadcast historian at University College Cork.  Two further proposed members have agreed to serve on the commission, subject to approval by their employers.  Their names will be announced once that approval is obtained.</p> <p> It is expected that the commission will engage in wide-ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered in its work.  It is to report within nine months on the necessary measures that need to be taken to ensure there is a vibrant, independent and sustainable public service media for the next generation.  I thank the eminent members of the commission for their commitment to chart the pathway for public service broadcasting and media, particularly Professor Brian MacCraith, who has been an innovator in education and is a pre-eminent intellectual in Irish public life.  I look forward to receiving their recommendations in due course.</p></reply>

This is a genuinely exciting opportunity to shape a new media environment rather than allowing our existing media to be hollowed out by some of the forces of change that are currently at work.  Does the Taoiseach agree that Covid has underlined the importance of an independent media more vividly than ever before and that it has exposed the vulnerability of many of our media sources in a way that may not have been clear previously?  Does he agree that some trends in this area cannot be reversed, such as the decline in the use by younger people of traditional media as well as the growth of global platforms offering a wide array of content?  There is an opportunity here to signpost a new direction such that citizens are properly informed and we have proper audiences for our significant range of sport, culture and other activities.</p>  <p>  I welcome the nine-month turnaround time for the report.  Will regulatory issues come up for consideration?  Will some of the issues around competitive platforms and the freedom they may have compared with traditional media be matters for consideration as well as the issue of the greater range of content, as outlined in the terms of reference?</p></speech>

I note the Taoiseach stated that two places on the commission are yet to be filled.  My party and I hope that full-time journalists will be appointed to those positions.  In concurring with the remarks of Deputy Bruton, I would note that journalism is in a very difficult position, not least in these Houses where it has never been more important to have good journalism.  Anybody who is reading the book "Champagne Football" or listening to the online podcasts about George Gibney will know that we need journalism to hold people to account, to find truth and to keep the institutions of the State, and every other institution, honest.  However, even in these Houses it can be seen that many former political commentators have drifted into becoming political advisers because there is a feeling that journalism is not a sustainable profession at this time.  It does not pay well, the hours are unreasonable and there does not seem to be as much of a future in it as may previously have been the case.  That said, a central tenet of any democracy is the ability of journalists to ask questions and find the truth.  Does the Taoiseach share that nervousness about the state of journalism in Ireland and internationally?  Does he hope the commission can speak to those issues and deal with them in a real way?</p></speech>

Consideration needs to be given to the differing regulatory frameworks governing online media and traditional media.  I think all Members present agree on the absolute importance and urgency of the work of the commission.  Quality public service journalism and broadcasting are essential.  They are at the core of our entire democratic system.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the point raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in regarding those in the profession of journalism.  There is ample evidence that many able professionals move from their first calling into the political space.  We need to ask why that is the case.  We also need to look at the new media and how that stitches in to provide an information-rich and diverse environment.  As Members are aware, that is not always the case and, as such, regulation and regulatory frameworks need to be examined.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in stated, that has impacted on the quality of life of journalists and the quality of the job itself.  It is extraordinary that those currently working in journalism must marry so many different platforms and be on all of them almost simultaneously from morning to night.  It is often the case that when one checks one's Twitter account one sees that a journalist is reporting breaking news.  Journalists are competing to be the first to report breaking news in addition to having to write articles and columns and carry out analysis.  It is an extremely demanding and challenging job.</p>  <p>  The financial underpinning of all of this is a significant issue.  Overall, we must accept that editorially independent journalism is essential to underpin our democracy in the modern era.  It is vulnerable to attack from new platforms, as we know from the experiences in other jurisdictions.  The Irish system is no less vulnerable to such attacks than the system in any other jurisdiction, whether at election time or any other time.  That must be kept under review.  Above all, journalism should be financially remunerative.  Those working in the sector should be able to anticipate and aspire to a particular quality of life, but that is becoming more challenging and difficult.</p>  <p>  Public service broadcasting is very important.  I agree with Deputy Bruton's observation that Covid-19 has shown public service broadcasting at its best.  It has also shown the extent of the vulnerability of various forms of media.  Local media in particular came under significant threat because of the absolute collapse in advertising during the early phase of the pandemic.  Such organisations are still under pressure as a result of that collapse.  Advertising spend at a national level has been somewhat restored, which is helping broadcasting.</p>  <p>  We must be clear about the importance of arts and culture in this area.  The synergies between culture and creative media and broadcast must be explored.</p> <p>In terms of the music, I favour the symphony orchestra being separated out but getting ring-fenced funding for the future - it is not quite under the remit of this - as per a previous decision.  We need to clear the demarcation lines but also create synergies between broadcasting, media in general and the arts and culture.  That is why they are all situated within one Department now, which is far better than was the case heretofore.</p> <p> I believe we are at a crossroads.  We must be prepared.  In talking of the financing, I have been criticised for believing we should financially underpin our media and we should do it in a way that ring-fences its editorial independence, both in broadcasting and in print media.</p> <p> I think we should financially underpin it through a universal approach.  The licence fee, in itself, is not sufficient.  The methodology of collecting it is not sufficient.  Many people are paying it.  Quite a number are not.  That is not fair.  It is also not at present in a position to underpin the quality, breadth and width of public service broadcasting that the State requires to underpin our democracy.  Those are my general views on it.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 for the consideration of this House.  All Stages were completed in the Seanad on Friday evening after a comprehensive seven-hour discussion, and I am sure we will have something similar in this House.  I thank the Business Committee of the D&aacute;il for agreeing to waive the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the proposed Bill due to the urgency of the need to introduce this legislation.  The Bill has been in circulation in draft form since the end of July.  A month-long public consultation helped greatly to inform the draft put before the Seanad last week.</p>  <p>  As all Deputies will be aware, the forestry sector is experiencing its fair share of challenges in recent times, not least the ongoing difficulties with issuing licences for afforestation, roads and felling.  I am acutely aware of these issues, and my first and most pressing priority is to ensure we have an efficient and functioning licensing system.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for land use, biodiversity and forestry, I am enormously keen to shape the future of Irish forestry to ensure delivery for the environmental, social and economic well-being of our country.  The programme for Government is ambitious for forestry, with over 15 proactive, close-to-nature forestry commitments.  I am determined to work with all stakeholders to achieve that ambition.  My commitment, and that of the Government, to that ambition is unequivocal.  However, first we must overcome the current difficulties and get the licensing system functioning for all.  The reasons for the delays in issuing licences are well documented at this stage and have required the most fundamental changes to our licensing system in its history.</p>  <p>  As I am sure Deputies will be aware, there is a crisis in the forestry sector.  The licensing and appeals system has come under significant pressure in the last two years.  Not only are there delays in issuing licences due to the licensing process itself, which my Department is addressing and to which I will speak later, but there are also long delays in determining appeals against licences issued.  It is fair to say that the appeals system, and the forestry appeals committee, FAC, is currently overwhelmed.  The delays being experienced are unfair to both applicants and appellants.  A timely and efficient appeals process is needed, and that is why this Bill is being introduced.  The Bill includes a suite of measures, which will deliver a much more efficient and effective process and will meet and balance the needs of all.</p>  <p>  I will give Deputies some background information on the licensing system that is in place for afforestation, tree felling, forest roads and aerial fertilisation.  My Department is the sole licensing authority for such licences and it determines all forestry licence applications at first instance.  All licences must be issued in compliance with EU and national environmental legislation, including the 1992 EU habitats directive.  An Taisce, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and other bodies are statutory consultees on licence applications.  The current licence procedures allow submissions by third parties at application stage and provide for appropriate consultations with any relevant consultation bodies.  Applicants and third parties dissatisfied with a licence decision of the Minister may submit an appeal on that decision to the FAC within 28 days of the decision.  There has been an upward trend in the numbers of licences being appealed, with 14 licences appealed in 2017, 105 in 2018, 235 in 2019 and 402 to date in 2020.  While the FAC has increased the number of decisions issued year on year, with 31 in 2018, 55 in 2019 and 172 so far this year, it is simply not keeping pace with the appeals received.  Approximately 490 cases are awaiting the decision of the FAC at present.</p>  <p>  I have been engaging intensively with all relevant stakeholders on these issues.  I have met with the environmental pillar, with Forest Industries Ireland and with other groups.  I have had correspondence from many frustrated farmers who are confused about why they cannot get a licence to plant a native woodland or take out dead and dying trees from their forests.  The delays in issuing licences have led to serious difficulties for people working in the forestry industry.  If action is not taken quickly, we could face the prospect of sawmills running out of timber and of significant job losses.  While delays in hearing appeals affect the quantity of timber being felled and transported to sawmills, they are also influencing planting rates.  To date, my Department has supported the establishment of just 1,941 ha of new afforestation this year, which is down 35% on this time last year.  This is well off any afforestation targets we have set, and it needs to be rectified.</p>  <p>  Before I move on to the specific provisions of the Bill and the public consultation process undertaken, I want to say that the Bill is not being delivered in isolation.  We are also addressing the other issues and delays with forestry licensing.  It must be acknowledged that decisions on granting licences have been too slow, and we now have a significant backlog of applications.  This arose in response to a substantial change in our appropriate assessment procedures, which deal with the impact of projects on sensitive European sites.  We have completely overhauled our assessment process, which is now robust and responsive to the environment in which we operate.  This has meant that the Department has had to revise procedures, increase resources, develop training and guidance, and strengthen its ecology team.  While this has taken time, we now have a sustainable system and we are tackling the backlog through a dedicated project plan, which operates to key performance indicators.  A project manager is in place and a project management board is overseeing and monitoring delivery weekly.  This plan is already yielding progress, with the number of felling licences issued in August being the highest in the previous 13 months in both volume and area.</p>  <p>  The action taken in improving the number of licences issued must be matched by a responsive appeals system or an even bigger bottleneck will develop at appeals stage.  That is why this Bill is so important.  In order to ensure full public participation with these proposals, the draft Bill was published and open to consultation for four weeks.  I very much welcome the fact that almost 9,000 submissions were received by the closing date.  This shows that this is an issue is of intense public interest.  The vast majority of the submissions, approximately 81%, indicated support for the Bill.  The submissions received have been examined and categorised in terms of who made the submission, that is, industry, private, public representatives or other, and whether the submission was in favour or opposed to the draft Bill.  The submissions were also grouped and analysed based on the Bill head and section being addressed.  A copy of a report summarising the main outcomes of the public consultation, which was made available last week, provides an overview of the submissions made.  Careful consideration was given to the suggestions made, and as a result the draft Bill was updated to take account of the feedback received and presented to the Seanad last week.  All submissions will be published in due course on my Department's website in a suitable format that meets GDPR requirements.</p> <p>My Department is working hard to complete this as quickly as possible, hopefully very soon.  <br/><br/>The main provisions set out in the Bill include increasing the capacity of the forestry appeals committee to determine appeals by enabling it to sit in divisions of itself; enabling the committee to determine appeals without an oral hearing where it is possible to properly dispose of an appeal in that manner; providing the Minister with the regulation making power to specify, among other things, the procedures to apply in relation to appeals and for related forestry appeals committee matters generally; and introducing reasonable fees for appeals.  <br/><br/>Updates that have been made to the Bill to take into account suggestions made during the public consultation process are as follows.  It makes no change to the right of applicants and all third parties to appeal directly to the forestry appeals committee.  The removal of this &quot;relevant person&quot; provision will allow direct access to all.  It sets the quorum requirement for the forestry appeals committee at two, to consist of a chairperson or deputy chairperson, or a deputy chairperson is designated, and at least one ordinary member in order to increase the efficiency of the committee.  It provides that licensing decisions may be affirmed, varied, set aside and returned to the Department.  This brings clarity to the role of the forestry appeals committee.  It requires that all information and documentation must accompany an appeal in order to be valid.  This is to ensure the efficient functioning of the committee.  It provides clarity as to the circumstances in which the Minister might issue a general policy directive, that is, when prioritising certain classes of appeal having regard to the need to an ensure economically and environmentally yield of forest goods and service in the State.<br/><br/>These provisions were the subject of an informed and robust debate in the Seanad last week, where Senators put forward a large number of amendments to the Bill.  These were organised into 14 groups, and I accepted two amendments in that House to which I would like to draw Members' attention.  Text was added under section 2 at page 3, after line 26, which states that: &quot;A copy of the report will at the same time be made available to the public on the Government of Ireland website and the Government publications office.&quot;  I was more than happy to accept this change, which offers the widest possible visibility for the annual report of the chairperson of the forestry appeals committee.  Under section 3 at page 8, the text at 14D (2) was replaced with: &quot;When making a directive under this section, the Minister shall have regard to the need to support economically and environmentally sustainable forest goods and services in the State.&quot;  This text better reflects what the Minister must have regard to when issuing a directive to the forestry appeals committee to prioritise certain classes of appeal.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that all these amendments are necessary to remove the current delays being experienced in the system and to reduce decision times in the forestry licensing system overall.<br/><br/>I will now go through the Bill in detail.  Section 1 deals with definitions of the Forestry Act 2014 and the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001.  Section 2 amends section 14 of the Act of 2001.  It provides for the chairperson of the forestry appeals committee to make an annual report to the Minister of his or her activities and of the activities of the committee, and for copies of that report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, to be published on <i>Gov.ie</i>and be made available in the Government Publications Office.<br/><br/>Section 3 covers the amendment of section 14A of the Act of 2001.  It provides for the appointment of deputy chairpersons to the forestry appeals committee and for the committee to sit in divisions of itself.  It also provides for the committee to have a quorum of two, for a time limit of 28 days to lodge an appeal, and for the deletion of the provision that a decision of the forestry appeals committee may be appealed to the High Court on any question of law.<br/><br/>Section 4 deals with further amendments to the Act of 2001.  It includes provisions for procedures and arrangements for the conduct of appeals, including oral hearings, and for the types of decisions the forestry appeals committee may make.  It allows the Minister to issue general directives as to policy prioritising certain classes of appeal.  It enables the Minister to make regulations having regard to the efficiency of the system of appeals, and the publication of documents relating to appeals on the forestry appeals committee website.  It also gives the Minister the power to prescribe fees, by regulation.<br/><br/>Section 5 amends the Act of 2014 and allows for the publication of application documents on the Department's website.  It also deletes certain sections of the Act, so that the making of regulations to prescribe fees follow the procedures outlined in the Act of 2001.<br/><br/>Section 6 outlines the transitional provisions for the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill.  In effect operational matters in relation to composition of the committee come into effect immediately on enactment of the Bill, as do directives from the Ministers.  Fees may be imposed on licences made on or after the Bill comes into operation.<br/><br/>While we must recognise the current difficulties, we must also look towards the future of forestry, and how the planting of the right tree in the right place can best serve the environmental, social, and economic needs of our society.  We have, however, a long way to go on delivering on these needs.  Forestry has a vital role to play in climate action and in dealing with biodiversity decline.  Getting this model right will be my primary focus.  Any new national forestry programme must deliver on these objectives, and I am committed to the development of an ambitious new programme, one which unites communities, protects habitats, delivers a measurable response to climate change, while supporting important rural jobs, and a vibrant timber sector.  This will not be an easy task, but I ask each and every Member to work with me on this.<br/><br/>I assure Deputies that this Bill will bring important efficiencies, proper procedures, and operational clarity to all stages of the forestry licence appeals process.  It will provide for forestry licence appeals to be conducted in a fair, straightforward and timely fashion.  While this Bill will not change the situation overnight, it will, along with our project plans for managing the licensing backlog, greatly improve the overall system, and will result in an increase in the number of licences available for planting and felling, and as a consequence will project jobs within the forestry sector.  In that spirit, I look forward to our debate of its provisions, and the reforms which it can put in place, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I echo her words of gratitude to the Opposition for working with us in recognition of the urgency of the legislation for the forestry sector and to work with us in ensuring the Bill could be accommodated in the Seanad last week and in the D&aacute;il this week.  We do not take that co-operation lightly and are very appreciative of it.</p>  <p>  Before turning to the Bill itself, I would like to say something about the forestry sector and our plans for its expansion.  I do not have to tell the House that we have ambitious plans, that can be seen in the programme for Government.  We want to expand afforestation beyond the current level of 11%, to deliver on the target of 8,000 ha per year.  In doing so, we want to plant diverse and resilient forests.  These will include all types of forestry - productive, mixed, native woodlands and recreational forests.  We want to promote sustainable forest management.  We want to grow healthy forests which will sustain our timber industry, an industry which supports many jobs in our rural communities.  Equally we want healthy and expanding forests to contribute to our climate change, biodiversity, and societal goals.  </p>  <p>  Forestry is an integral part of our response to the climate change challenge as recognised in the 2019 climate action plan, which is currently under revision.  It also has a role to play in contributing to halting the loss of biodiversity, as outlined in the national biodiversity plan.  It is all about having a forestry system which contributes to our aims as a society.  After all, forests and woodlands are multifunctional.  Productive forests produce an economic good, which those who have invested land in forestry over many years depend upon.  These forests provide jobs for those who plant, who harvest and who work in sawmills.  Then there are the pallets, building materials and other wood-based products produced at the end of the process, which we all use and need.</p>  <p>  Forests also occupy wonderful community and recreational spaces in many parts of the country.  My Department&rsquo;s NeighbourWood scheme has brought communities together to revitalise and plant woodlands, solely for recreational use.  These are collaborative efforts which promote a healthy enjoyment of the outdoors, for all age groups.  This is something which has taken on even more importance during these times.  I am sure everyone agrees that a stroll through our nearby woodland is good for both the heart and the soul.</p>  <p>  Our native woodlands are also a source of pride and I am more than pleased that the area being planted with our native species is on the rise.  These are biodiversity hotspots and as part of the Host a Hive initiative align with the national pollinator plan.</p> <p> Farm forestry is something that I am keen to see more of, as trees in a farmland setting can deliver many benefits.  Shelterbelts can provide shelter for animals and from wind.  When sensitively planted near rivers, they can prevent erosion and flooding.  They can contribute to water quality and to our Water Framework Directive obligations.  Trees planted in the right place can also provide connectivity corridors for wildlife.</p> <p> I am acutely aware that we must promote forests that respond to the evolving needs of our society.  This will be the aim of the new forestry programme and strategy.  The strategy will be a shared endeavour requiring action from public bodies, landowners, foresters, communities and businesses.</p> <p> Before we get to that point, however, we need a properly functioning licensing and appeals system.  Every tree planted, every tree felled and every forest road built must have a licence.  As all in the House know, these licences are not available because of delays in the licensing and appeals system.  This situation is unsustainable and no encouragement to anyone who wishes to plant.  In fact, because of these delays, the very future of the sector is at risk, with jobs in sawmills up and down the country under pressure as a result.  That is why the Bill is so important and urgently needed.</p> <p> My Department is beginning to address the delays in issuing licences, but good progress being made is being hampered by long delays in dealing with appeals.  This serves neither the landowner nor the appellant.  Each has a right to a timely decision from the forestry appeals committee.</p> <p> I fully support the changes proposed in the Bill.  They are suitable to the task at hand, that of improving the functioning of the appeals system.  A committee that can sit in divisions, ensure that relevant information is provided when an appeal is lodged and charge a reasonable fee are all sound provisions.</p> <p> The independence of the committee in dealing with individual cases is fully protected in this Bill, as is the right of any party to appeal directly to the committee.  While I welcome the option I have of prioritising certain classes of appeal, it is not something that I would take lightly.  To be clear, I may direct the committee to hear certain classes of appeal, but I may not interfere in an individual appeal in any way.</p> <p> The importance of this issue has been more than demonstrated by the level of response to the public consultation.  People wish to see the system fixed quickly.  We can move closer to that aim by bringing the Bill to a conclusion.</p> <p> I look forward to the Bill being considered in more detail in the House today and tomorrow, as was the case in the Seanad.  I commend the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on her sterling work in introducing the Bill and, importantly, working with departmental officials on making a strong effort to get the Bill processed in a prompt fashion, with the co-operation of the Houses.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister and Minister of State.  This is the first time that I have spoken in their presence and I congratulate them on their appointments.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the importance of this legislation and welcomes that the Government is seeking to address the existential crisis facing the forestry industry.  The challenge the sector is facing is one that can now be measured in weeks.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have played our part in helping to bring this legislation to the floor in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  The Government must recognise and accept how this crisis came to be.  Last December, the then Minister, former Deputy Creed, spoke of being involved in a "major triage operation" regarding the building backlog in the forestry sector.  He spoke of recruiting additional staff and external environmental consultants, all of which we now know amounted to nothing.  By May, the then Minister was describing the backlog as temporary and unavoidable.  The reason for the crisis in our forestry industry is not one of too much democratic political participation, but of a lack of political will and interest in dealing with the issue.  Interest in rural Ireland is something that this Government has shown little of.  We have now reached this crisis point.</p>  <p>  That the Bill allows the forestry appeals committee to meet in divisions is to be welcomed and is the primary mechanism through which the backlog can be addressed.  Upon the passing of the Bill, the Government will be promptly tested.  It is incumbent upon the Government to ensure that the additional staff and resources that the forestry appeals committee needs are put in place urgently.  We can discuss the amount of appeals coming in and the reasons for same, but the real test will be the Government clearing the backlog, getting the timber industry, including sawmills, back to work as quickly as possible and ensuring that jobs are not lost.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have several concerns regarding the Bill.  It places too much discretion in the hands of the Minister and may limit ordinary citizens' access to the appeals process.  We have engaged constructively with the legislation and are seeking to address these concerns, which are shared by many, through the amendments that we have tabled.  This is not our preferred manner to legislate, however.  In particular, that amendments were required to be submitted for consideration today prior to the Seanad voting is a procedure that the Government must not believe will be welcomed as common practice.</p>  <p>  Our amendments will not seek to impinge upon any aspect of the legislation that seeks to address the existing backlog or even the way that appeals will be handled.  We seek only to add safeguards to ensure that any citizen may engage in the process freely, as is citizens' right.  We would extend the period wherein an appeal could be lodged to a reasonable six weeks.  We wish for the time a person has to appeal to be counted from when public notice of a licence is granted rather than when the decision is made.  We want to ensure that people appointed to the forestry appeals committee are suitably qualified.  We seek to ensure that ordinary people can engage in the appeals process without prejudice.  These amendments are reasonably worded and we appeal to the Government to recognise not only the rights of citizens to engage in the process, but also its own obligation to safeguard and ensure those rights.</p>  <p>  While the Minister and Minister of State may correctly point out the potential benefits of the new online portal that the Government is bound to make available, they will be aware of significant concerns that the portal will not be available for some time.  If use of this portal can deliver documents and materials critical to appeals in a timely manner, it would play an important role in making the appeals process more efficient.  What is not tenable is limiting people's ability to appeal today on the promise that a separate future appeal might be more streamlined.  I expect that the Minister and Ministers of State will give some undertaking that this portal will be available before any constraint is placed on appellants.</p>  <p>  Much of the discretion provided to the Minister within the Bill is unnecessary and a cause of concern.  I call on the Government to accept our amendments to rectify this.  The Minister is empowered to reduce the period wherein an appeal may be lodged but is prohibited from extending it.  To us, this is bizarre.  In addition, the discussion around fees in the Bill has often missed the point.  The Bill repeals the Minister's existing ability to introduce fees and then reintroduces it in a separate section, but with one key difference; the Minister will no longer have to justify these fees to the D&aacute;il.  I urge the Government to accept our modest amendments to place a cap on fees and mandate the Minister to provide a refund in cases where an appeal is upheld.</p>  <p>  The Bill is imperfect, but by engaging with the Opposition constructively we can pass legislation that will allow for the existing backlog to be cleared in a timely manner without impinging on the rights of citizens.</p>  <p>  With the new forestry programme due in 2021, the Government will have an opportunity to shape Irish forestry policy for several years.  A proper forestry policy should deliver for everyone.  It should be of benefit to the community, the local economy and the environment.  A forest should be an amenity, somewhere people want to live near.  This means greater diversity requirements in afforestation, more native species and less Sitka spruce.  While the conifer may be the most commercially viable in the short term, the resulting monoculture provides none of the ancillary benefits while damaging soil in the long run.</p>  <p>  It is known that much of the cause of the backlog is opposition to forestry policy in general rather than individual operations.  Upon the passing of the Bill, while the Government's first duty is to clear the existing backlog promptly, its second duty and opportunity are to develop a new forestry policy that provides broader benefits not only for today, but tomorrow.  The Government should bring a new forestry programme to both Houses of the Oireachtas in a prompt manner, accompanied by further legislation to address the outstanding concerns and do so as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  We will be supporting the substantive motion before the House in order to save rural jobs and ensure that the forestry industry can continue to operate, but the Government must live up to its part and ensure that rural Ireland can be made vibrant once again.</p>  <p>  As the Minister and Minister of State will be aware, I represent County Leitrim, where up to 50% of the land available for forestry is under Sitka spruce primarily.  This frustrates and annoys the communities living in the areas in question.  Many years ago, I spoke to a man in Ballinamore.</p> <p>It was the evening and the lights were coming on as darkness fell.  He pointed to the mountain behind the town and said he remembered when there were hundreds of lights on the mountain and that the only thing there now was trees.  That is what is happening, not just in mountainous and hilly areas but in every part of County Leitrim.  It is really frustrating for farmers who want to buy a piece of land beside their farm but cannot do so because they are outbid by big corporations which purchase it for investment purposes and then plant it.  It is an issue that is extremely sore and annoying for people living in rural areas.</p> <p> My own parish has seen huge amounts of forestry development.  The local school has had its number of teachers reduced from three to two this year because there are so few families living there.  When I look at the horizon beyond my house, more than three quarters of it is made up of conifers.  Where the land is planted, there is no longer any need for the farmer.  There are no cattle on the land and no need for the vet to come out.  There is no tractor to be fixed and no roof to be put on a shed because there is no need for a shed.  There is no need for anything really.  As far as the community is concerned, that piece of land has become sterile.  There will be a lot of activity on it for three weeks every ten or 12 years when the trees are cut and drawn away but then there is nothing again for years.</p> <p> There is a really deep problem which the Government must address.  If we are going to have parts of the country under large amounts of afforestation, something must be done to replace the communities that are being displaced by that afforestation.  We see in those same parts of the country that people cannot get planning permission to build a house.  When that point is raised, the answer is often given that they should go and live in a town.  My parish does not have a town, nor do the parishes that surround it.  We live in a rural area with dispersed communities and there is no town.  Those communities have survived for centuries and can survive again if the Government would take the interest to ensure they are provided with the resources to be able to continue.</p> <p> Afforestation is a huge problem for many parts of rural Ireland but it should be a huge opportunity.  The difference is in whether the Government puts the right policies in place.  The policies in place at the moment are only about big corporate interests and being able to produce the maximum amount of timber off the worst kind of land as fast as possible to make the maximum amount of profit.  Everyone else can just stand by and watch as their community dwindles in front of them.  That is what I have seen happen and we must do something about it.  We will support this legislation to ensure the blockade is stopped and people who have forests grown can cut the timber.  The timber has to be got out and those jobs must be sustainable.  We recognise that and it is fine.  However, the other side of the issue is not being addressed with any urgency at all.  On my first day in the House I pointed out that we have a huge problem in that we are not delivering for rural Ireland.  That is not happening at all.</p> <p> If we are going to move forward on these issues, to look at all the factors in the round and ensure we deliver for people in rural areas, we have to recognise the problems that exist.  We must recognise, first of all, that the level of grant aid that has been given for afforestation to people who are not farmers must be different from the level of grant aid given to people who are farmers.  It was the case in the past that farmers got a higher level of grant aid.  If they had a small piece of land of poor quality which they wanted to plant, there was an opportunity to do so.  Now the same level of grant aid is offered to the investor who comes from wherever.  That has created a completely unfair scenario.  These people come with very deep pockets and can offer bids for land that put it out of the reach of any local person.  That is a huge problem.  At the same time, there are many wealthy Irish people who come together and invest in these companies to provide a pension fund.  They buy farms and land in places like Leitrim and plant them.  They do not know, understand or care what that does to the local community.  That is fine and understandable.  The Government should know, understand and care about the impact on communities, but that does not seem to be the case.  The Minister and Minister of State have an opportunity to do something about that responsibility.</p> <p> Another problem that has been arising for years in many parts of rural Ireland, particularly in counties like Leitrim where there is poor infrastructure, is that roads are being decimated by forest operations.  Part of the problem is that forestry is treated as an agricultural crop.  Every other agricultural crop grows in a year or two years, but this particular crop takes 40 years to grow and is harvested in a couple of weeks.  During those couple of weeks, thousands of tonnes of materials are coming out across small county roads which simply cannot sustain the load and are being crushed beneath it.  Local authorities are putting weight restrictions on those loads and trying every way they can to put pressure on the forestry companies to come up with answers to the problem.  What is really needed is for the Government put a fund in place to enable local authorities to replace the roads.  A simple solution that has been proposed is that a small portion of the grant aid to afforestation should be set aside for such a fund.  The hauliers will undoubtedly argue that they pay road tax and they have a point in that regard.  They are entitled to have good roads in place.  At the end of the day, the problem we have is that the weight of the forestry loads simply cannot be sustained by the roads on which they are being transported.</p> <p> Another huge problem is one that has been raised with me by people in the tourism industry.  In different parts of the country, formerly magnificent scenic views have been totally blocked out by a wall of dark green forest.  A tree is small when it is planted but it is 12 ft or 14 ft within a couple of years and 40 ft by the time it is ready to be cut.  It is like building a wall around a whole community and sometimes the trees are very close to people's houses.  My view is that anybody proposing an afforestation project of more than 5 ha should have to apply to the local authority for planning permission.  Any such project involves a permanent change of land use and a permanent change to the landscape.  I introduced legislation in the previous D&aacute;il to give effect to that provision and I intend to put it forward again in this D&aacute;il.  I hope the Government will co-operate with me and look seriously at the proposal.</p> <p> On Leitrim County Council, all political parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, Independent representatives and the CEO agree that we need to have a planning permission requirement for forestry.  There is also concern among local authority members about the amount of run-off coming from forestry.  An acidic sap that comes out of the trees in October and November is getting into the water and causing a lot of pollution.  In fact, the council tells me that apart from farmyard pollution, forestry is the next highest contributor to pollution in County Leitrim.  It will be the same in many other counties if the intention is to expand the amount of land planted.  There are consequences to that expansion and those consequences need to be examined and preparations made to mitigate them.  We must work with people to ensure the D&aacute;il is not still debating these issues in 20 years' time because some other problem has been created by poor foresight at this time.</p> <p> The answers to all of these problems are most likely to be found among the people who live in these areas and are dealing with the problems.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in particular to talk to people.  The Green Party and many other environmental interests in County Leitrim are absolutely in tune with everything I am saying in this regard.  They understand the problems and they see the way that conifer planting has destroyed communities.  There is little use in somebody who lives far away telling us that trees are lovely and we should plant loads of them.  Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that and we must work through the problems that are created by these issues.</p> <p> One of the biggest problems is the change of land ownership.  In places like County Leitrim, land is moving out of the hands of the community and into the hands of corporate interests.  If it does not happen at the beginning, it happens towards the end.  Farmers decide to plant their land and for 15 years they will get a premium on it.  By that stage, they are getting a little older, they might need a hip replacement or whatever else, and they need to get a few bob together.  They get the thinnings out of it but there is no more premium coming and it will be another 20 years before they see another bob.  It is at this point that the company which brought away the thinnings may offer to buy the whole lot, and that is when the land transfers from local to corporate ownership.  The same thing is happening all over the place.  In some instances, the land is bought by corporate interests in the beginning and ends up under forestry.</p> <p> These issues must be dealt with and I hope that happens in the next forestry programme.  There are also issues around agroforestry and how it is operating.  There is talk of only having six years of payment for agroforestry, which is nothing near what is needed.  The issues around forestry are not just to do with how big companies are being allowed to go in, cut fast, get the product out and then replant.  The issues are also around communities of people and rural neglect, and those are the issues that need to be dealt with first.  When that is done and people have confidence, they will embrace forestry.  Their problem is not with forestry itself but with the consequences of it.  In my community, as in many communities throughout the country, people have a very negative experience of those consequences.</p> <p> I understand the motivation behind this legislation.  We know why these changes have to happen, but we also know that a lot more needs to be done in dealing with this sector.  We will support the Bill.  I hope the amendments we have put forward will be accepted by the Government and will help to bring a new day for the industry.</p></speech>

Lig an Rialtas a bh&iacute; ann i ndearmad &iacute; agus t&aacute; s&eacute; thar am &eacute; seo a phl&eacute; sa Seomra seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe seo agus roimh an dea-obair freisin a rinne na hAir&iacute; f&eacute;in le mo chomhghleacaithe.</p><p>Bh&iacute; tionchar tromch&uacute;iseach, ar nd&oacute;igh, ag na riar&aacute;ist&iacute; achomhairc ar an tionscal seo le tamall.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh bhun&uacute; rann&aacute;in chun dul i ngleic leis an gceist seo ach caithfimid a chinnti&uacute; go mbun&oacute;far &eacute; chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir agus go mbeidh na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; aige.  Chomh maith leis sin caithfear a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh saineolas acu si&uacute;d a cheapfar ar an rann&aacute;n seo mar go mbeidh siad ag teacht ar chinnt&iacute; at&aacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach don earn&aacute;il seo.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas taca&iacute;ocht do leas&uacute; Shinn F&eacute;in ina thaobh sin.</p><p>The reality, as we have discussed here, is that the forestry sector is in crisis right now.  It is welcome that this situation is being discussed in the Chamber as it affects the lives and livelihoods of people across the State, especially in our rural areas, as my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, has outlined.  The backlog of appeals has had a major impact on the industry and, as a result, the industry has faced a crisis.  We know that this is not resolved, by January at the latest Ireland will need to import timber.  In all likelihood, that will happen even earlier.</p><p>The issue was ignored by the previous Government, even though it has been on the cards since December of last year when it was highlighted in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.  </i>This once again highlights the lack of planning by successive Governments for rural Ireland.  These areas have also been severely impacted economically by Covid-19.</p><p>The establishment of the divisions is welcome but we need to ensure there is no delay in setting them up, and we must ensure the divisions are adequately resourced.  A key concern Sinn F&eacute;in has with the Bill is that there is no explicit requirement for those appointed to the divisions by the Minister to have relevant expertise.  I hope the Government sees sense on this issue and will support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to ensure members have expertise in biodiversity, water quality, climate change and environmental legislation.</p><p>As I said earlier, it is essential that we deal with this matter here today.  It is vitally important that Sinn F&eacute;in amendments to this Bill are taken into consideration and supported by the Government to ensure the best possible outcome for the sector and, of course, the communities and the people affected by the Bill.</p></speech>

M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I rise to support the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I congratulate them on their appointments.</p><p>The issues are well articulated.  My colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, articulated the Labour Party position in the Seanad.  While the legislation is necessary, it gives rise to many questions, one of which is forestry policy in its totality.  The Labour Party is not convinced that this Bill alone is the answer or the panacea to the problems that exist within the forestry sector at present.  I believe the Minister and the Minister of State acknowledge there are problems inherent with the process.  We need to have these issues rectified if we are serious about ensuring we have a seamless, fit-for-purpose forestry sector that recognises the challenges of afforestation and increasing beyond 11% the rate of cover.  We must also recognise that the process of applying for licences is clearly not fit for purpose.  We need to investigate further after this legislation is passed, and presumably it will, why the process is not working.  We are all aware, across the party divide in the House, that it is not fit for purpose currently.</p><p>I ask that a lot of energy is given to ensuring that once the Bill passes, there is a root and branch review of policy in general so the requisite staff are appointed and the requisite whole-time equivalents are appointed.  We are told that additional staff are being appointed within the forestry service but we do not have a clear number of staff and the type of staff that are being appointed.  Much of the work could be done internally on the licence screening process, with regard to triage of applications and in the assessment of the ecological or environmental impact elements, without diminishing the right of anybody to appeal.</p><p>There is much in this legislation that gives voice to regulations that will have to come into force after the Bill has passed.  The Labour Party is worried about the number of regulations, as articulated in the proposed new section 14E.  I would dearly love the Minister of State to respond specifically to the point I am about to make.  I note that her officials are present.  Section 14E provides for 14 regulations that must come into force.  For this legislation to be taken seriously, the question that arises is when this will happen.  What is the timeframe for bringing those regulations into force once the legislation has passed?  According to the proposed new section 14E(1):</p> <blockquote> 	Without prejudice to the generality of sections 7(2) and 15, for the purpose of the conduct of appeals, and having regard to the need for efficiency in the system of appeals, the Minister may make regulations to provide for all or any of the following: </blockquote>  <p>The section goes on to list potential areas of regulation in subsections (a) through to (n), providing, <i>inter alia</i>, for &quot;time limits to apply to the making and conduct of appeals&quot;; &quot;the constitution of divisions of the Forestry Appeals Committee and the assignment of appeals to those divisions&quot;; and &quot;the form and manner of making of requests by the Forestry Appeals Committee for information from a party to an appeal, or a person other than a party&quot;.  If we do not have sight right now of the timeframe, it could be argued that notwithstanding the bona fides of the Minister and Minister of State present in the Chamber in seeking to have this issue addressed, there is a danger that if those timeframes slip and are not tight there will be no systemic change in this process, notwithstanding the subdivision of the FAC, and there could be as many delays in the licensing process in the future as there are now.  If we had some sight of how the Minister will deal with these regulations and when they will be put into force, that will give great confidence to the forestry sector and would allay some of the fears of people in the forestry sector.  I ask the Minister to address that issue in response to the Second Stage debate.</p><p>We talk about afforestation policy and there are programme for Government commitments, but we are seriously lagging behind.  I am not trying to make a party political point on this because we all agree on afforestation in this House.  We want to see clear targets and we want those targets to be met.  We want to ensure that the Minister with responsibility for biodiversity will set out a pathway for those afforestation targets to be met, and that we achieve targets greater than 8,000 in 2021 to offset the missed targets in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Ireland is abysmally behind the curve, and I say this in a spirit of co-operation.  This Minister and the Government have an opportunity now really to hammer home the idea that Ireland needs to nudge well past the 11%.</p> <p>That is something the Government would get support for, but only on the basis that it is not just blanket cover but an afforestation policy that ensures that biodiversity is not damaged in any way.  I am stating the obvious as far as the Minister of State is concerned.  The issue of afforestation and forestry policy needs to have a radical basis now.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action in the last D&aacute;il published a report containing clear targets which had cross-party support.  The Minister of State will find that if she is radical in her approach to this, she will have the support of the majority of the Members of this House.</p> <p>  On the issue of fees I would ask the Minister of State to consider the impact of levying a fee.  The Minister, arguably, is silent on the issue of the amount of the fee.  It is another issue that will be given over to regulation or statutory instrument.  What people want is certainty with this legislation.  If the Minister of State is of a mind to instigate a fee - and it seems from her speech that she is absolutely clear on the need for a fee - we cannot have a situation where ordinary people, such as those for whom Deputy Martin Kenny spoke in places like Leitrim, are locked out of a process.  Ordinary people cannot be locked out of the process by dint of the fact that there is a fee put in their way that arguably diminishes their right to make a genuine submission to an appeal.  I ask the Minister to revisit that issue.  </p> <p> I repeat the point made earlier on the numbers and types of staff being appointed at present.  How many people have been appointed in the past number of months since the Government was formed and across what positions?  What are the proposals to appoint new people in the forestry service?  Again, I reiterate the point that the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture must come together and work with the Minister and Minister of State to shine a light into how the forestry service operates and unlock any of the impediments to the granting of licences in a way that balances the needs of industry with ensuring that the ecology and the environment are not damaged or put upon in any way.  The committee must give a voice to all of the stakeholders and contextualise the more 9,000 submissions in public.  If we are to agree a position on the workings of the forestry service, we must have an opportunity to have a hearing or some public articulation and give further voice, after this legislation is passed, to how we feel the forestry service needs to operate.  We must hear from independents and others within the sector as to how they feel the forestry service should operate.  I am talking about the stakeholders within the industry who are affected by the decisions of the forestry service day in, day out.  </p> <p> I also wish to give voice to the frustration of people, some of whom will also have contacted the Minister of State.  I know of one forestry application that was 823 days in the system with no decision.  I have learned of other applications that were 681 days, 713 days and 520 days in the system with no decision.  It is unconscionable for any modern public or civil service to take that long to process an application or an appeal.  It beggars belief.  I know that the Minister of State is conscious of this problem but we need to get to a stage where this is no longer happening and the sooner, the better.  </p> <p> I do not wish to tarry.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the issue.  I have asked very specific questions and hope that they will be answered when the Minister of State responds at the end of this Second Stage debate.  The Labour Party is generally supportive of the Bill but there must be a root and branch review of how the forestry service operates when all of this is over.  That needs to happen as soon as possible.</p></speech>

There are 55,000 acres of forestry in County Clare.  Nationally the sector employs 12,000 people and it remained buoyant during the last recession.  It is a sector that should be valued in terms of licensing and felling in order to realise its full potential.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill because it will make the appeals system more efficient and will reduce the backlog of appeals at the forestry appeals committee.  It will also align forestry licensing with the planning process and its appeals system.  County Clare is hugely impacted by all of this.  Many constituents have contacted my office whose forestry applications have been in the system for inordinate and unacceptably long periods of time.  They are extremely frustrated.  At the same time, the building sector is running out of timber to build homes.  There is a real urgency to removing the backlog which, as things stand, would take approximately two years to clear.  A total of 382 objections were lodged this year and approximately 500 cases are awaiting a decision.  Serial and in some instances vexatious objectors have been throwing in objections to forestry licence applications.  Some of these objectors are the same ones that crop up in the planning process.  Three key projects in Clare are on the back burner because of serial objectors, namely the Clonlara flood defences, the coastal erosion defences at Doonbeg and the bridge crossing at Killaloe.  As we grasp this issue in the context of agriculture and forestry, we must also introduce pre-qualifying rules for those who object to planning applications.  Someone living in Rathmines has no basis for serially objecting to planning applications in County Clare.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I hope that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will encourage more of a mix of broadleaf trees.  There has been a 2% increase in the planting of such trees in the past year but we need to see far more.  In my constituency we have the Cratloe wood, timbers from which were used to roof the House of Commons at Westminster.  It is a fabulous wood but there are lots of conifers in there now, driving out native species.  We need to see more native trees being planted in there again.</p></speech>

In other jurisdictions, the Minister's counterparts are ensuring that many of these individuals are protected during this period.  They have legislated for payment breaks, including payment breaks where interest does not accrue.  Crucially, for people living in Germany today, the payment breaks last nine months and, in Portugal, Spain and Italy, they last 12 months.  Yet, the Minister sat as majority shareholder in the banks and did nothing to protect these individuals, who will have a negative credit rating from the next couple of days onwards.</p></reply>

We have put in place and released the supports that made a difference to so many at such a crucial time.  Payment breaks were applied to 157,000 customer accounts over the past six months.  Those related to mortgages, personal loans and SME loans, and they were a source of considerable relief to customers at a time of great uncertainty.  Approximately 89,000 of these payment breaks were granted to mortgage customers.  Almost 37,000 of those customers subsequently opted to take a second three-month payment break, meaning the majority of customers had enough confidence and certainty to come off their initial three-month break.  Payment breaks were put in place for 32,000 SMEs and for 4,000 corporate customers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of the guidance from the European Banking Authority, EBA, in regard to the phasing out of, and the changing of the guidelines on, payment moratoria.  I have met and engaged with the banks this week in this regard and in regard to how we can make sure the right level of support is available to those who need it across the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  I listened to what Deputy Doherty said about other countries.  However, he did not mention that, for example, in Germany those breaks are on offer in 21% of banks.  Here, in Ireland, it is 100% of the banks, but he did not mention that in the contribution he made.  He made reference to Spain, but he did not make reference to the fact that those who are able to access those breaks access them if they see their income fall by more than 40%.  What we have done here in Ireland is something that is broad and that has made a difference to so many.  If he is going to compare us to other countries, Deputy Doherty should portray the full picture of what has happened in other countries and allow the record of what we have done here in Ireland a fairer comparison.</p></speech>

What did he do yesterday?  He had tea and coffee with the banks through Zoom and a nice friendly chat, where they came in and told him they are going to do what they always do, which is to deal with individuals on an individual basis.  Even if Germany has done this for 21% of its customers, the Minister will have failed to address it for anybody after this month.  Under the EBA guidelines, banks in this State could have announced a continuation or an extension of the breaks, which would mean these individuals&rsquo; credit rating would not be affected.  It would mean they would not be deemed as non-performing loans if they could not pay the full capital or interest.  It would mean the banks would not have to hold additional capital when we need banks to be lending to SMEs.  There are 32,000 SMEs affected, many of which cannot go back to paying full costs and, therefore, this will have a negative impact on their rates.  The Minister had a responsibility and, indeed, a duty to do the right thing.  He has failed miserably because there will be no extensions to payment breaks for anybody in this State after they run out later this month.</p></speech>

It is by discharging this duty and responsibility that 89,000 breaks were granted to mortgage holders who needed them in the first place.  Since then, we have seen almost 37,000 of those deciding they do not need the payment breaks, and that they are able to honour their loans in full.</p>  <p>  What Deputy Doherty has just done is a typical Sinn F&eacute;in response.  What he has put out here, on the floor of the D&aacute;il, is part of the truth.  Is he going to go on with this type of debate?  In Germany, for example, the breaks he is referring to began in the middle of June whereas the actions we put in place happened when this pandemic arrived in Ireland.  I am aware of the need that is there.  I am aware of the anxiety and the stress that so many face at the moment.  I and the Central Bank have been very clear that with the funding that is available to banks and what they have already done, the ability is now there to put in place arrangements that will work and will do the right thing by families and by business.  If Deputy Doherty is going to compare us with what happens in other countries, will he at least do us the duty of a full comparison? </p></speech>

When the Minister compares us to Italy, Portugal, Spain or Germany, the difference is their finance ministers have made sure that, in those countries, people can continue to avail of payment breaks, depending on their circumstances.  Here, where the Minister is unique because he is the majority shareholder in two of the largest banks, he has done nothing.</p> <p>The Minister has allowed these people to fall off a cliff, in a manner of speaking.  The reality is that tomorrow is the deadline to apply for a payment break.  Some 37,000 people got them approximately six months ago.  These people will have to return to making full payments or their credit ratings will be affected.  Their loans will be deemed to be non-performing and the banks will have to carry additional capital.  We are not back in normal times by any measure.  That is why the European Banking Authority, EBA, guidelines allowed countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal to do what they did.  The Minister had an opportunity to do the right thing.  The problem is that he and Fine Gael have done the wrong thing time and again.  As we have seen in the cases of Senator Michael D'Arcy and Brian Hayes, the Minister's party is too close to big finance and the banks.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty is at it again.  He is referring to Italy but, in the comparison he is making, will he point to the fact that, during the moratorium in Italy, only repayments on the principal were suspended while interest payments still had to be made?  He also made a comparison to Spain.  As I put to the Deputy earlier, to access the measures implemented in Spain, a person must have had a very significant fall in income.  In Ireland, we moved quickly to put in place breaks which were needed and which affected tens of thousands of families and many thousands of businesses.  I am well aware of the anxiety, pressure and fear that so many are facing.  That is why the employment wage subsidy scheme was continued.  That is why the Deputy will have heard the Government and Central Bank, over the weekend and recent days, making clear that funding and flexibility exist to put in place the right arrangements for the families and businesses that need them.</p></speech>

Does he have any plans to extend or broaden the criteria under which people can apply for such certificates?  They are a very useful support for those who need them but I find many people visiting my constituency office who have children who need special vehicles but who do not qualify because they are not physically in a wheelchair or have not lost a limb.  It is important that we look at this issue compassionately.</p></reply>

As he is aware, this is a very important scheme, the cost of which was, in 2019 and excluding motor tax, &euro;72 million.  To repeat what I have said, this scheme is important for many and I understand the many demands on it.</p><p>It is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger, and it is open to certain organisations.  To qualify for relief, an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009.</p><p>To qualify for relief, the following criteria apply.  The applicant must hold a primary medical certificate issued by the relevant senior area medical officer or a board medical certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.  The vehicle may be a new or a used vehicle but must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  It must be purchased by the applicant.  This criterion includes vehicles purchased through hire purchase agreements but excludes vehicles which have been purchased by way of a leasing arrangement.  The engine capacity of the vehicle must not exceed 6,000 cc.</p><p>The Deputy is aware of the criteria for being granted a primary medical certificate.  This scheme was first introduced in 1968, at which point the legislation only allowed for one medical ground.  In 1989, four new medical grounds were added and, in 1994, one new medical ground was added.</p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup></sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a primary medical certificate.  The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the regulations did not align with the regulation-making mandate given in the primary legislation to define further criteria.</p><p>I will answer in more detail in a moment.</p><p><i>Additional information not give on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the regulations did not align with the regulation-making mandate given in the primary legislation to define further criteria for &quot;severely and permanently disabled&quot; persons.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Supreme Court decision has raised complex legal and policy issues which will require careful consideration.  In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are examining the judgement in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and will bring forward any policy and-or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.</p></speech>

If the last review of the scheme or addition to it was in 1994, it may be timely to review it again.  I know of a young child who has been blind since birth.  He needs special care and a vehicle but cannot qualify for this particular primary certificate.  When looked at compassionately, much like every other rule or regulation we bring in, anomalies will arise in the scheme, which we accept.  It may be time to review the scheme again as it has not been reviewed since 1994.</p></speech>

I understand their level of need.  I am now considering the consequences of the Supreme Court ruling on this matter.  I have asked my officials to prepare options for me as to what we can do in respect of this scheme.  I know many Deputies in this House represent constituents who, for entirely understandable reasons, feel that they should have access to this scheme.  One of the reasons that so few changes have been made to it in the past, however, is that we have been trying to get the balance right between implementing a scheme that can make a big difference for those who need it the most and not developing a scheme that is so broad that it represents a considerable use of taxpayers' money and which spreads those resources very broadly.  I am aware of the issues the Deputy has raised and, as I have said, I am seeking to come up with options for dealing with some of the issues which emerged in the hearing to which he has referred.</p></speech>

I am delighted that he is going to review the scheme or take advice based on the ruling made in the courts.  This is an opportunity.  We do not want to open up the scheme as a free-for-all but it is very important that the right people get support.  I have no doubt that, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, the Deputy will look at this issue in a reasonable light.  I may send him some details of the case with which I am dealing as an example of what we can do by making a very small change and of how that would help people enormously in their lives.</p></speech>

This scheme is very valuable to those who participate in it.  They deserve the value afforded by the scheme, which gives help to those who need it most.  I need to ensure that, if any further changes are made to the scheme, it will continue to target a great deal of taxpayers' money at those who need it most while not becoming so broad as to become far bigger than originally intended.  If the Deputy wants to send me details of the particular case to which he has referred, I will certainly examine them.  We will have to return to the House at a later point with regard to how we will develop this particular scheme.</p></speech>

This comes a year after I submitted a dossier to the Central Bank comprising a complaint outlining how this practice affected customers, how it ripped off motorists and homeowners, how it is banned in many other jurisdictions, including in the United States, and how a ban on the practice was being considered in Britain.  I put it directly to the Minister during his previous term in Government that this practice should be banned.  Does he now believe it has to come to an end?  Will he support the legislation I am producing to bring this about?</p></reply>

As he himself has acknowledged, the Central Bank has now published the findings of a phase of its work in studying this practice in the Irish market.  Our programme for Government includes a commitment to remove this practice from the market.  I will be looking at the work the Deputy has done in this area and any legislation he may bring forward in that regard.</p> <p>That being said, the Central Bank review is ongoing and focused on motor and home insurance.  It is being carried out in three phases, and the first of these was completed recently.  While I welcome the publication of the report, I note with concern that the Central Bank has observed that the majority of firms utilise differential pricing through various techniques.  A failure to recognise and acknowledge the practice on the part of some firms has raised significant concerns about their ability to assess its impact on customers.  This is why, on foot of this, the Central Bank wrote to the chief executives of these insurance providers on 8 September to highlight its concerns following this first phase.  I expect that the firms will respond to these concerns and co-operate with the Central Bank.</p> <p> The work of the Central Bank is now moving to the next phase of its review before it makes any final recommendations.  I believe it is prudent to wait until the review is complete.  This is a complex issue and we will need to consider carefully any potential remedies and what impact they could have on consumers.  We need to guard against the risk of unintended consequences and ensure that in attempting to address an issue we do not create an undesirable knock-on impact elsewhere or discourage competition or new entrants to the market.</p></speech>

That sounds logical.  I instigated the review because of what I had done with my engagement with and complaint to the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Anyway, the first phase of the review has basically vindicated everything I have said.  It has found the practice operates on a wide scale across the market.  Many of these operators operate from Britain.  The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, has already concluded its final report.  The FCA is going to ban the practice that punishes people for what is called dual pricing or the loyalty premium.  If a customer is with an insurance company for five years or more, then the customer will be charged 30% extra on average in terms of the renewal practice.  This problem is real right now.  It is reckoned operators have been overcharging 6 million people in Britain.  People here are being overcharged hundreds of millions of euro.  The firms are using big information, including social media sites.  They can take information from posts, photographs and videos.  I appeal to the Minister to show urgency and to move to give us a firm commitment that this will be banned within the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900032#GG00300"><p>The comparison with the FCA in the UK is interesting.  The FCA began this work in October 2018.  It has now published a final report.  It was published this week along with a related consultation document.  The FCA is inviting views on its consultation document up to 25 January 2021.  The FCA has indicated that in the aftermath at some point next year it will publish a policy statement.  That is the timeline for what is happening in the UK, as I imagine Deputy Doherty is aware.  Deputy Doherty has been fair and accurate enough to describe my approach as logical.  The UK approach illustrates that we should await the final phase of the Central Bank because I need to understand fully the view of the regulator in respect of this matter, the potential remedies and the consequences of action that the regulator or the Government can take.  Deputy Doherty will see from the comparison with what is happening in the UK what timelines those in the UK are operating to.  I am absolutely aware of the urgency of this issue.  I welcome that the Central Bank has done this work quickly.  I will act on this issue as soon as I am clear about what kind of action can deal properly with the matter but not create other difficulties that I would then be held to account for.</p></speech>

I am not knocking the bank for doing this.  It will take a further year to finish phases two and three, which will include final recommendations.  Then the Government will consider it.  The point I am making in terms of Britain is that the insurance companies operating here are operating in Britain as well.  There is no need for us to reinvent the wheel.  These companies are ripping off their customers.  Dual pricing is happening - we know that.  It is banned in 20 states across the USA.  The FCA final report included what the interim report said, which was that the FCA wants to ban it as well.  The problem is that it will take the Minister three or four years to do this.  In the meantime, people are being ripped off by the insurance industry.  They are telling the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority that technology has developed so far that they can look at a customer's social media posts, including posts of their children playing, and draw information to figure out how much they can stick that customer in terms of the insurance premium quote.  That is how much this is moving on.  As we sit here, consumers are getting ripped off.  We need to move now rather than reinvent the wheel.  We should look to what is happening in Britain.</p></speech>

The bank has moved with speed on this issue.  The Deputy compared our work to what is happening with the FCA.  The FCA has taken longer to do this work.  It has now published something that might lead to action next year.  That is the timeline for what is happening elsewhere.  The Central Bank has done this work across this year and within the year.  I know the urgency of this issue.  Equally, I know that while I am expected and want to make progress in ensuring we can bring down the cost of insurance for businesses and families and deal with unfair practices, it is also the case that in any action I take I need to ensure it works and does not have other consequences.  If that were to arise, the Deputy would hold me to account for that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty was open about drawing comparisons with what the FCA is doing in the UK.  He can see the timeline that organisation is operating to.  The Central Bank has done this complex tranche of work quickly.  It has already followed up with the chief executives on this.  I will outline what steps the Government will take on the matter when the Central Bank has quickly completed the work it has committed to in this area.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has indicated that it believes substantial additional stimulus should be undertaken in 2021.  I am keen to explore what this substantial additional stimulus will look like.</p></reply>

As ever, this is valuable analysis and I welcome the council's contribution at an early stage of the budget process.  It is also worth pointing out that around the same time, the Governor of the Central Bank wrote to me expressing broadly similar views to the council.  The council noted that the macroeconomic outlook is exceptionally uncertain, with key risks relating to future waves of Covid-19 as well as the potential for bilateral trade between Ireland and the UK to be on World Trade Organization terms from next year.  I agree with this assessment.  Infection rates have increased further and additional measures have been put in place for some counties.  Additionally, the Government has decided to base budget 2021 on the assumption of a disorderly end to the so-called transition period, given the high probability of it materialising.  It is worth pointing out that the council is supportive of the unprecedented budgetary response that has been implemented by the Government in response to this terrible disease.</p>  <p>  The council's view with regard to budget 2021 is that it should include a substantial multi-year stimulus so that targeted support measures are continued.  Given the uncertainty remaining around Covid-19 and the future trading relationship between the EU and UK, the council further recommends an appropriately sized contingency to help to manage these key risks.  Additionally, the council's view is that once recovery is established the public finances be brought back to a more sustainable trajectory.  I broadly concur with these views.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will prioritise a continued response to this crisis.  The overall strategy will be to provide further countercyclical support to the economy.  We will prioritise preserving and maintaining existing levels of service, make improvements where we can and where needed and target any additional supports to those sectors and workers who are most in need.  I am also conscious of the need to put the public finances on a sustainable path.  The Government will, in the first half of next year, set out a medium-term trajectory to restore balance to the public finances.</p></speech>

Something like a new deal needs to be developed in Ireland at this stage.  Will there be a substantially larger public investment programme?  It is important that we start to take the opportunity of a decline in private investment to accelerate.  Can we get projects moving quickly enough to take up that opportunity?</p>  <p>  I am also interested to hear the Minister's comments on some of the specific supports through activating and restructuring sectors, which need to take into account matters such as the challenge of climate change.  Can we design instruments that will accelerate structural change in order that we can be ready for this new normal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900033#HH00200"><p>On the scale of the stimulus and the role of capital spending, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has committed to &euro;9 billion of investment in capital projects next year.  To put that in context, the figure at the start of the previous D&aacute;il was between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  It is a huge increase on recent years.  Unlike in other years when, due to our inability to fund public services, capital investment had to be cut back, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, earlier this year committed to maintaining capital investment at approximately &euro;1 billion higher than it otherwise would have been, which is now a &euro;9 billion figure.  As for it going beyond that, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is now looking at that as part of his engagement with all the spending Departments.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point about retraining, we will be closely monitoring the take-up and use of all the different training posts and further education roles announced as part of the July jobs plan.  I expect them to play a big part in our efforts for 2021 and beyond.</p></speech>

It would be very timely to commit not only to higher levels of investment but to accelerating that change and developing tools that will lead enterprise to accelerate those needed investments and to position itself for the new normal that will emerge.  There is a need to look creatively at how investment can be accelerated and at how necessary change in the economy can be leveraged for the long term.</p></speech>

In April, it was predicted that GDP would crash by 10.5%, whereas the figures published today suggest instead that it will shrink by 2.5% only, a significant figure but one we can accommodate.  Worryingly, unemployment will be 2% higher than forecast at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.  With the prospect of a no-deal Brexit coming into view, as we all know, unprecedented action is very much needed.</p>  <p>  IFAC signed off on the Department's numbers today, endorsing them.  Clearly the Minister agrees with the council's earlier analysis that we will require a multi-annual stimulus approach to support our economy into the future.  Does he agree that support should involve an investment of &euro;10 billion, the quantum allocated to the investment that IFAC identified, and that it would be appropriately sized relative to what it advised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900033#HH00500"><p>There are two points on that.  I would be careful, as the Deputy acknowledged, about deriving a great deal of comfort from what has happened to national income growth because so much of the improved performance in national income has been driven by what has happened to our exports in a particular part of our economy.  The reality of where we are is contained in the Deputy's point about what has happened to unemployment this year, which has, unfortunately, been in line with our fears of what could happen.  While it is welcome that there has been a sharp decline in the number of those receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, it is still the case that there are far more people on it than we would ever want.</p>  <p>  We will have to make a decision on budget day about the scale of the stimulus.  As I indicated to Deputy Bruton, the figure is already at &euro;9 billion.  The only note of caution I would sound is that while we can commit to the principle of stimulus over a number of years, being able to forecast the level of stimulus that will be needed in 2022, for example, given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding us at the moment, would be a very demanding task.  That is a decision that may be taken at another point.</p></speech>

I note, however, that the Deputy raised three separate but related issues regarding important measures in the tax code that support caring for people in vulnerable circumstances.</p>  <p>  Regarding the suggestion to extend eligibility for the home carer tax credit to include single workers, this credit was introduced in Finance Act 2000 specifically in the context of a planned move to full individualisation of the income tax system to ensure a balance was maintained for married one-income families where one spouse works primarily in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons.  The home carer tax credit is, therefore, available only to jointly assessed couples in a marriage or civil partnership and not to single persons, as the issues the credit sought to address do not arise in their circumstances.  Instead, the single person child carer credit of &euro;1,650 and an increased rate band of &euro;4,000 are available to single parents with caring responsibilities for a dependent child who is under the age of 18 or, if over 18, is an incapacitated child who satisfies the incapacitated child tax credit criteria.</p>  <p>  As for the question of claiming tax relief on the cost of employing a care worker while also claiming the dependent relative or incapacitated child tax credit, there is no restriction on this and the tax relief is available at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax. </p>  <p>  I will outline further information in my follow-up response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900033#HH01300"><p>There is a considerable anomaly here.  If a single carer, such as a widow or widower or someone who is divorced or separated, cares for a sister or mother, the carer cannot avail of the credit.  Perhaps the person is doing it full time, or works eight hours part time for sanity or just to keep heat in the house.  He or she cannot avail of the home carer tax credit.  That is fundamentally unjust.  I understand why it was put in place in the first instance, because it was intended that one person would work outside the home and the other predominantly in the home, but that second person could have part-time work.  The Government is saying, therefore, that for two people who are jointly assessed, one can work outside the home, while the other can have part-time work and still claim that credit, whereas someone who is a lone carer, for whatever reason, cannot claim that credit and work outside the home.</p> <p>While I know the Minister has said he will not increase tax bands or credits, that is a serious anomaly in its own right.</p></speech>

I appreciate that in any tax credit such as this, that is targeted and that is looking to support those who are doing important work in our society and for their families and so on, anomalies can be generated by it at times and I will look at the issue the Deputy has raised.  I want to make the point that, for example, if we were to raise the dependant relative tax credit to &euro;3,300, it is estimated that the additional cost for that would be &euro;194 million.  That is not to seek to diminish the value of the work that is being done.  It is just to acknowledge the financial cost that would be involved in doing that.  I will consider the observations the Deputy has made around those anomalies but I have to be open with her on the fact that the options for me for changing any credits in the upcoming budget are limited.</p></speech>

In the context of more people working from home or doing blended working, this issue will arise more.  Also, some people need a few hours outside of the home for their mental health and sanity.  Those people would not be able to get the home carer tax credit.  As I said, it is fundamentally unjust.  I know the legislation was not put in place with that perspective in mind but as the Minister and I both know, sometimes unintended consequences happen and that is, perhaps at best, what happened here.  The Minister mentioned the dependant relative tax credit and the cost of same and I accept that but the Minister and I both know that family carers save the State huge amounts of money every year and that needs to be factored into any decision.  I thank the Minister for his acknowledgement that he will look at this.</p></speech>

I have looked to explain why the tax credit is at the level it is and I have noted what the financial cost would be in any such change.  As I have already said to the Deputy, I am acknowledging the financial cost involved in a change such as this.  In doing that, I am not looking to diminish the incalculable value of those who are caring for those in their families or communities who need care.  As I have said to the Deputy, in order genuinely to manage expectations around this issue in the approaching budget, the ability to make changes to tax credits or rates or to any personal tax measure that would be relevant to this House is limited in the context of this budget for all of the reasons Deputies know.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank has 88 branches in our State, it has more than 2,500 employees and it has a substantial presence in the Border region, particularly in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, with three branches in County Cavan and one in Monaghan.  It has been an integral part of Irish commercial life and it has been trading in our country for almost 200 years.  Any thought of the closure of this bank and its branch network would be devastating for so many communities and for the employees of the bank as well.</p></reply>

The Government has no formal role in such a review or in any commercial decisions that result as these are a matter for the board and management of the bank and its parent company, NatWest.  I understand that the process is ongoing and that no decisions have been made.  Therefore, I will not comment or speculate on possible outcomes as there is no basis for such speculation available to me and any comment I might make could be open to misinterpretation.  As the Deputy has just done, however, I want to acknowledge that news of this review is, of course, unsettling for all who could be affected by it, especially for the staff and the customers and communities who depend on this branch network.  I expect Ulster Bank to keep all its stakeholders, especially its staff and customers, fully informed about any developments in the review and to engage promptly with them in relation to any proposals or decisions that result from the review.</p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market has been an important dimension of how banking has been organised and supplied in Ireland over many years.  Ulster Bank is a significant employer and it has 88 branches across our country.  It is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market.  The bank will have to keep the Central Bank of Ireland fully informed and comply with its requirements in its decision making process.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that I have no role in any review undertaken by a commercial entity but I and my officials will carefully monitor any developments in this area.</p></speech>

They are large communities nowadays because a lot of branches were closed over the years due to rationalisation measures and there has been a loss of services to many communities.  Any further diminution in banking competition in this country would be concerning.  Ulster Bank is the third largest bank and we lack banking competition in this country.</p>  <p>  The Minister previously told me, in reply to a parliamentary question, that he would expect the bank to keep its customers and employees up-to-date with whatever it was planning or proposing.  I would also like the Minister to convey the concerns of communities and employees throughout the country on these suggestions and this narrative that have been in place for some time.  I am concerned and I know the Minister has no formal role but there is nothing to stop communication being made through the Central Bank or the Department on the importance of this bank to so many communities and employees.  God forbid the branches would close when one considers the small enterprises that have been affected by Covid-19 that are struggling to survive through the pandemic.  Where would they go to transfer to another bank if they lost their current banking arrangement?</p></speech>

We are talking about 2,500 jobs and 88 communities in which the bank is based and in many cases it is the only bank serving those communities.  We are also talking about the interests of many thousands of mortgage holders who will fear Ulster Bank being transferred into new hands and those new hands having claws in them in the form of vultures.  They will fear what will happen to their mortgages if they fall into arrears or if they have arrangements with the bank that expire and new arrangements have to be put in place.  The Minister has indicated that he would trust that Ulster Bank will keep stakeholders informed.  I do not trust Ulster Bank to do that.  We found out about this from a leak in the parent company.  The Government has to be poised for action here.  The question of nationalisation in order to defend jobs, mortgage holders and services will need to be put on the agenda and it will be part of the debate on this.</p></speech>

Deputy Brendan Smith raising this question has given me the opportunity to make clear my expectation on that communication.  As I did with the earlier question that was put to me, I want to acknowledge how valuable Ulster Bank is and will continue to be from an employment and a lending point of view within our country.  I am well aware of the value of the role it plays in the communities Deputy Brendan Smith is referring to and I will continue to monitor developments carefully in this area.</p> <p>I am available to Deputies who are particularly concerned about this matter for any further question or comment.</p></speech>

In my constituency, we have Ulster Bank branches in Ballyconnell, Cavan, Ballyjamesduff and Monaghan town.  Traditionally, Ulster Bank has very much been associated with the Border region and it has had a very successful business, by and large, for the most of 200 years in communities right throughout our country.  As the third largest bank in the country, we cannot afford to lose it.</p>  <p>  From speaking with employees and interaction with private individuals and people with small and medium enterprises, I know Ulster Bank's business is across all sectors of our economy.  From the perspective of employees, business and enterprise and so many communities, it is essential a clear message goes to NatWest that we want to see Ulster Bank retained in its current format with its 88 branches and more than 2,500 employees.</p>  <p>  There is concern among employees and I would like to know if the Minister has any indication if an announcement is imminent on NatWest's intentions.</p></speech>

The concern here is that a bank that has made much profit through the years has hit a bump in the road and lost &euro;276 million, according to its report for the first six months of this year, because of the Covid-19 crisis.  The bank is going to make a short-term decision to put profit above the needs of the workers, mortgage holders and communities.  That must not be allowed to happen.</p>  <p>  There has been some speculation that a bank in which the State has majority ownership, Permanent TSB, could potentially take over if there was an attempt to withdraw Ulster Bank from the market here.  This would effectively be a form of nationalisation, although I would like to see a form of nationalisation that would really prioritise the needs of the workers, the mortgage holders and the communities.  We will also be monitoring the position very carefully.</p></speech>

Does the Government intend to engage actively in the process or will the Minister just monitor this as everybody else will do?</p>  <p>  I know the Minister for Finance is not the shareholder and the bank is owned by a party in another jurisdiction.  Has the Minister any intention to reach out or engage with parties?  Is there any plan B?  We need competition and for staff employment to be retained.  We need that presence in communities, many of which are rural.  There are options to increase the presence of existing banks or, as we have seen, new players in the market.  Unfortunately, these new players do not seem to want a physical branch structure but nonetheless, there may be opportunities.  Does the Minister intend to engage directly with those involved?</p></speech>

I have already contacted the parent bank, NatWest, to ascertain the status of the alleged reports.  My contact with the bank has informed the answer I gave to Deputies this afternoon.  As the process develops within NatWest, I will of course raise issues and perspectives that I have in this regard.  I absolutely understand the concerns that employees will have at this point, not to mention the businesses that are depending on Ulster Bank for lending and investment.</p>  <p>  I have personal experience of the unsettling effect of an announcement like this for those who work for the bank.  I understand the concerns about their future.  I must emphasise, as Deputy Doherty acknowledged, that the State does not have a share in this bank.  The parent bank is located in the UK and Ulster Bank is part of its broader structure and company.  Notwithstanding those constraints, I will contact the parent bank on the matter.</p></speech>

Will the Minister outline the effect this will have on the capitalisation requirements of the banks and, subsequently, their ability to lend money at competitive rates?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900035#KK01000"><p>Payment breaks have provided substantial and rapid relief to allow homes and businesses to absorb the shock and impact of Covid-19.  The expiry of the guidelines do not prevent banks from engaging with customers who continue to experience difficulty beyond the deadline and all applicable consumer protection remains in place.  Borrowers who cannot return to full repayments following the conclusion of their payment break should engage with their lender as early as possible and the Central Bank expects lenders to take a consumer-focused approach at this worrying time.</p>  <p>  The longer term impact of Covid-19 on bank capital levels will take some time to materialise.  However, some increase in non-performing loans is to be expected.  It is nonetheless important to note the efforts undertaken by the Central Bank of Ireland and the EU institutions to ensure banks can absorb losses and continue to lend into the economy.  The Central Bank has reduced the countercyclical capital buffer from 1% to 0% and it estimates this will free approximately &euro;940 million of capital across the Irish retail banks to facilitate lending or help banks absorb losses.</p>  <p>  At an EU level, a number of support measures have already been put in place.  The European Central Bank announced that banks can temporarily operate below the capital conservation buffer and member states also passed a package of temporary measures designed to reduce the economic consequences of Covid-19 on the banking system and ensure that banks have sufficient capacity to lend.</p>  <p>  The matter raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is very important but measures have been taken to try to ensure banks have the ability to continue to lend across this very important time.  Due to measures taken in the past to deal with or reduce non-performing loans, our banks have funding on their balance sheet to deal with the matter raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

If the Minister had extended the payment break before 30 September for a further six months, would it have prevented the reclassification of these loans as non-performing loans under the rules?  As a consequence, this may have avoided the capitalisation problems outlined by the Minister while still having all the EU and other money provided.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister confirm if other EU countries extended the break for a further six months?  Did the Minister examine the reasons they did so?  I am interested to know what other countries in the EU extended these payment breaks.</p></speech>

As of yet I am not aware if other governments or regulators have decided to extend further the measures they have in place.  Comparing where we are versus other countries, those other countries have put in place very different arrangements.  Superficially they may in some ways look more attractive but they are more limited and, in many cases, they have not seen the breadth of impact seen with the measures we introduced in Ireland.</p> <p>Potential future capital consequences can be avoided on a bank-by-bank basis through engagement between customers and banks.  One of the most important ways the issue the Deputy refers to can be avoided is for such engagement to take place, restructured loans to be agreed upon and those restructured loans to be honoured.</p></speech>

As I understand, these loans are to be reclassified as non-performing loans.  When loans are classified as non-performing on a bank's balance sheet, the next temptation is to sell them off to vulture funds in tranches.  We know the consequences of that.  The Minister talks about the same conditions applying.  Everybody who has dealt with people in the hands of vulture funds knows the consequences of having a loan transferred to one.  Can the Minister confirm that the risk of such transfers is higher once loans become non-performing because borrowers have been made unemployed by the pandemic?</p>  <p>  I was contacted by someone who told me that their monthly repayment has increased quite considerably because their loan is non-performing due to unemployment.  This will have future consequences for them.  It will mean an extra cost of about &euro;10,000 over 20 years when compared to the effect of the previous arrangement, that is, the mortgage payment break.  That is the difference between the original six-month arrangement and what the Minister has allowed to happen.</p></speech>

That is not what the guidelines allow for.  In fact they allow for any extension to take place on the condition that it is announced and applied for before tomorrow.  That is where the Minister has failed to deal with this issue.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is completely right.  If this was done, banks would not have to hold additional capital and loans which cannot go back to full repayment of capital and interest would not be classified as non-performing.  Crucially, the SMEs and mortgage holders in question would not be given a negative rating by the credit register.  That rating will impact their terms of borrowing for the next several years.  That is the consequence of the Minister's unfortunate inaction.</p></speech>

As I pointed out to him earlier, payment breaks were made available in the first place because the Government took action.  This has been a huge help to so many families and businesses at a time when it was needed.  We have seen the number of people who need these payment breaks begin to decrease, quite considerably in the case of some banks.  Engagement between borrowers and lenders is the key to reducing the risk of loans becoming non-performing in the future, leading to the kind of vista to which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has referred.  I believe it will be possible for a restructured agreement to be put in place for many of the loans we are referring to, and I hope it will be possible for all of them.  This issue is now developing in many countries, which points to the need for this to be dealt with in a co-ordinated way at European level to avoid creating a further risk in trying to get countries and people back to work in the coming months and next year.</p></speech>

As he will be aware from his recent role in the Department, a whole-of-Government strategy for the development of the international financial services sector up to 2025 was launched in April 2019.  The strategy, known as Ireland for Finance, is structured around action measures grouped together under several pillars: operating environment, technology and innovation, talent and communications, and promotion.  There are also horizontal priorities - regionalisation, sustainable finance and workplace diversity -  which apply across all four areas.  The vision of this strategy is for Ireland to be a top-tier location of choice for specialist international financial services and to enhance and protect our future competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The employment strategy aims to see 50,000 people in direct employment in the sector by 2025.  According to enterprise agencies, approximately 47,000 people worked in international financial services at the end of 2019, which represented an increase of approximately 11,500 from 2015.  I am pleased to report that the Ireland for Finance strategy was included in the programme for Government.  We expect to bring an updated Ireland for Finance action plan 2020 to the Government for approval and publication in the next few weeks.  Stakeholders have been working on the action measures in this draft of the strategy.  The updated strategy was delayed because of the general election, as it includes policy measures which could only be taken by an incoming Government.  The Covid-19 pandemic has added further delay, but the updating of the strategy is now in its final stages.  I am also working on a finance plan for 2021.  We have sought and received representations from most of the stakeholders involved and we hope to complete the plan in December, for publication early in 2021.</p></reply>

This is an exciting portfolio and I wish him well in it.  A lot of the work depends on how much the Minister of State's senior Minister delegates to him, but I have no doubt that he will be very generous in that regard because I know how busy he is.  As the Minister of State mentioned, I was one of several Ministers with responsibility for the previous international financial services strategy, IFS2020.  A key commitment of that plan, which has been retained in the current Ireland for Finance strategy, was a focus on developing financial services jobs outside of Dublin.  From memory, approximately one third of our financial services jobs are located outside of Dublin.  They are not all back-office jobs.  Deputy Nash, who was here earlier, knows all about the M1 payments corridor, which proceeds north from here to Letterkenny in Deputy Doherty's constituency, which is a very important hub for insurance services.  Tralee in Kerry hosts Fintech services.  Kilkenny is another financial services hub.  Cork is obviously our second city for financial services and is doing incredibly well in that regard.</p>  <p>  The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 and it immediately presented opportunities for us.  Covid-19 also presents opportunities for the relocation of businesses and working from home.  This aligns with the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040.  Has the Minister of State met with the regional chambers of commerce in relation to beefing up action 7 of the relevant pillar of the strategy?  The regional chambers really do have the expertise when it comes to attracting businesses to their own areas.</p></speech>

As he will know, Avantcard is based in Carrick-on-Shannon.  It is doing tremendously on its own.  A massive facility and a skilled financial services workforce is available there.  We need to redouble efforts to land new financial services investment in Carrick-on-Shannon and at that site.</p></speech>

I have not yet met with any of the regional chambers but I will be happy to do so.  I thank the Deputies for publicly prompting me, especially in view of the fact that so many jobs in this industry are located in the regions.  Today I chaired a meeting with the industry advisory committee, which brings representatives of all the sectors in this area together with relevant senior public servants.  That joint group holds a quarterly meeting.  We discussed our plans for 2021.  As part of that conference I spoke by video link with representatives of State Street bank in Kilkenny.  I also spoke with representatives of Fexco, which is located in Kerry.  There is a big regional spread in this sector, with approximately one third of jobs located in the regions.  We want to develop that further.  People now want to migrate closer to home.  The industry is very alive to the fact that increased working from home is one of the outcomes of Covid-19.  I will take up those suggestions and I thank the Deputies.</p></speech>

It needs to be driven by the Minister of State in order to be successful.  It is also great to hear that he has committed to meeting with the chambers of commerce to help to develop the action on regional spread.  As it is written the action is quite broad, but it could be fleshed out for future iterations of the plan.  I would also add that the last progress report included a spotlight on the south east.</p> <p>That was a good thing to include in it.  Perhaps the next progress report could contain a similar spotlight on another part of the country.</p></speech>

I was specifically dealing with this area all day today.  The 2021 plan on which we are now working will feature strongly the issue to which the Deputies referred, especially in the context of the regions.  One of the issues at which we are looking is the impact of Covid-19.  Many people are working from home, accommodation is cheaper and, although there are major issues with broadband in large parts of the economy, it is quite surprising that there are so many good connections such that people can work successfully in many parts of the country.  It has been highlighted that this is not the case in certain areas.  This issue leads to bigger questions relating to whether everybody will be centred in Dublin.  One issue we must address is that of those who are working from home from abroad.  It is important that we get all those workers back to Ireland as soon as possible.</p></speech>

After a period of intensive technical and political discussions among member states, a revised proposal for a digital advertising tax was brought to ECOFIN in March 2019 but no agreement was reached there.  It was subsequently agreed that member states would focus on supporting the ongoing discussions at OECD level on addressing the tax challenges of digitalisation.</p>  <p>  If the OECD work is successful in reaching consensus, pillar 1 of that work should address the same concerns that a digital services tax was trying to address.  How pillar 1 is ultimately implemented will depend on the nature of the eventual agreement reached at the OECD.  The European Commission has indicated it will revisit the issue if agreement is reached at the OECD on the ongoing work.  In her recent state of the Union address, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, reiterated her support for reaching an international agreement on digital taxation, but highlighted that should an agreement not be made at the OECD, the EU will move forward with its own proposals next year.</p>  <p>  Separately, the issue of digital taxation or some form of digital levy has been discussed in the broader context of the EU identifying new EU resources to fund the EU budget.  To date, no proposal has been made in this area.</p>  <p>  I have consistently stated that unilateral digital taxes only serve to increase international trade tensions and undermine the trust required to achieve a lasting global agreement at the OECD.  Ireland is committed to finding a global consensus-based solution to issues that have arisen in the international tax framework as a result of increasing digitalisation.  I believe the OECD is the best forum at which to achieve this aim.  The OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, inclusive framework is due to publish an update on its ongoing work to address tax and digitalisation in October.  We will engage positively in that work.</p></speech>

I understand EU officials have stated they will seek to press ahead with proposals for a digital tax on technology companies at the end of the year if the wider collection of 137 or more countries fails to get a multilateral deal from the OECD.  My understanding is that the US withdrew from OECD talks earlier in the year.  It may have rejoined, but my understanding is that it is out for the moment.  That may change in November.  In any event, it highlights the difficulties of securing a deal or agreement at OECD level.  Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD tax policy centre, stated that Ireland will suffer more than most countries if those efforts to secure a global digital tax agreement fail, triggering an international trade or tax war.  I agree with the Minister that it would be destructive and politically and economically detrimental were those events to unfold, but we must be as proactive as possible in trying to prevent that.  The Minister wishes for an accord at OECD level, as do all Members.  He warned recently that the State could lose up to &euro;2 billion of corporate tax revenue under those proposals or approximately 20% of our corporate tax rate.  Tax sovereignty is an important issue.  It underpins our approach to the Apple tax matter and many issues that are key to the health of our economy.  What is our plan B?</p></speech>

In last year's budget and much of the work that led up to it, I made the point that our corporate tax revenues, which have increased in recent years, will fall.  The reason for that fall is highlighted in the question asked by the Deputy.  If agreement is not reached, the risks related to double taxation will pose a direct challenge to the revenue we currently collect.  If agreement is reached, it is very likely that there will also be challenges and risks to the revenue we are currently collecting.  There will be effects on the tax we collect in the future, and on corporate tax revenue in particular, if agreement is reached or if it is not reached.  I believe the OECD is the best place to try to get agreement for the key reason that if agreement is reached inside the OECD, at least it minimises the risk of a tax issue flowing into trade difficulty.  Trade difficulty in this area would be an even bigger challenge for Ireland.</p></speech>

President von der Leyen, to whom the Minister alluded, indicated in the context of the EU Covid budget and recovery package that member states, whether the so-called "frugal four" or otherwise, must repay by 2058 any borrowing they receive under the &euro;750 billion once-off recovery fund which is to be borrowed on the markets by the Commission and then distributed to member states in grants and loans.  My understanding is that the Commission has asked member states to put proposals in place in that regard.  As the Minister is aware, the EU has the power to impose pan-EU levies that would be used for repayments.  In other words, the &euro;750 billion rescue package would be underpinned by pan-EU fundraising or revenue-raising initiatives which would include a digital tax and a carbon levy with a view to introduction by 1 January 2023, which is not very far away.  Ireland would have to sign up to that.  I understand it would be possible to use a veto as unanimous agreement by member states would be required.  How stands Ireland on that matter?  I realise it is challenging issue, but it is an important one.</p></speech>

That agreement brings consequences, but agreement not being reached also brings consequences.  The Deputy is correct in his summary of the matter.  Several proposals are being put forward within the EU to generate what are called "own resources".  They are, in essence, taxes the revenue from which goes back to the European Union.  There are several such taxes that I believe we will be able to support, such as some of the proposals in favour of a plastics tax, but there are other proposals relating to digital taxation and the whole addition of a carbon and border adjustment tax that raise very big issues for any exporting country within the European Union, not to mention the EU as an exporter in many important parts of the global economy.  That said, the only way we can deal with these issues is to try to engage with them constructively and see whether some kind of agreement can be reached in these areas that gets the balance right between our own interests in this area and the broader European needs which the Deputy described.  We will engage on this constructively.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.</p></speech>

That will have a significant knock-on benefit in terms of housing pressure and demand in Dublin.  Properties with home office potential are being snapped up around the country.  Seamus Carthy, a neighbour of mine in County Roscommon, has 43 potential buyers on a waiting list for homes with garden space.  However, direction and support from the Government are needed if this is going to happen.</p></reply>

There is also a commitment to the development of a "national remote working strategy", and to that end a remote working strategy group has been established.  A number of issues are being considered as relevant to these commitments, the results of which will be made public in due course.</p>  <p>  In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, I would note that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of the employer's business.</p>  <p>  From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors, including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons, including the nature of his or her work and the nature of his or her home environment.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments of up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.  I am advised that Revenue has published detailed guidance on these arrangements in its tax and duty manual, which may be found on the Revenue website.</p></speech>

There is not much equity for families who are spending hours sitting in traffic or queuing to try and get childcare places.  We have a situation where we have the schools, the childcare facilities and streets that have not seen a child kick a ball on them for a generation across rural communities and there is an opportunity here to achieve a balance where pressure is being taken off the infrastructure in Dublin and life is being brought back into rural communities.  There needs to be a concerted positive effort in terms of the tax code to support either people to work remotely or blended working.</p></speech>

How could I not be aware of so many more people now working from home?  Of course, they are making the choice regarding where that home will be located.  There are supports available within the tax code for this already.  Of course, in the context of the budget, this is something that we will re-examine.</p>  <p>  I would make the point though that we need balance in all of this.  With our continued efforts to look after the health of our country, I believe we need to find a safe way over time in which we can encourage those who want to work in offices to be able to go back into their offices where they were located and, as the Deputy has said, for those who either do not want to do it or whose employer says they do not need to do it, a way in which working from home can be sustainable.  This is an issue of much debate among families as they look at what 2021 could bring, but we need to get the balance right.</p></speech>

There is a reference attributed to him in the Sunday newspapers where he is privately concerned about the amount of empty office space across Dublin and elsewhere as employees are encouraged to work from home.  I would be concerned that this could be a vehicle used to undermine the objective of blended working and remote working to shore up the pension funds - pension funds that could convert this office space into housing accommodation to meet the needs of people in the city of Dublin.</p>  <p>  There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to support remote and blending working but it needs leadership from Government.  We should set an objective within Government to have one third of our employees working from home or a remote location within the next five years.</p></speech>

Previously, I asked the Minister about our financial services strategy and making sure that we are focusing on jobs outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Picking up on Deputy Naughten's point, we are looking at a long-term impact on the city centre where people may not be returning to work, at least five days a week, and a permanent reduction in footfall.  There is an opportunity for existing developments which may have been for one purpose, that is, office space, to become something else and therefore support the economy locally here in Dublin city centre which continues to be damaged because of the more permanent changes that people are making in their working lives.</p></speech>

I am publicly concerned about it.  Looking at where we are now across September and October, a time in which many new employees are starting work in new employers throughout the country, for example, for them not to have the opportunity to be able to go into an office to sit with peers and learn from them and for them not to have the opportunity of the normal ways of developing skills and developing their careers is something that I am concerned about.  I am also concerned about what it could mean if we prolong a reality of many people working from home and not being able to access the kind of skill development and knowledge that happens when they are sitting near and working with other colleagues.</p>  <p>  However, that is not as inconsistent with the Deputy's view as he might infer.  I am simply saying that we have to get the balance right.  What is beneficial about where we are now is we have relearned that certain kinds of work can be done in more places than we thought possible.  Of course, as the Deputy has said, where possible, there may well be opportunities for that to happen outside of our cities.  However, this is not a Dublin-specific comment.  It is a comment about the well-being and the future development of workers, particularly those who are in the early phase of their careers because the development of their skills and well-being is at the heart of how our economy can grow in the future.</p></speech>

There were two questions grouped.  I am glad that the Minister clarified that.  It is important that we try to get the balance right and that we look at blended employment.</p>  <p>  I can confirm for the Minister that there is demand, but it is only a drip at present.  That could be progressed along the lines Deputy Murphy spoke about.  We need to look, and we are looking as part of the pre-budget submission that I forwarded to the Ministers, at developing an initiative similar to the bike-to-work scheme to encourage people to work from home or adapt their home to meet the demand and facilitate the national broadband plan as it is being delivered throughout the country.  In the context of the budget, I would hope that the Minister can come forward with some constructive proposals to support this drip that is happening so that we have a greater balance of people moving out to rural communities while at the same time providing much-needed accommodation in this city.</p></speech>

That is the kind of balance we need to try to move to, where we have offices being used in a way that is different from how they were used in the past but have people in them who are learning, who are healthy and who are safe.</p>  <p>  The most important priority is to try to keep people safe and try to reduce the spread of this disease.  That is why our public health efforts are so important.  As we move through our battle with this disease, I hope we will come up with ways in which it will be safe for large employers to have more of their staff in the office more of the time than is the case at present.  That is so important from a skills, productivity and well-being point of view.  However, we can genuinely do what the Deputy is outlining at the same time as trying to make progress on what I am referring to.</p></speech>

In future, the products that will be available to families and businesses may be safer in many ways, in their regulation and where the funding comes from to enable the products, but as we know too well, financial risk is always there for countries, families and businesses.  The more we can encourage literacy in the area, the better we can manage risk in the future.</p></speech>

No. 318 of 2020): Motion [Private Members]</major-heading>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900039#OO00700"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 318 of 2020) be and are hereby annulled. </blockquote>  <p>On behalf of all the fishing organisations Sinn F&eacute;in has spoken to, we support a penalty points system being put in place - it is essential - but the system must be fair and just.  It is important that I outline the history of how we got here this evening.  Previous statutory instruments introduced by Ministers in the Department with responsibility for the marine were ruled illegal by the High Court on a number of occasions.  The issue went to the Supreme Court and the challenges by the fishermen were upheld.</p><p>Subsequently, SI 89 of 2018 was put in place by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, who signed it.  In May 2018 the D&aacute;il came to debate an annulment motion, just like this one, and for the first time in the history of the State, the D&aacute;il voted to annul a statutory instrument.  It was immensely significant, it had never happened before and has not happened since.</p><p>I will quote from some of the debate.  The proposer of the motion, who deserves great credit, was the former Donegal Deputy, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who had been Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on fisheries and marine.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	The statutory instrument states that the determination panel and the appeals officer if such is the case would determine on the balance of probabilities.  We do not accept this principle of a lesser burden of proof.  It is grossly unfair to the individual to lower the burden of proof.  We will be proposing a statutory instrument we have prepared under which, in both instances, the case must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt in line with common law principles.   </blockquote>  <p>Hear, hear.  He continued: </p> <blockquote> 	To put it in simple language, the proposed structure under this statutory instrument would be similar to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na detecting an infringement, being allowed to select the judges to adjudicate on the case and finally handing down the eventual judgment. </blockquote>  <p>I will now quote the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, during the same debate on 23 May 2018:</p> <blockquote> 	We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector.  We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again.  The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor.  Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore. </blockquote>  <p>Later, he said:</p> <blockquote> 	The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof.  The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued.  The role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments. </blockquote>  <p>We can see the concerns expressed by the Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons.  Deputy Dara Calleary, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, expressed his concerns about the &quot;burden of proof, the rights of appeal, penalty points capacity and some sort of realistic appeals timeframe&quot;.  He spoke of a sense of alienation and of how it was getting deeper.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	Many of these communities are dying on their feet.  The way this issue has been handled is adding to the sense that marine issues are not a priority, not just for the Government but for the central government system full stop.  If we deal with this collectively as an Oireachtas and deal with it in a progressive way working together, we can start addressing these issues and lay some sort of pathway to addressing that alienation. </blockquote>  <p>I endorse those remarks 100%. </p><p>The motion was passed, making it a historic motion.</p> <p>In fairness to Pat the Cope Gallagher, not only did he have this statutory instrument annulled in the days that followed, he produced a document - I have read through it - containing amendments to the instrument.  I have it with me.  He did that in full consultation with the fishing industry.  His amendments would have solved the problem, but nothing was done and time drifted on.</p> <p> We then come to 28 August 2020, when the Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, signed off on SI 318 of 2020, which was almost identical to the 2018 statutory instrument.  The core objections were not addressed.  I found out about it on a Friday evening.  At first, I thought it had to have been a misunderstanding because there was no way the Taoiseach would have done that without consulting the fishing industry.  However, I found out the next day that he actually had done it.  I still thought that he might have been misled and that he had not understood the full implications of what had been done.</p> <p> My party put this annulment motion on the Order Paper, but we held back because we talked to the fishing industry, which was of the belief that, if it engaged with the new Minister, Deputy McConalogue, he would surely see the need to make Pat the Cope Gallagher's amendments to the statutory instrument.  By the way, I emailed those amendments to the Minister, but I have still not received a substantive response.</p> <p> The producer organisations then met the Minister, which believed that they could turn the situation around.  They were bitterly disappointed with that meeting.  Subsequently, they sent a letter to the Minister on 18 September in which they identified four issues.  First, the burden of proof is based on the balance of probabilities.  As we all know, a prosecution must be beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold, except for fishermen.  Second, the points remain on a licence even in the event of the person or persons being exonerated in court.  Third, the points attached to a licence if the tonnage is sold on multiplies on the next person's licence.  Fourth, people can only appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  No substantive response has been received to that letter to the Minister.</p> <p> We are debating this matter because, incredibly, the Taoiseach has signed a statutory instrument that is in clear defiance of everything Fianna F&aacute;il as a party did in 2018.  He actually voted for the historic motion on 29 May 2019.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing.  In particular, I appeal to the Deputies of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I could have read quote after quote after quote.  I would invite anyone to read the Official Report.  I would not challenge a word of what a whole ream of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies said in that debate.  Everything they said was spot on.  It was powerful stuff, yet here they are as a party.  How will they stand over this?  It is profoundly unjust.</p> <p> While dealing with Brexit, I spoke to a senior fisheries spokesperson in recent days who stated that this was the greatest threat to our industry since the foundation of the State.  We have seen the submissions the industry has made to the previous Oireachtas committee.  The industry is deeply concerned.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and re-engage.  I hope that its Members will not vote this motion down tomorrow, but even if they do, there is still a chance to amend the statutory instrument.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation has already made it clear publicly that it will challenge this instrument in the courts again, but it should not have to.  We have already spent a fortune in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine going to the High Court and Supreme Court defending the indefensible.  Will it do so again?  Will this matter go to the courts again?  We can avoid that.  I am not being party political.  Let us use the template of Pat the Cope Gallagher's amendments.  What is the Attorney General's view on them?  Has the Minister sought his view on whether they are permissible?  I have no doubt that they are.  Has there been proper engagement on this matter?</p> <p> How the situation has been handled by the Taoiseach is a scandal.  I am shocked that a solution has not been found.  We did not want this debate.  We would never have tabled this motion for Private Members' business had the fishing industry not told us to go ahead because it was not getting anywhere itself.</p></speech>

They work in the most dangerous and, sometimes, the harshest of environments.  The one thing they should not face is a points system that is not fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  This motion is about fair regulations, the type of regulation promised in the programme for Government, which committed to implementing a fair EU points system.  Nothing about SI 318 is fair, however.  In no other EU member state does a system exist like the penalty points system in use in this State where the burden of proof is based on the balance of probabilities, points remain on a fishing licence even if someone has won the case in court, and the appeals system is not a true appeals system because the number of penalty points cannot be changed no matter the mitigating circumstances.</p>  <p>  There have been many attempts to deal with this issue and one would assume that we as Oireachtas Members would be hearing in detail about how the High Court and Supreme Court judgments had been addressed and implemented in any new regulation.  There are differences between the statutory instrument signed and then annulled in 2018 and this statutory instrument, but they are slight and, as such, the instrument leaves fishermen's livelihoods in peril.  I have strong reservations about the constitutionality of this regulation.  Were it not for the scrutiny of fishermen and Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, we would not have had the opportunity to try to stop this sinking ship.</p>  <p>  If the statutory instrument is not annulled, there will be more court challenges as sure as night follows day.  If left unamended, it will damage coastal communities across the island, including those in my county of Wexford, from Rosslare to Kilmore to Duncannon.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and treat the fishermen in a fair and equitable manner.  I ask that all Deputies support this motion on annulling SI 318 in the name of fair procedures and justice for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900040#PP00400"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, for tabling this important motion.</p>  <p>  The commercial fishing industry provides an essential source of income for many people in communities along the coast of Mayo and elsewhere across the island.  We have always asked that rules that are introduced be proportional and reflect the realities on the ground, but EU regulations are too often designed with member states with far larger and more industrialised fishing industries in mind.  The blame in this case lies closer to home, though, with successive Governments mishandling the introduction of a system that works and is fair.  This is despite the best efforts of fishermen throughout the country to engage constructively with the process.</p>  <p>  The statutory instrument that Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to annul was designed by Fine Gael and opposed by Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition and is now supported by Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  As such, it is no surprise that the electorate is turning away from Fianna F&aacute;il, given that it changes its position so easily that it is impossible to know what one is voting for.</p>  <p>  There are a number of serious issues with this statutory instrument, the most glaring being the fact that fishermen will not have the right to appeal to the High Court after a situation is dealt with by the determination panel and the appeals officer.  This issue has been going on for so long that it has given enough time for a detailed review to be conducted by the EU in terms of modernising and simplifying the existing system.  The EU has accepted that there are insufficient data to enforce the system accurately.  The European Court of Auditors and a resolution by the European Parliament have all shown that the fisheries control system "has deficiencies and is overall not fit for purpose."</p>  <p>  Despite the EU's recognition of the systemic weaknesses in the approach, the Government believes it is appropriate to design the system in such as way as to remove any legal recourse for fishermen, even when their livelihoods are taken away.</p></speech>

I join him in highlighting that it should not be necessary.  Putting forward a motion on this issue was the last thing we wanted to have to do.  The fishing representative organisations understood that a lot of the heavy lifting had been done in this regard and that the argument was won.  However, we have seen a complete about-turn on it from Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  Nobody will be surprised by that.  Indeed, the fishing communities that I represent are neither surprised nor disappointed by it because they know that Fianna F&aacute;il says one thing but will do another.</p>  <p>  This motion is intended to be constructive.  It was devised following consultation with the representative bodies - presumably the same representative bodies that Fianna Fail consulted before drafting the recent amendments.  As somebody who did not grow up on the coast, I have been struck by the way in which people in the community work.  The fishing community is a very solid, close-knit one but the people who are part of it have long come to expect disappointment from successive governments.  They expect to be neglected and to be the last to have their concerns addressed.  They know they are very low down on the list of priorities.  What is happening here this evening is proof of that.</p>  <p>  Fishermen in Skerries and Balbriggan do not have the largest fleets and they do not have a massive harbour but they are members of the fishing community  and, as such, we have consulted them on this issue.  They are not opposed to a penalty points system.  They only seek a system that is fair and an appeals process that is fit for purpose.  The fact that this is too much to ask of the Government says a lot to people in our fishing communities, their families and the people like me who represent them.  I call on the Minister in my constituency, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to do what he said he would do and to be as good as the word he gave as recently as two years ago.  I hope he and his colleagues in government will support this motion and stand up for fishing communities.</p></speech>

It is rather strange that we are discussing it again in 2020.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn outlined, the statutory instrument referred to in the motion was annulled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in May 2018, in accordance with the proposal put forward by former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher.  Many speakers have made the point that fishers are not opposed to the introduction of penalty points but they want whatever system is introduced to be fair.</p>  <p>  The point is often made in discussions in this House that a bad law is an unjust law.  In this instance, families' livelihoods could be taken away from them on the basis of some absolutely ridiculous provisions.  Specifically, the statutory instrument provides for the imposition of sanctions that would remove the livelihood of fishers for alleged infringements of which they may be found guilty on the balance of probability.  Any such sanctions would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt in any other circumstance.  One could not make it up.  The Government is proposing that people should lose their livelihood on the basis of a probability or belief that they have done something wrong.</p>  <p>  I was surprised to note that my fellow Cork East representative and then Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, voted against the proposal to annul the statutory instrument in May 2018.  He and other Deputies in the area represent fishermen from Youghal, Ballycotton, Gyleen, Roches Point and all the way to Cobh.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and address the need for fairness for fishermen and their families.  We need to support this motion, annul the statutory instrument and get things done right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="19:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900041#QQ00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.  I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn and his party colleagues for affording me the opportunity to discuss this important motion.  The EU's fisheries control regulation of 2009 established a community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  One of the important measures introduced by the control regulation is a points system for serious infringement of the rules of the CFP, which is applicable to the licenceholders of fishing vessels and, separately, to the masters of those vessels.  This part of the control framework was introduced to address concerns about the lack of a level playing field across the EU in fisheries control and the treatment of vessels from different member states.  The rules are designed to ensure that fishing in EU waters is sustainable and that the long-term interests of fishers in coastal communities are protected by protecting this precious resource.  The points system is intended to complement the normal sanctioning system in member states for serious infringements and promote a level playing field on control within the EU.  These systems were due to be implemented in 2012.</p><p>Ireland is responsible for the control of all fishing activity by Irish and foreign fishing vessels in our 200-mile zone.  The points to be assigned under the new statutory instrument will be applied to both Irish and foreign fishing vessel licenceholders who are held responsible for serious infringements committed within the zone.  The idea of a points system is that it should be graduated and proportionate, with only repeated serious infringements resulting in the most serious penalties.  Such penalties are, of course, completely avoidable through compliance with rules that are well established.</p><p>The new regulations have been a requirement of EU law since 2012.  All other coastal member states have implemented the points system and Ireland is in breach of its EU legal obligations as a result of its failure to implement them up to now.  As a result, the European Commission, under infringement<font color="#FF0000"> </font>proceedings, issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland in July 2020 and gave us three months to respond.  The implementation of the regulations was already overdue but its urgency has been amplified by the issuing of the reasoned opinion.  In addition, the Commission has formally suspended payment to Ireland of EU co-funding payments under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, operational programme.  This suspension will continue indefinitely until Ireland puts in place the necessary legislation and administrative systems to comply with the EU points system.  Unless the regulatory lacuna is addressed immediately, we face an increasing financial cost to the taxpayers of this country.  EU funds for control and enforcement available to Ireland under the EMFF amount to &euro;37.2 million over the course of the programme.  As of September 2020, &euro;13.5 million in payments due had been withheld.  A further recoupment claim due to be submitted later in 2020 will result in the amounts withheld rising to &euro;24.5 million.  As I indicated, a total of &euro;37.2 million in funding is at risk for the full period of the programme.</p><p>SI 318 of 2020 presents an opportunity for us to fulfil our obligations under EU law while providing a fair and balanced points system that will ensure the stability of our fishing industry.  The statutory instrument takes on board in full the findings of the related 2017 Supreme Court judgment that the procedures followed are fair and in accordance with best practices.  It separates the detection and determination functions by putting in place an independent determination panel as well as an independent appeals officer, all of whom are legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General.  Both the determination panel and the appeals officer must grant the licenceholder an oral hearing if he or she so wishes.</p><p>Under the new statutory instrument, the accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the rules of the CFP will lead to the suspension of a sea-fishing boat licence for a period from two months to one year.  In extreme cases, persistent serious infringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of the licence.  It is important to note that the EU control regulation provides that if the licenceholder does not commit another serious infringement within three years from the date of the last such infringement, all points on the licence shall be deleted.  The statutory instrument includes several but not all of the amendments sought as a result of consultations with the industry.  The new arrangements are the minimum required to meet the tests of proportionality, effectiveness and dissuasiveness required under EU law.  The adoption of the new instrument is also in line with the related commitment in the programme for Government.</p><p>Everybody in this House wants to see a strong and vibrant fishing industry that supports employment in fishing fleet, fish processing and ancillary activities in our coastal communities.  SI 318 of 2020 is necessary to protect law-abiding operators, who make up the vast majority of those in the industry, and to preserve this precious and valuable resource for all Irish fishermen and for future generations.  I am confident that the new enhanced points system provided for under the instrument will play a vital role in delivering on the CFP objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements and contributing to a level playing field in fisheries control across member states.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The points system is necessary as an effective measure against the small number of operators, either foreign or Irish, who break the rules.  It is necessary to protect law-abiding operators and preserve fish stocks.  I urge the House to protect the future of our fishing industry by supporting the Government in this matter.</p></speech>

I represent west Cork, home to Castletownbere port, which is Ireland's premier whitefish port.  Out the outset, it is important for me to say that I am not happy with elements of this statutory instrument.  It would, however, be misleading for me to say that I felt there was a realistic possibility of a replacement statutory instrument at this stage.</p>  <p>  I will take this opportunity in the Chamber to outline some of the problems and issues I have with this statutory instrument.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, will listen to my concerns, the concerns of the fishing industry and the concerns of the Opposition, which have been pretty well made.  They represent concerns made to them by the fishing industry.  This is an opportunity because there is a host of massive challenges facing Ireland's fishing industry, an industry that sustains so many coastal communities.  These challenges include Brexit, which is coming down the tracks at a rate of knots.  This will impact Ireland with European vessels coming into Irish waters.  There are so many challenges and I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to listen to my concerns and those of the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  I will send more detailed submissions to the Minister on the issues I have with this statutory instrument but I take this opportunity to highlight three or four elements.  Number one is the need for sufficient separation between the policing authority and the determination panel.  The fact that the determination panel is selected by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is insufficient separation.  This needs to be addressed.  The determination panel could be selected by the Attorney General or by the Minister.</p>  <p>  I now turn to my second issue.  I have great difficulty, as has the industry, with the fact that where a court of law deems an infringement has not taken place, or where the court of law acquits the licenceholder, the penalty points remain with the licence or the vessel.  This is very hard for me and for the industry to understand and could be reversed.</p>  <p>  My third concern is that where fishing capacity is transferred, the penalty points would transfer with each section of capacity transferred.  Again, this is not consistent with what happens in other jurisdictions in Europe.  This needs to be re-examined.  It devalues the vessel, the licence and the capacity.  It does not happen in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Finally, my point number four, which has been raised by other Deputies today, is the burden of proof.  The burden of proof is heavily in favour of the policing authority and I do not feel this is the way the statutory instrument should be drafted.  The points are to be assigned to a licence on the balance of probability as opposed to a higher burden of proof, such as beyond reasonable doubt.  This needs to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  Those are the four main issues, but there are other issues.  I appreciate that at my invitation the Minister of State met and consulted with members of the producing organisations but there needs to be more consultation.  We need to keep that communication avenue open with the producing organisations and other representatives of the fishing industry.  As I said earlier, I will not vote against the Government on this motion, and it would be misleading of me to send a message to the fishing industry that somehow there will be a replacement statutory instrument that better represents their concerns.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to take my concerns and those of the Opposition on board, to open up the dialogue and communication, and try to come up with a better proposal.  The challenges facing our fishing industry are humongous.  We need strength it and we need to be able to liaise with it and listen to its concerns.</p></speech>

It was the first of a number of island trips I hope to make in the coming months to learn more about island life and, as a person from Roscommon which is very much inland, to understand adequately the life islanders live and the places they call home so I can represent them adequately.  I had several meetings on that visit and I engaged with a number of sectors, all while socially distanced.  One group in particular remains with me.  It was three fishermen, two gentlemen who have fished for most of their lives, and one around my age in his 20s who faces an uncertain future but who still wants a future as a fisherman.  I would not imagine that this is much to ask for.  I was struck by two things about the fishermen.  One is how sick and tired they are of the way they are treated, and the very obvious sense that they just cannot continue with things the way they are.  There was also the immediate sense that for them fishing is not just a job but that it is has been passed on to them and is something they love, although very clearly becoming more and more difficult for them to continue.  Then, here comes a most bizarre penalty point system, where if one does the crime one gets the points, but if found to be innocent the points remain the same.  For many fishermen this will be the last straw.  The fishermen I met told me of 54 fishing boats in the 1980s, but now just six full-time fishermen remain.  The Government refuses to support them and their families while super-trawlers can travel the west coast from now until April to fish every species going, when our own fishermen are being driven out of their livelihoods and fined with penalty points.</p></speech>

While I understand that the Minister was not sitting in that seat when this statutory instrument was signed at the end of August I feel that he and his party have not thought this through.  The issues faced here need to be addressed urgently.</p>  <p>  Back in May 2018 the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, sat on this side of the House and supported a similar motion put forward by his Fianna F&aacute;il colleague, former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, calling for the annulment of the same system of penalty points.  The Minister's own words are on the record of the House expressing the exact same concerns that we in Sinn F&eacute;in look to address today.  That system of penalty points had been contested in the highest court in this land and was won.  It was from this win that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Private Member's motion to annul the system.  That motion, along with an amendment put forward by Deputy Martin Kenny, was accepted by Fianna F&aacute;il and voted on by the vast majority of this House at that time.  Now, here we are two years later debating the same thing.</p>  <p>  Most of the fishing community along with the main representative organisations in the industry agree with the need to introduce a penalty point system.  The issue, however, is the burden of proof that is required.  Again, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, addressed this matter in May 2018.  It is worrying that there can be a criminal prosecution on the balance of probabilities.  If a decision is challenged in the courts and is won, the penalty points are kept on the licence.  This is just complete madness.  Imagine the public outrage this would cause if this was a driver's licence.  The idea of a person being innocent until proven guilty is gone in this instance, and will cause real worry and concern in the House.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that this would be quite a simple motion to get behind.  If the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and his party colleagues were able to support a similar motion put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2018, then there is no reason the Government cannot support this one.  I advise the Minister to err on the side of caution.</p></speech>

I wonder what kind of scrutiny is undertaken by the Government coalition parties when they introduce regulations such as this.  In July we had a situation where, under Covid-19 legislation, a change in the law was brought about to facilitate vulture funds, which was spoken against by all Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies in the Chamber at the time, and yet they voted the other way.  Now we have a situation where the regulations opposed quite strongly by all Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are now being proposed by them.  I wonder is there any communication between the various Government parties before items like this are brought before the House.</p>  <p>  Recently I met some inshore fishermen and we discussed the overall grim economic situation in which they find themselves.  Despite Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, adequate supports have not been put in place for these fishermen.</p> <p>The answer from the Government is to introduce regulations such as these on evidence that would not be sufficient for a warrant to search a person's house.</p> <p> This is part of an overall trend by the Executive seeking out powers that are inappropriate, ramming them through or placing them within statutory instruments so that legislators cannot effectively scrutinise them.  We have seen this in terms of legislation that has gone through these Houses.  Rushed law makes for bad law.  The concerns of the fishing community are being ignored here.  This scheme has been pushed through in a lazy way that will inevitably cause problems.  I remember dealing with the courts in Kerry and time after time cases on the Circuit Court lists were put back because of rushed legislation that had been challenged in the courts, causing delays.  That is probably going to happen again with this.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il's track record in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine since coming to power has been an absolute shambles.  When it comes to Fianna F&aacute;il, U-turns, talking out of both sides of the mouth and breaking promises should not really surprise us but its U-turn on the penalty points scheme really takes the biscuit.  When we were between the second and third Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of this Government the Taoiseach sneaked in this statutory instrument.  This scheme is seriously flawed.  Indeed, the serious legal flaws in this scheme meant that it was scrapped by the previous D&aacute;il, including Fianna F&aacute;il.  This same scheme was struck down in 2016 by the Supreme Court, as others have already said.</p>  <p>  What the fishermen in my constituency from Clogherhead right the way up to Carlingford want is fairness.  That is all they are asking for - fairness.  They are not opposed to a penalty point scheme but it must be fair.  The main issue raised by fishermen locally is that there is no right to appeal under this statutory instrument, except to the High Court on a point of law.  The scheme proposes to enforce sanctions on the balance of probabilities which is too low a standard of proof given that the result of sanctions could be the loss of livelihoods for our fishermen.  Penalty points will also remain on a licence even if a fisherman is exonerated in court.  Those points will remain attached to the licence quota which will have knock-on effects where a quota or part of a quota is sold on.  If sanctions of this type were imposed on motorists or any other group in society, we would not stand for it.  Why are unfair and unjust rules for fishermen considered to be okay by this Government?  It is difficult to understand how the three Government parties can stand over such a flawed system.  Fishermen are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens by successive governments and this scheme is further evidence that this attitude lives on in the new coalition.  SI 318 must be annulled.</p></speech>

Third time lucky, I hope.  I welcome this motion which allows us to reverse a poor decision which was made without consultation with the fishing sector.  Ireland is required to enact some form of a points system and I do not think anyone disputes that.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has resulted in a process that lacks common sense and puts a further burden on small fishing communities and families.</p>  <p>  In late August the Taoiseach, then acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, signed this new system into law.  The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation and other representative organisations were dismayed at this development because there was no consultation with industry and many found out about it via an official email a few days later.  The Government&rsquo;s scheme flies in the face of due process.  There are very limited rights to appeal, decisions can be made on the balance of probabilities and even if an appeal is successful, penalty points still remain on a licence.  This is poor law-making that erodes confidence in systems that are supposed to be about ensuring better practices. </p>  <p>  The people of west Cork were further confused by the fact that a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach, who had previously condemned this statutory instrument, was the one who signed it into law.  While Fianna F&aacute;il Members will point to differences between new and previous regulations, these are largely technical in nature.  They concern the extension of time periods and alterations to oral hearings but the core issues remain.  After the announcement, commitments were made by the Taoiseach and the new Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to meet with representatives for the sector but this looks and feels like tokenism.  There is little point in meeting to discuss concerns after signing this into law.  Where was the proactive engagement?  </p>  <p>  Our coastal and island communities deserve better.  Fishermen and women should be central to creating a viable and fair process.  This points system is another example of the disconnect between the Department and the sector.  The Government&rsquo;s tie-up scheme was deeply unpopular with the industry too as it did not address its needs.  It was clear when the scheme was announced that it was not fit for purpose.  Representatives of fishing communities contacted me highlighting that it was not sufficient to cover their costs.  Fishing is an expensive livelihood in terms of overheads like maintenance costs, insurance and safety fees.  Their concerns were reflected in reports that very few took up the scheme.  The only way successful and progressive policies can be developed is in genuine partnership with the communities and businesses affected.  I am particularly concerned for smaller fishing groups which, despite practising the most sustainable fishing, are often overlooked.  At a time when we are all making changes to the way we do business, the Department should be open to more proactive measures to help an industry that is vital to so many coastal and island communities.</p>  <p>  Another issue of concern is the lack of accountability in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the organisation which will administers the points system.  We are a waiting a review of that body and until that is released, it seems ill-judged to give it additional powers.  Again, we all acknowledge the need for a points system.  Not only is it necessary under EU regulations, but it is an important tool to prevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  These practices put the livelihoods of honest fishermen and women at risk and need to be tackled but there are fairer and better ways than this.  We need a system that makes sense, is fair and transparent, one that island communities can buy into and can have faith in.  This motion gives us a chance to hit the reset button.  </p>  <p>  This discussion also allows us to focus on the fishing sector, which is too often relegated behind other industries in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need to support sustainable, small-scale fishing and to do that, we must immediately address the lack of basic infrastructure.  Too many small piers dotted around our coastline and islands are falling into disrepair and lack basic amenities like slipways.  They urgently need investment to preserve the livelihoods of local fishing families and the practice of truly sustainable fishing.  I refer to the kind of fishing that has existed in rural and coastal Ireland for generations which is more environmentally friendly and which will keep families living on islands and in other coastal and rural areas.  Funding for piers comes in limited form from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Housing, Planning and Local Government through to local authorities.  Having been a member of the coastal management committee on Cork County Council, I have first-hand knowledge of under-investment in piers.  At the very first meeting I had to point out that everyone fighting for the same minuscule amount of funding was counterproductive and that we should instead focus on getting more much-needed funding for piers.  I have called for small piers to be made a priority for funding streams for marine infrastructure to support sustainable fishing communities.  The fishing sector has been severely impacted by the pandemic.  Since March fishing communities have been calling for greater support due to the significant drop in markets.  I have sought a fisheries task force to help the sector and communities through measures such as tailored social protection mechanisms and consumer campaigns.  I am making that call again today.  </p>  <p>  This motion highlights serious issues with the penalty points system and allows us to correct a mistake.  I urge all Deputies, especially those who represent coastal and island communities, to support it.</p></speech>

I am unsure what has changed since the High Court and the Supreme Court struck down this statutory instrument, or what has changed since Fianna F&aacute;il and its coastal representatives voted this down in 2018 in a declaration of support for our fishing communities.  Let me say, from this side, that we support this motion and believe the statutory instrument is a blunt instrument which is discriminatory and unjustifiable in its application.  If it was wrong in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it is wrong now.</p>  <p>  While fishing communities throughout the country are right to be outraged and to feel betrayed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach over this, that does not mean we are opposed to the regulation of the fishing industry or that we oppose quotas for saving the world's oceans from environmental collapse.  I am in favour of a quota system and I am well aware that fishing and the way the quota systems work go well beyond what science and nature tell us is unsustainable, and are leading to the ruination and devastation of ocean life.  I am also aware that we constantly set quotas above what science tells us is sustainable.</p>  <p>  The truth is the Common Fisheries Policy, to which this statutory instrument is attached, is not protecting fish stocks or the greater biodiversity of our oceans.  There is and there has been a crisis in our fishing communities and a crisis in our oceans, and both are a by-product of the greater crisis on this planet.  When people say the EU fisheries policy has decimated our fishing communities, they are often derided by economists, who tell us to look at the statistics that tell us we have more people employed, we have a greater tonnage of fish catch and we have exported more wealth generated by the fishing industry than we did before we entered the European Union.  The reality is that, behind those statistics, the type of employment has changed for the worse, the ability of fishing communities to survive and thrive has changed for the worse and the sustainability of fishing fleets and methods have changed for the worse.</p>  <p>  The crisis in fishing is a symptom of a global crisis in our environment, a crisis driven by the same reason and the same basis: the production for profit, regardless of the impact on nature or on human beings.  The interests of large agri-food business corporations drive the unsustainable extraction of the earth's wealth and resources, while the interests of the giant oil and gas corporations drive the heating of the globe and the acidification of our oceans. </p>  <p>  The European Union policy fits into this matrix despite its claims to the contrary.  This debate is not whether people support a system of regulation to protect fish stocks or do not.  It is about whether they stand with the small fishing communities or whether they want to pretend that a system of penalty points and unaccountable authority will save the worlds oceans.  It will not.  It will, in fact, accelerate the trend of driving smaller fishing communities out of business and stacking the cards in favour of the mega-trawlers and the giant agri-food industry.  We support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900044#TT00200"><p>Council Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009 requires that actions be taken to ensure compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Clearly, enforcement action is necessitated by our membership of the EU and SI 318 sets out that enforcement action for Ireland.  The enforcement is the imposition of penalty points for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy.  There are three issues I would like to raise.  First, should the implementation of the penalty points system be done by way of primary legislation?  It is setting up new competent authorities such as the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the determination panel to deal with the system, and it is delegating serious powers to these bodies.</p>  <p>  Second, SI 318 provides that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority will set up a determination panel to investigate infringements and allot penalty points when it determines that a serious infringement has occurred.  This determination panel will determine whether a serious infringement has occurred or not on the balance of probabilities.  This is a civil standard of the burden of proof whereas, given the penalty being imposed is in the nature of that imposed for a criminal offence, the burden for the determination panel should at least be somewhere between a balance of probabilities test and the criminal standard of "beyond reasonable doubt".</p>  <p>  The third issue is that the determination panel can, in effect, impose what would be considered a major sanction.  Other legislation allowing for such sanctions in the case of removal of a licence from those such as auctioneers is primary legislation, and a major sanction such as the removal of a licence must be confirmed by the High Court.  If a fishing boat is about to acquire the maximum number of points such that it cannot fish, and taking into account that the sanction follows the ship, this should also require the confirmation of the High Court.  There should be nothing less than primary legislation to ensure the rights of fishermen.</p>  <p>  I remind the House that fishing is an indigenous coastal and rural activity that employs in excess of 12,000 people in areas otherwise starved of employment, other than in tourism.  Rural harbours such as at Killybegs, Howth, Kilmore, the Hook and Duncannon are all in areas were local fishermen contribute greatly to the tourist attractions, and they are areas which have the finest seafood restaurants this country has to offer.  It is not by accident that Wexford and many coastal counties have their fair share of award-winning seafood restaurants; it is down to the hard labour of both the fishing and hospitality sectors.</p>  <p>  There is good reason that I express these concerns, given this comes from personal experience of a penalty points system being introduced in another sector.  In that case also, the imposition of penalty points served as enforcement for serious infringements, something that was welcomed within the sector as it was felt it would serve to implement a standard across the sector for all to abide by.  The penalty points regime in that case would, if applied, have seen 12 points close a business for a period of 30 days.  That points system had credibility until three points were applied for the non-wearing of a name tag by the receptionist in a business.  The case went all the way to the High Court, where it was settled, but that saw the withdrawal of the penalty points provision in that sector.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that, as the fishing sector is a rather small cohort, it is never personal between enforcers and fishermen, which is another good reason for requiring that the removal of a licence be affirmed by the High Court.  In reality, all that has been requested is fair procedure and due process in the appropriate manner.  In this case, that is above "reasonable doubt" and closer to "beyond a reasonable doubt".  I ask that the House would consider it in that light.  The people who engage in fishing activity do so in all weathers and in often horrendous conditions to put food on our tables.  They need nourishment, not punishment.  We must support and not discourage them, and unfairness is never a source of encouragement. </p></speech>

It is high time the Minister and his Department came up with a proper plan to deal with this.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 has been in place for more than ten years and the Department should have dealt with it properly a long time ago.  None of the fishing organisations, big or small, is happy with the way this is written, so it looks like it will be challenged and will most likely fail again.  It is a waste of everybody's time.</p>  <p>  In my own constituency, there is a fisheries harbour and four offshore islands which are involved in fishing.  When the joint Oireachtas committee published its report on sustainable, rural, coastal and island communities, which was launched on Inis O&iacute;rr in January 2014, the islanders were at first encouraged by the recommendations about fishing on the islands.  They set up a representative group of island fishermen from Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork, the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO.</p>  <p>  I am sorry.  I will have to finish.

There is a centuries-old legal dictum applying in our Irish common law system, overlaid by the requirements for the administration of justice under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann 1937, that no person can be a judge in his or her own case.</p> <p>Accordingly, it is not the duly appointed judges of Ireland who prosecute people for alleged infringements of the law but the statutory, separate and independent Director of Public Prosecutions, who presents all relevant and admissible evidence before our courts.  Our judges, sometimes sitting with juries, listen to the admissible evidence and then decide whether an accused person committed the alleged offence.  The test governing the guilt or innocence of an accused person is that the prosecutor must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, following which, in the event of a conviction, the accused person is sentenced in accordance with the law, generally by way of a fine or the imposition of a prison sentence.</p> <p> The EU penalty points legislation dating from 2008 was introduced into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, an Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, supported by Fine Gael on 26 August 2020.  This instrument seeks to implement in Irish law the provisions of the 2008 EU Council regulation, which is legislation that was initially put forward and designed to deal with the problems of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Once the competent authority has decided an infringement is serious, the SFPA must proceed to impose a penalty on the unfortunate owner of the offending fishing boat.  In Ireland, the possible penalties to be imposed by the SFPA in the event of repeat offences being committed include the confiscation of a sea fishing boat licence.</p> <p> Although we in Ireland might think that imposing a penalty as enormously damaging and punishing as the confiscation of a sea fishing boat licence should only be considered on the basis of proof and when a case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, our Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Government has sadly chosen to grant the power to destroy a fishing boat owner's livelihood and the livelihoods of crew and support staff through the confiscation of the fishing licence on the basis of an offence having been proved to have been committed on the balance of probability.  I can think of no other area of our lives in which such an extraordinarily severe penalty can be imposed on the basis of a probability and in circumstances in which the detective, the prosecution barrister, the expert witness, the judge and jury, and the person imposing the sentence are one and the same.  This is shocking beyond belief in our democracy.</p> <p> In May 2018, the D&aacute;il voted down a Fianna F&aacute;il motion to have the statutory instrument annulled.  This motion was tabled by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, Pat the Cope Gallagher.  I therefore ask every Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy why, within two months of entering government, the Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach, who had been acting as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for only seven days, did a dramatic U-turn and signed a statutory instrument which the party voted against entering law when in opposition?  The chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue, criticised the move the Taoiseach made during his short term as acting Minister holding the agriculture, food and the marine brief.  The system signed into law by the Taoiseach on 28 August by statutory instrument does not allow for the right of appeal except through a court of law and penalties can remain on a licence should a case be thrown out.</p></speech>

Mr. Murphy said that two members of his organisation challenged this legislation in the High Court and won.  He said that the then Minister, Deputy Creed, tried again to introduce this flawed legislation with little change in 2019.</p>  <p>  In west Cork, fishing groups were promised a meeting with the Taoiseach by one of his own backbenchers.  Of course, there was no meeting.  Yet again, we saw empty promises made by a Government which was seemingly trying once again to criminalise fishermen and fisherwomen.  When this meeting with the Taoiseach was promised to take place I assumed and read that changes would be made to the statutory instrument.  It was only after attending the AGM of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation that I found out this meeting had not materialised.  In my view, the fishermen of west Cork were hoodwinked and that the plan was to hope that we would all keep our mouths shut, take our eye off the ball and turn our backs on our fishermen.  Tonight's motion, if passed, will not allow this to happen.  </p>  <p>  All Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies who represent coastal communities and who claim to represent the fishermen who fight the high seas and who have faced a mammoth task day in and day out with little or no support for decades, whether they claim to support those in the bigger trawlers or the inshore fishermen, should not support further destruction of fishermen's livelihoods by backing the party lines.  I urge them to stand by their fishermen whether from west Cork or any other part of Ireland.  If those Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies toe the party line tonight and turn their backs on these fishermen and fisherwomen and their families, it will not be forgotten for decades to come.</p></speech>

There is 7,500 km of coastline in Ireland.  Ireland's total package of agreed fish quota for 2020 is 195,000 tonnes.  This is worth an estimated &euro;275 million to the Irish industry.  The fishing industry supports 16,000 jobs including 9,000 directly and 7,000 indirectly.</p>  <p>  It was very interesting to note this week that Michel Barnier is very concerned about Ireland's position after Brexit.  The EU's chief negotiator on Brexit said "Without a doubt, Ireland is the Member State most affected by Brexit."  He also said "the UK has not shown any willingness to seek compromises on fisheries."  Ireland needs agreement on the average 34% of Irish landings which are taken from UK waters.  This is the voice of the EU but, in what is a box-ticking exercise, the Taoiseach has been adamant that a penalty points system which will cripple our fishing industry is to be introduced through a statutory instrument.  My job as a politician is to question why a points system would be forced on our fishermen when they are struggling.  The appeals process under this system does not remove the penalty points even if they are not warranted.  In conclusion, there must be room for a proper appeals system.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a 200-mile fishing zone.  This must be protected as it is a very valuable resource for our country.  The Common Fisheries Policy for the period 2021 to 2027 states that small-scale coastal fishery regions will receive more beneficial treatment.  Surely this is all about Ireland.</p></speech>

I will support its motion because there is no question but that this is absolutely ridiculous.  It is like putting the cart before the horse.  If the system involved people being brought to court and being fined or given penalty points at that stage, that would be fine.  This is not the case under this system.  The Taoiseach has signed a statutory instrument and, if fishermen are held up on the high seas and get penalty points, no matter what they do and no matter what court they go to, those penalty points will not be removed.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is from Donegal and he understands this perhaps better than any of us.  Two or three years ago his party opposed this measure.  Pat the Cope Gallagher vehemently opposed it.  We all supported him when he left the Chair to make the case for the fishermen.  I will make the case for the fishermen along the coast of Kerry from Dingle to Cahersiveen, Renard, Kenmare and Sneem.  They have a lonely and difficult job.  When they fight and overcome everything else, the weather may overcome them.  It is a seriously hard job.  We do not have gold, oil or diamonds in this country but we have fish and we should be entitled to fish fairly and to have fair laws applied.</p>  <p>  We are all Irishmen here.  I cannot understand why the last Minister and Government tried to bring this in.  Deputy Michael Collins, Martin Ferris and I met the Minister, Deputy Creed, and laid out to him that we were not going to take what he was proposing.  Why has the Taoiseach done this?  To whom are we beholden?  Is Europe putting on pressure?  Will the Minister tell us what is going on because there is no reason Irishmen should get penalty points and be penalised without the chance to fight their case in a court of law?  It is very wrong.  </p>  <p>  I call on Deputy Griffin and the Minister, Deputy Foley, who claim credit for everything in our county but the weather these days, to come out and do something about this and to stop it before it goes to a vote.  If they vote with the Government they will blow the fishermen out of it.  Will the Government cop on before it is too late and see that what it is doing is wrong?  It is unfair and it is not democratic.</p></speech>

I am from east Clare.  There is a distinct divide when it comes to fishing.  Not much sea fishing goes on in east Clare.  What little of it is left it is all along west Clare.</p>  <p>  There is a great imbalance in the fishing industry and among most of the people the Minister represents, whether farmers or fishermen.  It is chiefly about their inability to take on a system.  There are big players in the agrifood business.  For one reason or another, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine often gives way to them.  Then there are numerous small producers, whether fishermen or farmers, who go out and produce an amazing product but they do not get the reward for it.  Sometimes they believe that they are being penalised and that the system is against them.  The idea of taking a judicial review is not something they can consider.  They do not have access to the High Court, although the big players do.  The weak suffer what they must and the strong do what they can.  I believe that is very much what happens in the Department.  I am not saying it is the fault of the Minister, but it is the way it is.</p>  <p>  I will wait and listen but I want to know how the penalty points system that the Minister has introduced differs so substantially from the penalty points system that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party had annulled.  There may be differences and I am willing to listen to them.  I hope the difference is not around an ability to take judicial review proceedings in the same way that it was for small publicans.  If they were shut down for a day, they were to take a judicial review.  That is simply not realistic.  People need fairness.  People need to be able to produce a product that they have produced for generations in an ecologically sustainable and environmental way, as inshore fishermen and small farmers do in Ireland.  They need to get a fair price.  Instead of being put to the pin of their collars by regulations of the Department, they need to be supported and assisted.</p></speech>

I support the motion.  It is embarrassing to be here and to listen to the argument from Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who have supported the bringing in by the Taoiseach of the statutory instrument on 28 August.  It seems little different from the previous one that was annulled by the Supreme Court and before that by the High Court in another situation.  It is embarrassing because we need leadership.  We need a change of direction from Covid-19.  We need to realise that we have to support our rural communities and support sustainable development in every sense of the term.  Fishermen are an integral part of the food chain.  I wish we were holding a discussion on how to support them.  They take the view they are isolated, and I can absolutely see why.</p>  <p>  I represent Galway West with my colleagues.  We have the Aran Islands, Inishbofin and a long coast.  I can tell the Minister that the sense of alienation being referred to is palpable in respect of the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  I am all for sustainability.  I am not for overfishing.  I cannot say it better than Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said earlier.  We do not have policies that are sustainable.  On top of that, we bring in a punitive system that the Minister referred to in his speech as being proportionate, dissuasive and effective.  It is none of those things.</p>  <p>  I wonder at what stage sense will prevail.  At what stage will this Chamber listen and, as a result of listening to sensible points being put forward by such an array of speakers, do something about it?  Let us get rid of this statutory instrument.  Let us learn from the Supreme Court and the High Court.  Most of all, let us learn from the fishermen who are telling us this is not possible, fair, just or proportionate.</p>  <p>  The four major points have been mentioned already.  These include the burden of proof, the points remaining despite exoneration in the court, the multiplying of the points if the quotas are assigned, and the restriction of access to the courts under the appeals system except on a point of law.  How can that be justified?</p>  <p>  When I look at it, I reckon what has happened is that the Government has got to the point where it can no longer say to the EU that Ireland has failed to comply with what it was supposed to have done since 2009, or with a little leeway since 2012.  Here we are eight years later.  The co-funding has stopped.  It is rising by millions although I cannot remember the precise amount,  I did not get a copy of the Minister's speech.  The Minister mentioned the money that has been stopped and that is rising.  The Government has got itself into a pickle again because it needs the money from the EU and it needs to be seen to do something, but in reality it is not doing anything.  Worse than that, it is dispiriting for the fishermen listening to this debate to realise the complete absence of leadership.  A little would go far with them.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in again for bringing the motion.</p></speech>

It is certainly doing what it is designed to do, which is basically to put Fianna F&aacute;il in the spotlight given what the party and the Taoiseach have actually done.  There has been much speculation of what his motivation was and so on.  Unfortunately, I believe his motivation was partly to protect the Minister.  If the Taoiseach introduced the measure, it would not come down on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and he would not have to do it when he came to the Department.  The Minister can now wash his hands of it and say it was not he who did it and so it has to stay.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever in the history of the State a Government law was rejected in 2018 on this penalty points issue.  The rejection was put forward by the Minister and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  Now, we see that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has brought it forward and implemented it.  It is interesting because I was speaking to several fishermen today on this.  They genuinely could not figure out how this could happen.  They asked how could Fianna F&aacute;il say one thing and do something else.  I pointed out there was an election in between.  Fianna F&aacute;il is now in government.  Those in Fianna F&aacute;il will say anything in opposition and when they go into government they will do the exact opposite.  It has really brought it home to these fishermen that this is actually what happens.  I hope it will bring it home to many people that this is what is happening here.  The Minister can say whatever he wants in opposition, and when he goes into government, he can then do whatever he wants.  He can do the exact opposite and no one bats an eyelid.</p>  <p>  The Government will pass this through the House because it has the numbers.  This is despite the Minister's party colleague acting as if he were in opposition while in government and saying how terrible this is and how much it will impact on the poor fishermen in west Cork.  Yet he will vote with the Minister to ensure it is implemented.  That is the sad reality of it.</p>  <p>  Many problems have been laid out in respect of the penalty points.  They are the same problems that arose in 2018 when the previous regime was rejected and before that in turn when the courts struck down the measures.  They include the issue of the burden of proof, the assignment of the quota and how the penalty points will pass on, even if a boat is sold and the tonnage is split up among four different boats.  The penalty points will go with them as well.  That is a real problem.  This is hampering the system.  The fact that there is no appeals system or a restricted appeals system is a problem as well.  That causes ongoing problems for fishermen.</p>  <p>  Article 90 of the EU control regulations states that the competent authority of the member state is required to determine the gravity of the infringement in question, taking into account criteria such as the nature of the damage, its value, the economic situation of the offender and the extent of the infringement.  Where is the economic situation of the offender taken into account with these penalty points?  It is certainly nowhere I can see.  That is the crux of the problem and that is why fishermen are so opposed to it.</p>  <p>  Many fishermen do not believe they can ever get a fair hearing from the Minister, the Government or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Department and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, are part of the problem as well.  There is no sense among the fishing community that they will get a fair hearing from the Department or the SFPA.  That is the crux of the problem when it comes down to it.  We will have ongoing problems dealing with fishing control and regulation.  We are seeing ongoing problems because the fishermen do not have any faith in the bodies.  The Minister will argue that it is always this way in fishing and that fishermen do not want it this way, but that is not the reality of the situation.  The reality of the situation is that if fishermen believed that these bodies could work on their behalf and that they could have a frank and open discussion, then the Minister would go a long way towards making the system work.  Unfortunately, the debate this evening will highlight the situation, but the Government will use its numbers to ensure that the penalty points stay and fishermen are going to have to live under that system in future.</p> <p>That is what will happen and fishermen will have to live under that system in the future too.</p></speech>

I apologise to Deputy Mac Lochlainn and a few of his colleagues who spoke at the start of the debate for not being able to be present for their contributions.  I heard it while I was in transit but I would like to have been here in person, although the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, was.  I thank everybody for the many contributions on the motion.  Many Deputies took the time to take part in the debate and to give us the benefit of their views, and it has been a worthwhile debate in that regard.</p>  <p>  This is an important issue that my party took seriously when on the Opposition benches.  That is why I, as the then Opposition spokesperson for agriculture, food and the marine, alongside the then Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, who was our spokesperson on fisheries, tabled a motion in the House in respect of the penalty points statutory instrument introduced in 2018, seeking amendments and making a clear request, for which we got the support of the House, to have those amendments considered.  The amendments were considered in that period of two years and legal advice sought on how the SI might be amended in a way that would take on board the fishing sector's concerns and, at the same time, leave us compliant with our obligation for a control authority in the Common Fisheries Policy to have a system of policing our seas and ensuring that the Common Fisheries Policy was being implemented and overseen.</p>  <p>  The SI, which was signed into law by the Taoiseach at the end of August, took on board two of those amendments, in respect of the need for a right to an oral hearing with the determination panel and the appeals officer and of the opportunity for additional time for making submissions and for seeking those appeals.  The other amendments that were proposed, having been legally considered, were determined not to be possible to accommodate in the SI while keeping us compliant with our obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and implementing the regulation, which had been outstanding since 2012.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's engagement with producer organisations and his input to me over the past period, as well as the many other Deputies who have spoken to me about the matter.  I also acknowledge the meeting I had with producer organisations where we discussed this in detail and where I offered them the opportunity to come forward with further submissions to me that they wished me to consider if they believed that an argument could be made that our obligations could be complied with and the requests accommodated.  That door is still open.  Our obligation is to ensure we implement and follow legal advice on the statutory instruments we bring forward and I will outline some of the key considerations that have informed the content of the statutory instrument, which was brought forward at the end of August.</p>  <p>  I know that everyone in the House wants there to be a strong and vibrant fishing industry that supports employment in our fishing fleet, fish processing and ancillary activities in our coastal communities.  My Government colleagues and I, although we are here discussing this issue, are all very aware of the important moment this is for the fishing sector in respect of Brexit and ensuring the best outcome and that the sector is protected in that regard.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, outlined earlier, the conservation of fishing resources is in everyone's interests and is vital for the future of the Irish fishing industry.  An effective regulation implementing the EU points system is necessary to protect the vast law-abiding majority of industry to preserve the precious and valuable resource in our waters, for our fishermen and future generations.</p>  <p>  The delay of more than eight years in implementing a points system needs to be addressed, particularly given that the European Commission has commenced formal infringement proceedings for non-implementation of the points system with potentially very significant fines that Ireland may have to pay as a result.  The Commission has also warned that up to &euro;37 million in EU funding for the fishing sector may have to be suspended indefinitely until Ireland complies with the requirements of EU law and implements a points system.  One of the main issues of contention in respect of the application of points has been the possibility of points being assigned outside of our courts system.  The 2017 Supreme Court judgment found in favour of the State's position that it is permissible to have a stand-alone system separate to a prosecution through the courts and that it is permissible to provide for a stand-alone system pursuant to a statutory instrument.  The judgment is clear on this as the court understands that criminal prosecutions could take at least two years, making the points for licenceholders ineffective in many cases because points are to be applied from the date of detection and lapse three years from that date.</p>  <p>  It has also been suggested that the licenceholder should have a right to a full rehearing of the case before the High Court.  The legal advice I have is clear that under the Constitution, the High Court has "full original jurisdiction" and can hear all matters of law brought before it.  The legal advice is that it would be highly anomalous, if not unprecedented, to provide such a full High Court rehearing of a matter first governed by the procedures set down in the 2020 SI.  In addition, it would delay the application of points, which would run against the timeline set down in the EU regulation that points apply for three years, with a commencement date of the date of detection.  To that extent it would hinder the effective implementation of this EU law and would not meet Ireland's obligations to implement these EU provisions.  The High Court retains a supervisory and review capacity that provides for an appeal on a point of law to the High Court, which is entirely in keeping with statutory review and appeal procedures of this nature.  Accordingly, the legal advice is that while the High Court retains the constitutional authority to enjoy full original jurisdiction over any legal proceedings, this authority has been circumscribed by the specific appeals mechanisms set down in primary and secondary legislation, which overwhelmingly limits just High Court appeals to reviews on a point of law.</p>  <p>  The issue of points following capacity was raised.  Where points have been built up on a licence in respect of serious infringements and a further serious infringement would result in a suspension of the licence, it is essential that the points are managed so as to dissuade further serious infringements.  The SI provides that the points cannot be negated through being subdivided by the licenceholder and distributed in reduced numbers among different fishing vessels.  A proposal from industry that would allow points to be subdivided by the subdivision of capacity among fishing vessels, so that each vessel would hold a smaller number of points, was examined but was not accepted as it was deemed that it would undermine the effectiveness of the system and not meet the objective of the EU regulation.</p>  <p>  The issue of the standard of proof to be used by the determination panel and the appeals officer was also raised.  The legal standard "beyond a reasonable doubt" is almost entirely confined to criminal trials and is not applicable to proceedings of a civil nature, where the standard used is the "balance of probabilities".  This is the standard used for the points system and is an appropriate legal standard.</p>  <p>  The issue of points for licenceholders being removed where the master or owner is found not guilty in criminal proceedings in respect of the infringement was also debated.  This proposal would involve both systems being interlinked and they would not stand alone from each other.  There are separate systems involving separate standards of proof between the points and a criminal prosecution.  It would lead to the confusion and conflation of evidence and render elements inadmissible.  In addition, the legal advice is clear that points under EU regulation are intended as additional to a criminal prosecution.  Accordingly, it could not be argued that Ireland has both criminal and points systems, as required under EU regulation, if we operated the system in a manner whereby the criminal proceedings completely eclipsed the points system.</p>  <p>  Deputies also raised the issue of infringements and the points to be assigned in that regard.  An annex of the EU implementing regulation sets down the details of the infringements and the points to be assigned.  Furthermore, the EU regulations on this matter are very prescriptive for licenceholders, leaving little room for further negotiation.  Fixed at EU level, for example, are the list of serious infringements, the number of points to be assigned for each such infringement, the periods of suspension and disqualification, the deletion of points after three years and the deletion of points in certain other circumstances.  The issues being raised by industry representatives were previously raised on a number or occasions, including with current and former Deputies.  All such proposals were carefully examined and any that were considered acceptable from a compliance and legal perspective were accepted and incorporated into 2020 SI.  As I outlined, these relate primarily to an unqualified commitment to an oral hearing, should the licenceholder request one, and an extension of certain timescales, such as for a licenceholder to make written submissions to the determination panel and appeals officer.</p> <p>If the House were to vote to annul SI 318 of 2020, this would leave a significant vacuum in the law in this area and impact how Ireland would respond to the EU Commission in respect of the infringement proceedings taken against Ireland and the withholding of EU funds under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  This would be acting in a way that would show irresponsible indifference to the consequences, not only for the fishing industry, but also for the public purse and for Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a member of the European Union.</p> <p> I have clearly outlined the process that has taken place in examining the proposals and amendments suggested in 2018.  I have outlined those that have been taken on board and the reasons the others were not taken on board.  This is the best and most balance statutory instrument that can be had that ensures we are compliant with our obligations under EU regulations to apply a penalty points system.</p></speech>

The Minister claimed there is "irresponsible indifference" coming from Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who I commend for bringing forward this motion to the House.  The Minister's party colleague drafted the alternative statutory instrument two years ago and brought a motion forward to this House to annul what was nearly an identical statutory instrument, which also penalised fishermen in the Minister's constituency and further afield.  That was the first time ever for a statutory instrument to be struck down, yet today the Minister claims that it is "irresponsible indifference".</p>  <p>  The reality is this is a kick in the teeth to fishermen across the coast of this State, many of whom are in our county of Donegal.  These same fishermen who the Minister wants to impose this regime of penalty points upon see their livelihoods being stolen from them by an overburdensome suite of regulations.  They understand, particularly in the inshore sector, the difficulties in not having adequate quotas and they see how super trawlers trawl through the fish off our coasts.  These European super trawlers are allowed to plough through the pots of these fishermen, yet when the Naval Service inspectors go on board the super trawlers, they are given hours of warning.  They catch thousands of fish, only to dump them again because they are a few millimetres too small.  These fishermen understand the need for preservation and conservation but they do not understand the fact that the Minister has brought in and stands over this statutory instrument, which is ridiculous.</p></speech>

The reality is this Government is doing exactly the same as the last Government did.  It is ignoring rural and coastal communities and it is destroying them.  People often wonder what fishermen stand for and when ordinary workers from all over the country look at fishermen they see people who risk everything to go out and try to survive.</p>  <p>  This statutory instrument says that this Government is once again going to back the big shot as opposed to the small coastal communities and fishermen who are struggling to survive.  Somewhere in the Department or elsewhere, it has been decided that the small fishermen need to be pushed out and that they are not sustainable.  This is another element in making that happen.  The Government will not give them quotas, it will not give them a chance and it has pushed them into the ground.  This statutory instrument will mean their vessels can be boarded and fishermen can receive penalty points with no recourse whatsoever.  The points are there whether the fishermen win or lose the case.  It is completely arbitrary and wrong.</p>  <p>  When he was here, former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher made a strong point of that and in fairness to him he fought that corner.  It is deplorable that his colleague from the same constituency is doing the exact opposite.  I am incensed at how the Minister has come to this position that he thinks it is OK to do this to fishermen in his constituency and the length and breadth of all the coastal communities around Ireland.  It is completely wrong and the Minister knows that.</p>  <p>  Somewhere or other, this policy has been put in place by people who are faceless and who do not come into this Chamber and those people need to be stood up to.  If the Minister is going to make a mark as a Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, he needs to make that stand.  He needs to stand up to those people who stand for something that is not really what we are about but that is about something different, namely looking after vested interests.  It is time the vested interests were set aside and the ordinary people were given a chance.  The recognition and reference of that will be if the Minister does the right thing by the coastal communities and the small fishermen around the country.  The first thing the Minister needs to do is make sure this statutory instrument is set aside because it is wrong and the Minister knows it.</p></speech>

I will give the Minister genuine advice across the floor.  He urgently needs to get a grip of the people who run the marine section in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In all of my eighteen and a half years in politics, I have never come across such wall of distrust between those who a Department are supposed to represent and the Department itself.  I have spoken to fishermen and fisherwomen up and down the coast since I took on the role of Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for fisheries and the marine.</p>  <p>  In every single sector, including inshore fisheries, which the Minister knows well, whitefish fisheries, pelagic fisheries and offshore fisheries, they have a huge distrust of those who run the marine section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They had to take them to court twice and they were vindicated.  They went to the highest court in the land.  These people in the Department spent a huge amount of taxpayers' money and they lost again and again.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a motion, led by former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, which represented a huge moment because a statutory instrument was voted down for the first time in the history of the State.  I read over every single speech that was made, line for line, when we put this annulment motion on the Order Paper and I read them again today.  If the Minister reads back what he said and what every single Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson said that night in comparison with what he has said tonight, he will see that it is like two different people were speaking.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  I cannot convey to the Minister how angry these fishing representatives are, many of whom have supported Fianna F&aacute;il through thick and thin over the years.  They said to me that we should hold back on this annulment motion, that they would get a meeting with the new Minister because he is from Donegal and that he will understand more than anybody the need to address this issue.  They said the Minister would engage with former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher on the amendments he brought forward to the previous statutory instrument.  Those amendments would have solved the problem, addressed the concerns of the fishing industry and built trust at last between those who put their lives at risk to earn a living all around our coast and those who run this Department.  It would have been a big and important moment but here we are again tonight.</p>  <p>  The Minister's speech reads almost identically to what the former Minister, Deputy Creed, said two years ago.  He gave a deeply alarmist speech, lecturing those across the Chamber and talking about the financial cost of the amendments.  What about the cost of going to the Supreme Court or the costs for the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, which will be forced to take a legal case again, which it may well win?  This should not be necessary.</p>  <p>  One of the comments made by the former Minister, Deputy Calleary, was that we need a Minister of State for the marine.  That is what he said in 2018 and he referred to former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher and his track record.  The Minister needs somebody who will get a grip of this Department.  The Minister himself will be overwhelmed with all of his immense responsibilities in agriculture.  Yet again, the marine section of the Department will be allowed to run riot on its own with no Minister or Minister of State to hold it to account.  It will have warned the Minister of all sorts of unintended consequences and told him about the views of Attorneys General and of legal views.  It will bamboozle him with all of this.</p>  <p>  Yet when one looks at a report from the European Union itself in July of this year, it is very clear that the systems in place all across Europe bear little resemblance to this one.  This is a system where on the balance of probabilities somebody can be convicted and have his or her livelihood taken away, whereas if the Minister or I were stopped by a garda, we would have the right to go to a court and would be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  If we were found innocent those penalty points would be removed and they would not take effect because the burden of proof would be beyond reasonable doubt.  Whoever wrote that script for tonight and said to the Minister that it is acceptable that the balance of probabilities is an acceptable threshold is letting him down and failing him.</p> <p>The Government may well vote tomorrow night in total defiance of every word said by every one of those Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  I read through every line spoken by those Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies two years ago and there is not one with which I disagree.</p> <p> Charlie, I will say it - apologies, I am speaking to the Minister but if I am informal it is because we know each other as Donegal representatives - these representatives of fishing organisations feel betrayed, and if the Government votes against this tomorrow night, the Minister will have a major job to do if he is to reach out to the fishing industry and break down the wall of distrust.  He will have to stand up to the senior officials in his Department.  It is the view of the people in the fishing community that they are being criminalised and treated like second-class citizens.  The Minister must know that from speaking to them.  The Minister's actions will only entrench their view even more and push the gap further.</p> <p> We are an island nation and we have a large marine resource.  We should be enriching coastal communities and not criminalising them.  These are the implications of the decision being made by the Government.  Whatever way he votes tomorrow night, the Minister must urgently reflect on the need to stand up to those officials and make a stand as a Donegal man against those officials on behalf of the people he represents.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as ucht teacht isteach anocht agus &eacute;isteacht leis an gc&aacute;s at&aacute;im ag d&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute;lim in aghaidh &oacute;il ach t&aacute;im in aghaidh an iomarca &oacute;il de bharr an dochar a dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; do dhaoine.  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute;im ag iarraidh a mhaol&uacute;.  Mar a deirtear i nGaeilge, nuair a bh&iacute;onn an deoch istigh, b&iacute;onn an chiall amuigh.</p>  <p>  There is a saying in the Irish language that when the drink is in, the sense is out.  We know the truth of that statement.  There can be no doubt that cheap alcohol is having a damaging effect in our country.  The vast majority of the Oireachtas agreed with that in 2018 when we passed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  That Act included provisions setting a minimum price for alcohol.  If implemented or commenced, this Act will have no effect on the cost of most alcohol, which is already sold at prices in excess of the proposed minimum.  However, the Act will work to stop sales of really cheap drinks with very high alcohol content.  </p>  <p>  The Act sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  A standard drink has 10 g of alcohol in it.  A standard drink is a half-pint of beer, lager or stout, a small 100 ml glass of wine or a pub measure of spirits.  The Act sets the cheapest price for a gram of alcohol at 10 cents.  This would mean, for example, that a glass of lager or beer could not be sold for less than &euro;1 and a pint could not be sold for less than &euro;2.  We can extrapolate the minimum cost of bottles and so on from that.  Since most drinks are sold at higher prices than this, the Act would mainly affect very cheap drinks with a strong alcohol content.  It is not a tax and it will not affect the price of drink above the minimum price level.  </p>  <p>  In July 2019 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said he hoped to implement minimum unit pricing of alcohol in order to reduce the significant health harms and financial costs of the way alcohol is consumed in Ireland to the greatest extent possible.  These harms and costs include alcohol-attributed deaths from motor accidents, domestic violence, liver disease, breast cancer and other issues.  These account for 21.2 deaths per 100,000 in this State, compared to 15.09 deaths per 100,000 in the North.  To put that in context, the Global Burden of Disease Study finds that up to 20,000 deaths in this country could be attributed to alcohol diseases and other related deaths since the Act was first mooted in 2013.  </p>  <p>  The excuse given for not acting on this was that people would travel across the Border for cheaper drink.  This might happen but it would not undermine the general effectiveness of the law.  The same argument could be made in the case of Scotland, which has a land border with England.  However, the Scottish are happy to note that their legislation is having an effect.  According to statistics published following the introduction of the relevant Act there, alcohol consumption has dropped to the lowest level on record.  Again, let us not forget that Scotland has a land border with England.  When Covid-19 is added to the mix, it becomes even more important for people to keep their wits about them.  It is time that we commence this section, which was passed by the House.  We should not put it on the never-never, but take action.</p></speech>

The programme for Government promises to honour our long-standing commitment to the introduction of minimum unit pricing of alcohol products in consultation with Northern Ireland.</p>  <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for this issue, I want to assure the House from the outset that there is no ambiguity whatsoever on the importance of this issue or on the need to see progress with the implementation of the Act.  As the Deputy rightly said, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 is a major aspect of the work of my Department's alcohol and tobacco unit.  As a result, it is an issue that I will make every effort to progress in my time in office as Minister of State.</p>  <p>  The Act was enacted on 17 October 2018.  Its primary policy objectives are to reduce alcohol consumption to 9.1 l of pure alcohol per person per annum; to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people; to reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol; and to regulate the supply and price of alcohol to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol-related harm.  These objectives were developed in recognition of the harms to health and significant costs to the Exchequer caused by alcohol and the fact that alcohol consumption in Ireland remains high.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Act provides for a minimum price of 10 cents per gram of alcohol for alcohol products.  Minimum pricing is considered effective because international evidence shows that those who consume alcohol at harmful levels tend to purchase cheaper alcohol than do moderate drinkers.  The policy therefore impacts harmful drinkers the most.  In addition, a minimum price will mean that strong alcohol products are not cheaply available to children and young people.  Minimum unit pricing will target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the price is determined by and is directly proportionate to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  This means that the price of individual products will depend on their strength.  It sets a price floor beneath which alcohol cannot legally be sold and targets products that are currently very cheap relative to their strength.</p>  <p>  A sample application of a 10 cent minimum price per gram shows that it affects only the cheapest of products sold in off-licences.  The prices of products sold in the on-licensed trade are unlikely to be impacted by a minimum price of 10 cents per gram.  For example, under minimum unit pricing, a pub measure of whiskey would cost &euro;1.12, a measure of vodka would be &euro;1.05 and a pint of Heineken lager, Guinness stout and Bulmer's cider would be &euro;2.25, &euro;1.89 and &euro;2.02 respectively.  The aim of minimum unit pricing is to target harmful drinkers, that is, those who drink so much that they are putting their health in danger.  The measure is targeted and attempts to minimise the impact on moderate drinkers.</p>  <p>  In 2013 the Government decided to approve the introduction of a minimum unit pricing regime on the basis that minimum pricing would be introduced simultaneously here and in Northern Ireland.  This position of all-island co-operation is reaffirmed in the programme for Government.  The reason for simultaneous introduction is to allay concerns in relation to possible impacts on cross-Border trade if the measure was to be introduced in one jurisdiction only.</p>  <p>  We welcome the recent commitment on the part of the Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Robin Swann, to hold a full public consultation on the introduction of minimum unit pricing in Northern Ireland.  Following a letter I sent to the Minister last month, I reiterate that I look forward to working with him on this important public health measure in order that both jurisdictions can avail of the benefits of the introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol products.</p> <p>The Deputy is correct that it has been a success in Scotland.  We hope that we will be able to follow that example in conjunction with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900051#BBB00200"><p>I listened carefully to the comments of the Minister of State.  Everything he stated backs up the case I have made.  This is a very desirable measure.  As anybody who examines it will see, what it hits really hard are cheap, high alcohol content drinks.  If a drink has a very low alcohol content, one can sell it in volume more cheaply because minimum unit pricing will not have the same impact.  The impact of the measure relates to the alcohol content of the drink.</p>  <p>  We need to do this.  The Minister of State did not address why Scotland was able to do it in spite of the fact that it has a land border with England but we cannot do it.  With or without the other jurisdiction on this island, we need to get on with the job.  Like every other Deputy, I would much prefer everything to be done on an all-Ireland basis and it would be much better if both sides had got on with this two years ago but we have been putting this on the long finger since 2013.  There is no reason why we could not act unilaterally.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is present because, as he knows, we distorted the market by putting a carbon tax on certain products when there is no equivalent tax on them in Northern Ireland.  There were abuses of that to a certain level but it certainly improved things down here in the South.  It is true that petrol and diesel are much cheaper in the South than they are in Northern Ireland and that people come over the Border to buy them, which distorts trade.</p>  <p>  Alcohol is a much more public good than either of those two products and the introduction of minimum unit pricing will save a significant number of lives.  We need a commitment from the Government that before this year is out, this provision will be commenced with or without Northern Ireland.  Its commencement here may encourage the Northern Ireland authorities to move in a progressive way.</p>  <p>  As I stated, we are not trying to stop people accessing alcohol at the normal prices at which they access it.  Rather, what this measure will hit is the abuse of alcohol.  As the Minister of State pointed out, it will hit those who buy very high alcohol content drinks, which I will not name tonight, at a ridiculously low price and do incredible damage.  We know that young people in particular are tempted in that direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900051#BBB00300"><p>Early analysis of the introduction of minimum unit pricing in Scotland shows that the policy is successful in targeting harmful drinking.  Scotland introduced minimum pricing in May 2018.  Subsequent to its introduction, alcohol consumption figures there were at their lowest rate for 25 years.</p><p>We have an alcohol issue in this country.  Alcohol consumption in Ireland almost trebled over the four decades between 1960 and 2000, from 4.9 l to 12.1 l of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i>aged over 15 years.  That dramatic rise came about because alcohol became more affordable and widely available.  Our current consumption is down to 11 l.  We wish to get it down to 9.1 l.  We have not reached the target of a decrease of more than 21%.  We wish to get it down to 9.1 l by 2020.  Analysis published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>in 2019 found the introduction of minimum unit pricing has led to a 7.6% decrease in purchased grammes of alcohol per adult per household.  It also concluded that minimum unit pricing has a targeted effect on those who purchase the most alcohol and that the reductions in purchased alcohol occurred in the households that bought the most alcohol.</p><p>I and my Department believe that a minimum unit pricing policy would be most effective if we work together with our colleagues in Northern Ireland such that both jurisdictions introduce the policy simultaneously.  If we proceed with the policy unilaterally, we risk undermining its effectiveness by continuing to provide consumers with the option to avoid minimum unit pricing by crossing the Border to access cheaper alcohol.  We are committed to the introduction of minimum unit pricing, as set out in the programme for Government, and I very much look forward to implementing the policy when the conditions are in place for it to be effective.</p><p>Another aspect worth noting of the introduction of the measure in Scotland is that deaths in Glasgow related to alcohol reduced by 20%, which is staggering.  We have a major fight on our hands.  I wish to thank the representatives of Alcohol Action Ireland, whom I have met, and many other stakeholders.  We are committed and united in tackling this issue.</p></speech>

Before the lockdown, there was a four-year waiting list to access speech and language therapy in those counties.  That means a preschool child referred to speech and language services might not get support before his or her Holy Communion.  At present, 1,049 children in the two counties are awaiting access to speech and language therapy but three-quarters of the speech and language therapists are directly involved in contact tracing.  This is not a good use of scarce therapy resources.  It is not just speech and language therapists.  I have received reports that occupational therapists, physiotherapists, audiologists and podiatrists, to name but a few highly trained staff, have been redeployed since the Covid-19 lockdown and remain redeployed in other areas of the health system while the waiting lists for vulnerable children mount and mount.  This is not just happening in the west.  I have also received reports of it happening in counties Westmeath, Laois, Offaly and Kildare.</p>  <p>  How can it be that it has taken months after these staff were redeployed for any attempt to be made to recruit contact tracers?  What is even more appalling is the fact that the therapists involved in the Galway-Roscommon autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit based in Athenry were, prior to Covid-19, involved in a reconfiguration of that service which was to be completed by January of next year.  It would not surprise me if Covid-19 is now used as an excuse to drag out that process, rather than the reconfiguration having being done during the lockdown when those therapists were not seeing children.  That will add further delays. </p>  <p>  What does this mean in reality?  Liam, who turned five today, had his first block of speech therapy sanctioned in March but did not have any sessions before he started school this September because his therapist has been redeployed into contact tracing.  As Liam was not sanctioned a special needs assistant, SNA, in his school, his older sister must translate for him in the classroom.  These issues came about because nobody seems to have been recruited and trained for contact tracing after the first wave of infection months ago.  In fact, clerical staff across Government agencies and members of the Defence Forces have been taken off contact tracing and sent back to their previous jobs but that is not the case for front-line therapists who could help Liam and make sure that his older sister, Ava, could be a normal child in first class rather than having to act as an SNA.  I want this to stop today.  These therapists should be put back to doing the work they ought to be doing today.  I do not wish for the Government to wait until next Monday to make this happen.  It needs to happen immediately.  These staff should never have been redeployed in the first instance.  After the first wave of infection, they should have been the first staff to be sent back to their front-line services, rather than sending back the clerical staff and having these staff still tied up in contact tracing.</p></speech>

In preparing for and responding to Covid-19 and to fully align with public health guidance as recommended by NPHET, the HSE and its partner service providers put in place a range of measures.</p> <p>These included the prioritisation of vital residential and home support services, while curtailing or closing certain services, such as day services as well as certain clinical supports, in order to prioritise essential public health services at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level and ensure continued delivery of the referenced residential and home supports provision.</p> <p> Effective redeployment of health service employees was a core element of the response by the HSE to Covid-19.  Hospital groups and community healthcare organisations, temporarily redeployed staff to support their business continuity plans, to emerging services developing in direct response to Covid-19 and in response to the health and availability of staff in their own organisations.</p> <p> Having said that, some services continued with therapists, including speech and language therapists, working with service users and their families remotely and using technology in new and effective ways.</p> <p> The HSE's national HR strategic workforce planning and intelligence unit collects information regarding the redeployment of some staff.  Many grades and categories of staff, including speech and language therapists, were redeployed and some continue to be redeployed to other services such as the helplines, contact tracing, testing, public health and service support.</p> <p> The presence and threat of Covid-19 in Ireland is ongoing and has resulted in significant challenges for service users, their carers and families and for service providers.  During these challenging times, disability services and supports, such as residential services, day services, home supports, personal assistant supports, respite services and children's services, were either suspended or delivered in alternative ways in line with public health guidance.</p> <p> In the absence of regular scheduled day services, respite supports and multidisciplinary supports, CHOs and service providers have tried to maintain services that can be delivered safely, providing outreach and telecare solutions, using technology where possible and using creative and innovative models of care to support service users, both adults and children.  The HSE was also mindful of the will and preference of people in terms of receiving services and in certain instances where personal choice was made to put these services on hold.</p> <p> The HSE acknowledges that during the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, it has not been possible to maintain full services.  It has, therefore, been difficult to complete clinical assessments or provide interventions while maintaining social distancing and meeting health and safety requirements.</p> <p> The HSE is aware of the numbers of children and adults waiting for therapy services, as the Deputy outlined, including speech and language therapy, and is fully cognisant of the stress this can cause to families.  One of the key priorities for the HSE is to improve waiting times for therapy services.</p> <p> In respect of the provision of disability services and in the context of the Government's Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021 framework, the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability.  This means that therapies including speech and language therapy, while being delivered in new ways, will gradually be re-introduced to children with disabilities.  It is a priority for the HSE to release redeployed staff back to their substantive grade and a national recruitment campaign is under way to retain testing and tracing resources in order to deliver this priority.  As the Deputy rightly stated, 50% of the staff redeployed at the beginning of the pandemic have already returned to their substantive grade.</p></speech>

I have given a week's notice on this specific issue.</p>  <p>  In relation to all of these therapies, all the private providers have been back delivering these exact same services, and charging for them, for months at this stage, but not the HSE staff.</p>  <p>  With all due respect, 50% of the staff have not returned to the front-line services that they were providing prior to this time.  As I have already put on the public record here, three-quarters of the speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapist are still involved in contact tracing instead of the job that they should be doing.</p>  <p>  I had the opportunity here in the House on Thursday last to bring this up with the former T&aacute;naiste, and current Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  The Minister told the D&aacute;il that Defence Forces staff would be made available to provide contact tracing if the HSE asked for them.  He also told the House that only 24 of the 647 applications received from former Defence Forces personnel to re-enlist to help out during the pandemic had been approved due to eligibility criteria, such as age.  Surely some of those 623 applicants and, I am sure, many more staff who have answered Ireland's call, and staff who have already left the HSE, would be willing to come back to help out in order that children could learn to talk or to walk and that children could have ordinary everyday lives, just like their brothers and sisters and friends and neighbours.  Surely it is not too much to ask that these valuable therapists would be sent back to the job that they should be doing at the front line, treating children on a day-to-day basis, instead of picking up the phone.</p></speech>

I am aware that in the Department of Health, many of the various teams are still working on Covid.</p>  <p>  The HSE has put a plan in place to stabilise the testing workforce to release staff back to their substantive roles.  However, with the rising number of cases and the requirement for the HSE community services to respond to meet the evolving priorities, there is a fine balance to be struck between the competing priorities of responding to Covid and the restarting of services temporarily paused on the onset of Covid.  I will bring the Deputy's forthright and helpful advice to the Minister when I meet him tomorrow.</p></speech>

We expect that such measures coming in place will assist in our ability to meet both Covid and non-Covid service demands.</p>  <p>  HR in community operations has been in dialogue with trade union partners regarding the matter and has agreed to progress a roadmap for the return of all staff to their substantive roles as the new staff come on stream in a co-ordinated way.</p>  <p>  I appreciate Deputy Naughten's advice and I will bring it to the Minister.  However, sometimes there are many other issues.  When I got involved in politics first, I was told the fight is never what the fight is about.  Sometimes there are other issues, of which perhaps we are not cognisant.  We are in the middle of a dangerous Covid pandemic.  The situation is evolving and what pertained last week may not pertain this week.  We see in our own areas the rise of Covid-19.  I certainly congratulate all the front-line staff of the HSE for all the work they have done so far.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900052#CCC00600"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this matter this evening and the Minister for being here at this late hour to take the debate.</p>  <p>  As the Minister will probably be aware, there is an urgent need to provide better road access to Great Island and the town of Cobh in Cork East.  I doubt the Minister has been to Cobh recently but it is a most beautiful town and setting.  On a fine day, it is like costa del Cobh.  It is really lovely.</p>  <p>  The population of the Great Island is 15,000.  Cobh is one of the biggest towns in County Cork.  Many people do not realise that.  However, Great Island itself can only be reached by a cross-river crossing.  There is a good rail link, which is fantastic, but the road access is deplorable.  It really is extremely poor.  The river ferry is weather dependent as well.</p>  <p>  This R624 road includes the triple-arch humpback Belvelly Bridge, which was constructed in 1803.  In the view of many people, including me, it is totally inadequate for the weight and volume of the traffic that is on it today, when one thinks of 15,000 people being obliged to use it.</p> <p>Behind it there is the beautiful Belvelly Castle which was recently restored.  In addition to the issue of Belvelly Bridge, the R624 network leading from Cobh Cross to the bridge and on to Cobh town in particular is extremely narrow and has many twists and turns.  It is very dangerous for road users at peak commute times and lethal for cyclists and pedestrians who literally cannot use it.  Local residents are very concerned because the volume of traffic has increased in recent years.  </p> <p> The overriding concern is that if anything happens to the almost 220-year-old stone bridge, 15,000 people would be cut off.  Several times in recent years, unfortunate accidents on the R624 have curtailed access to the island, in some cases for hours, resulting in major delays and traffic chaos.  One can imagine the impact this could have on emergency services.  </p> <p> Cobh is now a major international tourist destination.  Prior to the Covid restrictions, the town had up to 100 cruise liners visiting annually.  Visitors from those liners typically explored the immediate region in touring coaches which must navigate this very narrow, dangerous road, the Belvelly Bridge and the local road network.  Cobh is also recognised as an attractive tourist destination for local visitors, with its world-famous, Pugin-designed St. Colman's Cathedral dominating the skyline, its fine promenade, restaurants, coffee shops and attractions such as the heritage centre, Titanic Experience Cobh and nearby Fota House and wildlife park.  It is a very beautiful town which has been enhanced in recent years by the Tidy Towns committee and local authority workers.</p> <p> The R624 is also the main access route for those who want to visit Spike Island which last year had in excess of 81,000 visitors.  Spike Island was named Europe's leading attraction at the World Travel Awards in 2017 and came second in the global awards behind some place called Machu Picchu.  While the road network is currently presenting problems, a master plan for the development of the former IFI site at Marino Point will further increase traffic volume on the R624 along with any further developments which might be planned in the Cork dockyard in Cobh.  The dockyard may end up being a centre for wind energy development.</p> <p> I am aware that the Department of Transport had an initial engagement with Cork County Council last year, including a meeting with the Department's strategic research and analysis division regarding the project proposal process.  I understand the council is appointing consultants.  This evening, I ask the Minister to add his weight to this.  We know this is a major project, which is extremely sensitive.  It is in a special area of conservation where there is a great deal of heritage, stonework and so on.  Any works in the area will require a considerable work and effort and take many years to plan and develop.  I ask the Minister to put his weight behind this project and to do all he can, with his hard-working officials, to support Cork County Council in advancing proposals to upgrade road access to Cobh. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900053#DDD00200"><p>I am pleased to be here to discuss this issue with Deputy Stanton.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post-2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  The national development plan, NDP, provides for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.</p>  <p>  Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects.  This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.  The project assessment process can be expected to take time and all proposed projects must now comply with the revised public spending code published in December 2019.  An important change to the public spending code is the introduction of a requirement for a strategic assessment report for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.  The strategic assessment report is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.  The purpose of the strategic assessment report is to examine the rationale for a proposed project and to ensure the strategic alignment of projects with Government policy, including the national planning framework and national development plan.  The strategic assessment report is also an important step in the project life cycle in that potential alternatives for an intervention are assessed and identified for further appraisal should the project progress to the preliminary business case phase of the appraisal process.  Once completed, a report needs Departmental approval.  </p>  <p>  On access to Cobh and Great Island, there was some initial engagement between Cork County Council and my Department last year, including a meeting with the Department's strategic research and analysis division regarding the project appraisal process.  My Department understands that Cork County Council is now proposing to appoint consultants to carry out a transport study which will look at all options in relation to access.</p></speech>

I am aware of the strategic access report requirement at the first decision stage in the project appraisal work.  I am also familiar with Government policy.  A tier 1 port is being developed in Cobh, which is hugely important.  I invite the Minister to visit the area and drive the road, or be driven along it, in order that he can have a look at it.  It is frightening and the volume of traffic is very high.  I hope the cruise liners return when the pandemic ends.  This project will take time.  I ask the Minister to personally look at the file and support and drive on the project.  If it was started today, by the time there were shovels in the ground, the project could take four or five years to complete, by which time we will probably all be gone from this House.  I ask the Minister to push this very hard.  The council is very anxious that the project proceeds because it knows how badly needed it is.  Local people have contacted me about it.  They are very concerned about the safety of the road, which is really dangerous.  I know cycling is close to the Minister's heart but it cannot be cycled as there is no place for bicycles at all.  It is an extraordinarily narrow road and the volume of traffic on it is extreme.</p>  <p>  I know that the project must go through a procedure.  I ask that the Minister get behind it and support the local authority which is doing its best to progress it for the people in the area.</p></speech>

My grandfather grew up in Glounthaune where we had a family farm so I know the area well.  I will look closely at the file.</p>  <p>  There is a whole range of developments in the Cork harbour and city area.  We need to develop Cork as a counterbalance to Dublin.  We need infrastructure in Cork, which includes Cobh and Carrigtwohill, Ballincollig on the other side, and Blarney.  The city has spread a great deal.  We need to bring life back into Cork but we also need to look after the 15,000 people in Cobh and those living in Glounthaune and beyond.  </p>  <p>  There will be a variety of ways to invest in this infrastructure.  One will be to invest in Cork harbour.  Marino Point, a deep sea port with a rail connection and one of the best harbours in the world, is an underutilised asset.  It also has a lot of energy infrastructure around it.  We will have to invest in the rail line.  One of my top priority projects is developing a second track from Midleton to Cork city.  I would also develop a station at Tivoli.  I spoke to Cork County Council about this recently.  If we did that, we could have 10,000 people in Tivoli docks.  The other side of the estuary on the old Dunlop site and the docklands would allow massive development of the east of the city.  </p>  <p>  We also need to develop and look after Cobh for tourism and many other purposes.  I know the bridge and road in question and what the Deputy has said is not untrue.  The project would not be cheap.  One might think it is just one section of road but it would quickly amount to tens of millions of euro.  It is about balance, and I expect that, as well as the road, the strategic review is looking at further Local Link bus services and increasing frequency on the Cobh train line.  Traffic volume on the R624 is an issue.  The road caters for around 5,000 vehicles per day and probably has a multiple of that now.  The study will have to consider the various options to solve the needs of people in the community.  Their needs must come first.  We must look at every option for achieving that. </p></speech>

This is probably forgotten when people look at its skyline and see sparkling six, eight and ten storey apartment buildings and plenty of cranes.  These new buildings have state-of-the-art technology and all the mod cons, but that is in stark contrast to Dublin City Council's housing in Pearse House, Glover's Court and most of the council's flat complexes.  The Googles and Facebooks are pushing people out of their communities.</p>  <p>  The flat complexes that I have mentioned and many more are almost like modern tenements, but our people deserve better.  Bin storage areas are open and the competition between rats and seagulls is intense.  If one wants to witness that struggle in bin storage areas, one need only go to Markievicz House, which is less than 1 km from here.  Rats travel the flats without fear and, in some cases, have eaten into cars and done such damage that insurance companies have had to write off those cars.  In what is not an unusual instance, rats found their way into a flat in Pearse House through the waste pipes, nested behind a wardrobe and ate the electrics at the back of the fridge and cooker at night.</p>  <p>  Flooding is a regular occurrence, sometimes with raw sewage.  Regularly, raw sewage bursts into the balconies or courtyards from the old pipes.  Mould is rampant in the flats, with some rooms being uninhabitable because of its extent.  Residents' health is badly impacted because of this, but more often than not, the council just tells people to wipe the mould off with bleach and they will be grand.</p>  <p>  The council has lined stairwells with a lining that makes it almost impossible to sweep and is difficult to wash down.  This was done without any consultation with residents.  Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend faces a variety of issues that Dublin City Council has agreed to work on, but that work has stalled once again.</p>  <p>  In the 1930s and 1940s when many flat complexes were constructed, they were built to replace the slums across Dublin.  They were built to a high standard and have lasted well, but they are no longer suitable for families.  Herbert Simms, who was responsible for the design and construction of some 17,000 homes from 1932 to 1948 when the country was on its knees economically, saw the importance of public housing.  We now need to see that same commitment from this Government in terms of investing in public housing stock.  There has been a great deal of talk about building a sustainable city, but that cannot be achieved while abandoning these communities, which have been the city's backbone for generations.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council has started the process of engaging with residents in Pearse House with a view to regeneration.  Will the Government commit to investing in the redevelopment of Pearse House?  Residents there and in Macken Villas and flats like them across the city have been left behind.  For many reasons, the inner city cannot be left behind.  The Government needs to invest as a matter of urgency in Dublin's communities, which have been forgotten.  We need to invest in flat complexes not too far from here, for example, Pearse House, Bishop Street, York Street and Digges Street, and other flat complexes around Dublin.</p></speech>

However, my Department also supports local authorities in improving their social housing stock through a range of programmes, including energy retrofitting, regeneration and refurbishment works to vacant properties in order to return these to productive use as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department currently supports a programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Cork, Limerick and Dublin and smaller projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  These projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in their communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  Projects being funded under the programme target the country's most disadvantaged communities, including those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, poverty and deprivation.  Between 2016 and 2019, more than 560 units were delivered under the national regeneration programme, supported by funding in excess of &euro;237 million from our Department.  There are regeneration projects in the national pipeline that will yield in excess of 740 new homes out to 2023 at an estimated cost of &euro;240 million, which includes a number of significant projects in inner city Dublin.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a regeneration project moves through a number of phases during its life: the initial planning stage; decanting of existing tenants; demolition works; enabling works; refurbishment and-or consolidation works in some cases; and construction.  The project also moves through a number of pre-construction stages and approvals, with funding being approved for the different phases as required.  There may be significant investment in a regeneration project over a number of years before housing units are delivered and ready for occupation.</p>  <p>  A number of Dublin City Council projects are currently on site, including phase 1 of the regeneration of St. Teresa's Gardens, which will deliver the first 54 units early in 2021, and Dominick Street, which will deliver 72 units in 2021.  Other projects, such as Dolphin House's phase 1b of 35 units, Dorset Street's 115 units in the initial phase and Constitution Hill's 130 units in the initial phase, are all at pre-construction stages.</p>  <p>  While the identification of properties for inclusion in any such programme is a matter for the local authority, I understand that Dublin City Council has completed a strategic development audit of its 220 apartment complexes in order to develop a capital housing apartment complex regeneration programme for 2020 to 2040.  According to the council, this audit has regard to the physical condition and development potential of the complexes and other relevant factors.  The council has identified priorities for each of its 11 electoral areas.  I understand that it is examining the feasibility of making a positive intervention at Pearse House, which is a protected structure, and engagement with local elected members and the community will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with Dublin City Council in support of advancing this programme, with funding available through various social housing programmes.</p></speech>

Clearly, Dublin City Council is filling in the details, but it cannot do this without funding and a commitment.  It is important that the Government commits to funding redevelopment projects.  Pearse House is a large development of 370 flats and is experiencing many social as well as physical infrastructure issues.  It needs to be regenerated.  The people there have put up with terrible conditions.  None of us here would live in the conditions to which they have been subjected.  The Government needs to invest in this project as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's comments.  I will keep pushing him on more than just Pearse House.  Right across the inner city, there are homes that need to be redeveloped.  They are not up to modern standards and would not be acceptable in any other European city.  They should not be accepted in Dublin.  It is important that we invest in Pearse House and all those flat complexes that are in urgent need of regeneration.</p></speech>

The community development and regeneration aspects have to go hand in hand with redevelopment projects.  The Department is working closely with all local authorities on increasing and accelerating the delivery of a range of social housing programmes and supports.  It is fully committed to working with Dublin City Council on progressing the regeneration proposals in the inner city.  The Department has worked consistently with the council in support of the latter's efforts to advance proposals under the regeneration programme and we will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  As evidenced by the Department's commitment to supporting public housing in inner city Dublin, funding in excess of &euro;450 million has been approved for social housing programmes, with approximately 20 projects delivering in excess of 1,225 social housing units in such inner city projects as North King Street, Bonham Street, Sackville Avenue, Cork Street, Infirmary Road, Matt Talbot Court and Constitution Hill.  It eagerly awaits submissions from Dublin City Council on a variety of new projects, including St. Andrew's Court, Dunne Street and the next phases of the redevelopment at St. Teresa's Gardens.  In terms of Pearse House, following completion of the engagement process with local councillors and the local community, it is a matter for Dublin City Council to advance the project accordingly and to submit the proposal to the Department for consideration.</p>  <p>  It is important that what we have discussed form part and parcel of our approach to town centres.  We want families living in vibrant, sustainable communities in inner city Dublin because that is at the heart of Dublin and in Dublin's future.  As such, it is vital that we get this right.  I welcome the Deputy's contribution in that regard.</p></speech>

However, the Revised Estimates for Public Services published in December 2019 already laid out Exchequer capital funding of &euro;9.1 billion for 2021.  As such, I fail to see any additionality in what is indicated in the July stimulus.  Will the Minister outline how the emergency measures in the budget will increase capital expenditure in 2021 to &euro;9.1 billion and how that differs from what was signalled in the Revised Estimates published in December 2019?</p></reply>

As she points out, the capital expenditure levels for 2021, as originally set out in the Revised Estimates Volume of December 2019, amounted to &euro;9.1 billion.  This figure, which was set out in advance of the Covid-19 pandemic, was almost &euro;1 billion, or 12%, higher than the corresponding 2020 allocation. </p>  <p>  As part of the July stimulus, the Government decided that rather than scaling back on planned capital investment in 2021 in response to budgetary pressures elsewhere, we would commit to preserving and maintaining this unprecedented level of capital investment.  It is a commitment I will carry through fully in budget 2021.  Of course, the precise configuration and prioritisation of the overall increased 2021 capital allocation of &euro;9.1 billion, including the remaining unallocated reserve and any potential for enhancement to those allocations, will be specified further and more comprehensively in the context of budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The national development plan, NDP, sets out five-year expenditure allocations by Department for the period 2018 to 2022.  These multi-annual allocations are devised to give Departments a degree of certainty for future planning.  In direct response to Covid-19, however, the Government made necessary and large-scale revisions to capital allocations for 2020.  The capital expenditure allocations for 2020 were increased by in the region of an additional &euro;1.5 billion, bringing total capital investment for 2020 to above &euro;9.7 billion.  This is the highest ever investment in capital projects and programmes in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  In line with programme for Government commitments and in my capacity as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am bringing proposals to the Government regarding the launch of a structured, in-depth review of the NDP in order to advance the priorities identified in the programme for Government, including climate change, housing policy, transport policy, implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and balanced regional development, aligned with the associated multi-annual resourcing requirements.  The revised NDP, to be published next year, will assess the balance of resourcing between sectors in light of the programme for Government and will consider if there is a need for any strategic changes in allocations beyond 2021.</p></reply>

Prior to the pandemic, we saw voted capital expenditure of that sum for 2021.  It is my understanding, therefore, that there is no additionality in what is currently proposed and we are left exactly where we started.  Capital expenditure was always planned to be at around the &euro;9.1 billion mark.  That was the plan before the onset of the Covid crisis and it is the plan now.</p>  <p>  Capital expenditure has a large positive multiplier effect in terms of employment and as a means of tackling the crisis in comparison to the likes of the services industry.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has demonstrated that fiscal policy can have positive and significant initial impacts on Irish output.  According to EUROSTAT, in terms of investment as measured by gross fixed capital formation, we are currently the worst-performing economy in the EU.  Yet the Minister is saying that the allocation for capital investment is the same as initially stated, before the current crisis.</p></speech>

Ten years ago, in very different times and when different circumstances applied, capital expenditure was slashed by some 60%.  What we are doing now is in marked contrast to what happened in the past.  We are going to maintain, and have the ambition to increase, capital investment.</p>  <p>  The within-year increase in capital expenditure this year was for exceptional measures.  These include the measures in the July stimulus programme, under which some &euro;500 million was added.  There is approximately &euro;900 million extra in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation Vote, much of it to do with the enterprise grants, restart grants and so on which were brought forward as an exceptional measure this year.  The Deputy should reserve final judgment until she sees the actual allocation on budget day.  On a no-policy-change basis, we are saying that it is &euro;9.1 billion.  That does not mean things are set in stone with regard to budget day.</p></speech>

I have also heard rumours circulating that the Government plans to keep capital expenditure at around the &euro;9 billion mark for the duration of this crisis.  That greatly concerns me because we do not know how long that will be.  All indications are that the crisis will last for some time.  If we assume that it continues for a two- to three-year period, then this provision represents a real cut <i>per capita</i>when factoring in inflation and population growth.  It is austerity by stealth, under the table or through the back the door.  Call it whatever one wants but we have seen it before.</p><p>The Minister said that this Government is taking a different approach to this crisis from what was done previously.  We saw during the last crisis, especially after 2014, that despite the announcements that austerity was over, it did, in fact, continue, albeit in a sneakier fashion.  A recent report from the Halle Institute for Economic Research on the impact of Brexit estimates that more than 700,000 jobs will be at risk in the EU, with Ireland set to lose more than 35,000.  We are facing a crisis on two fronts and the State needs to be willing to step in with the types of large-scale capital projects that can offset the decline in private sector investment.  If that is not done, people will feel the hit in their pockets.  People are not naive.</p></speech>

Now is the right time to make that investment because we can borrow at historically low levels of interests.  There are many unmet infrastructure needs throughout the country.  We have an opportunity now that should be taken and it falls to me to be the advocate within Government for doing so.  To be fair, the prioritisation given to capital investment within the programme for Government is very clear.  The context within which we are maintaining more than &euro;9 billion of capital investment next year has changed dramatically in the past six months.  The reality is that we will probably get a lot more done with the same amount of money, given the changes we have inevitably seen so far and are likely to continue to see within the construction industry.  There is already evidence of better value for money coming into the process of tendering for projects.</p>  <p>  I ask the Deputy to reserve her judgment.  To be clear, there has been no decision within Government simply to maintain capital investment at this level through the unknown duration of the crisis.  The NDP review will happen in the coming months and it will set out a capital expenditure envelope for the next decade.</p></speech>

I described it at the time as the Government parties' very own job creation initiative, or a July stimulus for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  In the week that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is being cut, the Government, with the sanction of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, as the Minister in charge of spending, gave the go-ahead to appoint ten new special advisers to Ministers of State.  Does the Minister believe this is the right thing to do?  Will he, as Minister responsible for reform, establish criteria for such appointments?  Can he inform the House as to the total annual cost of the 64 advisers appointed to date?  Finally, will he confirm that he will not sign off on the appointment of any additional ministerial advisers during the term of the Government?</p></reply>

At that meeting, the Government approved the proposed guidelines setting out the process for the appointment of special advisers to Ministers and Ministers of State of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, as well as the terms and conditions applying to those appointments.  The guidelines were published by my Department on the <i>gov.ie</i>website and are broadly consistent with those applying under the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, both in terms of the number of appointments and the terms and conditions on appointment.</p> <p> The appointment of special advisers to the Ministers of State in question, which the Deputy refers to, was considered by the Government meeting of 22 September last.

As with the previous Government, once the formal appointment of all special advisers is concluded in the coming weeks, my Department will publish a list of special advisers to the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.  This list will include their names, the Departments to which they are assigned and their respective rates of pay.  Additionally, as the Deputy will be aware, a copy of each special adviser&rsquo;s signed contract of employment must also be laid before the Oireachtas by Ministers within 60 days of each special adviser&rsquo;s formal appointment by Government.</p></reply>

I assure the Minister that I am not throwing cheap, political potshots at the Minister and his Government colleagues on the appointment of a raft of special advisers for junior Ministers.  I do not believe it is in my nature to do so and the Minister may know this.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, correctly pointed out on "The Week in Politics" this week that I enjoyed the support of two special advisers during my own short spell as a super junior Minister.  I am old enough to remember when Government only merited one super junior Minister at the Cabinet table, and the two special advisers that the super junior Minister is entitled to have.  This time around we have three.  The only reason we have three super junior Ministers is not because of any particular policy focus in Government that would require the support of three particular voices at Cabinet with specific expertise, it is to keep the three Government parties sweet.  This is what it is all about, nothing more and nothing less.  I am not convinced or persuaded at all of the merits of appointing almost double the number of special advisers that the 2011-16 Government merited.  That was a Government that was in the mire and in battle to try to save Ireland's economy, as this Government is doing.  I am not persuaded by the Minister's response and I am not persuaded of the merits of appointing a raft of special advisers to junior Ministers.  I am not persuaded whatsoever.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to set out what the functions are.  The Act provides that a special adviser shall assist the relevant Minister by providing advice and by "monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department" and "performing such other functions as may be directed by the Minister" provided this does not involve the exercise of any specific powers conferred on the Minister or any other officeholder under the Act.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question related to the special advisers appointed to the Ministers of State.  For the information of the House, special advisers to those Ministers of State who do not regularly attend Cabinet are to be placed on the assistant principal officer standard scale, which is currently a number of points between &euro;67,659 and &euro;78,816.  That is the cost of that particular decision.</p></speech>

I believe that 64 is more than enough.  During the 2011-16 Government the country was in the mire and battling for its very survival and it had 30-plus advisers.  For a country with 15 Cabinet Ministers, a Chief Whip, a super junior Minister and probably the largest majority we have ever seen in the history of the State, I am open to be persuaded but remain to be convinced of the merits of appointing this number of special advisers.</p>  <p>  I am a fan of good government and good governance, and anything required to deliver that should be supported.  While I do not want to individualise this in any way, given the raft of cock ups we have seen over the last few months and weeks since this Government has come into office, all of the evidence so far suggests that the support being provided by special advisers may leave a little bit to be desired.  This is not about seamless Government and delivering better outcomes.  It is about keeping the parties in Government happy.  It is as simple as that. </p></speech>

Those challenges are still very much there and will become even more acute if we do not address them.  They include the housing crisis, the long-term structural reforms needed in our health service and the existential challenge of climate action.  That is ultimately how we will be judged.  I am the first to acknowledge that the appointment of special advisers is a sensitive issue.

There is no doubt that the Minister will be sitting down with representatives of ICTU's public service pay committee.  I am concerned that with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, the FEMPI legislation, still in place the Government will hold a big stick over the heads of the public service unions.

That process of restoration began on 1 January 2018 and is due to conclude by 1 July 2022.</p>  <p>  In that regard, on 1 October 2020, public servants will receive a 2% pay increase by way of restoration.  This will complete the pay restoration for public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 per annum.  Also on 1 October, reductions of between 5% and 8% made to certain allowances in 2010 will cease.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that by end 2020, an order is made to restore, at a date to be decided, reductions made to certain public service pensions.  In addition, section 20 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides explicitly that for certain public servants, pay restoration cannot be completed before 2 October 2021.</p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is obliged, before 30 June each year, to submit a written report of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the FEMPI Acts of 2009, No. 2 of 2009, 2010 and 2013 to the Oireachtas.  As part of that report, consideration must be given to whether or not any of the provisions of the relevant Acts continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of those Acts, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions.  Key considerations include the economic circumstances of the State, the budgetary outlook, debt, returns from taxation, Brexit and preparedness for other economic shocks.</p>  <p>  The 2020 report that was laid before this House last June concluded, on the basis of the prevailing economic and fiscal outlook, that the timetable for pay and pensions restoration up to July 2022 continued to be appropriate and necessary.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to take the most appropriate course of action in this key policy area into the future.</p></speech>

Here we are almost 13 years on and the legislation is still in place.  Today we face a crisis of a very different kind and the emergency measures that were introduced to tackle a very different crisis cannot be used to tackle this one.  Is the Minister planning to slowly unwind the legislation in the future and remove the more draconian parts of it while keeping other parts he considers necessary?  Will the Minister tell us prior to that, which parts will be removed and which retained, and what is the rationale behind such decisions?  I would urge the Minister to do so.</p></speech>

In addition, all very senior public and civil servants, including politicians, would have the cuts that were imposed reversed overnight.  We need to deal with this issue in a managed and phased way.</p>  <p>  To return to the point made by the Deputy earlier, it is my objective to negotiate a new public service pay deal.  It is in the interests of the State, the trade unions and the workers that they represent to have the certainty and stability of a new public service pay agreement.  We are in difficult circumstances and it will not be easy to negotiate a successor agreement.  We are in exploratory discussions at the moment with the trade unions and will see where that goes in the weeks ahead.  As the Deputy said, the current deal runs up to the end of the year.  We are seeing that deal through and part of that involves paying the 2% increase which, on balance, is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

It is extremely important to ensure that an agreement is reached with the unions which brings about real pay equality in our public services.  We need to have good public service wages.  We have been quick to clap in this Chamber.  I have been here when we clapped front-line public sector workers since the onset of this crisis but applause do not put bread on the table for these families or keep a roof over their heads, which is extremely difficult to do in the current housing crisis.  This Government regularly says that we are indebted to our public sector workers but it is time to put its money where its mouth is and reach a fair deal that recognises the pain they have suffered since 2008 as well as the heroics they have performed since the onset of Covid-19.</p></speech>

We now have approximately 340,000</p>  <p>public servants, over one third of whom work in our health service.  The work they have put in over the last number of months has been immense, against huge adversity.  We are doing the right thing as a Government in honouring the agreement that was entered into, even though it was entered into in much better times.  We have had an enormous economic shock as a result of Covid-19 but honouring that agreement and paying the 2%, albeit at a significant cost, is justified in the circumstances.  </p>  <p>  I want to negotiate a new agreement and my officials are in initial, exploratory discussions at the moment and we will see where that goes in the next number of weeks.  I hope a deal can be agreed but there is no certainty about anything.  We have had periods in the past where we have not had an agreement in place.  There is real value in a collective agreement and it is the Government's objective to secure one but it cannot be at any price.</p></speech>

How can the Minister possibly justify a pay rise for politicians when huge numbers of working people are seeing their incomes savaged?</p></reply>

The first point to note is that the 1 October adjustments to pay in the public service form part of the broader ongoing process of unwinding FEMPI reductions which was negotiated with public service trade unions and delivered through successive collective agreements, from the Lansdowne Road agreement to the current public service stability agreement.</p>  <p>  The remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers and other officeholders, has been examined a number of times by the former review body on higher remuneration in the public sector.  In its 38th report in September 2000, it recommended that the rate of salary for a Deputy should be linked to the grade of principal officer in the Civil Service.  The recommendation, which was accepted by Government at the time, was based on independent and expert consideration of the level of responsibilities and the commensurate level of pay.  Accordingly, the pay of D&aacute;il Deputies has been linked for 20 years to the prevailing pay of principal officers in the Civil Service, including through the significant pay cuts of the FEMPI legislation and now through the pay restoration measures involved in the phased unwinding of that legislation agreed with public service unions and set out in public service agreements.  This process of unwinding FEMPI reductions, including the forthcoming pay increase on 1 October, is also provided for in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas under the FEMPI Act 2015 and the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware it remains open to all Members of the Oireachtas to forego pay increases on a voluntary basis and I understand that many have been doing so.  For its part, the Government has already decided that Ministers and Ministers of State, in addition to taking a 10% pay cut, will also forgo the 2% pay increase when it becomes due in October.  This decision was taken in light of the Covid-19 emergency and the challenging economic and fiscal situation the country faces. </p></speech>

The ordinary public servants who were robbed to pay for the bailout of the banks should get their pay restored.  Indeed, it should have been restored long before now but the idea that politicians on extraordinarily handsome salaries of &euro;96,000 should get a pay rise at the very same time that the Government is cutting the PUP for people who have lost their jobs and seen their incomes hammered as a result of measures imposed by the Government is sickening.</p>  <p>  The increase that Deputies will receive is around &euro;45 per week on top of an already very handsome salary.  That is just a little less than the amount the Government has taken off PUP recipients.  These are people who were, in most cases, on much lower incomes in the first place.  Their income fell to &euro;350 per week because of pandemic measures imposed by the Government and now their incomes are being hammered down by another &euro;50 or &euro;100.  Does the Minister not think that is sickening and unacceptable in the current climate?</p></speech>

I am not sure what alternative system the Deputy is proposing to carve out the pay of politicians.  It is up to each individual to make whatever decision he or she wishes to make.  I am forgoing the increase because it is the right thing to do.  I assume Deputy Boyd Barrett is doing the same.  I am not sure in what manner the Deputy forgoes his increase.  Does he sign a gift back to the State or does he put it into a fund, the details of which he publishes?  Is there transparency in terms of how that money is used?  I do not know the details of how Deputy Boyd Barrett does it but I know that those of us in the Government who are doing it are gifting it back directly to the Exchequer so that the cost to the State is reduced as a result.  I ask the Deputy to explain the alternative system he wants for politicians to set their own pay but I do not believe we should be going down that road.  We have a system in place whereby we are linked to a certain grade in the Civil Service, whether that rate of pay is going up or down.  It is up to each individual then to make a decision based on his or her own circumstances.  People have different circumstances and we should all acknowledge that too.</p></speech>

That means we are in the same position as the people we represent and have a vested interest in representing the collective and not just looking after ourselves.  That is our policy.</p> <p> In the case of the 2%, we will be handing it back to the Exchequer because we think it is unconscionable in the current situation to take any pay rise, although, frankly, it hurts me to think we are handing it back to a Government that will then give it on to some other pampered group rather than give it to the people who actually need it.</p> <p> The Minister has not really answered my central question.  Does he think it is okay, that it looks very good or that it is not simply sickening for people who have lost their jobs and income, who are on the PUP and have just had their payments cut by the Government, to see the politicians who are doing that getting a pay rise?  Does he not think that looks awful, is unacceptable and is a kick in the stomach to people who are already down?</p></speech>

I do not believe that is a good system.  I do not believe that, in any other walk of life, people get to decide their own pay.  There is a pay increase that people can decide to either accept or reject.  Apart from the 2% increase, which the Deputy says he is gifting back to the State, what I hear him say, in essence, is that he is accepting the full salary from the State but that he is deciding what to do with it.  This means he has already accepted a number of rounds of restoration of previous FEMPI pay cuts.   Politicians within People Before Profit are accepting that and they are then putting that into some fund, apparently, which they presumably then make a decision on how to distribute, and in respect of which the State has no role whatsoever.  Apart from this 2%, what I hear the Deputy saying is that he is accepting the full salary from the State.  What we are doing is open and transparent.  The Deputy is preaching over there while, at the same time, he has been taking the full salary from the State but not telling everybody what the balance is, in net terms, that he says he does not take.  Is it gross or is it net?  Where does that money go?</p></speech>

What we are doing with the 2% is that we are not taking it, but we do not think it should be a choice for the politicians to take it.  In terms of the average industrial wage, we use that money as we pledged in our election manifesto in a very clear way.  We pledged that we would take the average industrial wage, so I have not benefited one cent personally from any pay increase that other politicians have all benefited from in the context of their already high salaries,  We use that money to fund constituency services, campaigns, groups and organisations that campaign for social justice and for equality.  That is what we use it for, as we promised.  We would much rather do that than give it to you lot to then give to bankers or give further pay increases to politicians.  It is a far more admirable strategy.  If the Minister was really concerned about this, and was concerned about the things he is implying he is concerned about, he would cut the pay of politicians and certainly would not increase it.</p></speech>

I assume he is suggesting that legislation would be introduced to set politicians' pay, and then we would be the only body I am aware of that would have the power to, in essence, set its own pay.  I hear the Deputy talk about a fund that his party uses to distribute to worthy causes, and I have no doubt they are worthy, although I have not seen the operation of that fund or how transparent it is.  I assume that is fully published for everyone to see.  The Deputy talks about the average industrial wage.  Is that gross or net?  I do not know.  The truth is he is taking the full money from the State and then he makes a decision, as he sees fit, on what to do with it.  He should be honest and upfront with people that this is what he is proposing.</p>  <p>  Politicians should not set their own pay.  We have a system in place which goes back 20 years.

I do not think that would be a better system.  The system we have is completely independent and beyond our direct control.  We are linked to a certain grade within the Civil Service and I think that settles the issue.  We are linked to that grade, irrespective of whether the rate of pay is going up or going down.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has spoken about the 2% and said he is not going to take it.  Some Deputies may take it and other Deputies will not.  It is a matter for each individual to make that decision and I am not going to lecture or advise anyone as to what he or she should do.  I am telling the Deputy what I am doing personally, as a member of Government, and that is the equivalent of an annualised cut in pay of 12% ,which is the right thing to do because we are in a hugely privileged position to serve in government and to represent the people of this country, as well as our constituencies.  It is a matter for the Deputy if he has a proposal to make.  Let him make it to the House - in this democratic forum - in the normal way.</p></speech>

I was on the picket line with Debenhams workers the other day.  They were sickened at the thought that people in this House were going to get a pay increase when their pandemic unemployment payments were going to be cut by those very people.  Does the Minister understand why they would be sickened about a situation where they have been abandoned, where the Government has let them down and where people who have worked for decades have just been dumped on the scrapheap?  The Government sits by and gives them tea and sympathy but does nothing to help them, and they are literally dumped by a ruthless company and a Government that washes its hands of their fate.  Then, they see that politicians are giving themselves a pay rise.  Does the Minister not get how angry that would make them?  I can tell him it was not me prompting them.  When I hear that kind of stuff, I think we have to respond to that and we have to say it is not just a matter of individual choice.  Fair play to the Minister for making that choice, and we have made that choice that we will not take the pay increase, but, against that background, I do not believe any politician in this House should receive an increase in respect of an already high salary.</p></speech>

That is misleading and he knows it is misleading.  It is stoking up the anger that is undoubtedly there.  The reality is that the system which is in place takes it out of the hands of politicians, in essence, and I think that is the right thing to do.  The Deputy might think it would be a great thing to bring in legislation that reduces politicians' pay but if we give that power to the House, it might make a different decision at another point with which he would completely disagree.  Is it not far better that we have a system where we do not have direct control?</p>  <p>  The Deputy has singled out politicians, as is his right and as is his form, but there are many others in the public service earning far more than politicians and he has not singled them out.  He wants very special treatment for politicians to not be paid the 2%.  As I have said, I am not taking it and the members of the Government are not taking it, but I think it is only proper that we allow each individual to make that decision.  The Deputy is throwing all of this out there, but I do not hear an alternative proposal as to what to do.  If he has one, he should bring it forward. </p></speech>

That is our proposal, that is our policy and that is what we campaigned for.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister on higher paid civil servants.  That would also nauseate people.  Low and middle-income earners, the vast bulk of public servants, were savaged with FEMPI but those cuts did not mean the same for the super-well-paid civil servants at the very top of the Civil Service, and that nauseated people too.  We have a policy for that and we have put it across many times in this House.</p> <p>That policy is that nobody who is paid out of the public purse should be getting more than &euro;100,000 and that higher bands of tax should apply to anybody earning in excess of that amount, whether in the public or private sector, so that an end can be brought to the shocking differentials between the earnings of people on low and average incomes, who work just as hard as anybody in here, and the earnings of individuals who are on multiples of those salaries.</p></speech>

He made some additional points.  He wants every Deputy to be paid the average industrial wage and he is perfectly entitled to hold that policy.  I do not know if he would also apply that policy to all other public servants earning as much as or more than Deputies.  Perhaps that is his policy; I simply do not know.  We have a system whereby we do not set our own pay and under which our pay is linked to that of a certain grade within the Civil Service.  This takes our level of pay out of our direct control.  Of course it grates with many people who are in extremely tough circumstances to see anyone on good pay getting an increase.  That is why some Members of the House have decided not to take it but it is open to others to accept it.

I seek to ascertain the progress to date and intentions with regard to restoration of cuts made under the FEMPI legislation given that vast swathes of public servants, including doctors, nurses and many others at the coalface whom we aspire to support, had to take severe cuts during the economic recession.</p></reply>

It concluded that, on the basis of the prevailing economic and fiscal outlook, the timetable for pay and pensions restoration up to July 2022 continued to be appropriate and necessary.</p>  <p>  The report references the Public Service Pay and Pension Act 2017.  This Act provides for the restoration of reductions made to public service pay and pensions by the FEMPI Acts.  In that regard and as the Deputy knows, on 1 October 2020, public servants will receive a 2% pay increase.  This will complete pay restoration for public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 per annum.  Also on 1 October, reductions of between 5% and 8% made to certain allowances in 2010 will cease.</p>  <p>  In addition to pay, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that, by the end of this year, an order shall be made to restore, at a date to be decided, reductions made to certain public service pensions.</p>  <p>  Taking what I have just said into account, very substantial progress will be made in completing the FEMPI restoration process by the end of this year.  I highlight that the elements I have set out relate to the thousands of public servants who have been at the front line in delivering key services during the current pandemic.  These services are critical and range across the areas of health, education, justice, welfare and business supports to name but a few.  They have ensured that this Government continues to deliver a comprehensive national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></speech>

Given the pivotal nature of the services provided by public servants generally, during the current Covid crisis and during the previous crisis, does the Minister remain satisfied that it will be possible to proceed along the lines anticipated heretofore into 2021 and 2022 without interruption, having particular regard to the disquiet among some in the public sector and what they see as the unfairness of the cuts which were, understandably, imposed upon them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="22:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900059#KKK00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  It is fair to point out that the emphasis of the restoration process to date has been on low and middle-income earners within the public service.  By 1 October, people earning up to &euro;70,000 will have had their pay fully restored.  That is a significant milestone.  There are further measures in the FEMPI Acts, to which I have alluded.  A process is set out in the legislation with regard to the unwinding of the remainder of the FEMPI provisions.  These will be considered in due course.  As I have highlighted, under the current Act, by the end of this year I have to signal a date by which the public service pension reductions will be reversed.  There is also a schedule in place so that, by July 2021 and July 2022, restoration will be complete for higher-earning public servants.  All of those matters remain under consideration but for now the priority is to see out the current public pay deal and, it is hoped, to negotiate a new one.</p></speech>

The reply the Minister has given correctly states that those earning up to &euro;70,000 will have had their pay restored but, in the meantime, they would possibly have reached a higher bracket had they not these severe cuts imposed.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the cuts could have been avoided at the time.  They want right across the board and affected everybody.  Everyone was hit very severely.  Many people in those income brackets lost their homes for a variety of reasons including having entered financial commitments with which they could not continue.  The Minister has confirmed that we will continue with the restoration of cuts made under FEMPI legislation to the best of his ability.</p></speech>

This needs to be managed in an affordable and responsible manner.  That will inform and guide my approach with what remains to be done with regard to the FEMPI legislation.  Cabinet gave approval today for the drafting of legislation to remove what has become known as the FEMPI handcuffs.  That is another important step along the journey.  The 2% pay restoration to be implemented on 1 October will have a full-year cost of &euro;264 million.  On balance, it is the right thing to do to honour the agreement in full.  I hope it will create a better and more positive environment within which it might be possible to negotiate a new deal with the public service unions, albeit in very changed and difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

The need to upgrade and to replace the station has been very well established over a number of years.  That is why it was included in the capital programme for the period from 2016 to 2021.  Even though the land was bought some five years ago, very little progress, if any, seems to have been made in advancing the project.  The Department of Justice and Equality was to confirm that it was a priority project.  Can that now be confirmed?  Is it a priority project?  Is advancing through a public private partnership?  What is the up-to-date position on getting the new station for Macroom?</p></reply>

Since the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s announcement of a major reorganisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s structures and the decision to change the new Macroom station from a district station to a regional and divisional headquarters in late 2019, the Office of Public Works has undertaken intensive engagement with the key relevant State agencies.</p> <p>The Office of Public Works, OPW, has been liaising with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the brief and the design of the scheme since the Garda Commissioner announced the station in Macroom was to operate as a regional and divisional headquarters.  The design is well advanced and is currently with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for approval of the plans.</p> <p> From an early stage in the project, there has been ongoing engagement with the local authority, Cork County Council, with which the OPW jointly acquired a greenfield site off the N22 for dual use.  There has been ongoing technical consultation with the local authority, which will deliver the shared access road as part of a fire station development.  It is understood this aspect of the development has been tendered by the local authority and completion of this part of the work is critical to a public private partnership contractor being able to commence work on the Garda station site.  Meetings have taken place between OPW and the local authority with regard to the planning application and site infrastructure for the development, including water supply, drainage and road junctions.  The relevant pre-connection inquiries have been made to Irish Water.</p></reply>

The divisional headquarters will serve the entire county of Cork, one eighth of the entire island.  The Minister of State can well imagine the additional demand on the station.  I imagine he will well understand the frustration locally, having seen little progress on this project for several years.  It is good that new energy is coming to it at this stage and I thank him for that.  Can he clarify who the different stakeholders are?  Who has been engaged at this stage?  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was to advance the public private partnership aspect of the project.  The agency was waiting for the Department of Justice and Equality to identify the project as a priority.  Is the project continuing as a PPP?  Has the NDFA engaged with the OPW?  Is the agency in a position to advance the project?</p>  <p>  The idea that the fire station project would in some way impede this project does not stand up; it is actually the other way around.  Cork County Council was able to advance the project, despite the fact that the council had to wait to get updates on the shared entrance.  Who are the different agencies involved?  Has the NDFA been given the go-ahead to drive on full tilt as a public private partnership?</p></speech>

The OPW has had meetings with the NDFA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, which is funding the project on a regular basis to progress it as part of a PPP.  Other agencies are involved as well.  There were long negotiations with Cork County Council regarding the shared access road.  Irish Water has concerns about the capacity required.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na upgraded this project significantly last year.  It is a completely different project, more than twice the size of what was originally intended.  We have multiple agencies involved and there is liaison with the county council over a road and the fire station.  We have a changing specification as well.  There are numerous complications.  The fact that the project only changed last year indicates that it will take some time.</p></speech>

We have seen so much lost time on the project over several years.  Could the fast-track process be used to move this along?

It is something that people on the left, including trade unionists and socialists, have argued for a long time would be a good measure.  It is even more appropriate now that we should consider introducing a four-day week given the pandemic and the vast numbers of people who have lost their jobs.  I am keen to hear the Minster's response to the proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-29a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900060#LLL01200"><p>I am aware of the FourDayWeek campaign led by F&oacute;rsa, ICTU and other civil society groups.  Many of the implications of this proposal need to be carefully considered for the entire labour force and not simply in the public service.  Indeed, any movement by the public service in isolation could have serious consequences for small and medium-sized businesses struggling in the face of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I will deal with the public services as the Deputy has asked.  However, I would first like to make the point that the State is already a good employer that offers staff considerable flexibility through the availability of, among other things, work sharing, flexible working hours, shorter working years, career breaks and now remote working.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister, I have to ensure that quality public services are delivered to the people in a manner that delivers value for money to the taxpayer.  There are two core issues associated with any transition to a four-day week for the public service.  The first is the cost to the taxpayer and the second is ensuring continuity of services to the public.  Estimating the full Exchequer cost of the proposal would be highly complex as it would encompass more than 342,000 public servants across almost 200 organisations.  At a very high level, paying people for four days but providing services to the citizen over five, and in some cases seven, days would add at least one fifth to the current pay bill of approximately &euro;20 billion.  That equates to an extra &euro;4 billion, which would have to be found to deliver the same level of services.  In reality, an extra &euro;4 billion is probably a conservative estimate as gaps would likely be filled though overtime payments and additional cover from agency staffing, both of which come at a considerable premium.  It is unclear how increased productivity alone could offset the cost in the context of keeping essential services open.  Practical issues will arise for the Garda, members of the fire brigade, nurses in hospitals and so on operating a four-day week.  I can go into that in a moment.</p></speech>

We got all the increased productivity.  However, instead of this improving the quality of life of workers, the opposite has happened.  We even had, as part of the austerity programme, the infamous Lansdowne Road hours, adding hours rather than reducing them.</p>  <p>  I do not accept that we would see a fall-off in services.  In fact, countries that have shorter working weeks have higher levels of productivity.  A happier workforce, one with a better quality of life, is a more productive workforce.  I believe the Minster is wrong in his argument.</p></speech>

In any event, there are real consequences for key parts of our public services.  Let us consider teachers for example.  Is Deputy Boyd Barrett suggesting that schools would only open for four days per week and not for five?  We need to think about the implications this would create for families, childcare issues and so on.  Other front-line services, including garda&iacute;, members of the fire service, nurses and doctors would be affected.  I am not at all clear on exactly how it would work in practice.</p>  <p>  There should be acknowledgement that the State is a good employer.  I have offered some examples, including the shorter working year, work sharing, flexitime, career breaks and, increasingly, remote working, which is a feature that is here to stay.  There is an ambition in the programme for Government to deliver that.</p></speech>

They have not had their pay restored and they are working longer hours.  Let us think about our nurses.</p> <p>They are overrun and underpaid and there is pay apartheid.  The same is true for our teachers, and there is pay apartheid even for the service officers and ushers here in the House, who are paid different rates depending on when they came into the place.  I would not, therefore, laud the treatment of public servants.  Some, perhaps, are very well paid and well treated, but others not so.</p> <p> That is a somewhat separate argument, and, of course, there are complexities and nuances to a four-day week, but it is about establishing the basic principle.  Once upon a time, the weekend was considered impossible and there was no such thing.  We then got a weekend because people fought for it, and society and the economy were better for it.  The very same principle can apply to the four-day week,s and it is not about cutting people's pay.</p></speech>

He put the question in the context of the public service only but this issue has to be examined in the round, for the private sector as well.  I am sure he is not suggesting one treatment for public servants while people working in shops, factories and offices would continue to work a five-day week-----</p></speech>

The Deputy said there were nuances and complexities, and there are very real ones, such as the example I gave of schools.  Does he suggest they should open for only four days a week?  This is an issue that would benefit from social dialogue.  We need to put a new structure in place to facilitate a full dialogue involving civic society, with employers, the public service, unions and other important stakeholders.</p></speech>

He outlined to the Department that he had been in touch with the OPW with regard to the necessary modernisation or upgrading of any of the Garda stations so chosen.  The Garda station in Bawnboy, my home village, was one of the six that it was decided to reopen and we were told work would commence in a relatively short time.

The OPW undertook technical surveys on the building and issued a report to Garda estate management on the works required, the indicative costs involved and a proposed layout.  The deliberative process between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW to finalise proposals is ongoing.  On final Garda sign-off, the office will prepare, submit and publicise the necessary Part 9 planning application and progress the procurement of works required to reopen the station, which is expected to take place in 2020.  In the interim, the OPW is arranging enabling works that are necessary prior to the removal of asbestos.</p></speech>

This is not a massive development; it is a relatively small-scale project.</p>  <p>  The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was very supportive of reopening Bawnboy Garda station when I put questions to him in the House on this issue in the past.  I think it was early in 2019 that, in response to a parliamentary question, he indicated that the station would reopen before the end of 2019.  Subsequently, in September 2019, the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Kevin Boxer Moran, indicated that the station would reopen by mid-2020.</p>  <p>  What progress has been made in this deliberative process in regard to getting plans finalised and construction commenced?</p></speech>

There was also a question about whether these stations should have married quarters attached to them when operational, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has yet to decide whether such accommodation is to be part of the functions of the reopened station.</p>  <p>  A fast-track application is being prepared under Part 9 and that is expected to happen this year.</p></speech>

It was only last week that the Garda Commissioner joined us at a meeting of the Cavan joint policing committee, where we spoke about the difficulties in policing a long land border with a different jurisdiction.  Bawnboy is a small village in west County Cavan with a rural community and it is a long way to the next Garda station.  At the time it was closed, I argued, along with the local community, for it to be reinstated and was very glad when the then Garda Commissioner announced it was one of the stations that would reopen.  The local community is anxious that the station be reinstated as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  What was brought home to very clearly during the recent Covid-19 pandemic was the value of community policing and the presence of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in our communities.  It is a comfort for communities when they know of the local Garda presence, which a local Garda station facilitates.  I ask the Minister of State to relay the message to officials at the OPW that we want movement on this as rapidly as possible.</p></speech>

Six stations were identified for reopening as part of the pilot programme, four of which have thus far reopened, with Bawnboy and Leighlinbridge the two that remain.  There has been progress on this but I appreciate the Deputy's point on the concerns of local people about having community policing in place.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to revert to him on the topic.</p></speech>

I want to know that we are going to go in the direction of recruitment to provide high-quality public services, rather than the cuts and understaffing that plague our public services.</p></reply>

We can all be proud of the great work that is under way during this unprecedented public health emergency.</p>  <p>  A number of reforms that have been introduced under the Government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda, such as the build-to-share ICT infrastructure, the progressive digitalisation of services, a streamlined and centralised Government procurement system, shared services and centralised strategic HR capability, have greatly facilitated our civil and public services in responding rapidly to the challenges emerging from the pandemic.  The current framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020, launched at the end of 2017, builds on earlier programmes of reform while expanding their scope to accelerate the digital delivery of public services, deliver better services to customers, drive innovation and develop our people and organisations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, who has responsibility in this area, is very keen to continue and develop further that ambitious programme.</p>  <p>  Our Department has begun consultations on developing a successor framework to Our Public Service 2020 and similar work is well advanced in framing a renewal plan for the Civil Service.  The vision and strategy underpinning this will focus on large-scale, ambitious transformation to support greatly enhanced digital service delivery, developing our data infrastructure and building the workforce and workplace of the future following the extraordinary changes that have taken place during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  On staffing levels, as the Deputy will be aware, significant increases in Government expenditure have allowed for the recruitment of additional staff across the public service since 2015.  Over the past four years alone, the number in the public service has increased by more than 30,000.</p></speech>

As that Government swung the austerity axe, the result was not more for less but a hell of a lot less at every level in our public services, to the point that we have nearly 1 million people waiting for procedures in hospitals, the lowest rate of ICU beds anywhere in Europe in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, the most overcrowded classrooms and waiting lists for housing maintenance, adaptations and developing Part 8 projects because of chronic understaffing.  All of the procurement policies and technological streamlining in the world do not substitute for the people who are needed to deliver services.  We are not being aggressive enough in recruiting the nurses, teachers, local authority workers and community and youth workers we need to deliver public services.</p></speech>

I asked for confirmation on some issues relating to the e-Government strategy which was meant to be updated.  I would like to get a timeline for that because it has become much more important in the time of Covid-19.

The Deputy is right that there were major cuts to numbers at the bottom or in the trough.  These left us with approximately 292,000 public servants and we now have about 343,000.  Recruitment in recent years has been essential to keep pace with demographic changes and undo some of the cuts that were imposed during those years.  We face great challenges and we are determined to continue with a programme of recruitment.  In the overall context, this has to be done in an affordable way.  As a result of decisions the Government has made since coming into office, we have seen the initiation of additional recruitment in key areas of the public service in recent months.  That will continue.</p></speech>

To allude to our earlier discussion, they suggest that there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Too much of the money is going to the chiefs and not enough is going to pay the people who deliver the front-line services.  Our ICU situation, for example, is terrifying.  It is not about beds because we have the beds and ventilators.  We do not have the staff because we have not recruited them or created the posts.  We are not creating the posts in nursing and we are not aiming to recruit enough teachers to reduce our class sizes to the level of those in Denmark, as opposed to having three times the ratio in Denmark.  We are desperately lacking outdoor workers in local authorities to do maintenance work, work in communities, fix the roads and do all of that kind of stuff.  There is a clear and obvious shortage of front-line public sector workers in the area of key service delivery and we need to respond to that.</p></speech>

The numbers speak for themselves, however.  The number of public servants has increased significantly and across the board, including in our health service, where we have well over 120,000 people working.  The winter plan we unveiled will involve additional recruitment.  This year alone, we are spending an extra &euro;3 billion on health because we have to do so and it is the right thing to do.  We are determined to ensure that we fund our health service properly for next year, not just to deal with the pandemic but also to deal once and for all with the deep-rooted structural problems in the health service and ensure it has the capacity, both in physical infrastructure, such as beds, and in the people needed to run the services.  We are determined to do that.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of recurring flooding in Kenmare and Sneem, County Kerry.  Most recently, at the end of July, we had serious flooding in Kenmare and Sneem.  While we also had flooding in other parts of south Kerry, it particularly affected those two locations.  I want to keep this matter high on the agenda.  I seek an update on progress on measures to alleviate flooding in these areas.</p></reply>

A steering group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Kerry County Council, is already in place to progress a number of schemes in County Kerry, including the Kenmare flood relief scheme.  Earlier this year, Kerry County Council appointed three additional technical and administrative staff to support the progression of these schemes.  These posts are being funded by the OPW to progress the schemes proposed for County Kerry under the flood risk management plans.</p>  <p>  Kenmare's scheme is due to be implemented as part of the first tranche of 60 new schemes that have been prioritised for implementation nationally, following the launch of the flood risk management plans by the Minister of State's office in May 2018, and the announcement of a &euro;1 billion investment in flood risk over the coming decade.  Potentially viable flood relief works for Kenmare, to be implemented as appropriate after project level assessment and planning, or exhibition and confirmation, would include fluvial flood defences comprising of walls and embankments on the Finnihy and Kealnagower rivers, and tidal flood defences comprising of walls, embankments and removable barriers.  The measures proposed also include the removal of the existing pipe under Finnihy Bridge.  Kerry County Council is on schedule to issue the request for tenders for engineering design consultants and environmental consultants, from the Office of Public Works framework of consultants, in October 2020.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the steering group has also proposed interim works that will involve the clearance of vegetation along a 600 m stretch of the Kealnagower river from the bridge at Aldi to where the Kealnagower river meets the Finnihy river, and a 600 m stretch of the Finnihy river from behind St. Claire&rsquo;s Convent to the footbridge downstream of Cornwell&rsquo;s Bridge.  This vegetation will need to be cleared to allow various surveys, site investigations and examinations of environmental baselines and so on to take place.  This will also involve the removal of debris that poses an immediate risk in a flood event of leading to blockages in bridges as was seen in the recent flooding event in Kenmare where a number of properties were flooded.  Subject to approval, this work will be completed before the end of the year.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the financial supports that were put in place for affected parties in the locality following the request I made in early August.  That is very important but it is critical that the tenders issue in October and we see consultants appointed.  I understand that the design phase will take up to 18 months before planning will be sought and the works commenced.  The fear in the areas of Kenmare and Sneem is that there will be a recurrence of serious flooding.</p>  <p>  I ask that the tender process be prioritised and there is no undue delay.  In respect of Sneem, I ask that similar priority be given to having the matter addressed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The response to the Covid-19 crisis was swift, with many civil and public servants transitioning to working from home at very short notice.  This was an unprecedented action but it was entirely necessary to ensure the health and well-being of staff across the system was protected as best we could.</p>  <p>  Most Departments and offices, including my Department, would have had remote access solutions or systems in place and issued mobile devices such as laptops and tablets before the pandemic.  In my Department, approximately 97% of staff are enabled to work from home, with most of the other client organisations of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer at between 80% to 95% staff remote working coverage.</p>  <p>  No additional expenditure allocations have been provided to Departments to facilitate working from home arrangements or flexible working hours across the Civil Service in response to Covid-19.  Any additional funding incurred by Departments, including in respect of information technology resources required, is to be met from within existing resources, and they have done so.  The management of resources in this regard is a matter for each individual Department and Minister.</p>  <p>  With regard to my Department specifically, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which is an office of the Department, has spent &euro;267,000 to date on capital equipment for the Department, including for itself, from its Vote.  The vast majority of this expenditure relates to facilitating staff to work remotely through the purchase of information technology equipment.  This cost is being met internally through existing capital budgets by reprioritising expenditure.  My Department has also spent &euro;22,000 on remote working equipment from its own Vote to date.</p></speech>

Coming from a rural county, I am excited by the possibilities afforded by remote working to a place like Kerry.  As I said, we will be dealing with Covid-19 for a long time.</p>  <p>  I have a concern about contacting some Departments, although none of these is the Minister's Department.  There is a difficulty in our office getting through to some Departments.  When we got through to one we were told it was like a ghost town and when calls were transferred, nobody answered the phone.  There is nothing on the websites to indicate that phones are not being answered and that only emails will be responded to.  I wonder if extra facilities or staffing can be put in place to ensure the same level of service is maintained across all Departments.  For example, staff in a school in Kerry contacted the Department to try to find out what was happening with broadband and were advised to contact their local representative.  The staff did that somewhat reluctantly, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Remote working brings certain opportunities for the regions and for individuals it may open career opportunities that people thought may not be possible.  A degree of remote working is here to stay and we must think about what is the right balance both for the employer, the public servant and the public services being provided.  There is also the issue of cities if large numbers of people are not based in or working in them.</p>  <p>  I will take up the matter of maintaining public services as we must ensure, insofar as it is possible, that services are maintained even in the extraordinary circumstances in which we work.  If phone calls are systematically not being answered, I will look into the matter.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has visited these areas and people's lives are being affected there.  Houses in Coonagh were flooded and residents are now getting back into their homes.  The people of King's Island are waiting on a large project to get under way.  Funding has been allocated to Castleconnell village, which has been repeatedly flooded over a number of years.  This extends down to the Mountshannon Road and into Annacotty village.  Montpelier is also affected.</p></reply>

I thank him for raising the question of the status of flood relief schemes in Limerick city and its environs, including Coonagh, King's Island and Castleconnell.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister of State is very familiar with the areas in question.  On 15 September, in the company of officials from Limerick City and County Council and the Office of Public Works, he visited Coonagh to view the area where the embankments were breached.  From there he visited King's Island and received updates on these projects.</p>  <p>  The evidence provided by the catchment flood risk and assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which was launched by the Office of Public Works in May 2018, supports the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion planned investment to complete 151 flood relief schemes through the national development plan up to 2027 as part of Project 2040.  Since May 2018, the number of flood relief schemes under design and construction by the OPW in partnership with local authorities has increased to approximately 90.  These include schemes in King's Island, Limerick city and its environs and Castleconnell.  Together with the 46 schemes already completed or substantially completed, including a number of localised schemes within Limerick city, this means that the OPW and local authorities have completed or are now actively working on projects to protect 80% of those properties to be protected in this decade.</p>  <p>  There is currently in place a joint Limerick City and County Council and OPW steering group for delivery of schemes in County Limerick.  The OPW has agreed to fund two engineering resources and a senior staff officer in Limerick to work on delivery of the schemes.  The senior executive engineer and senior staff officer are now in place and the executive engineer post is to be filled.  A project brief for the procurement of engineering and environmental consultants to develop a flood relief scheme for Limerick city was advertised on the e-tenders platform in July 2020.  It is intended to appoint consultants in December 2020.  Once consultants are appointed to progress the flood relief scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme.</p></speech>

I accompanied the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, on his tour of Limerick and the flood relief projects in Coonagh and King's Island that have been mentioned.  He is also very familiar with Castleconnell, the Mountshannon Road, Annacotty and Montpelier, as well as the projects throughout Limerick city.</p>  <p>  I welcome that additional staff are to be appointed.  I ask that the appointment of design teams be expedited, although I know the design team is already in place for Castleconnell.  These matters must be rectified as quickly as possible and I welcome the Minister of State's commitment in the House today.</p></speech>

I was worried that we would not get to the question.  We will not get enough time to discuss it.  The Minister of State has already answered the question by saying the new strategy will be updated in the first quarter of next year.  I know it might not seem like a very important matter, but so many of my constituents are now dealing with Government services and local authorities via electronic means such as email.  When it does not work out for them it gets very difficult.  We as Deputies should not have to be the middlemen between our constituents and Government services.  A great strategy was in place for this important area.  I had some involvement in it years ago.</p>  <p>  The private sector is adopting a lot of new technologies which open multiple pathways of communication.  One feature of private sector practice which I do not like is the use of algorithms or bots to answer questions so that a customer does not actually deal with a real person.  I do not think public services should go down that road because it will not be to the satisfaction of the people involved.</p></reply>

I have only found it to be a frustrating experience.  When people interact with public services and public bodies they should interact with an individual where possible, including through the use of email and phones.  That new strategy is very important.  It is great to see a new Minister of State who is able to take charge and drive that strategy, because in small ways it has a big impact on lots of people throughout the country.</p></speech>
