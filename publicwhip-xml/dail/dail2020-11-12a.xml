How many tests will each major port and airport be able to carry out daily?  What will the timeframe involved?  There is some indication that testing will start today at Cork and Shannon airports.  When will testing be up and running elsewhere?</p></reply>

In light of this, any testing for international travel will need to draw on resources from the private sector, which are not being accessed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The testing regime envisaged under the Government decision for international travel will be implemented through the private supply of testing availability in Ireland.  This will include: testing post arrival, from day five, for passengers from EU orange or red list locations; and testing for departing passengers who need or wish to complete a pre-departure test requirement before travelling to another country.</p>  <p>  Subject to the ongoing review of testing by National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the Government, a Covid-19 PCR, test is currently the only test that is accepted for the purposes of allowing the advice relating to restricted movement to be waived.  Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, and antigen testing.</p>  <p>  Shannon and Cork airports have indicated that drive-through testing will be available today for passengers and the public.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has indicated that the provision of testing at Dublin Airport by private providers can be increased within weeks.  Testing at Dublin Airport will be undertaken by two providers by means of a drive-through facility and a walk-through facility at the airport.  The DAA has advised that the testing offer by the providers will be reasonably priced, within what is generally available on the market.  As there can be no certainty that capacity will be available to meet all possible requirements, intending passengers who wish to avail of testing should seek an appointment before travelling.</p></reply>

Many people are looking towards Christmas and want to know what testing regime will be in place.  How does the Government plan to advise people on foreign travel for the Christmas period?  Some 1.2 million people travelled through Dublin Airport during the Christmas period last year.  That is a significant number.  There is a demand for people to come home to Ireland and for people to travel abroad to their home countries for Christmas.  What advice can the Minister of State give to people at this stage?  How will travel be managed and constrained, if that is what is intended?  The current position is that there should be no non-essential travel.  The public health advice is quite clear.  This is a dynamic situation and it is changing, but we know that NPHET has been quite consistent with the public health advice.  I do not see it changing significantly, but I ask how the Government intends to manage the demand that will exist and to balance it with the public health advice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200003#A00800"><p>As Deputy O'Rourke is aware, we are listening to the advice of NPHET at the moment.  We are at level 5.  We have aligned ourselves with the EU traffic-light approach.  People who come to this country from a red-list country will be asked to restrict their movements for 14 days.  After five days, they can avail of PCR tests here.  Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and the private sector will be rolling out testing facilities.  Travellers coming from orange list countries will be asked to take a test three days in advance of travelling.  If they do not do that, they can also avail of the test here within five days, as per red list passengers.  Again, it is about people taking personal responsibility when they come here and adhering to the local public health advice.</p>  <p>  Regarding some of the expected volumes, the DAA testing plan across Dublin and Cork airports has estimated the volume to be approximately 150 tests per day, ramping up to a total of 300 tests per day towards the end of the year.  The DAA has also identified capacity in the private sector testing market of up to 12,000 PCR tests per day.</p></speech>

At this stage, if someone is planning for Christmas, is the Government maintaining the position that people should seriously consider planning for a different type of Christmas?  Is the Government suggesting that people should give serious consideration to whether they need to travel at all if they have an alternative to stay where they are?  If very large numbers of people come back to the country, that will have significant public health implications, particularly as the passenger locator form and the testing regime are not entirely adequate.</p></speech>

Whatever we do at national level with the health protocols, there is a level of responsibility on anyone who is planning to travel here for essential work or who is returning home for Christmas to visit family, relatives and friends.</p> <p>It is in our interests to ensure that we act responsibly, that such persons take a PCR test in advance if they are coming from an orange-listed country and again after five days for people coming from a red-listed country.  We need to await the advice.  We do not know where we will be with this virus, which is moving in a positive direction.  The Deputy can be assured that the high-level governmental group will be watching international travel and will be working with the CMO on the travel advice.  For people who are travelling, the DAA has established a webpage with details of airport testing availability.  I ask passengers to look at that as well as <i>gov.ie</i>for the advice the Government will be giving.</p></speech>

I am talking about people who are aggressive and targeting the majority of our citizens who are doing the right thing.  Under the level 5 restrictions, only essential workers and schoolgoing children are advised to use public transport.  They are the ones we need to protect most to keep everything going.  They are the ones who in small but very worrying circumstances are being targeted.</p></reply>

We all recognise that the continued operation of the public transport sector is important, which is why it has been designated among the essential services that have carried on throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that essential transport services and passengers utilising these services are protected and supported.  I assure the Deputy that public health advice has closely guided the introduction of measures across the public transport system to improve journey safety for the passengers, including people travelling to work to provide front-line and other essential services, and for the transport staff who operate the services.  I again take the opportunity to thank public transport operators and their staff for their commitment in providing this vital service in these challenging times. </p>  <p>  The measures taken to enable the continued operation of services more safely during the pandemic include enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.  Social distancing is currently supported through the reductions in the number of passengers that the buses and trains can carry during the various risk levels under the Government's living with Covid plan.</p>  <p>  The safety measures also include the regulations requiring the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, which came into effect on Monday, 13 July, and were recently extended to June 2021.  These regulations require passengers, with some exceptions, to wear face coverings while utilising public transport giving additional protection to both passengers and transport staff.</p>  <p>  The regulations are implementable by a relevant person who is defined as any officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  A relevant person implementing the regulations can seek the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where needed.  Where a passenger is not wearing a face covering, a relevant person under the regulations may request the passenger to wear a face covering, refuse the passenger entry to the public transport vehicle or request the passenger to alight from the vehicle.  Failure to comply is an offence and there are penalties on summary conviction for non-compliance. </p>  <p>  In excess of 95% of passengers are wearing masks.  Compliance is very high across all public transport operators.  This has worked and is working.  We want to ensure it continues to work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200004#B00600"><p>I absolutely agree.  Compliance is incredible because the people of Ireland are incredible.  They are doing an amazing job during this incredibly difficult year.</p>  <p>  My question is focused at the very small group of anti-mask protesters who, when they are active on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, are targeting either, the people in this House and people on public transport.  The difference is that we get protected by garda&iacute; and we get barriers.  Passengers on the Luas red line which serves St. James's Hospital are sitting ducks and can go nowhere.  They are in an enclosed space and are being threatened physically and verbally.  It is frightening enough at any time, but during the Covid pandemic it is doubly if not trebly so.  The workers on public transport and the passengers need to be protected.  The garda&iacute; need to be protected.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to wave a magic wand and solve the issue, but it needs to be raised in this House.  We must call this fascism out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200004#B00700"><p>I agree that it needs to be called out.  The behaviour during the recent protests on Luas journeys, to which I believe the Deputy is referring, was despicable.  That is not what the Irish people represent.  The vast majority are complying.  It was an insult and an attack on the vast majority of Irish people on that Luas on that day.  There are mechanisms that allow a public transport operator or driver to call in support from the Garda.  My information from talking to the authorities in this regard is that it has worked very well on any occasion to date when it needed to be used.  The Garda is taking the approach that we are in this together.  It is not policing with a heavy hand and the public transport operators similarly have not done that.  I think in the incidents the Deputy referred to a specific complaint was not made in time for those operations to come into play, but they are in place.  I support and reiterate the Deputy's call for us to stand up for the Irish people and call out those incidents where they take place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200004#B00800"><p>Based on my discussions with the Garda, I am confident that it is dealing with this group as best it can.  We cannot remain silent over the actions of a very small minority when the actions of the vast majority, who have suffered so much throughout 2020, are so compliant.  If they are asked to cocoon and stay at home, they are doing that.  The people required to take public transport provide essential services, such as going to Dublin Port to ensure goods are coming in, working on the front line in hospital and teaching in our schools.  These are the people who are on the front line and are using our public transport.  They need to know that we, in this House, do not stand for this kind of fascist behaviour and will always stand up against it.  While it may be a very small number of incidents, when they happen, they are frightening, threatening and intolerable.  I thank the Minister for his answer.  I am sure we will work together on this on all sides of the House.</p></speech>

It is a sign of respect as well as good public health practice.  It is a modest statement of respect for other people.  Irrespective of one's political views, outlook or ideology, how could one stand against such an expression of courtesy and respect to others?  Whatever our differences, people deserve that from each other.  That is why I think the vast majority of Irish people have bought into it and do not turn it into something completely different which turns into disrespect and discourtesy to other people.  Where would be the sense of that?  Where is the logic?  What is to be gained from that?</p></speech>

The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has indicated that more than 93,000 learner drivers are waiting to sit their tests.  The problem has been deteriorating over the year and has increased by 70% since June of this year.  What measures are being taken to address this?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200004#B01300"><p>Covid-19 has created difficulties for many public services, including the National Driver Licensing Service, NDLS and the driver testing service, which are provided by the Road Safety Authority.</p>  <p>  Closures during the initial lockdown earlier this year led inevitably to backlogs, while restrictions on the services, which are necessary in the interests of public health, have reduced capacity since the services reopened.  The urgent health necessity which led to level 5 restrictions in October will have a further impact.  This cannot be avoided, and no one will question that we must put public safety first. </p>  <p>  In the case of the NDLS, all appointments must be booked in advance and the RSA is working with its providers to see how they can create additional capacity by making more evening and weekend hours available, the recruitment of additional staff, extending its postal service for those who are over 70 years, and expanding the online system from 9 November.  The introduction of these steps will help ease some of the pressure, free up appointment slots and make it easier to apply online or find slots at local centres.  </p>  <p>  Driver testing always presented the greatest difficulties when operating under Covid-19 restrictions.  Backlogs and waiting times will be addressed ultimately by increased capacity.</p> <p>My Department recently approved the retention of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the rehiring of another 18 testers whose contracts expired in May.  In addition, my Department is in discussion with the RSA, on putting a more comprehensive plan in place to address the backlog.  While discussions are well-advanced, there are no quick fixes, and the RSA estimates that it will be end of next year before we are back to the long-standing target of a ten-week wait period.</p> <p> I am aware that some driving instructors have expressed dissatisfaction that they are currently not permitted to enter the test centres.  Currently only people who absolutely need to enter a test centre can do so to minimise the risk.  While this is an operational matter for the RSA, it is a decision the authority has taken in the interests of public health and safety, and not least that of the instructors, as well as those undergoing the tests, and the staff.</p></speech>

A total of18 additional testers have been hired.  Has the option of extended working days, including testing on Sundays, evenings and early mornings, to expand the capacity been considered?  To what extent has that been explored, and how quickly will the Minister of State's deliberations with the RSA or the RSA's investigation into expanding capacity be concluded?  How soon can we expect to see a new regime in place?</p></speech>

The authority is working with its providers to see how it can do just exactly what the Deputy has outlined in regarding to extending weekend hours, overtime, the recruitment of additional staff as well as extending the postal service.  It will need that extra capacity in terms of resources, but, at the same time, the throughput at the testing centres must be managed at all times.  Many of the centres are small spaces, so that also needs to be managed in relation to the waiting areas.  To give an idea of where we have come from, pre-Covid the waiting period was six and a half weeks whereas at the moment an applicant can expect to wait to between 25 and 30 weeks.  It is a very difficult situation, but we are trying to prioritise essential workers at the moment, and there is an email address to which essential workers can write, namely, urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by driving instructors over the past number of weeks who have been refused entry to driving testing centres.  Yesterday, I was sent a video to my phone from the west of Ireland, showing female and male driving instructors in rain that was falling horizontally and they were outside with a collapsable chair and an umbrella.  That is what they were left with.  They had no access to toilet facilities, warmth or sanitisation facilities.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  I raised this issue with the Minister of State at a committee meeting on 21 October 2020 and nothing has improved since.  UNITE is on the case, and fair play to the union.  There is a simple resolution.  A dog would not be treated like this.  The Government can intervene and the Minister of State or a senior Minister can intervene to resolve this issue at the flick of a switch.  I am asking for that to be done, and for a commitment to be given to the instructors.  I will send the Minister of State the video so that she can see it at first hand.  Nobody would stand over it.</p></speech>

I know that in normal times, not just driving instructors, but somebody accompanying the learner driver doing their test, would normally be facilitated to wait in the waiting room in the driving test centres.  However, these are not normal times.  I take on board the Deputy's concerns in this regard.  They are trying to minimise the throughput and the interaction at test centres, but I will speak to the RSA to see if further measures can be implemented.  We are trying to adhere to public health guidelines and keep the testers, the learner drivers doing their tests and the staff within the centres, safe, and that also includes those who are accompanying the learner drivers.</p></speech>

Indeed, they are not just along that line; they are along the Kildare line as well.  For example, the combined population of Naas, Newbridge, Sallins and other towns is in excess of 60,000, which puts pressure on the N7.  A more sustainable type of transport is required.

It is important to set out what it will deliver.  It will double the capacity of the network in the greater Dublin area; it will mean approximately 70% of all journeys on the entire national rail network will be on electrified track and it will enable sustainable, transport-orientated development at key locations along the network.  These are all hugely ambitious and  important outcomes and I know the Deputy recognises and welcomes the benefits DART+ will bring to the greater Dublin area, and I am glad that she supports it.</p><p>DART + has its origins in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area<i>, </i>which sets out the geographic scope of the programme and the high-level strategic rationale.  The development of transport strategies is a fundamentally important part of how we can improve transport in Ireland.  They allow us develop an evidence-based and plan-led approach to transport infrastructure and transport services and, importantly, integrate with land-use planning to shape the location of housing and commercial development.  </p><p>I think we can agree on two further points.  First, we need to deliver on the strategies and not just develop them, and that means delivering the likes of DART+.  Second, we need to keep requirements under review and, where necessary, consider whether additional projects and programmes are needed.  That means we should push ahead with delivering DART+ as set out, while consulting people as is currently under way, and refining issues that may be raised during those consultations.  We also need to think about whether additional projects and programmes might need to be considered, and that is where the review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area and, indeed, the review of the national development plan, NDP, have a role to play.</p><p>I look forward to seeing DART+ progress and, likewise, I look forward to the review processes in respect of both the strategy and the NDP, where some of the additional measures that the Deputy has mentioned could be considered.</p></speech>

Kilcock is not as far from the city centre as Balbriggan, and there can be a mindset in relation to counties and geography.  The population there is growing.  The turning circle is 450 m away from that town, and it would seem obvious that the doubling of the line there is going to be a prerequisite to ultimately delivering the electrification project.</p>  <p>  There is a more difficult scenario in Greystones from an engineering perspective, but there is a sizeable population in the area  It is about thinking beyond the announcement, which is very welcome, and I concur that public consultation is required on the detail, particularly in respect of bridge lifts and how they are carried out.  I am absolutely supportive of the project.  It needs to be even more ambitious than it currently is.  It is the next phase that I am trying to expand on.</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, a similar expansion of the section from Bray to Greystones has more complexities because of the geography, the tunnel and the coastal aspect.  There may be mechanisms, for example, using short sections of double track, or others that could be used.  We could increase the frequency to have a DART running every 20 minutes, using some of those interim measures.</p> <p>There is a wider review that needs to be done of that entire route because of the need for coastal defences against sea erosion.  That is a bigger issue for the southern route from Greystones, but the whole line requires significant review, arising, first and foremost, out of the coastal defence issues.</p></speech>

I understand the intention is to increase capacity but not frequency.</p>  <p>  In regard to costs, people living in Kilcock, for example, seeing that there is a much better service from Maynooth, will choose to drive there to access public transport.  That puts pressure on car parking spaces and involves making part of the journey in a less sustainable way.  The totality of costs must be looked at and that should include, for instance, the cost of providing surface space for car parking.  That space must be provided when people are required to travel to access a service.  The totality of costs needs to be considered when looking at the cost of doubling the line.</p></speech>

I hope to do the same in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  We want to move towards transport-led development that would see new housing being built within a walk or short cycle of the major public transport infrastructure in which we are going to invest.  One of the main reasons we are making that investment is the benefits it will give in terms of improved quality of life, shorter commuting times, more sustainable, lower-emissions transport, better local environments and an improved public realm.  The reality is that we have been going in completely the other direction.  Half of new housing in the State in recent years was built in the counties surrounding Dublin and not located close to public transport nodes or other sustainable transport options.  At the same time as we undertake the DART+ project and start implementing the other investments, the local authorities need to start reviewing their development plans in order to ensure that, instead of new development spreading out everywhere, we start building closer to the public transport nodes we are going to implement.  It is in this context that investment in an upgrade to the Kilcock service could make real sense.</p></speech>

Since the publication of the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 study and the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO analysis shows there is more than sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the roll-on, roll off - ro-ro - network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the land bridge traffic, which is currently estimated at approximately 150,000 trucks per annum.  It is also considered that the shipping industry is resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.</p><p>My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019.  We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to continental Europe, they will respond.  Significant additional shipping links have been added on direct routes to the Continent, even during the Covid-19 pandemic in summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place from January next.  Indeed, in the past week, we have seen moves from Irish Ferries and Stena Line to change and increase their direct sailings to Cherbourg from January.  Those changes mean that, between them, there will be a daily service from Ireland to France, resulting in a further increase in capacity on that direct continental Europe route.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Minister and I met with the shipping companies regarding maritime connectivity in mid-July of this year.  I met with them again recently to discuss this issue further.  The companies confirmed the reassurance already given regarding their ability to respond to demand as needed.  This engagement is in addition to the fortnightly meetings which take place between officials in my Department and the shipping companies as well as separately with haulage representatives.  My Department has also had confidential briefings with individual shipping companies in which they have outlined a range of options they can implement quickly from January, if required.</p><p>The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would likely undermine a market response and result in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place.  Such an intervention would be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers, breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid.  It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market.</p><p>A communications campaign is currently under way, ACT Now and Prepare to Switch, which encourages importers and exporters to focus immediately on the direct route option.  The campaign encourages stakeholders to assess their current routes to market, communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies and trial alternative services in order that disruption to the British land bridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.</p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor and review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports.  We will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.</p></reply>

Hauliers contested the conclusions that were drawn in it, particularly in regard to ro-ro capacity.  They also pointed out that we do not have daily ferry connections.  When I raised this issue previously with the Minister of State, she said that individual hauliers should contact ferry companies to try to stoke up demand.  I take it from her reply that the ferry companies are responding to this demand and that we will have daily direct-to-the-Continent departures and arrivals from January.</p></speech>

As recently as last week, Stena Line and Irish Ferries both indicated that they will be putting on a daily direct service from January.  Indeed, they have been responding to demand throughout the pandemic and they put on extra services during the summer.  The Minister and I met with representatives of the shipping companies last July and I met with them again last week.  My officials have had fortnightly meetings with all stakeholders in the maritime sector and we have been assured that they will respond to demand.  The ACT Now and Prepare to Switch campaign is not just a call on the hauliers but also on importers and exporters to engage directly with shipping companies in regard to their needs.</p></speech>

A huge amount of work has gone into this over the past number of years.  There have been many campaigns aimed at preparing businesses, including hauliers, for customs checks.  I thank the haulage industry representatives for their ongoing engagement with my Department.  We know that the situation from 1 January will not be easy and there will be delays at the UK land bridge.  That is why our ACT Now and Prepare to Switch campaign is asking importers and exporters to assess their needs in respect of the direct routes to the Continent, communicate with the shipping industry and trial alternative routes in advance of 1 January.  I have been engaging as well with the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, Deputy Troy, in calling for businesses to prepare in the two months remaining before the start of the new year.</p></speech>

First and foremost in any discussion of micromobility must be pedestrianisation.  We have to create safe conditions for pedestrians.  This will involve better footpaths, easier zebra crossings and a whole range of different measures.  Micromobility also includes cycling and these new e-bikes.  These are fantastic because they extend the range people can travel and make cycling easier for people with less ability or in different age groups.  The technology is improving dramatically and the cost is coming down.  I am, however, speaking about ordinary bikes as well.  </p>  <p>  There is a revolution taking place in transport which leads towards this type of transport system.  We need to start shaping the rest of the transport system around it so that the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and students going to college on an e-scooter is prioritised.  The heavier actors in transport have to take care if we are to create a safe environment for those mobile modes.  I very much support the Deputy's comments.  I give notice of our intention to regulate for e-scooters, an intention mentioned in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that I am pushing an open door.  The directly-elected mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, introduced and appointed a cycling commissioner, Chris Boardman, the first UK Olympian to win a medal for cycling, which he did at the Barcelona Olympics.  The Minister could do worse than to consider the appointment of a micromobility commissioner for Dublin.  Such a person could really drive the agenda across the four Dublin local authorities, which have shown mixed responses to the need for micromobility.  The Minister will be familiar with Dublin City Council's approach, which has been really proactive, as has that of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  My county council, South Dublin County Council, has been behind in this regard.  The Minister could consider such an appointment.</p>  <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with, and strongly welcome, the Minister's comments on the need for a hierarchy of responsibility on our roads, as is legislated for on the Continent.  The Minister might outline if he has any plans to back up such a hierarchy with legislation.</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority, NTA, is the lead authority in designing and implementing the city transport strategy.  An example of this is the BusConnects project.  Its implementation will not be without difficulties.  I was speaking to Deputy Lahart's constituency colleague, Deputy Duffy, last night in Rathfarnham.  The Deputy will be aware of the granular detail but, in general, this scheme, although it is called BusConnects, will completely transform the city for the better as regards cycling.  We are in the third round of consultation now and, during the process, the scheme changed from one which was very traditional and heavily orientated towards traffic to one which promotes pedestrian, cyclist and e-mobility safety structures.  It is critical that this scheme be introduced, although it may need further amendment in respect of very local specific issues.  The broad outline of the plan seems right to me.  The authority has done good work in the consultation.  We do not need a tsar; we need to implement what we have.</p></speech>

Returning to the legislation, pedestrians give out about cyclists, cyclists give out about car drivers and car drivers give out about heavy goods vehicles.  We should legislate for a hierarchy of responsibility so that truck and bus drivers would be responsible for smaller motor vehicles, cars would be responsible for smaller vehicles such as bikes and e-scooters, and everyone would be responsible for pedestrians.  Legislation of this kind exists in other countries.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister will appreciate the concept of cyclovia, which has been introduced in other capitals and which began in Colombia.  It involves cities holding car-free days.  In Dublin, this might include those areas within the canal cordon.  It would be held once a month.  This is a small request to make and there should not be any obstacles in the way.  We shut the area down for the marathon once a year.  Can the Minister imagine the activity that would be generated in the capital, particularly during the period of Covid restrictions, with regard to pedestrian movements if we implemented cyclovia in Dublin once a month?</p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to the Phoenix Park, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  There has been great public movement with regard to bikes and pedestrians.  Can we return to pedestrian movement only in the Phoenix Park, even if only on weekends?  If we could do so even just for Sundays, it would be a gesture towards those who support micromobility.</p></speech>

One of my heroes is a former mayor in Colombia, Enrique Pe&ntilde;alosa, who transformed the city of Bogot&aacute; into a cycling and walking city.  He is like something out of a Mario Vargas Llosa novel, a romantic.  He has said that pavements are for kissing and that man and woman are to walking what fish are to swimming.  He had a romantic vision of how cities and streets should be designed.  It is a social project because it is a project for everyone.</p>  <p>  On the matter of the hierarchy approach, every tier must be designed around people with disabilities.  This is the case for public transport, pavements and other infrastructure.  When one designs for people with disabilities, one also designs for parents with a buggy and two or three kids, for older people and for people like poor old Deputy Chambers, who currently has a broken foot.  When one designs in that way, one gets better transport systems that work better in every way.  They are more efficient and more effective.  That is the metric.  One starts with disability and works from the pedestrian and the cyclist up, just as Deputy Lahart has said.</p></speech>

I was glad that it was included in the strategy in the end.  We are all very aware that it will not happen overnight, although I would like it to happen sooner than is scheduled.  In the meantime, is there scope for bus rapid transit along those corridors?  I think of the Glider system in Belfast.  This is a very eye-catching and attractive system which could potentially be very suitable for Cork.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200007#E01400"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I absolutely agree with him.  We mentioned Dublin earlier, but Cork also needs a sustainable transport system.  The Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, takes the right approach.  It adopts a multi-modal approach to transport planning, provides the necessary evidence-based and plan-led framework and is an example of good long-term planning.</p>  <p>  Now that we have the strategy, we have to move on to implementation.  I am glad to say that a number of important steps are already under way in that regard, while the review of the national development plan will also have an important role to play.  The CMATS was published earlier this year and includes a number of significant public transport proposals across bus, commuter rail and light rail as well as a proposed transformation of active travel infrastructure in the city region.</p>  <p>  The Deputy specifically referred to bus rapid transit.  He will be aware that the approach adopted for buses in the CMATS is similar to that proposed in Dublin, namely, the delivery of a BusConnects Cork programme of improved bus and active travel infrastructure.  BusConnects is not only about making the bus system better, it is about completely transforming Cork's potential.  Complementing that investment, it is also proposed to develop a light rail service running on an east to west corridor across the city and, in advance of its introduction, BusConnects Cork will deliver a high-capacity, high-frequency bus corridor along the route.</p>  <p>  I will go into the detail of that proposal, if I may.  We would hope that the route from Ballincollig would take in Cork Institute of Technology, Cork University Hospital, University College Cork and would go right through the centre, the business district and out towards Blackrock and Mahon via the docks.  This would connect a great many key areas and desired lines.</p> <p>We should accelerate and look to advance this good CMATS.  It would be the councillors who have to decide this but I do not see why we could not introduce this high quality bus rapid transport route along that corridor in advance of the light rail going in.  We could build up the demand and give the signal to developers that this is where to go.  The council has to row in behind this.  I had a good meeting last week with Cork city councillors and I think they are ready for it.</p></speech>

There is a widespread acceptance in the city and the surrounding areas that to achieve the population growth we want in the city and the region, we cannot just keep piling more cars into the south link road and into the city centre.  It will not work and it will not be able to develop in the way we want it to.  Bus rapid transit is not an immediate overnight win but it is potentially a quicker win than the light rail and it can happen along the same corridors.</p>  <p>  One point I would make on the corridors is that a lot of the main services and industries are along that east-west corridor, as well as facilities such as the hospitals and universities, but an awful lot of the population spreads north-south.  The failure to look at a north-south link connecting the north side and the south side, which is a desirable objective in any event, but potentially connecting that line to populations north and south of it, is something that should have been explored in CMATS and should continue to be explored because otherwise, people in Blackpool, Douglas, Mayfield or Togher will not benefit from the advantages of this corridor.</p></speech>

There is the other main spine on the north side.  Introducing a suburban rail service from Midleton right the way through to Mallow with eight stations also needs to be accelerated.  It was in the plan but it was further out.  These projects might need to come first and one of the benefits of coming first is that we get transport-led development of Cork.  Cork has been hollowed out as everyone moved to Carrigaline, Ballincollig or further afield.  We need to bring life back into the centre of Cork and I mention the Mahon to Ballincollig route and the Mallow to Midleton route.  There is potential for huge development in the docklands on one side of the Lee on the old Dunlop site and on the Tivoli docks on the other side.  That would be dramatic.  I would put a cycling and foot bridge across the river there.  We have to hold back on getting more road connections but some of those connections would provide a strong development to Cork right on the river and close to the centre.  It would be a spectacular place to live.</p></speech>

I have to say I am impressed with the Minister's knowledge of Cork geography.  He is able to rhyme off place names but if he can visualise the chunk of the city I am talking about, it will not benefit from that corridor.</p>  <p>  It is positive to see a delivery office set up for the docklands.  That will be a crucial area to CMATS and the transport links.  Cork Chamber of Commerce has been asking for a delivery office for CMATS.  That is logical but so far it has not been delivered.  Would the Minister be willing to agree to a delivery office for CMATS based in Cork?</p></speech>

My father grew up on Victoria Road.  I know Cork well.  The Deputy is right about Togher, Douglas and that whole area.  That is on the BusConnects route too.  It is not just that east-west corridor that needs to be built.  There are north-south corridors.  It is central to the BusConnects plan in CMATS so it is not just that one route.  North-South public transport corridors are needed and BusConnects can do it.  We can see it in Dublin.  It provides the capacity and it will really serve the city well.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has been involved with the city council in setting up that office.  The Deputy mentioned that both the city council and the NTA have been saying they need to work together so they could probably house that office together.  It is ready to go.  In my mind it needs additional funding and we will look at that.</p></speech>

It will go from a few times a week to a daily service but it seems from media reports that there will not be access for foot passengers on these services, which would be a huge missed opportunity in getting people who want to go to mainland Europe out of planes and onto a much more sustainable mode of travel, namely ferries.</p></reply>

I understand that the Deputy's question was prompted by the announcement last Thursday regarding increased service frequencies on roll-on roll-off passenger, RoPax, ferry services from Ireland to France from January 2021 and by the publication of the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, report regarding capacity on continental services.</p>  <p>  With the Brexit transition period coming to an end on 31 December and the resultant delays that are expected on the UK land bridge, I welcomed the IMDO report which found that there was more than sufficient spare capacity to accommodate any displaced land bridge traffic on direct routes to the continent.  I also welcome the decision by both Irish Ferries and Stena Line to increase the frequency of their services to France in January 2021, providing more capacity and options to both business and passengers.</p>  <p>  Ferry operators providing services on Ireland to France routes are private companies and any decision to restrict access to vehicle traffic only is a commercial decision made by the companies.  While one operator does restrict access to foot passengers over the winter months, there are and will continue to be alternative foot passenger options to France available all year round.  These options easily cover the demand there is for foot passengers on this route which is reported as negligible at present.  Covid-19 did lead to additional foot passenger capacity restrictions on some services in 2020.  This was based on operators having significantly reduced capacity to meet health protocols and facilitate social distancing onboard ships, which reduced the cabin numbers available for sale.  These operators report that they expect to be back to normal capacity in 2021, when they will welcome foot passengers on their French services as normal.</p></speech>

It is free not to do it and it does not do it in circumstances where it does not think it is profitable.  A consequence of that is increased CO2 emissions but from the point of view of capitalism, that is just another externality and not something it is concerned with.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the Irish Ferries Dublin to Cherbourg sailings on the MS Epsilon ferry generally do not accept foot passengers both ways.  Sometimes, one may be able to get to France as a foot passenger but one might not be able come back via the same route.  It is the Dublin to Cherbourg route that is being touted for expansion to a daily service.  Unfortunately the Minister of State is not able to tell me that foot passengers will be able to access daily services to France and that is what is necessary.</p></speech>

Brittany Ferries is expected to provide services from Rosslare to Cherbourg and from Cork to Roscoff from March to October of next year.  Both Irish Ferris and Stena Line carry foot passengers during the peak period every year.  However, Stena Line carries foot passengers all year around.  As the Deputy has outlined, Irish Ferries does not carry foot passengers over the winter period only, when it has an alternative vessel on the route which is more suitable to carry freight.  It is understood that is for health and safety reasons.</p>  <p>  On the programme for Government, there is a commitment in place that we will work to ensure that ferry companies provide access for foot passengers without cars and the Department will shortly start engagement with Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort, the Port of Cork and the relevant shipping companies to ascertain the situation with regard to facilitating foot passengers.</p></speech>

It means putting on a minibus to bring people from the boat to the ferry terminal or just providing a safe route for people to walk.  Especially in the context of subsidies being provided for private companies to encourage them to put on ferries to avoid the so-called British land bridge, it would be crazy not to insist that there is access for foot passengers on these ferries.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>generated per passenger in respect of a foot passenger on a ferry, with CO<sub>2</sub>emissions of 8 g/km, and a passenger on a long-haul flight, who uses more than ten times that amount, with CO<sub>2</sub>emissions of 102 g/km.  It makes all the sense in the world to do that.  That also underlines the need for Irish Ferries to be brought back into public ownership and that can be part of a plan.</p></speech>

I reiterate  that the situation referred to by the Deputy relates just to Irish Ferries during the winter period and to the <i>MS Epsilon</i>vessel, because of health and safety reasons regarding the ramps on board.  The Government is, however, looking at how we can encourage and enhance the passenger experience as part of the Department's work in that area.</p></speech>

This has been further compounded by Ryanair&rsquo;s most recent decision to cut its winter capacity at Ireland West Airport Knock and to cancel all services for four weeks, from the end of next week until mid-December.  Ryanair made this decision on a commercial basis in light of poor forward bookings for the period in question.  It also forms part of a wider move by the airline to cut its capacity on flights right across Europe.  That does not detract, however, from the impacts that this is having on Knock as well as Cork, Kerry and Shannon airports.  However, I assure the Deputy that the continued viability of these airports is very important to this Government.  Ireland West Airport Knock will continue to receive ongoing Exchequer support as part of the regional airports programme.  This year, the airport has received capital support of more than &euro;1 million and is also eligible to apply for operational supports from an available budget of &euro;3.5 million.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with this Government&rsquo;s priorities for regional development, I expect to publish a new regional airports programme for 2021 to 2025 in the coming weeks.  This will give funding certainty to Knock airport over a five-year timeframe, helping the airport to remain viable as it transitions through the various phases of recovery from Covid.  The Government has confirmed its commitment to the continuation of the programme in budget 2021 by securing more than &euro;21 million for airports such as this.  I am also pleased to refer to the additional supports agreed by Government this week as part of the revised &euro;80 million funding package for Irish aviation.  As part of this package, in addition to the &euro;21 million secured for next year under the regional airports programme, Government intends to make a further &euro;6 million available to Ireland's smallest airports, including Knock.  The funding package will also include a &euro;20 million airport charges rebate scheme for January to March 2021, which will support the retention of core connectivity.  I will return to the Deputy's other questions.</p></speech>

She did not answer my question regarding why the EU derogation was not sought for the regional airports and if it has been checked that the &euro;6 million in funding comes within the temporary framework.  It is important that this be done.  Although the money has been allocated, we do not have certainty concerning the temporary framework, or in respect of the breakdown of the funding and when the airports can expect to get that money.  Can some of the funding to which the Minister of State just referred be used for testing?  Testing is now an integral part of the survival of regional airports.  The costs being mentioned are of concern to many passengers.  Is funding available within the allocation she mentioned to subsidise testing?</p></speech>

Ireland is an island nation and I do not have to explain to the Deputy or anyone here the importance of core connectivity.  I am very hopeful that will be successful.  It will then be up to the regional airports to apply for that funding through the Department.</p>  <p>  Turning to the question of testing, as I outlined earlier, the DAA will be opening drive-through testing facilities at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  That will done through the private sector, and the private sector will also facilitate that testing across the country for airports such as Knock.  The testing will be for anyone requiring such a test in advance of flying to another country or for those coming here from red or orange-listed countries who need to take a test within five days of arrival. </p></speech>

It is important that we understand that.  I would also like her to give me a written update regarding the correspondence on the temporary framework and if it meets the criteria.  Making announcements without having that information just causes uncertainty, and God knows we have enough uncertainty at this time with everything that is happening.  That is particularly the case for regional airports.</p>  <p>  Regarding testing, I am concerned because Kerry Airport has mentioned a cost of &euro;70 and Ireland West Airport Knock has referred to &euro;140.  I am concerned about the procurement processes in respect of private providers and the costs, and the differentiation in those costs.  I ask that another look be given to those regional airports, in case there might be a line of funding somewhere that could be used to subsidise the testing.  I do not want passengers to be in a situation where they cannot afford to come home because the cost of testing is prohibitive.</p></speech>

It is clear and obvious to us that regional airports, such as Knock, have been severely impacted by Covid-19.  It is in the context that we are engaging with the European Commission.  The Deputy can be assured of the certainty around that and the importance of maintaining our core connectivity.  That is the reason that the Government this week provided &euro;6 million, in addition to the &euro;21.3 million allocated, to our regional airports.</p>  <p>  Turning to testing, again, that will be provided by the private sector.  The polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test is the gold standard in this regard.  It will be rolled out by the private sector.  As more capacity and technology comes online and as the uptake increases, that will reduce the cost.  The cost of the PCR test is considerable now, however.  As the Deputy may be aware, the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, is also looking at other testing technologies, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, tests, which may be significantly cheaper than the PCR test.  If those types of test are validated and become available, they could also be options for passengers.</p></speech>

I understand from the RSA that prior to the current pandemic some test centres across the country offered toilet facilities, and in some cases indoor waiting rooms, where instructors could choose to wait while their students were out undergoing their test.  To be clear, some test centres around the country are very small and do not have, and have never had, large waiting rooms or toilet facilities available for instructors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, driver testing is continuing under level 5 restrictions, but only for candidates involved in the provision of essential services or essential retail outlets.  The RSA has thus been presented with the challenge of facilitating these essential tests while at the same time safeguarding the safety of its staff and the public by minimising the risk of spreading the virus.</p> <p>I understand that, at present, toilet facilities at test centres are only available to the learner driver who is undertaking his or her driving test.  There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the centres for either the learner or the instructor.  The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester.  The decision to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities has been taken by the Road Safety Authority in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of services protocol in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures, which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans.  I assure the Deputy that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly.  I am sure he will agree that the health and safety of the workers and those in driving test centres need to be our priority. </p></speech>

There are 2,000 driving instructors in the State.  I am not in a position to say that every single one of them is opposed to this, but I am aware that the broad mass of those 2,000 driving instructors oppose what is going on here.  It is not just some driving instructors - the Minister of State gives the impression that it might be three or four - but the broad mass of the 2,000 driving instructors.  Many of them were forced to stand in lashing rain yesterday sheltering under umbrellas while waiting for the test drivers to come back to the centre.  I challenge the idea that health and safety is being protected here.  Health and safety is being endangered.  The broad mass of the 2,000 driving instructors cannot access the centres to use toilet facilities or wash their hands.  If the concern is with Covid safety, why are instructors still having to pass log books back and forth with test drivers, instead of doing it online?  Let us put health and safety first but that means letting instructors into the centres and ending the lockout.</p></speech>

As I said, this is an operational matter for the RSA.  The learner driver who is doing the test can go into the driver test centre to use the facilities.  The reason behind the measure is to try to minimise the through traffic inside test centres to protect public health.  I hear the Deputy's concerns.  It is not only about the driving instructors but also about those who bring the learner driver to the test centre, be it a parent or other accompanying driver.  In normal times, such persons would have been facilitated in the test centres but we are not in normal times.  I will re-engage with the RSA to see if something can be done for drivers accompanying those who are doing their test.  I emphasise that all of these measures were put in place to minimise risk and safeguard the health and safety of the learner drivers taking the test and the staff of the RSA driving test centres.</p></speech>

We are asking that instructors be allowed in.  That is the issue here.  The Minister of State indicated this is an operational matter for the RSA.  The drivers have chosen to join a union.  Whatever about wanting to talk to the RSA, the union wants to talk to the Minister of State.  It has written to her on more than one occasion and has not received anything back.  The Minister of State said that she wants to hear my concerns. She should cut out the middleman and listens to the instructors' concerns directly.  She should write back to them and do the decent thing by arranging to have a discussion with the instructors and the union of their choice.  Why will she not agree to do that?  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not replying in this debate but does the Green Party support this position of locking out a union and refusing to even talk to it?  How can the Minister stand over that position?</p></speech>

People doing the driving test must be brought to the centres by an accompanying driver because they are learners who have not yet passed the test.  Those accompanying drivers may be parents.  I am not detracting from what Deputy Barry said but the context in which these protocols were put in place was to try to keep everybody safe.  I hear the Deputy's concerns.  This is an operational matter for the RSA, which has sought the best medical advice for putting in place these protocols.  I will engage with it to see if anything else can be done to keep everybody safe and ensure we suppress this virus.  That is the reasoning behind all of these protocols.  It is not a perfect situation.  We are in an unprecedented global pandemic and we are all trying to grapple with it to keep everyone as safe as possible, while working with everyone.</p></speech>

I am aware that he was to give me good news and talk about increased services, which are welcome, but it is worth highlighting that even before Covid, we had a national crisis in our bus transport system.  There was a significant increase in the numbers using public transport in 2019.  We are now running to stand still and only recovering from the austerity years.  Added to this is the need for capacity at peak hours, particularly for essential workers.  Will the Minister address the issue in that context, please?</p></reply>

As the Deputy said, there are ambitious plans to expand bus services in all our cities through implementation of BusConnects, which will see improved services, better infrastructure and larger bus fleets.  This type of transformative change is needed and if we are serious about improving public transport, we need to be serious about our support for BusConnects and the benefits it will deliver.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing support can be seen in the expanded bus fleet operating our PSO services now as compared with a few years ago.  The PSO bus fleet has grown by around 15% over the last three years and will continue to expand this year and beyond.  Next year alone, for example, the National Transport Authority will purchase more than 240 new buses for the PSO fleets.  These buses will replace older buses with newer and cleaner buses, add capacity through replacing single-deck with double-deck buses and will also expand the fleet through additional buses beyond existing fleets.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin will see the PSO bus fleet in the Dublin region expand by more than 200 vehicles between 2021 and 2024, while the service improvements planned under the network redesign will increase services by around 23% as compared with today.  I want to see that level of ambition replicated in other cities also.  In the regional cities capacity is being added through replacing single-deck buses with double-deck vehicles, which can expand capacity by around 25% per bus.</p>  <p>  On the regional services, capacity increases are also being addressed through the purchase of double-deck coaches to replace single-deck coach vehicles on various routes, which can increase capacity by between 40% and 50%.  In 2021, it is expected that an additional 48 double-deck coach vehicles will be brought into operation which will add capacity to the system across the country.</p>  <p>  With regard to buses, I also note the NTA&rsquo;s ongoing work on Connecting Ireland.  This is an initiative to provide better public transport connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network nationwide.  The NTA is commencing a two-phase consultation, beginning with local authority officials and other key stakeholders on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, which will be followed by a wider public consultation on the proposals in the second quarter of 2021.</p></speech>

On the ambitious plans to increase the network across the country, it is pretty shameful for the Minister to describe them as such given that the NTA has actively encouraged private competition and run down Bus &Eacute;ireann as a company.  The Minister's lack of concern about the recent announcement that Bus &Eacute;ireann will cancel three Expressway routes was astonishing.  He does not seem to understand the importance of that decision for the company's future.</p>  <p>  We need to look at what the NTA is doing with its neoliberal experiment, as I describe it, under which it is bringing privately operated bus services to 10% of routes in Dublin in the name of competition.  The only area that is competitive is the wages and conditions of workers.  Everything else, including the routes, the number of buses, fares and timetables are decided by the NTA.  It is only the workers' pay and conditions that are subject to competition.  This is true also of the Expressway routes being taken over by private companies.</p></speech>

Last year, passenger numbers rose in Dublin by 7.5%, going from 141 million passengers in 2018 to 151 million in 2019.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on his plans to increase the bus fleet for 2021.</p></speech>

There will be an additional 240 new buses, and 200 additional buses are planned for the Dublin region in the next three years.</p>  <p>  As regards Bus &Eacute;ireann, those Expressway services are not yet due to be removed but that decision was made at the same time as additional drivers were being taken on by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company is expanding and I want to see it expand further.  It is making provision for new services in counties Meath and Louth where there is unmet need.  That decision was not an expression of a lack of confidence in Bus &Eacute;ireann - far from it.  The company told us it wanted to expand in these areas and that deploying its resources in this way was the best way to proceed.  For the towns that could potentially lose out, for example, Cahir and Mitchelstown, we gave a very clear commitment that public service obligation, PSO, services would be put in place in any such instance.  I believe in public transport and PSO services and if any such gap appears, it will be met and closed. </p></speech>

I am aware that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are recruiting.  It is about the number of physical buses we need.  Nothing in the Minister's response indicates the sort of radical forward thinking we need, given the Covid crisis and the climate crisis.  We do not have to argue with our population about using public transport.  They want to use it.  The question is whether they can get on it.  At the moment, healthcare workers cannot get home from work or travel to work because of the lower capacity.  I understand that this is a particular situation but this will be a problem in the future.  Before Covid, people had difficulty accessing bus services on time with the same frequency.  There is also the question of cost.  Bus fares are excessive and have gone up hugely in the last few years.  We are only now returning to the fleet numbers we had before the fleet was cut in 2009.  The Minister's response is not good enough and does not deal with the issue, the climate crisis in particular.</p></speech>

Dublin Bus has significantly increased efficiency, brought in new timetables and improved frequencies on the network, which has enabled it to continue growing its passenger numbers, hopefully into 2021.  It is clear that there is a demand for improved and increased services across Dublin and Dubliners want to see more improvements on public transport.  That is only right.  If we want people to leave their cars at home, we are going to have to improve public transport services.  I note what the Minister said about the BusConnects plans.  That project is important and while the majority of it is welcome, some new routes will also benefit the network.  On new proposed routes, I note that there was a discussion around 24-hour bus services.  If the Minister has any information on that, particularly routes southbound from Dublin city to Bray, I ask him to elaborate on it.</p></speech>

We will provide additional buses but the key here is the BusConnects project because if we can deliver that, not just in Dublin but also in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, it will radically improve the service, as well as the conditions and lived experience of the drivers working on the service.  That is the most important step and we have to get it right at this time to make our bus system the cornerstone of our public transport system.</p>  <p>  I was looking in detail at the Kimmage route the other day, which Deputy Smith and I share in our bordering constituencies.  I will take that as an example, although it is one of many I could take along the 16 corridors being built.  After consultation with the community, we have ended up with a very different design from the one that was originally proposed.  It will be very radical and will take a lot of political courage for us to get this through because it will very much advantage cycling, buses and pedestrians over other modes of transport.  That is what we have to do now because the city will not work unless we make a bus system that works.  We will provide the buses.  A shortage of buses will not be the problem in any instance.  The key now is getting the BusConnects project into planning.  We hope to get that done in March after this final consultation.  If there are changes, the NTA should be open to looking at them but by and large the network proposed and the design solutions it has come up with are the right ones.  More than anything else, that will increase bus numbers by making it easier for drivers and passengers to use the buses we have.  That is the key measure we need to get right in the next few years. </p></speech>

That means developing an integrated national transport service in which routes and timetables are integrated with other public bus and train services.  At the moment these services are quite successful but there is only one Local Link office for every two counties so we need a massive expansion.</p></reply>

The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the rural transport programme, which operates under the Local Link brand.  From a policy perspective, there is a need for a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland and the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to making public transport and active travel better and more accessible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will probably be aware that my Department has already been undertaking a review of sustainable mobility policy, which incorporates a review of public transport in rural areas.  In this context, the Department held a public consultation process between November 2019 and February 2020, and included a stakeholder event in the course of that consultation.  Over 250 submissions were received as part of this consultation process and I published a report on it last week.  I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next ten years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme.  The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework, known as Smarter Travel, and submissions received during my Department's consultation process.  Other stakeholders' views will also be taken into account.  This will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the programme for Government in the area of sustainable travel, and will replace the previous Smarter Travel policy from 2009.  Our programme for Government commitments on public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement.</p>  <p>  Among the measures we will prioritise are a sustainable rural mobility plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity.  Meanwhile, the NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country in areas, excluding the greater Dublin area, regional cities and large towns, by providing better connections between villages and towns and linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres.  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA is starting on a two-phase consultation on its proposals, entitled Connecting Ireland.  This will begin with local authority officials and other key stakeholders engaging on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland, and will then be followed by a wider public consultation on the proposals in the second quarter of 2021.</p></speech>

They are absolutely essential.  They are, by definition, low-volume services and therefore are not particularly profitable.  That is a problem with the entire model of how the NTA is doing this, by contracting services for which private operators like Go-Ahead Ireland can bid.  That model means these services, which we need in order to get people out of cars and to counteract isolation, are not necessarily provided.</p> <p>An integrated public transport system, which is genuinely public, will develop these low-volume rural services in a context in which the revenue from the high-volume routes can be used to cross-subsidise the low-volume routes.  Does the Minister agree there is a problem with this model of private contracting out of the routes?</p></speech>

There is a solution on the table that will serve the rural communities of Skreen, Walterstown and Kentstown and will also provide for those schoolchildren left without school bus transport since September.  Will the Minister support the proposal from Flexibus?  It will serve a rural community and those schoolchildren left without a service.</p></speech>

While I do not have a final resolution, I will commit to come back again on this as a solution has to be found for the students in question.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy on the importance of Local Link.  I also believe in public transport and public service companies delivering it.  However, that does not have to be to the complete exclusion of other operators.  From my experience as a passenger using a range of different public transport coach operators, they provide a good service.  They are local and often good community businesses.  I agree it has to be a public system designed for the public good.  We cannot allow transfer pricing along the way, as the Deputy suggested, where people cherry-pick routes.  That can be done in a way that does not exclude the many good companies involved in providing public transport.</p></speech>

The report was commissioned after a hard-fought battle by patients and by their families.  These were patients who had suffered delays in diagnosis and treatment with devastating consequences for them and for their families.  This included family members such as Dr. Margaret MacMahon who lost her sister.</p><p>As I said in September, campaigners such as Margaret deserve praise and recognition for their tenacity and determination.  The review found that of the 123 cases of endometrial cancer over a ten-year period in Letterkenny University Hospital, one in three women experienced a delay in diagnosis, one in five women suffered serious consequences as a result, and a number of these women have since passed away, some as a result of the delay in diagnosis.</p><p>The review uncovered a litany of failures which had devastating impacts and consequences for these women.  In September, I put some of the findings of the review on the D&aacute;il record and I wish to do so again.  The review stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It is clear that the experience for these women, and the service provided to them, was unsatisfactory. All cases, in one form or another, are typified by delay &ndash; delay from an urgent GP referral to a gynaecology outpatient appointment; from gynaecology outpatient appointment to urgent diagnostics ... and-or from diagnostics to intervention. </blockquote>  <p>Today we learned that things have gone from bad to worse.  A further three cases of delayed diagnosis have come to light in Letterkenny University Hospital, bringing the total number to 41.  This begs the question as to how many more delayed diagnoses are we unaware of.  It is simply not acceptable under any circumstances.  The families affected are rightly demanding answers.</p><p>T&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil tr&iacute; ch&aacute;s &uacute;r ina raibh moill leis an diagnosis.  Ta tri&uacute;r mn&aacute; san iarthuaisceart ag ceisti&uacute; an muin&iacute;n agus an trust at&aacute; acu i seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; gn&oacute;la&iacute;ochta agus in Ospid&eacute;al na hOllscoile Leitir Ceanainn.  T&aacute; eagla ar &aacute;r m&aacute;ithreacha agus ar &aacute;r ndeirfi&uacute;racha.  Is l&eacute;ir gur theip ar Shaolta agus ar an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte &oacute; thaobh na mn&aacute; seo a chosaint.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; maith go leor agus caithfidh an Rialtas gn&iacute;omh&uacute; air seo l&aacute;ithreach.</p><p>It was reported in the <i>Donegal News</i>today that many of the families of those who have passed away as a result of this are disgusted with the individual reports into their care received from Saolta.  Several families have come forward - some of them have been in contact with myself - to say that the reports they received are inaccurate and lack accountability.</p><p>The Saolta group responsible for these services at Letterkenny University Hospital has a lot to answer for.  The review itself criticised the fact that during the very time that Dr. Price was carrying out his review, Saolta management, without his knowledge, decided that they in their wisdom would carry out its own audit of the same files.  What does that say to the families?  It does not exactly inspire confidence in Saolta's handling of all of this.</p><p>This requires Government intervention and action.  In September, I raised this issue with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and was told that this would be followed up on.  I want the T&aacute;naiste to tell me what action, if any, has been taken by the Government over the past two and a half months.  I specifically asked at that time that the recommendations of the review be acted on and fully implemented.  This has not happened.  I asked for a review going wider than endometrial cancer in Letterkenny University Hospital.  That has not happened.  I asked if the Government would consider the independent panel's recommendation for a full audit to be carried out throughout the State to ensure that Letterkenny is not an outlier.  There is no evidence that has happened either.</p><p>For the families of those women who have passed away as a result of their failure of their treatment in Letterkenny University Hospital, will the T&aacute;naiste give this the priority it deserves?  The women of Donegal and, indeed, their families deserve nothing less.</p></speech>

Obviously, as a result of that, in some cases they did not get the treatment they should have as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I want to express my deep sorrow to any of the women affected and also to any of their families and friends who have faced an adverse outcome because of this.</p>  <p>  I am at a little bit of a disadvantage in answering the question in that I have not been briefed about this recently or in a very long time.  I do not want to give an answer on a sensitive matter for it to turn out to be wrong.  As the Deputy said, the Saolta group is in charge of the hospitals in the west and Donegal and it carried out individual reports into the different cases.  I understand from what the Deputy said that some women and families are unhappy with the individual reports they received.</p>  <p>  I am not able to answer what actions have been taken in the past two months as I am just not up to date on this.  There is a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on health this afternoon.  I will have a chance to see the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, then and I will let him know the Deputy raised this serious matter.  I am sure he will want to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></speech>

I appreciate he may not be fully up to speed with the independent review published in August and its recommendation that there should be a statewide review to ensure Letterkenny is not an outlier.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, as a GP, read that report because it is absolutely shocking?  People lost their lives.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that endometrial cancer, if detected and treated in proper time, is not life-threatening or life-ending.  In these cases, however, it is clear from the review, which Letterkenny University Hospital and Saolta accept, women lost their lives directly as a consequence of the failure of the treatment in the hospital.  Not only that, the numbers are staggering: 41 out of 130 cases were delayed diagnosis while one in five, or 25 or 26, had serious consequences for their health.  For some, that consequence was the loss of their life.</p>  <p>  What Saolta and the hospital did was flawed from the very start.  There was a review in 2018 by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which made ten recommendations.  There was no evidence that any of its recommendations was implemented.  There is a lack of confidence in the service.  That is why there is a demand for a proper independent review into this and to widen it beyond endometrial cancer.</p> <p>I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to take a personal interest in this as well as talking to the Minister.</p></speech>

I will do that and I will read the independent review.  When we find failings or shortcomings in any particular hospital it is important to apply scrutiny nationwide.  If things are going wrong in one hospital it is wrong to assume that everything is okay everywhere else.  Too many times we have learned that failings identified in a particular hospital or service are not confined to that service but are a more widespread problem.  We have seen that with other reports in the past.  I will take it upon myself to read that report and try to understand it better as well as raising it with the Minister for Health this afternoon when I see him at the Cabinet subcommittee.</p></speech>

We are probably unlike any other party in the degree of change we have stimulated.  I refer to our attitudes to divorce, abortion, the rights of the LGBTQ community, women's issues and many other areas.  As a party, we are now pursuing a campaign to ensure that every child born in this country has a pathway towards citizenship.  We will not stop until it is achieved.  The 27th amendment to the Constitution was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il with the support of Fine Gael in opposition and passed in 2004.  It needs to be withdrawn or we must bring in legislation to neutralise it to allow a pathway to citizenship for children whose parents were born outside the State.  It is completely wrong that such children cannot get passports, have problems accessing higher education or in some cases are threatened with deportation.  It is wrong that children are treated differently from those they sit next to in school and are in some ways discriminated against.</p>  <p>  The majority of Members of this House are delighted that change is coming in the United States.  US President-elect Joe Biden has said that he wants to support the children of illegal immigrants.  They call them "dreamers" in the United States.  We have our own dreamers here.  There are children in our own country that we need to look after.  I am asking for the T&aacute;naiste's support in this.  We have 3,000 undocumented children in Ireland.  These are our dreamers.  We are going through a pandemic.  So many of our healthcare workers come from outside this State.  I have met some whose children were born in this State but do not have the same rights as the children they sit beside in cr&egrave;ches, primary schools, secondary schools or in some cases third level institutions.  The pandemic has created disruption and changed the way we think.  It has given us a chance to breathe and think about what is important to us.  The children of all of those workers deserve to be treated equally.  We all know about the case of Eric Zhi Ying Mei Xue, whose deportation order was opposed by a petition signed by 65,000 people and was then reversed.  There are many children like Eric.  It is not good enough that if someone has a Minister in his or her constituency he or she can get a deportation order changed for a child while many others face similar orders. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, has introduced legislation to deal with this issue in the Seanad.  Will the T&aacute;naiste support this in order to ensure that these children have a pathway?  This is a campaign that the Labour Party has initiated.  It is being led by our youth wing, Labour Youth.  Will the T&aacute;naiste support this campaign and ensure that our 3,000 dreamers get their rightful place in this country, are respected and are given a pathway to citizenship?</p></speech>

I support the thrust of the campaign and the intentions behind it.  The matter of how this can be achieved requires a bit more discussion.  There is always the law of unintended consequences.  We all know of children, young people and teenagers who were born in Ireland, who know no other home and who speak with Dublin, Wicklow or Kerry accents - not that someone's accent really matters.  Many were born here, some were brought here at a very young age.  To me it would be wrong to deport them to countries they never called home and expect them to start their lives there.  We need a change in this area to provide a better legal mechanism for "dreamers", as the Deputy describes them, young people born in Ireland who are not citizens but who know no other home and were schooled here.  They need a pathway to regularisation and then to citizenship, which is a slightly different thing.</p>  <p>  Reversing the 27th amendment is a different issue.  Unusually for a European country, our previous regime allowed anyone born in the State to be an Irish citizen automatically.  Unfortunately that can be open to abuse.  It could confer rights on a parent who arrived here illegally, which would not be the right thing to do.  It could also represent a pull factor, causing people to come here from England to avail of that right.  That is what happens in America, as the Deputy knows.  We want to avoid replicating that.  These are complicated issues, but the principle of providing a pathway to residency and citizenship for children who have only known Ireland as home is a desirable one.  We will be happy to work with the Labour Party on that.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue for us.  Last December we lost the chairperson of our youth wing, Mr. Cormac &Oacute; Braon&aacute;in.  He was an amazing young man whose many talents had a huge impact on all of us in the Labour Party and further afield.  His number one political objective was to ensure that children born to people not from this State or without citizenship would have this pathway.  We all know the way our country has dealt with direct provision.  We all know that there are children in direct provision whose home is Ireland.  We all know that the longer this goes on, the more cases we will have.</p>  <p>  Given our experience with Covid-19 and the time we have been given to breathe and to analyse, now is the time to deal with this issue.  In light of the T&aacute;naiste's very welcome comments about working with the Labour Party, I ask him to look at the legislation we have introduced to the Seanad and support it.  Senator Ivana Bacik is very well versed in this area.  We would really welcome that so that we could bring it forward to the D&aacute;il.  I am sure my colleagues in the D&aacute;il would support it too.</p></speech>

I will speak to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, who I expect to be the Minister addressing it in the Seanad, to see what we can do.  Perhaps we will not oppose it and attempt to find a solution on Committee Stage.  Senator Bacik is one of the best legislators in these Houses so we would always take a serious look at any legislation she puts forward, or at any legislation put forward by any Member.  We have found solutions to these issues in the past.  Only last year we brought in a scheme to regularise people who came here on a student visa, whose student visa lapsed and who ended up in the workforce.  Many have been here for years.  This is pretty much what happens to the undocumented Irish in America, who often arrive with a student visa and overstay.  We found a solution to that.  We never use the term "amnesty" because we have signed a European agreement not to implement amnesties, but we arrived at a system allowing such people to apply for a regularised status.  Perhaps we can come up with a scheme to facilitate these young people as well.  As I say, I agree with the point the Deputy is making.  I would not like to see too many more cases like this arise without a solution in place.</p></speech>

His response was that international travel is not safe and movement of people around areas with high incidence of this disease, particularly Europe and North America, is not safe.  He went on to make the point that it is impossible to gauge what the situation in regard to the virus might be in six weeks' time, which is fair enough.  In recent days, the Government announced new proposals in respect of travel and change in the regime in this regard.  A number of those proposals require clarification.</p> <p> It goes without saying that I fully appreciate the importance of Christmas for people, especially families.  Many people, including me, have family members living abroad who have not been able to come home for the past year.  We would all really love to have some kind of normal Christmas and to spend time with our families.  I also fully appreciate the importance of Christmas for the business community in terms of the amount of trade done in the weeks coming up to Christmas and at Christmas in general.  However, it is really important that we do not engage in short-term thinking.  We need to consider the time horizon relating to the taking of some of these decisions and prioritise keeping the downward pressure on the number of virus cases.  The last thing anybody wants, either the public or the business community, is that we would go into a third lockdown in January.  It is important to bear in mind that public health considerations and business and economic considerations are two sides of the same coin.</p> <p> I am seeking clarification from the T&aacute;naiste.  Last year, approximately 1.2 million people passed through Dublin Airport.  What kind of modelling has been done in respect of the potential for a spike in the virus figures?  Specifically, was the CMO consulted about these proposed new arrangements?  What are the proposals for oversight of the testing arrangements that the Government suggests would apply to people coming from red zones and orange zones?  As far as I know, the public health advice is that there is a need for a double test to ensure that a person is negative.  For people who do have a test when they arrive here and it proves positive, is the Government satisfied that there is sufficient capacity in the tracing system to be able to respond to what will inevitably be a spike in positive results?</p></speech>

The CMO was consulted.  The matter was discussed at the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid.  We were both present and we discussed it.  I recall that at the time the CMO said he was not particularly concerned about international travel.  As we get the numbers down, it becomes a greater concern for reasons which the Deputy will understand.  I do not know exactly what type of formal oversight mechanism will exist.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.</p>  <p>  We are confident that we will have the 800 contact tracers in place and that will give us sufficient capacity to carry out whatever tracing is necessary.  There are 650 in place already.   In a situation where there are approximately 1,000 cases per day, tracing becomes really difficult.  If we can keep the number of cases low, in the ballpark of 100 or 200, we will have more than enough tracers to do the job that needs to be done.</p>  <p>  International travel is a risk.  We need to be upfront and honest about that.  We need to get the virus down to very low levels again.  We are doing really well in that regard.  We are ahead of the projects at the moment in terms of getting the virus under control.  The average number of weekly cases is one quarter of what it was only a few weeks ago and the positive rate has fallen from 7% to 3.5%.  The numbers are very much going in the right direction.  There is a risk, however, that as we get down to very low levels again, the country could be reseeded with the virus by people travelling in from overseas.  There is an even higher risk that if people engage in North-South travel - because a different approach is being taken in Northern Ireland - we could be reseeded as a result,  This type of travel probably poses a much higher than people travelling here from Qatar, Miami or wherever.  We need to bear in mind that Ireland is an island but it is not an island state.  There are two jurisdictions on this island.  We are never going to close the border between North and South so we have to bear in mind that we are not in the same boat as other island nations might be.</p>  <p>  We can limit risk but we cannot eliminate it entirely.  That is why we have opted into the European system for international travel.  It is advocated by the EU Commissioner for Health and backed by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's data and so it is science-based.  This creates regions that are green, amber and red.  There will be no restrictions in respect of travel here from a green region but a person travelling from an amber region will need a negative test before arriving in order to avoid having to restrict his or her movements.  A person travelling here from a red region will have to his or her restrict movements and undergo a test after five days.  He or she will not have to restrict his or her movements if that test proves negative.  We are considering what kind of legal mechanism we need to put around that because it is not mandatory or enforceable, and penalties do not apply.  Perhaps, we need to do that.  This is one of the issues we are discussing at the moment.  There are also a series of exemptions for healthcare workers, diplomats and people engaged in imperative family travel and imperative business because those things have to go on.</p>  <p>  In terms of people booking flights to come home for Christmas, I would advise them not to do so at the moment.  I know that is difficult and I know it is tough.  Christmas is six weeks away and it is too soon for people to be booking flights to come home.  I was watching "Reeling in the Years" the other day.  In 1967, there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England and people were asked not to come home.  They did not come home and foot and mouth disease did not spread to Ireland.  I am not saying that it is the same now but we are not in a position at this point to advise people that it is safe to come home for Christmas.  I know that is a tough message to hear but that is the case at the moment.</p></speech>

On my question about the requirement for a double test, my understanding is the medical advice is that a double test would be required at the moment.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to clarify that.</p>  <p>  My question in regard to capacity for tracing does not relate to the current numbers, it relates to the potential for large numbers of people coming here for Christmas.  That is why it is really important that there are not mixed messages in this regard.  I note what the T&aacute;naiste said about the current advice.  In the event of large numbers of people coming here and needing to take tests after five days, I presume that a significant number of them will test positive.  Is the Government satisfied that there is capacity in the tracing system to deal with that potential large influx at Christmas, when people will be looking for leave and so on.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell us what modelling has been done in this regard?  The last thing we want is a third lockdown.  It is in nobody interest that we would face that.  Has modelling been done on the potential for a spike?</p></speech>

I do not know to what extent international travel feeds into that modelling.  I will have to check that.  In terms of the European regulation that we have adopted and signed up to, that does not require a double test.  It falls within the discretion of member states to decide how to proceed in this regard.  NPHET's advice to us is that a double test would be better which, of course, is the case because any laboratory test creates false negatives.  If there is a double test, it is less likely there will be two false negatives.  This is the Swiss cheese analogy that people tend to use.</p>  <p>  In terms of capacity, the position is that people coming in from the green regions will not have to undergo tests so their travelling here should not have any implications for contact tracing.  People coming in from amber regions should have a negative test before getting on the plane and this, too, should not have any implications for contact tracing.  Where implications might arise is people coming in from red-----</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, the Northern Assembly is deadlocked and playing petty political games in its approach to coping with this deadly virus.  My main issue is the fact that a different approach being taken to the virus on each side of the Border.  The effects of this are clear to see.</p> <p> The infection rate soared in Border counties from Louth to Donegal.  In my county of Louth, at one time the rate in the northern part of the county was one of the highest in the country, yet less than 10 km away in the mid-Louth region there were practically no infections, and likewise in the south of the county.  That is not a coincidence.  The reasons are simple.  The fact is that the authorities in the North have taken a different approach and that is causing severe problems for Border counties such as Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal.  During the week a doctor in Donegal stated that the rates along the Border in Donegal, which are the highest in the country, are a direct result of the different approaches taken North and South of the Border.</p> <p> We in the South have been placed under the most restrictive lockdown in Europe.  People have accepted that because they want to get rid of this terrible virus and get their lives back to normal.  Many businesspeople have sacrificed their businesses to help in this national effort.  The T&aacute;naiste knows as well as I do that many of those businesses will not be in a position to reopen once they are permitted to so do.  These people will have effectively sacrificed their livelihoods for the sake of the health of the country.  That is why, when I see the North taking a different approach on this issue, I feel for the people and businesses who have made great sacrifices.</p> <p> How is it that the State has forced certain types of shops and businesses to close but similar shops across the Border remain open?  How is it that shops and businesses in Dundalk have been forced to close, yet only 10 km up the road similar shops and businesses can continue to trade?  How is it that under the current lockdown restrictions people are not allowed to travel outside their own county or more than 5 km from their home, yet people can travel from the North across the Border with apparent ease and face no fines or penalties?  The North still has one of the highest rates of infection in Europe, yet we have no restrictions on travel.</p> <p> It is plain to see that two different approaches are being taken and we in the South are paying a price for that.  The Government has to get real and get a handle on this situation.  Action, not words, is needed now.  If the Northern Assembly is not capable of working together and taking an approach that keeps not only its citizens, but also people south of the Border, safe then the Government of which the T&aacute;naiste is part needs to act strongly.  Surely we cannot expect people and businesses in the South to continue suffering and making significant sacrifices while in the North the Assembly is playing petty political games and is unable to reach an agreement that would make our island a safer place for all citizens.  Will the Government consider restricting cross-Border travel on the island of Ireland should the Northern Assembly fail to reach agreement or, indeed, decide to take a different approach from us in the South?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200015#N00200"><p>We are making enormous progress here south of the Border.  As I stated earlier, the percentage positivity rate was approximately 7% but is now under 4%.  The average number of weekly cases is down approximately 1,200 to approximately 400.  The numbers in hospital and ICU are a fraction of what they were in the spring and are now stabilising or falling.</p>  <p>  The picture in the Border counties is variable.  We are concerned about the situation in Donegal.  We have not seen a significant fall in the incidence of the virus there, particularly in east Donegal.  In the other Border counties, namely, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan, the numbers are good.  We need to bear in mind that all Border counties are not the same.  However, we need to keep at it and we need to drive the virus down further.</p>  <p>  When we ease restrictions, and I think everyone is confident now that we will ease restrictions in December, there will be risks.  There will be embers of the virus still out there in the community and, as we gather and meet again, those embers can be fanned.  There is the risk of international travel, which was discussed earlier.  There is a significant risk associated with cross-Border travel and the virus being brought south by people travelling back and forth across the Border.  That is a real risk of which we need to be aware.  We need to measure it better.  In my view, it is not being measured as well as it ought to be.  The 14-day averages in the North show it is at three times our incidence rate and four times our death rate.  There is a significant reservoir of infection in Northern Ireland and there is a risk that could spill over into the South.  If we ease restrictions in December, it will be a real risk too.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is one country but it is not one state.  Obviously, Northern Ireland is a different jurisdiction.  That is part of the Good Friday Agreement and we must respect the fact that in Northern Ireland the Executive has decided to adopt a different approach from here and, indeed, from the approaches in England, Wales and Scotland.  It is part of the Good Friday Agreement settlement that there is autonomy in Northern Ireland and that the power-sharing Executive there makes decisions for itself as it sees fit.  The easing of restrictions in Northern Ireland and how that might impact on the South is something about which the Government is concerned.  The fact that things are so much worse in Northern Ireland and the Executive is considering easing restrictions is very much on our risk register.  We do have a memorandum of understanding.  The CMOs and the health ministers are in contact with each other and the Taoiseach is in contact with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to express our views.  We must respect the right of the authorities in Northern Ireland to make their own decisions for their jurisdiction under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  On the question regarding cross-Border travel, the Deputy should bear in mind that the 5 km rule applies.  People can cross the Border, but only to go to work, school or college or for necessary reasons such as a medical appointment or to care for a relative or child, for example.   There is no other reason for people travelling more than 5 km or across the Border.  That is being enforced and I ask people to respect that.</p></speech>

I asked the Taoiseach the exact same question on Tuesday and he basically gave me the same answer, that the Ministers are speaking to each other, as are the chief medical officers.  We have a serious issue at the moment.  Everything the T&aacute;naiste told me indicates that we need to do something across the Border.  I come from Dundalk.  What will happen on Friday in the North if they start opening pubs and restaurants?  People will travel from the South across the Border and<i>vice versa.</i>That will cause serious problems.  We must do something about it.</p><p>From Omeath to Cullaville, there are approximately 30 Border crossings.  It is impossible to put checkpoints along the Border to stop people crossing it.  As an ex-soldier of the 27th Battalion, I think it is about time we started to use the Army.  There is a barracks in Dundalk with 450 soldiers.  Why not deploy them in Border areas?  Donegal is in a serious situation.  Louth, Cavan and Monaghan have done a fantastic job over the past three or four weeks.  Is that just going to be flushed down the toilet?  We have to be realistic.  I wish to see a united Ireland, but I do not wish to see a united Ireland right now.  At the moment, my first priority is for the citizens of Ireland to be protected.  The Government has to protect them.</p><p>We are in a second lockdown.  The way things are going, there will be a third lockdown.  I know and the T&aacute;naiste knows that we do not wish to see a third lockdown.  Prevention is the best cure.  We have an opportunity to do something.  The Government should get the Army out to stop the southerners and the northerners crossing up and down the Border.  There is no problem with people who have to travel, but I have seen this situation develop in recent months and I do not like it.  The situation is being abused.  The freedom to travel is being abused in Border areas such as Omeath and Carlingford by northerners who are coming down to the South.</p></speech>

We struggled and fought too hard for too many decades to take all armies off the Border and we certainly do not want to be the jurisdiction that puts uniforms on the Border again.  That is not something to which we are giving consideration.  The point raised by the Deputy is a serious one.  The situation in Northern Ireland is much more serious than the situation here.  There is a very significant reservoir of infection in Northern Ireland and people travelling to and from Northern Ireland create a real risk.  We need to enforce the 5 km rule, but that is best done by the Garda rather than by military means.</p></speech>

The vacancies arose back in February.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this as it will allow the commission to do some of its work that it cannot do at the minute while the vacancies remain unfilled.  One of the vacancies must be filled by a former Member of the Oireachtas.  The Government has proposed the appointment of Geraldine Feeney, a former Fianna F&aacute;il Senator with whom I served in the Seanad, to that role and, therefore, she fulfils that criterion.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste can tell us whether he is aware that Ms Feeney is not just a former Oireachtas Member.</p> <p>She also became a professional lobbyist.  There is a question as to whether it is appropriate for a motion to come before the House, without debate, asking the Houses to appoint not only a former Member of the Oireachtas but also a professional lobbyist to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  There is another issue.  Geraldine Feeney in her role as a lobbyist only ever lobbied for the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP.  Her eight returns to the Standards in Public Office Commission show that.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that there is a complaint relating to his conduct on which SIPO will have to adjudicate.  Is it appropriate that the T&aacute;naiste and the Government have proposed, after a nine-month delay, to appoint Geraldine Feeney, who was a professional lobbyist for the NAGP with regard to the GP contract, to the Standards in Public Office Commission?</p></speech>

The idea of having a former politician on SIPO is to have somebody who has a working understanding the work we do as politicians.  I think it was Mr. Jim O'Keeffe in the past and it is now proposed to be Geraldine Feeney.  Obviously, whether there is a debate on it would be a matter for the Business Committee rather than for me.</p></speech>

Every Member of the House has had so many complaints that even you, a Cheann Comhairle, intervened during the week.  Clearly, ComReg is not doing its job.  Does it have the powers?  Has the Minister spoken to it in depth about it?  The real issue is that businesses, many of whose employees are working from home, are being affected throughout the country.  The level of service from Eir, Vodafone etc is beyond atrocious.  It is impossible.  Businesses and customers are being hugely affected.  The Labour Party proposes that it will be necessary to impose penalties on these companies for such service.  It is the only way to stimulate change.  In his role as Minister with responsibility for business, with the T&aacute;naiste work with the Minister with responsibility for communications to ensure that either ComReg finally does its job, and I do not have much faith in that, or that penalties will be introduced for such service provision?</p></speech>

From a legislative point of view, I am bringing forward legislation which will give more powers to both the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and ComReg.  There will be more powers for those bodies, but it should not require that in the meantime.  These telecommunications companies provide an essential service, employ many people and do a very good job, but they have a responsibility to their customers.  The level of complaints I am receiving from Deputies would indicate that at least some of those companies are not providing the level of customer service they should.  It should not require legislative action by us for that to improve.  They should do it anyway.</p></speech>

However, it is not as simple as that.  Many women work in professions that were traditionally considered female professions and those professions have been less well paid historically than jobs that were traditionally seen to be male professions.  It is the breadwinner model, as it is described.  Why is a garda paid more than a nurse?  I do not know.  It is probably because of this tradition that one was seen to be a man's job and the other was seen to be a woman's job.  That is not something that can be fixed quickly.  However, we are going to act on it through legislation that is currently going through the Houses on the gender pay gap, which requires companies with more than 50 employees to report on gender pay, report on the gap, explain why there is a gap and to do something about it.  It follows on from the legislation in Iceland.  I do not know why it has not been done yet, as it should be done, but it is something we will try to get done by the first quarter of next year.</p></speech>

Their patience with what has happened to them is astounding.  I also think they have shown leadership in trying to push this House to legislate as it should have done many years ago.  It is time that the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.  This issue has been raised 17 times in the last week in the House - this is the 18th time - by many Deputies across all parties, even on the Government benches.  It is time to answer the question.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment in the recent past to Deputies Gino Kenny, Barry and Boyd Barrett that the Cabinet would discuss this issue.  Has it discussed it this week and, if not, when will it discuss it?  We are hurtling towards Christmas.  Next Tuesday, the workers will be 222 days on strike and they will be outside the gates of Leinster House to plead with the leadership of this country to show equal leadership to what they have shown.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach, the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Troy, and I have been involved in this.  There has been a huge amount of engagement with Mandate, ICTU and, to the extent possible, with the liquidator.  I have been in direct contact with Debenhams UK.  We have done a lot to try to bring about a solution to this.  Most recently, the Workplace Relations Commission, an office under my remit, brought together KPMG and Mandate to see if a solution could be brokered.</p>  <p>  The fundamental problem is one that we cannot really get around.  Debenhams Ireland went bust and, in doing so, left a lot of money owing to a lot of people, not just the workers but other businesses, the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities.  There is not enough money left over to go around and to give everyone what they deserve.  That is the truth of it.  That is what happens in a liquidation process, unfortunately, and with every day that this goes on there is less money left in the pot because the liquidator has to pay for security and continue to pay rent.</p></speech>

I strongly disagree with this approach.  Like many other people, I see the celebration of mass and the sacraments as an essential service, at the least.  Churches have gone to great lengths to ensure that they are safe places in which to congregate and I do not believe any outbreaks of Covid-19 have been associated with attendance at mass.  Has the Government discussed this and are there plans in place to reopen churches for public mass?  It is not fair to allow up to 100 people into a supermarket at a time, yet the same people cannot congregate in a church while socially distancing.  People must be allowed to celebrate mass now.  It is important for not only their spiritual health but also their mental health.  The celebration of public masses must be deemed an essential service.</p></speech>

The plan at the moment is not to ease any restrictions and that means that masses can only happen online, as is the case currently.  Obviously, 25 people can attend a funeral mass or a wedding but not a regular mass.  The Taoiseach met with the four Catholic archbishops to discuss this issue.  We hope to be in a position in early December to allow masses to resume again but like any gathering, unfortunately, there is a risk and even if people are socially distanced within a church there is everything that happens around it as well in terms of entry and exit, the car park and people taking the bus.  All of these things increase the risk of the virus spreading and that is why the rules apply.  December is not too far away and I hope it will be possible to allow masses to resume in person from 1 December.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Bruton's comments, I very much agree that it would be useful for this House to have an open debate on what the restrictions should look like from 1 December in order that each of us can bring his or her wisdom to the table.  Of course we will listen to advice from NPHET and the Government will have its own views too.  It will be useful for us to hear as well the views of the 160 Members of this House on how that period in December might look, because we all want the restrictions to be eased as much as possible, but we also know that the more they are eased the higher the risk that we end up having a spike again and, potentially, a third wave.  There are many choices to be made and a lot of difficult trade-offs.  It would be helpful for us to hear the views of the House in that regard.</p></speech>

The members of the Irish Bookmakers Association have been denied access to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which is very unfair as they make their returns to Revenue, pay tax and PRSI and employ a lot of people.  Revenue classifies them as casual traders because of the nature of their work and the fact that they move their pitches around to different race meetings.  It is totally unfair that legitimate business people are denied access to this scheme.  A new business that started up perhaps three or four months ago can get access to the grant.  I spoke to a bookmaker who has been in business for 15 years, who goes to 17 tracks and pays his taxes, but he is denied access to the CRSS because Revenue describes him as a casual trader.  That is something the Government should examine because it is unfair that this cohort of business people who work hard and pay their taxes are met with a blanket denial.</p></speech>

It is supposed to help them with the ongoing running costs of those premises even when they are closed.  If a business does not have a premises, then it is not eligible.  The people to whom the Deputy refers may be eligible for other grants.</p></speech>

It has been made known to me that no funding has been provided for a long time to Dublin City Council.  This lack of funding has resulted in a complete standstill and suspension of the council's retrofitting programme.  If we are serious about the environment, it is essential that the Ministers for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Darragh O'Brien, and their Departments engage with Dublin City Council in order to deliver as a matter of urgency the funding which was promised to it but which has not been delivered.</p></speech>

Councils receive funding from lots of different mechanisms.  They get direct grants from the Government.  They also have money from the property tax, commercial rates and other charges.  Ultimately, it is for them to decide how best to deploy their budgets, which amount to more than &euro;1 billion.  If there is any way we can give assistance, we will try to do so, but the Deputy must bear in mind that these are local authorities and they make decisions on how to spend their money and they have their own revenue too.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the matter of waiting lists in St. Louise's unit in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, where children reporting sexual abuse are interviewed.  I have a constituent aged six who reported in early March that she had been sexually abused but she has still not been interviewed.  She cannot get counselling before the interview occurs.  This is a long time to wait when one is six years old, and it is a long time for her mam to be watching her child in this excruciating position.  Yesterday, I wrote to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  The child's mam has already been in touch with him but she received no help from him or Tusla either.  I will be writing to the Ombudsman for Children today.  It is up to the State to protect children.  It is up to the Garda to conduct the interview.  Last month we had to deal with mother and baby homes and this week we have traumatised children and their traumatised parents.  What can be done about this waiting list?</p></speech>

There is a residential road in my constituency in Tipperary.  It is a cul-de-sac located at Glencush at the foot of the Galtee Mountains.  Due to its location, it is exposed to a lot of run-off from the mountains which leads to regular heavy flooding in no one particular section.  The situation is so bad that recently palliative care services had to stretcher out a patient and put them on a jeep because the location was inaccessible for the ambulance.  Other residents in this area have health issues and are extremely alarmed by the prospect that the emergency services will not be able to reach them directly.  The council secured &euro;82,000 in funding to deal with climate change adaptation measures but it says it is nowhere near enough to remedy the situation.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has told me that no further money is being provided under the climate change fund and the council would have to include the work in next year's programme.  This road is regularly used by hillwalkers and it is a danger which leaves the council open to possible litigation.</p></speech>

Because we do not have an adequate public transport system people must use any other mode of transport.  There is nothing suitable for any kind or urgent travel.  In Kilkenny, they have a marvellous scheme where anyone can travel from a location in the town, near McDonagh Junction and the train station.  They can hop on and hop off the bus and get to St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny in minutes.  This is a great link.  My understanding is that it is free to those with a free travel pass.  It is the kind of model that is urgently needed in Carlow.  The reason I raise the issue now is that I failed to get picked to ask a question of the Minister for Transport.  There were plans for a similar bus system in Carlow, which was supposed to happen early this year and then during the summer.</p> <p>We were meant to get the same bus system, but it has not happened.  We are now heading into 2021.  What is the status of it?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to speak to the Minister.  I have had several phone calls in recent days asking when we will be able to provide a service, particularly for people from Carlow who would be able to get the bus to the train station and then travel on to the hospital in Kilkenny.</p></speech>

Many patients who use St. Luke's come from Carlow and people who do not have cars need to be facilitated.  As taxis are extremely expensive, a bus system would be much better.  As the Deputy stated, the matter comes under the remit of the Minister for Transport.  As she did not have the opportunity to raise it with him, she has raised with me.  That is fine.  I will make sure he knows she brought it up and that she gets a reply.</p></speech>

Many have been working at home since March and for many of them the distinction between work life and home life has blurred beyond recognition.  Video meetings in different time zones, work calls in the evenings and the constant ping of emails arriving have heaped pressure on people.  This is especially true for those who are struggling with their work-life balance, their mental health or the general upheaval that Covid-19 has presented.  Current laws state that people should work an average of a maximum of 48 hours per week.  For many, that would be a luxury.  The programme for Government contains a commitment in respect of the introduction of proposals this year regarding a right to disconnect.  This was part of the Fine Gael remote working strategy launched in January, prior to the Covid pandemic, and it is something that is already in action in France.  Can the T&aacute;naiste outline plans to enable employees to have the right to disconnect so that when they switch off from work they can actually switch off?</p></speech>

There is already a law in place in that sense.  Working time also includes any of that time at home, but perhaps it is not enough.  We engaged in a public consultation on remote working and received more than 500 replies, which is very encouraging.  We are now examining a twin-track approach to this by giving people the right to request home working and requiring that employers take that seriously.  Linked to that is a right to disconnect so that people do not find that working from home means they are always working.  We want to avoid that.  We are looking at other jurisdictions to see whether their laws have made a difference.  There is little point in passing a law that does not really make a difference.  We should have some proposals in the new year.</p></speech>

This week, Deputy Lahart and I submitted a Private Members' Bill to the Ceann Comhairle's office to deal with some of those legislative changes.  This matter involves a number of Ministers and Departments.

This is a running sore and a hot issue in the Deputy's constituency and mine, where people have been demanding proper regulation in respect of scramblers and quad bikes for quite some time.  On multiple occasions, the Garda has indicated that the laws in place are sufficient, but people on the ground are telling us a very different story.  We are determined to do something to improve the situation and that will involve the Departments of Transport and Justice and other Departments..</p></speech>

Everybody knows the impact Covid-19 is having on the service in this regard.  However, the delay in getting tests is having a severe impact in rural areas where public transport is not readily available.  At present, 93,791 people are awaiting driver tests.  Some 954 of these are in Wexford alone.  I am being contacted on an almost daily basis by essential workers, such as nurses, shop assistants and lorry drivers, who are finding it almost impossible to get to work because of this delay.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to use his offices to urgently consult with instructors, testers and their unions to find a way to accelerate the number of tests that can be carried out safely in coming months.</p></speech>

Before the pandemic, we reached the point where the numbers on waiting list for tests were quite low but they are now quite high again.  We need to bear in mind that we need to protect the health and safety of driving instructors and testers - I know the Deputy will also want to do that - and this means that there are fewer slots than there used to be.  The Road Safety Authority has put in place a system whereby people who need a driving test because they are required to drive to work or to college can be prioritised and put on a cancellation list.  That is working quite well, but not everyone is aware of it.  If the Deputy comes across a constituent who needs that test because they have to get to work or college, they should avail of that possibility to be prioritised.</p></speech>

Will this be made a priority so that towns like Monasterevin, Portarlington and Rathangan can have the blight of derelict buildings removed from their main streets and that these will be transformed into much-needed homes?  They can also be transformed into business premises so that the daily exodus from Kildare and Laois in search of work will be reduced along, as will the consequent impact on the environment.</p></speech>

We are determined to make more progress on it.  Much has been done already with the town and village renewal scheme in recent years through the Department for Rural and Community Development.  However, we need to accelerate it.  When we see it done in a town, it is great to see derelict buildings being brought back into use for housing or for community use and to see old banks that were closed being reinvented as enterprise hubs so that people are working there again and spending money in the shops, pubs and caf&eacute;s in the town.  Where it works, it works really well and is something we need to accelerate in the years ahead.  We will certainly want to include the towns the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

The infrastructure at this crossroads is simply not good enough.  It is under the remit of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which, I understand, is looking at two possible options for works to be carried out at the junction.

East Donegal in particular seems to have a high incidence of the virus.

Counties Cavan and Monaghan are completely dependent on the rural road network as there is no public transport or railway line.  As I have said many times, we need to be imaginative and creative and consider reopening the local rail line.  There is a very sad article in <i>The Anglo Celt</i>this week by Sean McMahon about an elderly lady, Kitty Clarke, who is 74 years of age.  A picture speaks a thousand words, as they say, and the article features a photograph of the deplorable state of Curkish Lane in Bailieborough, which is also a public road.  I am acutely aware of the problems faced by Cavan and Monaghan county councils in relation to roads funding.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to ensure, in his deliberations at Cabinet with the Minister for Transport, that a positive bias is shown towards counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, which are totally dependent on the rural network, in the provision of roads funding for local authorities.</p></speech>

Transport Infrastructure Ireland funding is usually released in December and regional and local road funding will be released in January or February by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.

With social, economic and technological development, work practices are changing all the time.  Having spoken to the T&aacute;naiste on this issue several times, he will be aware that it is one that Sinn F&eacute;in has been working on for a number of months.  I understand it is also an issue for the Government.  Remote working is a new form of working which needs to be recognised as a distinct form of working, similar to the way that shift work is recognised.</p><p>These technological advances that we talk about make our lives easier.  They improve the quality of our lives in so many ways but there are also dangers and pitfalls.  Sometimes these developments, if they are unregulated or uncontrolled, end up actively working against workers, being damaging and inducing stress and other illnesses in people.  From an employer's perspective, if one wants to look at the issue like that, these developments can make it harder for employees to do their work and make them less productive.  For this reason, the right to disconnect is a win-win in many respects for both the worker and the employer.</p><p>For many workers, developments in the area of technology have proven to be a mixed bag.  There are advantages and we know there are disadvantages.  We have seen the development of what can be referred to as an &quot;always on&quot; culture.  We all know what when people finish work at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 7 p.m. or whatever time and close the door behind them, they are off, the door is closed and they can go home.  However, people working at home or remotely do not have the same structure and the danger is that they will always be in work, as it were, if they do not have the opportunity to leave.  Needless to say, the work-related stress created by this situation is a key driver in the mental ill health epidemic that is sweeping the world of work.</p><p>Many years ago, the French noticed there was a blurring of the boundary between work and private life by new technology and ways of working.  They promptly legislated to give workers the right to disconnect from their work outside of contracted work hours.  There is a strong campaign here among trade unions, especially the Financial Services Union, FSU, which has done fantastic work in this area.  I want to give a particular mention to Gareth Murphy, who has been leading on this issue.  The Bill seeks to build on the work done by the FSU, SIPTU, UNITE, the Communication Workers Union and others, and legislate to regulate excessive out-of-hours contact between employers and staff via email, messaging, apps, phones, etc.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to establish procedures for an employee's right to disconnect from work-related emails, texts, and calls outside of their normal working hours.  Put simply, it gives workers the right to disconnect when they are not in work so that they have the right to switch off.  However, as is often the case, some people may prefer to be always on the go, and it will be necessary to include in the legislation a right to opt out from this.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of electronic communications to the success of many businesses and organisations.  The use of mobile technology has enabled many workers to remain connected and in employment, and those who can work from home have been encouraged to do so.  We discussed this during Oral Questions the other evening.  I believe there should be a legal right not just to request remote working but also to ensure that people have their request considered properly if they want to work remotely.</p><p>We know that working from home has increased productivity.  Some workers are much happier and when they are much happier, obviously they will be much more productive.  I have to be honest when I say that while many workers enjoy remote working, blended working and their jobs in general, many have been in contact with me to say the &quot;always on&quot; culture and the fact that they cannot disconnect, and cannot refer to legislation that gives them the right to do so, is making their lives almost unbearable.  For some, the emails and pings from their phones are constant.  We know these are constant for many workers.</p><p>I note the Government has published its guidance on remote working, which is very much a step in the right direction.  However, we need to have a legislative underpinning.  That is why I have spent the last number of weeks working with stakeholders to research and draft this Bill.  In this regard, I must give specific thanks and credit to Dr. Conor McCabe.</p><p>This legislation seeks to give workers the legal right to disconnect from work-related emails, texts and calls.  It further makes it a requirement for employers to put in place a right to disconnect policy to establish the hours when employees are not supposed to send or answer work-related emails, texts or calls, and this has to be put in place in consultation with the workers and, where applicable, with the relevant, recognised trade union.  It also allows an employee to waive his or right to disconnect but only with his or her consent.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200019#R02000"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide employees working remotely with a right to switch off from out of working hours work-related electronic communications, to disapply subject to conditions certain provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 in the case of certain employees working temporarily from home, and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>We launched this campaign already, so I think we are ahead of the curve.  The T&aacute;naiste has already spoken on this issue in response to a previous question.  It is a very important topic, one which, collectively, this House will have to deal with.  The Labour Party has been fighting for workers since its inception.</p> <p>The number of people working from home on a regular basis has more than trebled from 200,000 to 700,000 as a result of the pandemic.  We will have to address the issues that have arisen out of that change.  The laws regulating home working are either piecemeal, out of date or unworkable.  I am sure everybody in the House will accept that the Organisation of Working Time Act is designed for a different era.  Its basis is fine but it is out of date.  Eight months into the pandemic, we really need to get up to speed with how these issues are being dealt with in other jurisdictions.  Four of our European partners have moved to address them quite swiftly and we must do the same.</p> <p> We are introducing this Bill to protect workers in a situation where there is an increasing number of issues affecting their day-to-day working lives.  The Bill gives two new protections to employees who work from home.  The first is to give all workers the right to switch off.  This is a very important protection that will ensure fair treatment of workers working remotely.  The advances in information technology and mobile telephony over the past 20 years have enabled people to contact each other through different channels with an ease that was unthinkable a few years ago, let alone a decade ago.  Whether it is by way of email, text messaging, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Zoom, Google Duo, Microsoft Teams or even the good old-fashioned telephone call, there is rarely an instance where a person cannot be contacted.  In this environment, politicians, like many people, now have to manage our contact channels.  People who are working from home deserve to be able to do the same.</p> <p> All this increased connectivity brings with it increased opportunities for employees to be pressurised into working long hours and responding to messages late at night.  A recent report by RT&Eacute; on staff working in the Houses of the Oireachtas showed that we are not exactly angels in our own working environment.  The culture of always being on has a very negative impact on people's physical and mental health, not to mention family life, as I am sure we are all aware.  Our Bill requires employers to set out a policy in regard to out-of-hours communication and ensure employees will not be punished for failing to respond to emails or other communications.</p> <p> As I said, we need to quicken our pace in addressing these issues, following what has been done in France, Italy, Spain and Belgium.  Ireland is one of the only countries in the EU without any modern protection in our employment law for remote workers.  The second key protection the Bill offers is to sort out the mess that is the requirement on employers to ensure their employees' workspace is suitable and appropriate.  At present, employers are, in effect, required to inspect the homes of their employees to ensure their workspace meets the requirements.  This is ludicrous and cannot be enforced.  We have proposed the pragmatic solution that employers be required to provide the equipment employees need but do not have, such as a suitable desk and chair, and pay a fixed amount to cover the cost to the employee of working from home, such as heating and lighting.  Much of this can be done through amendments to the tax codes and other small changes that I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will support.  Such changes are particularly important for people in low-paid employment and those who are renting.</p> <p> My colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock, has carried out a survey on this issue, which found that the lack of suitable workspace at home, especially for those renting, is really impacting on people's mental health.  The lack of clarity about supports and compensation for employees for the costs of working from home is also affecting workers negatively.  The idea that people in rented accommodation will invest in home-working equipment is not realistic.  However, employers often put them under pressure to perform and they may not be able to do so without investing.  There must be some formula for dealing with that.</p> <p> I hope the Taoiseach will give our proposals his consideration.  I meant to refer to the T&aacute;naiste.  This is the first time I have made that Freudian slip.  I was one of the few people who never made it but now I have slipped up as well.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste, the Government and all parties to support the Bill.  Collectively, as the D&aacute;il and Seanad, we all know we need to deal with this issue.  Covid has been a disrupter and it has changed everything.  We must change with it.</p></speech>

It has never been more important to ensure that Irish interests across our entire island are protected throughout the Brexit process.  We have seen how the Tories continue to undermine the process and, indeed, Irish interests, most recently through the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, which is both dangerous and illegal.  Surely at this stage we should know never to trust a British Government when it comes to Ireland, Irish interests and our people.  We have to make every effort to ensure that a free trade agreement that protects Irish jobs is agreed.  This is a matter of great concern in my constituency, particularly given the enormous damage caused to our economy by the pandemic and the closure of businesses this year.  Some people feel that, as a result of the pandemic, the focus has shifted away from the potential difficulties Brexit may pose.  We need to assure communities and businesses that they will be able to work and live their lives as normal once Britain leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  On the specifics of this Bill, I will raise the proposed changes to the retail export scheme and the effect these will have on tourist-focused retailers.  As we know, this scheme enables tourists from outside of the EU to claim a VAT refund on exported holiday purchases on sales worth more than a minimum of 1 cent.  Since the 1980s, the scheme has played a part in helping local businesses to grow and has contributed greatly to attracting tourism spend.  This Bill changes the scheme so that tourists can only avail of it if they are willing to spend more than &euro;175 per store.  It is estimated that 80% of tourists who use the scheme spend less than &euro;175 per store.  This figure rises to 90% along the west coast and in the midlands, areas that cannot afford any further blows to tourism.  The types of businesses on which this change will have the worst impact are the arts and crafts businesses, the pottery businesses, the Irish woollens businesses, businesses selling musical instruments such as bodhr&aacute;ns, and so on.  Tourists would have availed of this VAT relief when shopping in such businesses.  This measure will hit small retailers hardest, particularly those outside Dublin where the majority of the tourist spend under the scheme takes place.</p>  <p>  Other EU states are moving their existing thresholds while we are raising ours.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  Given the absolute hammering the tourism sector has experienced in 2020 and the potential for major travel restrictions next year, the timing of this move is absolutely disastrous for the sector, which is already on its knees.  I ask the Minister to strongly reconsider this decision given the effects it will have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200021#U00400"><p>I appreciate that, when asked by my party leader, Deputy McDonald, to work together on an all-party approach to Brexit, the Taoiseach agreed.  I firmly believe that this is the only way to approach Brexit.  I hope the Taoiseach holds firmly to his commitment in that regard.</p> <p> I want to raise some of the serious concerns some of my constituents and I have regarding healthcare in a post-Brexit society.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that over 6,000 people availed of the cross-Border directive in 2018 and this number has grown year on year.  With over 6,000 patients on the cataract surgery waiting list in this State, the use of the cross-Border directive will finish on 1 January.  I welcome the announcement to develop a cataract surgery unit at South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  However, funding was only signed off on in September.  We need a concrete timeline for when this unit will come into play.  Operations will be stopped on 1 January so we need to know when this service will be up and running.  The only issue I have with this facility is that it will only have the capacity to perform 2,000 surgeries a year.  When there is a waiting list of 6,000 people with new people coming on the list every day, we are suggesting that a second facility or service should be put in place to share the workload.</p> <p> We also have major issues with people who need hip and knee replacements.  I know people who are trapped in their homes and unable to get out because they are not mobile and because of the pain and discomfort they are in.  They are worried, along with others, about the potential loss of the ability to avail of the cross-Border directive.  There were over 612,000 people waiting to see consultants in September 2020.  This has increased over 500% in four years.  Despite all the spin, the waiting times are going up year on year and this is not Covid-19 related.  Many people have a fear that because of Brexit they will see the waiting times spiral out of control.  We need a solution where a plan is put in place for people who have been living in pain and unnecessary discomfort for years.  The thing about this is that sometimes we see figures and waiting times in lists but these are people.  They are ordinary people and they include family members, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters.  We need to put a plan in place to work for these people.</p> <p> The major fear about Brexit that I am raising is that hospital waiting lists will place an additional burden on our already overburdened health service.  I hope that, with this in mind, the Government will give a firm reassurance that healthcare will not be disrupted due to Brexit.  We want to work together to put the necessary measures in place to prevent this from happening.</p></speech>

This is a comprehensive Bill and, as previous speakers stated, it is about working together for the goodness of this island as a while.  To be honest, it is probably inevitable that we are heading for a united Ireland at some stage, despite what has been touted in the media at times.  I agree with many of the speakers who indicated that protection of the Good Friday Agreement is paramount.  Going through some of the issues in the Bill, many speakers have raised the matter that health will be a big issue and a concern for anybody in this country.</p>  <p>  A matter that is particularly close to my hear is that of disability.  I had the opportunity a year and a half ago to visit the Middletown Centre for Autism in Armagh.  It is ironic that I am from Midleton and that place is Middletown.  That is an all-Ireland specialist disability service that is supported by the Department of Education and the UK Department for Education.  I noticed that under the arrangements relating to the health service in the Bill, there is a commitment to continuing that so I will pick the positives out of this today.</p>  <p>  I have also listened to what has been said by those in the drinks and hospitality sector.  These people are very worried and more engagement has to be maintained with the various stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I have to put on the record that our near neighbours across the water and the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, have not been productive or forward going on this.  I appeal to the European Union that when the chips are down it will not do what the old European Economic Community, EEC, did to some members of our Defence Forces, in particular, at the siege of Jadotville.  The EEC gave us all the backing in that instance and promised us everything but when the Irish people went out there and gave their full graft, they did not get any support.</p>  <p>  I also want to talk about the massive cross-Border workforce of 30,000 people.  This issue places an onus on all of us in the House.  It is about all of us having a genuine consensus to support this.  Let us not see any form of a hard border after Brexit.</p>  <p>  I have looked at the Harbours Act 2015.  My constituency stretches from Youghal all the way to Cobh.  The Port of Cork is busy and we have our own Naval Service base there as well as ferries coming in and out.  Many people in Cobh are concerned about how tourism will be affected after the Brexit deadline.  I mention the fishing industry and I wonder what will happen there.  It is about working together on getting a strong agreement of which we can all be proud and in respect of which we can say that we stood our ground and did what we had to do for our nation and our people.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Government not to be found wanting.  Let us all do our best.  We will work with the Government on whatever is coming.  I welcome the initiative of the debate.  It is long overdue.  In the coming weeks we will hopefully be sitting here again, maybe after Christmas, and saying that we will get down to the crux of this and get things right.</p></speech>

We know that it is just short of 50 days until the transition period comes to an end on 31 December.  We also know the past two years have been painful as our nation has watched the Brexit madness and drama unfold.  Our people have suffered from great uncertainty and anxiety, particularly this year.  We know this was to be expected when faced with a global health pandemic.  However, our people have further suffered from the threat of Brexit and what that will mean for them and for their families, businesses and futures.  This threat is hanging over them like a dark cloud.</p>  <p>  The tactics that have been employed by Boris Johnson can only be described as poker moves, with his UK Internal Market Bill or when he well and truly threw the spanner in the works and tried to rock the boat on the hugely important international treaty that is respected all over the world, namely, the Good Friday Agreement.  It was an astonishing and shocking move but one that the Government needs to be mindful of in making decisions going forward.  That is why I would like to add that I am devastated to learn that the Minister of State wants to push out the referendum on Irish unity.  If anything, this sequence of events since its inception, coupled with the experience of Covid-19, clearly demonstrate that there has to be a clear pathway to a united Ireland and a new Ireland that can never be left open to these vulnerabilities again.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on the assurances that are needed for my county, Clare.  There is no better time to focus on this since we are coming up to Christmas and there is talk of food shortages.  All in all, there is need for assurances for: our farmers in Clare, who have just under 6,500 farms; for fisheries, as we are all aware that fish know no borders or division; the tourism, retail and business sectors, which have endured great difficulties before Covid-19 and which we know have been brought to their knees in recent months due to Covid-19; the students who require support and who are already in third level courses in the UK; the cross-Border workforce of 30,000 people; and our airports.</p>  <p>  I want to specifically focus on Shannon Airport, which depends on its connectivity to the UK.  We know that Shannon Airport acts as a vital gateway for tourism and business coming into County Clare.  It is important that this airport is supported, not partially or nearly but fully, in order to ensure that it can function when we reach the other side of this pandemic.  It needs guarantees, certainties, preparations and a solid plan as they are the ingredients required to provide a healthy and balanced future.</p> <p>This a job of work to be done and it must be done together.  We must ensure we apply the necessary pressure on London to get the best outcome for us.  I have no doubt that we will have support from Washington and Brussels.  I reiterate my colleagues' earlier comments that we will support the Government in achieving that end.  I look forward to this Bill being debated in full on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200023#W00200"><p>We are debating the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 and by any standards this is comprehensive legislation.  It is the second omnibus Bill dealing with Brexit to come before the House.  The Bill involves nine Government Departments and has 19 Parts.  It aims to protect citizens' rights and support the economy, enterprise and jobs.  It sets out to protect the Common Travel Area and to facilitate North-South co-operation.  It is clear to me that civil servants across those nine Government Departments have put a huge amount of time and effort into this Bill and we should acknowledge the work they have done in this regard.</p>  <p>  Where do we stand regarding reaching an agreement on a new trade deal as negotiations between the EU and the UK intensify?  The EU certainly wants a deal with the UK, but not at any cost.  It seems there are significant differences in respect of fishing rights, issues in respect of a level playing field and governance.  Discussions are still at a technical level.  The UK is engaged in brinkmanship and time is running out.  One thing is clear, however.  A deal is in everyone's best interests.  Let us hope that the negotiations will be successful.</p>  <p>  The issue of trust is of major concern, however.  The publication of the Internal Market Bill has severely dented the trust the EU has in the UK.  That Bill gives the UK Government the power to break the Ireland-Northern Protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still ruling out removing these provisions from the Bill and he has informed the President of the European Commission that he is proceeding with the Bill in its current form despite the House of Lords having voted to remove the offending clauses.  The signs are not good, therefore.  There is little trust in evidence.  Let us hope, therefore, that a free trade agreement can be reached.</p>  <p>  I warmly congratulate former Vice President Joe Biden on his election as President of the United States of America.  The President-elect favours free trade over protectionism, he believes in multilateral diplomacy and participation in international organisations.  He is also committed to tackling climate change.  This is all good for Ireland and the EU.  President-elect Biden is obviously a good friend of Ireland.  During the presidential election campaign, he warned that there could be no UK-US trade agreement if there is any threat to the Good Friday Agreement or the introduction of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  His support is most welcome and it will, no doubt, be crucial in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  It is notable that this week Sinn F&eacute;in and Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, which make up the Northern Ireland Executive, wrote to the European Commission expressing concern on behalf of supermarkets regarding the paperwork that will be required in respect of agrifood coming from Britain.  The Executive requested a waiver from this bureaucracy for these products.  This is a significant request and is yet another issue that must be resolved in the context of the current negotiations.  This is a rare display of unity between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, so hopefully the European Commission can respond positively to their letter.</p>  <p>  Part 16 of this Bill aims to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to allow extradition between Ireland and the UK, following its departure from the EU.  On the European arrest warrant scheme, reports in the newspapers last weekend stated that the European Commission is unhappy about Ireland's operation of this system and about delays in carrying out extraditions in particular.  I hope the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, can address this matter when she is debating her part of the Bill, perhaps on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  An agreement is in everyone's best interests.  A report by the UK's National Audit Office, recently published, stated that 40% to 70% of hauliers are unprepared for Brexit and that there could be queues of up to 7,000 trucks at Channel crossings.  I note what the Taoiseach had to say on British television in recent days about the need for an agreement and how that will be in the interests of the UK and the EU.  Any reports coming from a UK source clearly indicate that as the case.  That brings me to the position of Irish hauliers and how prepared they are for Brexit.  The Government is advising exporters to switch to direct ferry services to the Continent, rather than going through Britain.  Stena Line and Irish Ferries are providing services from Dublin and Rosslare to Cherbourg.  However, the Irish Road Hauliers Association, IRHA, is warning that there is not enough capacity on these planned services.  It is questioning the report of the Irish Maritime Development Organisation, IMDO, which concluded that there is enough capacity for the number of lorries needing direct access.  We must be sure about this aspect of the situation at this stage and ensure that exporters and importers can get their goods onto the Continent and into Ireland in as efficient a manner as possible.  It seems to me that there is work to be done in this area.</p>  <p>  I also take this opportunity to address another matter confronting the EU, namely, rule of law issues.  As we know, there are rule of law problems in Hungary and Poland.  A serious example of this is the introduction of so-called LGBT-free zones in Poland, which none of us supports.  I welcome, therefore, the provisional agreement reached last week, whereby the provision of EU Covid-19-related funding will now be dependent on compliance with the rule of law and adherence to EU values.  The provisional agreement is between the European Council and the Members of the European Parliament, MEPs.  I am sure the Minister of State is fully aware of the most recent developments.  I know he has raised these rule of law issues at EU level, as well as here in the D&aacute;il in the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  There is more work to be done on this issue, but what has been agreed so far is most welcome.</p>  <p>  This is significant legislation.  It is a weighty Bill and deals with many matters concerning the Republic of Ireland and the UK.  It is the second omnibus Bill brought before this House dealing with Brexit.  I am pleased that we are addressing these issues and I am hopeful there will be no hiccups on 1 January, regardless of whether a trade agreement has been reached.  We are prepared and that is most welcome.  Irish businesses need to prepare for Brexit.  It goes without saying, but time is running out, businesses need to be taking measures to deal with the situation, with or without a trade deal being in place on 1 January.  I implore them to do what must be done.</p>  <p>  People are concerned.  The hauliers are concerned, supermarkets in Northern Ireland are concerned and there are even concerns about possible shortages here in the Republic of Ireland.  We hope the move on 1 January will go without significant problems, but we must be as prepared as we can.  This Bill deals with these outstanding issues.</p> <p>No doubt if there are any other issues that emerge between now and the end of the year, more legislation can be considered by the House.  I hope that we will get a trade agreement.  The negotiations are intensifying and I guess that silence is golden because we are not hearing much leaking from the talks currently under way in the UK.  It is in everybody's interest that we do get a trade agreement and an agreement in general on all the other various issues under consideration.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200024#X00200"><p>We all recognise that we are now approaching the Brexit end game.  Irrespective of whether or not there is a trade deal agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and I hope there is, we all need to recognise that Brexit is a momentous occasion not just for the United Kingdom but also for this State.  In years to come, when the history of the 21st century is written of Ireland and of the UK, Brexit will feature very strongly and prominently.  It will have such a momentous impact on this country because our history and our lives are, to a significant extent, affected by the lives and politics of the United Kingdom.  That has been the case for 1,000 years.  The history of this island has been affected significantly by the history of the neighbouring larger island and this will probably continue into the next centuries.</p>  <p>  It is worthwhile, at the outset, that we really reflect on what are the political origins of Brexit and why was it that our closest neighbour, a country with which we have so much in common, made what we all in the House believe was the regressive decision to leave the European Union, and to further their own path in what it believes to be the better interests of the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  While we do that, we should recognise that at the same time Brexit happened, an extraordinary political even happened in the United States of America.  Sometimes we forget the significance that back in 2016 the people in the US elected as their President a well known businessman who was a television celebrity and who achieved prominence in the US in his campaign because he condemned the political system that operated in the United States of America at the time and he is still in power today.</p>  <p>  The reason it is worthwhile that we in this House look at those political events and their origins, is that we have to recognise that as a country Ireland is hugely affected by what happens in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America.  They are two very powerful political entities in the world and they have had significant influence throughout the world.  We need to recognise that we are sandwiched between the two of them and that it is only natural and not unusual that our politics has been affected and will continue to be affected by events that happen in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  When one looks one can see that the origins of Brexit were a form of English nationalism that really wished to reject association and alignment with Europe.  Leaving aside the whole issue of the European Union, at the heart of Brexit was the concern that the United Kingdom had become too close to its European neighbours and the whole issue of immigration was also linked with that.  It was on that basis that the majority of voters in the United Kingdom, but mainly in England, made the decision that they wanted to leave the European Union.  It is instructive to note that the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland decided that they did not want to leave the European Union, but unfortunately they are stuck with it now because of the dominance of English nationalism in that debate.</p>  <p>  With the election of President Trump in the United States of America, again there was a form of nationalism associated with his election.  There was also a rejection of what was regarded as the middle ground of politics.  At the heart of Brexit and the election of President Trump was a rejection of the centre ground.  It was an argument that said polarised politics is good and it has had that effect in the United Kingdom.  Unfortunately, as we have seen recently in the United States of America, there is also a very polarised political world there currently.</p>  <p>  I mention these two points because as other aspects of our lives are influenced by the United States of America and the United Kingdom we must be particularly careful that we do not allow our politics to become infected in the same way that the politics of the United Kingdom through Brexit and the politics of the US through the election of President Trump have become polarised.  I regret to say it may be the case that we are going down that pathway of polarised politics in this country.  If one looks at the way politics operates in the US and in the UK, one can see that it is very strategic, very deliberate, and more advanced than politics in this country.  That may sound as if it is intended to be a compliment, but it is not.  Simply because politics is advanced and strategic does not mean that it leads to good governance.  When I say that politics in those countries is strategic and advanced, it is that the political groupings in those countries know what they need to do in order to attract political support behind their own political groups.  Unfortunately, in those countries the political objectives of those political groups are universally put ahead of what is regarded as good governance in those countries.</p>  <p>  We need to be careful not to allow this country to go down the route of polarised politics.  Unfortunately, for decades and for generations we have seen in Northern Ireland that there is polarised politics there.  What do we mean when we say that politics has become polarised?  It is really a negation of politics.  It means that people do not look at issues on the basis of the content of the issue.  Instead, they decide their view on an issue by trying to see which side the person's political grouping is in favour of.  This has happened, unfortunately, for many years in Northern Ireland.  We even see it today with their response to the pandemic.  No issue in Northern Ireland appears to be safe or liberated from the politics of green and orange.  This is what is happening in the United Kingdom when it comes to Brexit and it is what has happened in the United States of America when it comes to the politics they operate there.  This is why it is so important that in this country we try to hold the centre ground.  This is why Fianna F&aacute;il is so important to this country, to ensure there is a large national party in the centre ground representing the centre left of the country for the purpose of ensuring we do not have a polarised political system.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, social media contributes to the polarisation of politics.  It is, in fact, the weapon that is used to polarise politics.  If one is going to polarise politics one must have an enemy and the enemy can never do anything right and the enemy must always be condemned for not representing the interests of your political group.  That is a consequence of polarised politics.  It is extremely important in this country that we do not allow political engagements on social media or elsewhere to be debased to a situation where it is just becoming attack politics.  I regret to say that some of the politics in this House engages in that form of attack politics.  The Members of this House do not.  Most Members of this House are reasonable people.  They know there is a resolution to political disputes, they recognise there should be debate about political disputes and in general my assessment of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is that they are open-minded people.  Behind us, however, are people whose sole objective is to advance the political success of their own political agendas and groupings.  For that purpose they use social media to create polarisation.  We need to be careful of it.  If it is the case that this country becomes extremely polarised politically let us be clear as to what will happen.  We will go down the same pathway as the United States of America or the United Kingdom and people will be divided on the basis of whether they belong to one political grouping or another.  Political engagement then ceases, political debate then becomes irrelevant and the only issue is where one's tribe stands in respect of this.</p>  <p>  That is a message we have learned from Brexit.  It is a message we all have to be careful of.  If we go down the route of achieving polarised politics in this country, it will be very difficult to reverse it, as we have seen with what has happened in the UK and in the US.  Once people go down that route it will take a generation to reverse it.</p>  <p>  What is the solution to ensure we do not get polarised politics?  I am not requiring that every Member of this House decides to position in the centre ground.  That is a polarisation in itself: everyone stuck in the centre.  We all need to ensure that we do not condemn our political opponents on the basis that they do not represent, nor do they seek to speak for, anyone else other than their own grouping elite, as is sometimes represented.</p> <p>We need to recognise that engagement is a success in politics.  The great political success of this generation on these islands was the Good Friday Agreement.  Even in Britain, the great diplomatic success of the past 20 or 30 years was the Good Friday Agreement.  That was achieved through negotiation, respect, discussion and debate.  That is the secret to the centre ground and that is why we must be careful not to allow this country to go down the same route as the US and the UK.</p></speech>

Fair play to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  He made a fine speech, none of which I agree with.</p><p>I will start by sounding a note of caution.  We in this House need to be more realistic about our friends in Washington and Brussels.  Echoed across this House is the mistaken belief that Joe Biden will be the saviour of the Good Friday Agreement and the guarantor of peace in this country.  Similar hopes have been expressed repeatedly in this House about the great and the good of the European Union acting as a protector of our interests in this island and as a bastion against a hard Border.  Joe Biden might know about Mayo's GAA hopes and Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier may continually wax lyrical about how much they love Ireland but, ultimately, it would be the height of folly for us to believe that the interests of the ordinary people of Ireland, North and South, will be the determining factor in either Joe Biden's or the EU's policies in the months ahead.  Joe Biden will do whatever is in the interests of US capitalism, not what is best for Mayo or Ballina.  Mr. Juncker stated clearly last year:</p> <blockquote> 	We have to make the sure the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved.  An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter the European Union without any kind of control via the southern part of the Irish island.  This cannot happen.  We have to preserve the health and safety of our citizens. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister of State can interpret that how he likes but that is clear to me that-----</p></speech>

There is no doubt that Boris Johnson and the Tories have used the Brexit debate to stoke up xenophobia and anti-migrant racism within a wider project of using the withdrawal from the EU to position a declining British capitalism as a low-wage, low-regulation haven for the worst forms of neoliberal projects.  There is an accompanying attack on all public services, the NHS being a shining example.  It is also clear that the Tories want to be free of environmental laws and regulations and to position themselves as a low-wage, anti-worker and anti-environmental competitor of both the EU and other trading blocs.  I see the Minister of State nodding.  He agrees with me on that.</p>  <p>  This debate and the 21 separate sections of the Bill highlight just how intricate and complex having a border on this island is.  James Connolly rightly predicted "a carnival of reaction both North and South" because of partition.  In the South, we are only in recent decades reversing some elements of that reaction in the legacy of the mother and baby homes scandal and much of the anti-women legislation that the southern State embedded in itself.  The same fight continues against that reaction in the North through the campaigns for the right to choose and marriage equality.  However, the strongest legacy of the reaction of partition today is the DUP.  This is not just a conservative right-wing outcrop of the Tories.  It would, by any standards of politics, be classified as extremely right-wing in every policy sphere.  That type of politics has been sustained over decades only by a recourse to sectarianism and outright bigotry based on religion.  The consequence of its strength as the largest party in the North has been abysmal for both communities.  Protestant workers have paid dearly for the dominance of a sectarian far-right party as their primary representative through public services, wage rates, social services, social protection and so on.</p>  <p>  In this Covid crisis we can see dramatically just how high a price workers pay when led by extreme right-wing and sectarian forces.  The willful ignoring of public health advice by the DUP is based on a political philosophy that is marginalised in most jurisdictions, but we see it play out clearly in Trump's America, in Johnson's UK and with the DUP in Stormont.  It is, when stripped of its rhetoric, a decision that economic interests must come before public health and that if the consequences of that decision are large death tolls and huge infection rates, then so be it.  It is not a policy of living with Covid but of learning to die with Covid, with the added insult that these people claim that this is somehow the will of God.  In this disaster, the rational case for a united Ireland becomes ever clearer in light of the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  As Deputy O'Callaghan noted, we need to remind ourselves that the people of Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit.  A practical case is to be made for an all-Ireland health service and an all-Ireland approach to the pandemic.  The need for a united Ireland is no longer a question of which flag flies over which jurisdiction but a question of whether we can truly build a national health service for everyone on this island, or ensure a safe environment with access to decent services, decent pensions and decent wages for everyone on this island.  We cannot continue to shy away from the need for a border poll forever.</p>  <p>  Many of us are extremely concerned about the question of an all-Ireland health strategy.  Anyone who has listened to GPs and healthcare workers in the North pleading for the government there to listen to public health advice can tell that the discussions are falling well short of where they need to be.  The T&aacute;naiste told us earlier that the Government is in continuous discussions with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, but we do not know what fruit is coming out of those discussions.  All we can see is disaster hurtling our way.  We need to know where those discussions are going and what sort of input we can have into an all-island strategy to crush this pandemic.  The Stormont parties, especially Sinn F&eacute;in, need to be stronger and must spell out very clearly what the public health advice is and how they want to take measures to follow it.  I will leave it at that.  I do not have much to say about the 21 individual measures in this Bill.  They are obviously necessary if we see the world in terms of who runs what part of the country but it is quite a disaster for this country that we remain partitioned and live, as Connolly predicted, "in a carnival of reaction".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200025#Y01200"><p>I will start with a specific provision in the Bill, which states that a tourist from a non-EU country has to purchase something with a value of more than &euro;175 to get the VAT rebate.  This has been an incredibly important scheme for craft shops and other businesses around the country, particularly in areas where a high proportion of the economy is based on tourism.  There are many jobs involved.  All the craft shop owners will say that while these tourists might make multiple purchases in one shop and might spend quite a bit of money, the individual purchases would not come to &euro;175.  Like everyone else, I recognise that the island of Britain joining its neighbouring island, the Isle of Man, outside the European Union is going to change the world quite dramatically because of its sheer population.</p> <p>I understand there are already good safeguards in the Bill to ensure this process is not abused by people from our neighbouring island.  Even though technically the North of Ireland is going to be outside of the European Union, in lots of other ways it is going to be in it.  In this case, it will be considered to be in the European Union.  Accordingly, one will not be able to go into the North of Ireland, buy one's goods, claim the VAT and go out.</p> <p> I hope we get good news on this before the Bill goes through the D&aacute;il and that we see a more tourism friendly approach to it.  It would be much preferred if more of the goods under this scheme were made in the country.  We must ensure more of our tourism product is actually produced on the island of Ireland.  When we look at it in the round, we are going over the top here to achieve something that might not happen in the way people fear.  The only people from Britain who would be able to do this would be those who came here and left the island again.  As I said, there is no shortcut through the North of Ireland on this scheme.</p> <p> It is amazing watching the television these days.  When Brexit was not happening, day and night, all we got on the television was Brexit.  When we were really far away from it, as was shown subsequently, if one looked at RT&Eacute; news, a whole section was devoted Brexit issues.  Now that we are coming up to the real wall, it does not seem to be worrying the media as much as one would have thought.</p> <p> I hope an agreement will be reached.  It is going to take flexibility and goodwill on all sides.  It is a pity that Europe did not recognise earlier that, whether Europe or we on this island liked it, the British people had a referendum and made their choice.  We should have all respected that from the beginning.  It seemed, however, that a lot of people spent a lot of time trying to tell them that they made the wrong decision, that it was all a big mistake and that they were badly informed.  Last Christmas, whether we liked it or not, the British reaffirmed that decision by putting the Conservative Party strongly back into government on a "Get Brexit Done" ticket.  We have lost time when we could have been working out the modalities of this.  Instead of trying to persuade them that they had made a big mistake, we should have recognised their sovereignty on this issue on the island of Britain.</p> <p> I recognise, of course, that events which happened 100 years ago have come back to haunt us and we are having an unforeseen difficulty on this island.  From the beginning, I summed up that difficulty as a case in which one could not accept a border on the island but one would have to accept the sensitivity of the unionist pro-Brexit population - who are in the minority but a large minority at that - and that putting a border in the Irish Sea would send wrong political signals to them.  Again, it is water under the bridge.  It took a long time to sort that one out, however.</p> <p> Peculiarly enough, maybe by accident more than design, if we do get a hard Brexit, Northern Ireland is going to find itself in an advantageous position and actually in a better position than the South.  It will be the only sterling area in the Single Market.  On the other hand, all the widgets produced in Northern Ireland - they might have to go through paperwork - can be sold through the South into the whole of Europe without any customs or tariffs.  There would be no paperwork going that way.  If they go into the island of Britain, they can also sell in there.  It is going to be the only part of the European Union that can sell both to Britain and to the rest of Europe with no tariffs.  Of course, we could find, particularly around the Border areas, a migration of companies, setting up in Northern Ireland because of that advantage.  This is all the more reason that it is important for this island that we get an agreement.</p> <p>  I have always maintained that fishing would be a contentious issue.  Looking at British politics, fishing and the like are symbolic of sovereignty.  One other conundrum not debated much is where are the richest waters around the island of Britain.  In England, they are off the north-east coast, not off the west coast, with its clear run for 200 miles towards Norway.  It is interesting to note that, in the last general election there, the Conservative Party did well in those very north-east constituencies.  Not that many of them are fishermen in those areas but it is symbolically important to them.</p> <p> Much more important, however, is what is north of them.  Scotland is surrounded on three sides by water.  It extends well out and well north because the Shetlands and the Orkneys are to the north of Scotland while the isles are well west of Scotland.  The country has enormous wealth in fisheries.  Inevitably, there will be a new independence referendum in Scotland.  The last referendum was won by the pro-union side by 5%.  If Boris Johnson wanted to maintain this margin, he will want to be able to say to Nicola Sturgeon if she wins independence and goes back into the European Union, she will have to give all the fisheries back again.  If, instead, she stays, Boris Johnson can tell her he will defend all the fisheries and hold them for Britain.  For that reason, I have always believed Britain will hang tough on the fisheries issue.</p> <p> No matter what comes out of these negotiations, it could have serious consequences for Irish fisheries.  I am never one to look at things as half-empty.  I prefer to look at them as half-full.  It is time that we said in Europe that the whole fisheries regime stinks.  We sold ourselves short on our water and fish resources from the very beginning in Europe.  I hate to say it but that was done by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We have 14% of the fish but 4% of the quota.  We have allowed people near the coast with a six-mile sovereign area that we control.  Up to 90% of the fish are caught by the big industrial operators but 80% of the fishermen are in small boats.  Accordingly, there is a case to be made at European level that all of the coastal nations would get a much bigger slice of the coastal waters for their coastal fishermen.  It should also be the case that the big industrial interests would have to yield to local interests and the benefit of local economies.</p> <p> There are several weeks still available.  An arbitrary deadline should not be set.  We should keep talking until we get to a place of agreement.  It concerns me that in the final hot hours of these negotiations we will not be at the table.  It is hard to expect anybody to represent one's interests as best as one could when the big industrial interests of France and Germany are at stake.</p> <p>I am a little bit afraid that we might be let down.  I have always had that fear.  All I could think of when listening to previous speakers is that in this country we have a history of believing that our salvation will come from abroad.  Any time someone says we will be saved by Europe, America or somebody else, I always think of the song from way back when that goes:</p><blockquote>	&quot;T&aacute; na Francaigh ag teacht thar s&aacute;ile&quot;<br /><br />Arsa an tSean-bhean bhocht. </blockquote> <p>Then I think of the people who decided that the destiny of Ireland should be taken into the hands of the people of Ireland.  They did not want to avoid being internationalists or playing their part as one of the nations of the world, but they would do so in a sovereign way and make sure they were at the table.  I accept that a very small number believes that.  I am probably in a minority of one or two, but I have that deep worry and I sincerely hope I am wrong.</p></speech>

I welcome its publication.  It is very important that it gets out there.  In 49 days, whether we like it or not and whether there is a deal, our trade relations with our nearest neighbour will face a severe shock.  It is very sensible and prudent to get our house in order as soon as possible, at least from a legislative point of view.  I have gone through the Bill in detail and I agree with the vast majority of what is in it.  I am in general agreement and I will be very happy to support its passage through the Chamber in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  I would like to comment on the opening remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the convention centre yesterday.  I found them quite reassuring.  He mentioned that the common travel area, a bilateral arrangement between this country and the UK, will be maintained and protected from 1 January.  That is important for our students, our workers and our families that are divided between both of these islands.  I am very encouraged by that fact.  I am also encouraged by his mention of a memorandum of understanding between Irish officials and UK authorities on the continuing healthcare cooperation, which is so important for these islands.  This memorandum is very close to being finalised.  Both of these measures are very important and officials on both sides should be commended on producing these draft agreements. </p>  <p>  I have been in this Chamber several times in the past few months to speak about Brexit and the wider EU project.  My views on EU affairs are well-established.  I would like to focus on four key developments in the past week that will influence how the negotiations play out.  First I would like to mention the comments of Sir John Major only three or four days ago, which were significant.  A former leader of the Conservative Party and British Prime Minister said he is completely against Brexit and that it will significantly diminish the UK's international standing.  While he agrees with the sovereign decision of the British public, he believes they were sold a pup.  They were sold an idea on false pretences.  That is a significant statement and it has been his consistent view throughout.  It will ratchet up the pressure on the UK negotiating team.</p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the House of Lords, which emphatically voted down illegal provisions in the draft United Kingdom Internal Market Bill 2019-21.  That is also a significant development.  The ratio of the vote was three to one, which is huge.  If there are people in this House who think that moderate Britain has disappeared and there are no sensible or prudent people in the British establishment, the evidence suggests otherwise.  I am happy that those provisions have been at least temporarily taken out and perhaps even permanently torpedoed, which would be a positive development. </p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the resignation of a senior British official at 10 Downing Street.  That shows the level of discord, disharmony and dysfunction in that office.  In a positive light it shows by contrast that there is significant unity of purpose in this Parliament, which has not gone unnoticed throughout the world.  All sides of the House should be commended on that.  Long may it continue.  Finally, the election of an Irish-American, President-elect Joe Biden, is a significant development.  It has the potential to completely change the calculus of how the negotiations play out in the next few days and weeks. </p>  <p>  I have a few questions for the Minister of State.  Perhaps he could touch on them in his closing remarks.  I am conscious that he must be circumspect in his use of language given the delicate situation during the next few days, but perhaps he could outline the timeline of events between now and 31 December.  For instance, a videoconference meeting of the European Council is scheduled for this day week, 19 November.  Is that likely to go ahead?  If there is a trade deal between the EU and the UK, will a remote conference be sufficient to sign off on it or will a physical EU summit be needed?</p>  <p>  I refer also to the ratification process.  The European Parliament will have to approve any potential deal.  What is this parliament's ratification process?  Does the Minister of State anticipate that further legislation will be required to codify any deal or is he happy with the omnibus Bill that we have in front of us?  Perhaps he could outline the timeline and how he sees this playing out. </p>  <p>  I refer also to the EU's &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve.  It has been talked about a lot in the past few months.  I was reassured by the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that this fund will be targeted at sectors and countries that are disproportionately affected by Brexit.  Does the Minister of State know what will Ireland's percentage of that &euro;5 billion be?  If not, when will we get more clarity?  </p>  <p>  The 11-month EU transition period has served all parties very well.  It has been in effect since 1 February and the clock is running out on it at this point.  My view is that we need an extension of three or six months.  The end of June is probably a good date to aim for.  The reason there is so much uncertainty about Brexit is that we do not know what the shape of the agreement will be, if there is one.  If we get one in December, it will be too late to upgrade our port infrastructure and get our small and medium-sized enterprises ready.  It would make a lot of sense to extend the transition period and we should aim to do so.  Regarding the post-Brexit relationship, if we get a bare-bones trade agreement in the coming days or weeks, what is the likelihood of a more comprehensive trade agreement between the EU and the UK at a later date, perhaps 12 or 24 months from now?  Is this possible or is it pie in the sky?</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to ask about an information campaign.  Other Deputies mentioned this yesterday.  Once a trade deal is agreed, or even if it is not, I would like to think that an information campaign is ready to go so that the trigger can be pulled as soon as the outcome is known.  Time is very short.  On behalf of my constituents, I emphasise the need for information from the Government.</p>  <p>  All the indications show that we are inching towards a very basic bare-bones free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.  The three outstanding issues are fisheries, that is, the EU fishing fleet's access to territorial waters, governance issues relating to the level playing-field and the full implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> <p>The UK desperately needs a deal.  It needs a deal because the EU is its biggest and closest trading partner, but a deal is also in our interests.  Our business community and agri-food industry have suffered disproportionately as a result of the pandemic and the ensuing global recession.  We do not need a third hit.  A double whammy is more than enough. </p> <p> I wish Michel Barnier and the EU task force negotiating team the very best and I wish the Government the best also in the final days of negotiating.  I very much look forward to interacting with the UK authorities as constructively as possible from 1 January in whatever shape that relationship plays out.</p></speech>

Ceapann s&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; ina mhionlach anseo ach b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine ann sa D&aacute;il seo at&aacute; den tuairim ch&eacute;anna.</p>  <p>  Aont&uacute; opposes Brexit.  We believe it will do enormous damage to Ireland.  I am amazed that at this far remove from the British referendum there has been precious little introspection or self-examination from a European Union perspective.  Much of the reason people across Europe are anti-EU is that many of them, me included, believe there is a democratic deficit within the EU.  The structures and functions of the EU are not transparently democratic.  The power resides in one or two countries and they dictate the direction of travel.  This was very obvious during the crash in this State ten years ago when Germany and one or two other countries decided they would embark on a policy of hardcore economic damage on Ireland as a result of what happened.  It is amazing that these countries can flip a switch and have a far different monetary policy in this particular crisis from the one they had ten years ago.  </p>  <p>  I agree with Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it is a weakness in our approach that there is not an Irish team at the negotiation table.  Ireland comprises 1.6% of the population of the EU and it exerts precious little influence over the objectives on the EU negotiators' priority list.  If we think that we are at the top table with regard to priorities for that negotiation, we are fooling ourselves.  There is within the Irish psyche a tendency to defer to our betters at times, which is wrong.  There needs to be some level of self-examination in the EU in regard to the reason so many people across the European Union feel the Union itself the biggest threat to the EU at the moment.  </p>  <p>  A couple of days ago, I received from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment a reply to a parliamentary question which indicated that by August, 3,236 businesses in this State had gone bust this year, largely due to Covid-19, although I imagine some of the Brexit changes are probably having an affect on those businesses.  It is an extremely difficult time to exist as a small to medium-sized enterprise in this State.  The figure of 3,236 is, as I said, the figure up to August this year.  It is bound to be underestimated because most businesses that go bust this year will not be known about until the end of the tax year next year.  The real figure will be far higher.  </p>  <p>  I also tabled a parliamentary question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the state of play with the financial supports that were being given to small businesses in this State.  The information I got back is incredible.  While the financial supports are available on paper to SMEs - I will grant the Government that some financial supports are going to SMEs - many of the financial supports that have been created because of Covid and Brexit are not being delivered to SMEs at the moment.  In regard to the working capital scheme, only 915 of 3,935 applications have been approved and only 27% funding has been given out under this particular scheme.  Under the Covid-19 loan scheme, &euro;3.1 million of a pot of &euro;15 million has been allocated.  A mere 279 of 1,205 applications or 13.2% of that funding has been given out.  Under the online retail scheme, the purpose of which is to get businesses ready for Brexit and to deal with Covid, less than 50% of allocations have been made.  That pot was only &euro;2 million.  We are hearing that currently 51% of retail is online, which is the highest ever figure in that regard.  The vast majority of that online retail is going abroad, which means it is lost to Ireland.  At the same time, small businesses are being wiped out.  Under the sustaining enterprise fund of &euro;180 million, only 108 of 639 applications were approved and approximately 25% of the available funding has been paid out to date.  The list goes on.  We have a radical problem with regard to the allocation of the funds necessary for small and medium sized business to be able to function through the double whammy of Covid-19 and Brexit.  There is so much of Brexit that is out of our hands at the moment but supporting those small businesses is in our hands.  More needs to be done to make sure that happens.</p>  <p>  I agree with Teachta Berry's remarks regarding the Brexit negotiations going to the wire.  There is no doubt in my mind that the British are trying to run down the clock in a strategic effort to crowbar their objectives into the final deal.  There is no doubt that we need to make sure we have a transition space.  At this stage, it must be recognised that it is practically impossible for all of the democratic objectives that need to be met after any negotiation is complete to be fulfilled by the end of the year.  Even if we do fulfil all of those democratic objectives - in other words, we get them through all of the committees in the European Parliament - it will still be physically impossible to give practical effect to the elements of the deal to enable businesses to function freely come the start of next year.  I concur that there needs to be an extension of the transition period by at least six months to allow that to happen.  Any less than that will not be feasible for Irish businesses.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is shaking his head.</p></speech>

I have been campaigning on the objective of Irish unity for the last 30 years.  Aont&uacute; was formed 20 months ago.  One of its pillar objectives is the creation of a 32 county Irish republic.  That objective is not a pipe dream or a romantic idea.  In practical terms, the island of Ireland functions a lot better as a unit than it does as a partitioned space.  It is clear to me that as a result of Brexit and Covid-19, many people who were not pro-unity in the past share that ground with us now.  They favour the idea of Irish unity.  It amazes me that 100 years after the War of Independence, which we are celebrating, the self-determination of the people of the North and our ability to function in this State, to do business here and to move people North and South on the island of Ireland are still determined by a Tory Government in London, which cares nothing about this country and knows nothing about it.  It needs to be understood by the D&aacute;il that partition is an exposure in our national interest.  It is a weakness.  The longer we leave it as the elephant in the room, without discussing and working on it, the longer that weakness and exposure will remain.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and I are from County Meath.  The following may have some resonance for Deputy Byrne as a Meath man.  One hundred years ago, the late Liam Mellows, a Teachta D&aacute;la for County Meath and an Irish revolutionary, said that if the island of Ireland was partitioned, there would grow two establishments on both sides of the Border which would then depend on the Border for their own existence.  That has happened.  In this State, we have Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which are regional political parties. </p> <p>If we had an all-Ireland parliament, their support base would be radically smaller and, therefore, they would be politically weaker, have less influence and be less likely to make it into government.  Unity is actually a threat to the self-interest of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  That is one of the major reasons the Taoiseach still refuses to talk about the necessity of planning for Irish unity.  Even though much of the rest of the island of Ireland is on board in the context of the logic behind it, there still is a resistance in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, for their own party-political interests, to going down that route.</p></speech>

That the UK, our nearest neighbour and the nation with which we share our deepest cultural ties, has chosen to leave the EU is regrettable in the extreme.  Ireland and the EU have been patient and will remain at the negotiation table for as long as needs be.  I can see why that is the case.  This is not a straightforward process.  In the decades during which the EU has existed, its policies and measures have evolved dramatically.  Walking away from everything might seem simple but it is not easy.</p>  <p>  Ireland is unique on many levels in this situation.  The UK and Ireland share a deep and often troubled history which continues to influence our interactions with one another for better or for worse.  Ireland is unique in its geography and the challenges it faces arising not only from sharing a land border with the UK, but also from sharing marine areas.  Although the land border has come to dominate many of the discussions surrounding the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, we have heard much less about what is to become of the maritime areas.  I understand that any agreement on fisheries and maritime remains worryingly distant in the ongoing negotiations.  Ireland is one of the few island nations in the EU.  Although our island seems tiny in comparison with some of our neighbours, we have the highest proportion of marine area relative to our land size.  Our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, represents approximately 10% of the entire EU EEZ.  It is a significant resource that surrounds our coast and stretches out into the Atlantic.</p>  <p>  On the fishing and seafood sector, the fisheries of Ireland and the UK are deeply entwined, with agreements long predating our entry to the European Union.  As approximately 34% of Irish landings are taken in UK waters, Irish fishers have become significantly dependent on their access to those waters.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has highlighted that the Irish seafood industry is worth more than &euro;1 billion, with up to 15,000 people having been employed directly or indirectly by the sector.  Our trade relationship in the sector is also highly important, with estimates of the value of imports and exports being in the range of hundreds of millions of euro.  The people and communities who have benefited so much from this relationship currently stand to incur substantial loss.</p>  <p>  The departure of the UK from Irish waters poses another major concern for the fishing sector in the form of increased traffic from other European trawlers.  Not only could this exacerbate the losses imposed as a result of the loss of access to UK waters, it could make it far more difficult for Irish fishers to land catches close to home.  This issue will have economic and environmental impacts.  It goes far beyond a simple consideration of the bottom line.  Very often, fishing is in the blood.  It is handed down from generation to generation and it is stitched into the fabric of coastal communities.  We cannot put a figure on that.  It will be of central importance to build on existing EU support and to continue working with fishers, coastal communities and the seafood sector to address challenges as they arise when the transition period ends.</p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of marine protection.  In our efforts to ensure a level playing field in trade and fishery negotiations, we must also prioritise marine protected areas and the common good they bring, not just for this country but for all member states in the EU.  Marine life and ecosystems are key but often overlooked players in the fight against climate change and the protection of a healthy planet.  Oceans provide 50% of the oxygen we breathe.  They sequester carbon and modulate global weather patterns.  However, maritime life is being exploited and strip-mined to dangerous levels.  When marine areas are protected, there are not trade-offs or losers.  Rather, fish live longer, grow larger, produce more offspring and replenish the overall marine area.  On the whole, the fishing sector stands to gain from such protection.</p>  <p>  With all of that said, there is a genuine fear among environmental groups, smaller scale fishers and conservationists that the UK may not strengthen or even maintain existing levels of protection of its maritime environment.  That risk is coupled with the potential for increased EU fishing in Irish waters which would further undermine marine protection and biodiversity as well as posing challenges to our indigenous fishers.  I fear that we may face an even worse scenario whereby the UK would seek to increase the current quotas to match the amount of fish currently taken by non-UK vessels within the UK zone.  That would lead to serious over-exploitation of stocks at everyone's expense and particularly at the expense of natural marine environments.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming marine planning and development management Bill will shape the future of Ireland's maritime sector, particularly in terms of how it addresses exclusive economic zones in the EU 27 and the Irish continental shelf.  Given the breadth of work covered in the Bill, it is important to maintain constructive communication with our UK counterparts to ensure their facing legislation interfaces well with what is passed by the House.  It is regrettable that a decision on fisheries and the marine has not yet been reached but, as an island nation with rich and strong tradition of seafaring and fishing, I remain optimistic that these crucial sectors will be supported no matter what the outcome is.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight some issues relating to the changing landscape of financial services and taxation that we are likely to see arise in a post-Brexit Europe.  Although the Bill is sorely needed, it is something of a missed opportunity to implement more robust measures in the sector of financial services and taxation.  In all the current uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the negotiations, there is one thing of which we can be sure - Brexit will result in change.  Of course, it will result in change in our relationship with our closest neighbour, but it will also result in change in the balance of relationships with the rest of our European colleagues and the global community.</p><p>The drivers of Brexit may seem nebulous and obscure, such as a sense of exceptionalism that finds a voice in patriotic bluster and a feeling of dissatisfaction with the <i>status quo</i>.  The social reasons for Brexit may be various, but there is a definite and identifiable underbelly to it which is about deregulation of the provision of goods and services, a loosening of constraints in the financial services sector and, possibly, a repudiation of the global move towards data protection.</p><p>In the context of taxation, I suspect Ireland will soon have to choose whose side we are on.  Do we align ourselves with our partners in the project of a Single Market and a shared vision of Europe or do we continue down our current path as a place of accommodating tax measures for the largest global companies and their profits?  In October, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child announced that it was going to examine Ireland's tax policies to see whether they are negatively damaging the rights of children around the globe and particularly in developing countries.  The argument of the committee is that the law in Ireland is enabling profits to be shifted from countries in the developing world and devastating those countries' ability to raise revenue, fund essential public services and fulfil their human rights obligations.  A recent working paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research identified Ireland as the number one profit-shifting destination, accounting for more than $100 billion.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges Ireland to avoid policies at home and abroad that undermine the human rights of children.  This will be the first time the UN has examined the external impact on children of a country's tax policy.  The fact that it is starting with Ireland is testament to how we are already being viewed internationally.</p> <p>Is this how we want to be seen in a post-Brexit world, with a large and increasingly deregulated financial market at our shoulder, as a tax haven and a facilitator of tax injustice that damages children and communities in the most vulnerable places in the world?</p> <p> I am aware of the argument that Ireland is engaging with ongoing reforms at the OECD and through the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, framework.  Ireland has engaged with BEPS and, crucially, it has opted out of the key provision, Action 12 of the multilateral instruments, which would have put an end to one of the most commonly used avoidance practices by US multinationals in Ireland.  If we truly want to reach out to our European neighbours and align ourselves with them and the global community, we could engage in this process in a more genuine manner.  Due to Brexit, we must amend our taxation law in significant ways, as this Bill demonstrates.  Now is the time.  Ireland must align taxable profits more closely with economic activity and prevent multinationals from exploiting our laws to reduce their tax bills.  As outlined by a number of NGOs in Ireland, it is obvious that without a fair and functioning taxation system the efforts of other countries to deliver adequate housing, healthcare and education and to tackle poverty, child poverty and inequality are badly undermined by Ireland.</p> <p> We must act as responsible members of the international community and ensure that our tax policies do not negatively affect the realisation of children's rights around the globe.  With our nearest neighbour about to embark on a unique path towards economic isolation, I urge the Government to move decisively towards international solidarity with Europe and developing nations, solidarity on taxation and tax justice and to reform our current laws to reflect that.</p></speech>

At the time, it was seen as a challenge that was potentially devastating for a number of sectors of the economy if an agreement was not reached.  The withdrawal agreement was achieved, but with the current British Government it appears to be more of an opt-in and opt-out statement.  Boris Johnson's Government freely admitted that it intended to break international law through the UK Internal Market Bill, which flies in the face of the withdrawal agreement.  Our farmers, who were already concerned about their ability to export, have seen their concerns grow as a result of Mr. Johnson's approach.  The same is the case with our hauliers, who have already been greatly impacted by Covid-19.  Trade talks, which had been underpinned by the understanding contained in the withdrawal agreement and its protocol on Ireland, have been made even more difficult due to this fast and loose attitude.  If Boris Johnson's Government continues to take an unreliable stance in these negotiations, the likelihood of a free trade agreement being reached is made more difficult.</p>  <p>  There must be good faith on all sides, but we do not appear to be getting it.  Mr. Johnson appears to take no notice of the preparations that are contained in the Bill us, such as the provision of healthcare regulations, employment regulations, education supports and so forth, but we do.  I welcome the continued inclusion of provisions that have been made for citizens in the North and the UK to be able to access education supports.  I also welcome how access to employment is included in the Bill.  However, perhaps the Minister would speak on what happens if a situation arises in which these provisions are not reciprocated.  We have seen the reckless attitude the British Government has adopted under Boris Johnson's leadership and how willing it is to go back on its word.  Before any trade agreement is reached, I ask the Minister to assure us that all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are honoured.  While we commit ourselves to this, let us not forget what the ultimate achievement will be and what would have made the Brexit mess less of a trauma from the start, that is, constitutional change that leads to a united Ireland.</p>  <p>  I wish to address another issue related to the economic landscape that this Bill seeks to protect, that is, the prosperity of our country and the need for a balanced system of regional investment and development.  For too long the focus has been on the capital, to the cost of all other regions.  For example, the N24 connects Waterford with the west of the country.  In recent years money has been spent on the stretch of the N24 that goes through Tipperary town, a notorious bottleneck.  Amazingly, however, not a penny was spent on taking traffic out of the town or facilitating traffic on its way either east or west.  What is required along the N24 route is a programme of removing traffic congestion from towns, not patching up bottlenecks.  This would make the route of the N24 fit for purpose as a link between east and west and between airports and ports.  It would make towns along the route, such as Tipperary town, proper hubs for business and industry.</p>  <p>  The same unbalanced attitude to regional development has affected Shannon Airport, which is no longer afforded the regional importance it deserves.  Brexit should be seen as an opportunity to give Shannon Airport the status of an Atlantic hub that is uniquely positioned to connect the EU and the US in a way that continental airports cannot.  Our rail services must be properly organised to link with ports connected to the EU and airports connected to the US.  Rural transport desperately needs to be upgraded to facilitate trade and commerce across rural Ireland.  The same is the case with the post offices, which must be embraced and nurtured.  If we fail to invest in our own and adopt a proper roadmap to success, what is the point of a Bill such as that before us?  While the measures included in the Bill are of major importance, they must be matched by the development of a country that facilitates progress no matter where one goes.</p></speech>

Ireland has a good friend in that man.</p>  <p>  My understanding of this Bill is that the purpose of Part 11 on customs is to accommodate the anticipated substantial increase in customs controls required at ports and trade premises arising from the end of the transition period.  I spoke about Rosslare Europort and the preparations at the port in my last contribution on Brexit, and I wish to raise it again today.  It is of vital importance to Rosslare village, Kilrane and their hinterlands.  The increase in customs control, for example, the 30 new customs staff in place at the port, will surely increase cargo waiting times and queues.  I ask the Government to prepare a traffic impact management plan for Rosslare Europort, as it did for Dublin Port.</p>  <p>  The other important issues are agrifood, the fishing industry and our SMEs.  The talk of the British claiming territorial waters will have a devastating and annihilating result for fishing communities throughout Ireland and in my county of Wexford.  This must be objected to in the strongest manner and approached in a principle of partnership with a level playing field.  The introduction by the Tory Party of the UK Internal Market Bill is an affront to the Irish protocol and a blatant disregard of the Good Friday Agreement.  I thank the Government and the EU negotiators for their strong, coherent and robust stance in protecting what is a fully endorsed international agreement.  I hope an agreement can be reached even at this eleventh hour, and that it will be beneficial for a prosperous and united people on our small beautiful island.</p></speech>

We can all learn.  What is of importance is not how long or short our contribution is.  However, we must recognise one point.  We are coming to the final stages of the Brexit issue.  Nigel Farage launched the campaign a long time ago.  He spent 20 years of his life in the European Parliament, taking a salary from it, while undermining the concepts of European co-operation and the EU.  He did so very successfully.  Not only did he do that, but he also managed to convince the people of the UK that this was the way to go.  He misled the people of the UK.  His propaganda was very potent, available, forceful and attractive to people who had a doubt.</p>  <p>  The EU is not always perfect.  We have had reason to show concern on numerous occasions, but we have also had many examples that prove the success of the Union, in particular from this country's point of view.  Many situations have arisen whereby membership of the Union meant we were in a position of solidarity, among equals, capable of participating in the debate, as opposed to waiting until the debate was over and attempting to influence it afterwards.  The European Community has been very effective in terms of providing peace in Europe and alleviating starvation.  Let us not forget that the original idea was to prevent starvation in the aftermath of the Second World War.  It did so very successfully.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to operate in a very meaningful way, but most of all in recent times when the Union was under threat.  I always made the comparison with the United States.  When the UK wanted to go off in its own direction and make Britain great again, it was reminiscent of other struggles we have heard of along the same lines.  I was worried about it at the time, as was everybody else in this House.  The fact of the matter is this: there is more to be gained from strength and solidarity than there is from the kind of dissent Europe suffered from in the past.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a very interesting speech that was subsequently criticised.  The sad part is that we do not have longer to debate subjects of this nature at greater depth and length.  Suffice it to say, he made comparisons with the renationalisation, the polarisation of thinking across Europe, in the UK and in some other European countries.  I had occasion to meet a delegation from another European country in the past year when its opposition to immigration and asylum seekers was voiced.  I reminded them of a time when they themselves were asylum seekers and were in need of help, which they got in this country.  Even though we did not have much to give, we shared it.  It is interesting that after so many years of recent freedom, some people decided to assert themselves and to reject all others who are in the position they were in.  That is a dangerous route to go, hence the polarisation to which the Deputy referred.</p>  <p>  He also referred to the US as being in a dangerous situation.  He is absolutely right, because the polarisation of opinion there has been ongoing for some years.  There was a number of explosions and attacks on people, including racist attacks, but nothing was done about it.  These things cannot go on for ever, but they are not good.  Somebody, sometime, somewhere will pay a price.  Like others said, the recent electoral developments in the US are to be welcomed by democrats everywhere and all freedom seeking people.  Whether they can deliver or not remains to be seen.  Recent US Administrations have been hampered by a lack of a majority in either House.  Nothing happens in such a situation, hence the need for reform of the system there.</p>  <p>  To return to the subject matter of this debate, we have been well-served by the Minister and his colleagues in this Government and the previous Government.  We have held the line very well.  The merit in that has been shown by the degree to which our colleagues in the EU have backed us up.  They have delivered.  They have stood up for us, which is the litmus test, and they will continue to do so, because it is in the interests of all of us remaining member states of the European Union.  We have to cease looking at ourselves as being outside the European Union.  We are part of the European Union and we must accept that.</p>  <p>  I am one of the first people in this country to suggest that our response to Brexit, over which we have no control, was that the island of Ireland should be treated as part of the Single Market and the customs union.  I thought it was a good idea at the time, and it is still a good idea and I hope it will prevail.</p> <p>Ironically, another speaker mentioned that we can benefit from the situation now developing.  Two things can happen.  We will need to depend on our colleagues in Northern Ireland and they on us to a greater extent than we think possible at this stage.  Inevitably, we will be interdependent with another state that we have not been interdependent with before.  That situation will be good for relations on this island, good for putting the past behind us and good for the development of good relations in the future.  It is an equally good development for economic recovery and advancement, and strength arising therefrom.<br/><br/>We need to bear something else in mind in the last critical days of the negotiations that are taking place.  Our friends in the UK are famous for their last-minute submissions and we need to be watchful for the door being slammed at a particular stage when it is more advantageous to them than it is to us in this country or in the rest of the European Union.  We need to be careful not to be phased by an ultimatum presented at the end.  We need to live on the island of Ireland thereafter along with our Northern colleagues.  It is up to us to do the best we can in the circumstances opening up to us.<br/><br/>Irrespective of what happens, we need to continue to be robustly involved in the European Union.  I am not as convinced as others are regarding the need to have a relationship with the UK.  Yes, we do, and it is up to the UK to continue that relationship.  We did not force anybody out of the European Union, nor should or would we and nor are we likely to in the future.  It remains a matter for our colleagues across the water to come to the conclusion that it is in the interests of Ireland, the UK and the European Union to reach an amicable arrangement that does not undermine one or the other.<br/><br/>We did not create the situation before us now.  It was a <i>fait accompli</i>from the time the UK voted.  Incidentally,  the moral lesson from all that is this.  If people do not respond to whatever is laid out before them, no matter how unrealistic it may be or how unattainable it may appear at the time, a result ensues, and that result might not always be what we want.  The referendum in the UK went the way it did because nobody else objected to any great extent and it happened.  I hope we will reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200032#FF00200"><p>Even though he is not here, I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his work on this issue so far.  I saw it from a Brussels perspective as a Member of the European Parliament.  I saw how sure-footed he was in his work and his negotiations.  That was a great comfort and my colleagues in the European Parliament recognised that was happening.  I also thank him for his assurances that he would fully co-operate with Members of the Opposition if they wish to propose relevant and well-founded amendments.  That is really important because there needs to be a sense that this is a Bill that represents the interests of everybody in the entire country.</p><p>The Bill is extremely complex because it straddles so many ministerial responsibilities and deals with so much different legislation, including certain EU directives, regulations and, of course, Irish legislation.  However, its coherence comes from the fact that the legislation sets out to protect citizens insofar as it can, and to adhere to the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol.  Hopefully, it also seeks to minimise the bureaucracy and red tape that Brexit will entail.  I say &quot;hopefully&quot; because at this stage it is very difficult to assess how the Bill will contribute to minimising red tape and bureaucracy while at the same time protecting the interests of citizens and different sectors.  I know the Government also wants to be ready to deal with emerging or unexpected issues that will require a legislative response, which is what makes this legislation so crucial.</p><p>I have watched the entire debate and virtually all speakers have emphasised that they hope this omnibus Bill - or most of it - will never see the light of day and I concur with those sentiments.  I also fully recognise that if we do not put a safety net in place and do not co-ordinate systems between the Republic and Northern Ireland and the Republic and the UK to the maximum allowable degree, and if we do not deal with the necessary details and difficult circumstances that may arise, we are storing up a tsunami of complex situations and interactions.  People will be tearing their hair out, especially those who live and work in Border regions and those who trade across the Border, unless we have the safeguards, the safety nets and the co-ordination systems in place.  Even then it will be difficult.</p><p>This is not our first run at this.  I was not a Member of the D&aacute;il when the previous Bill was introduced, but there seemed to be good co-operation between the parties in the D&aacute;il.  As I said, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised that this would continue with this Bill.  We will get down to the finer details on Committee Stage when I hope we do not encounter too many unexpected minefields.  However, if there are any, Committee Stage is the time to deal with potential difficulties as carefully and as expertly as we can.</p><p>I will return to some specific issues and questions before I finish.  Where do we stand now with the Northern Ireland protocol?  Is the UK Government seriously working on addressing its concerns on the protocol, which are real?  Is it making any serious attempt to formulate ways to set up arbitration, conciliation and dispute resolution mechanisms?  These procedures are all contained in the protocol.  Has the UK demonstrated flexibility in this area?  Has the EU reciprocated by, for example, actively working to streamline and simplify exit summary declarations for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain?  Has the EU shown sufficient flexibility on the application of state aid rules so that certain supports can be provided to Northern Ireland without distorting the market?  From the point of view of North-South interactions in particular, that is a very fine line.  We want to see movement and flexibility on both sides.  One of the issues this will throw up is whether we can ensure a level playing field when it comes to companies from Northern Ireland tendering for projects in the Republic and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>My final question on this section relates to the joint committee to be set up to adjudicate on disputes under four different strands.  I will not go through them but this joint committee is the most crucial piece of architecture that we need to put in place.</p> <p>I would like to know where we are in respect of setting up that committee.</p> <p> I have a few questions on the specifics of the Bill.  I see that it proposes the reimbursement of medical expenses for Northern Ireland residents, for unplanned care if they are actually in the EU.  However, in regard to the current cross-border health directive, which I was actively involved in when I was a Member of the European Parliament, I am wondering what exactly we are putting in place for patients from the Republic to go to Northern Ireland or the UK to access necessary treatments, where the waiting times are too long, and where the cost will be reimbursed by the HSE.  Through the memorandum of understanding, are we putting in place the same, or a similar type scheme?  I have heard people say that patients can go to other EU countries.  Yes, they can, but for virtually all of them, it is impossible, with the language barrier, the issue around prescriptions etc.  Very few people do that.  Therefore, I am asking what we are doing in that sphere.</p> <p> Also, what arrangements are there in place, or does the Minister of State hope to put in place, to deal with issues like rare diseases, where for many Irish people, the UK health system has been a lifeline?  Also, will the all-Island approach that we have in place, for example, in the area of paediatric cardiology services, continue?  Will cross-border initiatives, such as the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, initiative, which is part-financed by the EU Regional Development Fund, continue?  Will there continue to be the recognition of professional qualifications between Ireland, the UK and Northern Ireland, in all of the various different circumstances?</p> <p> Various colleagues have raised the issue of information flow between ourselves and the UK.  How will social security co-ordination be impacted by GDPR?  As we know, many Irish people have returned from the UK, either to work here or to retire here.  What, if any, implications will it have for the information flow between the two countries?</p> <p> I also want to ask the Minister of State a really important question.  What plans, if any, are in place to alleviate the passing of costs of consumer checks and operations from businesses to consumers?  Just under half of our total food imports, which amounted to about &euro;7.8 billion in 2018, came from the UK, with exports of foods and beverages from Ireland being valued at around &euro;4.2 billion.  To break it down very simply, it is also estimated that the extra cost per kilo on a carcass of beef will be approximately 11 cents and that is with a basic trade deal.  Significant work needs to be done and significant supports need to be put in place in order to prevent significant increases in the cost of many items, but particularly in the area of food.</p> <p> From the perspective of balanced regional development, the Minister of State is aware that all regions and sectors will be impacted, some of them severely, but there is no doubt that Border regions will experience severe dislocation.  People cross the Border every day to work and their entire lives are lived on a cross-border basis.  Also, there are certain sectors, such as the dairy sector, which are inextricably linked across the Border.  I mentioned the cross-border CAWT initiative, but there are many other cross-border initiatives, encompassing everything from health to rural and local transport.  These initiatives are a support system for communities and Border regions and citizens will be hardest hit, both financially and socially.  This Government has committed to delivering balanced regional development and the Border regions cannot be a casualty of Brexit.  They must receive the support and resources necessary to remain economically viable and for their social fabric not to be unravelled.</p> <p> I was listening to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and another Member commented on his speech, perhaps it was Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, where he talked about the "Sean-bhean bhocht".  He said that in the white heat of negotiations our interests might not be fully protected.  What I say to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is this: if we were at that table, the Belgians would have to be there; their losses from Brexit will be very significant, and the French would also want to the there.  Therefore, it is much better that we negotiate as a Union, because that is what gives us strength and that is what makes the EU what it is.  Whether it is negotiating a trade deal, data protection or leads on climate change, it is the fact that we work together that gives us strength.  Individual nations on their own cannot have the same influence.  Also, we could not have been luckier in getting Michel Barnier as negotiator, who was a commissioner for regional development and helped set up the peace funds in Ireland and who knows Ireland and therefore has context.  We could not have been luckier with the negotiator that was appointed.  However, I do not view the EU through rose-tinted glasses.  I spent 15 years there and I see the reality of how things work.  The reason that I hope our interests will be protected, namely, the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, is that all institutions of the EU have said that they will be protected.  At the end of the day, our interests dovetail with those of the EU, because it cannot be seen that leaving the EU will confer a benefit on member states and those who remain will suffer.  Our interests will, therefore, be protected because they are the same as those of the EU.</p></speech>

However, regardless of what happens, I certainly hope that there will be a deal which is in the interests of all of our people on these islands and indeed those in the wider EU.  Although I fundamentally disagree with the Vote Leave side, I agree with the right to campaign to leave the EU, as I agree with the right of people in Ireland to campaign to leave the EU, although I will be campaigning on the other side when that happens.  We are very keen to say that just because we are leaving the EU does not mean that we are leaving Europe, and we cannot return to any glorious period in the past, whether it is Ireland or the UK, and hope that the world has not moved on, because it has.  Our trade links are essential to protect, certainly as much, if not more so, in agriculture than any other sector.  I represent a farming constituency and I am also a farmer.  I expect that there will be a precipitous drop in the prices of cattle and milk in a few weeks' time if a trade deal is not done.  I am sure the Minister of State will have his own backbenchers calling on the Government for compensation, but nothing can compensate for being able to trade.</p> <p>The same is true with regard to Covid, but that is another issue.</p> <p> Many people say that Brexit has been a failure of British politics and perhaps it has been.  However, it also marks a profound failure on the part of the European Union itself insofar as people feel marginalised from its decision-making process and that the decisions made do not represent their interests.  That strand of disaffection is evident in every country in the Union, including our own, and it is very important that we address it.  There is a certain smugness that can set in during any debate, whether it is the ongoing debate on Covid-19, debate on the successes and failures of the EU, or anything else.  There is an elite in every country in the EU whose members have benefited significantly from Union membership.  I must be honest and say that I have benefited enormously from living in a country that is part of the EU.  Having an EU passport is of much more value than having an Irish passport because EU membership makes it more than an Irish passport.  EU citizenship does not replace national citizenship but sits on top of it.  It is an add-on but one that is sometimes neglected.</p> <p> I was not a Member of the last D&aacute;il but debate therein was apparently dominated by the issue of Brexit, how important membership of the EU is and how important our trade relationship is with, and as part of, the Union, as well as with Britain.  However, since the formation of this D&aacute;il, I have heard almost nothing about any of that.  I appreciate that the Minister of State came back from the European Council meeting and addressed us on it, for which I am thankful.  In the general political discourse in Ireland, however, I have heard very little about the EU and the four freedoms that are fundamental to it.  Other countries have dealt with the undoubted risks and dangers that arise out of the Covid crisis and it is for each member state to protect its population and safeguard public health.  Equally, however, it is for each member state to do so in a way that protects the four freedoms.  I have not seen that issue feature in the discourse.</p> <p> The traffic light system has been introduced, very late in the day, but there was no discussion of the fundamental freedoms when travel was, in effect, banned during some of the Covid period.  There is a debate among experts as to the extent to which there is a risk from travel.  If one goes to another country and behaves irresponsibly, there obviously is a risk one will get Covid-19, but there is the same risk if one behaves irresponsibly in Ireland.  The act of travel, in and of itself, may not be the risk.  There was no effort made at all to protect that fundamental freedom.  There is no acknowledgement in the debate we are having now that there are thousands of families living in Dublin and throughout Ireland who are not originally from this country and do not have an Irish passport but who are availing of free movement.  That needs to come more to the fore in our discussions.  We can talk about issues in the abstract but there are concrete realities we must address and the most concrete is the fact that the four freedoms need to be protected.  I urge the Government to address that issue when we move beyond this phase, whether or not a trade deal between the EU and the UK is successfully negotiated.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in that regard and I hope it will be the former.</p></speech>

Is c&aacute;ip&eacute;is thar a bheith suimi&uacute;il &iacute;, ag cur s&iacute;os ar an tionchar uaf&aacute;sach a bheidh ag an mBreatimeacht ar chomhlachta&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht, go h&aacute;irithe na comhlachta&iacute; beaga at&aacute; ag brath go huile agus go hioml&aacute;n ar a gcuid t&aacute;irg&iacute; ag dul trasna na farraige go Sasana agus ar na hamh&aacute;bhair ag teacht isteach.  Beidh siad buailte go dona agus beidh siad th&iacute;os.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it &eacute; sin.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, set out very clearly what is involved in this comprehensive Bill.  It refers to no fewer than 41 Acts, which will give people watching the debate some idea of its scope.  It has 21 Parts and 121 sections.  One of the areas it addresses is family law, an issue in which, in a different life, I had a particular interest.  The Bill seeks to continue the recognition, on a habitual basis, of certain divorces, judicial separations and annulments.  It also seeks to preserve the <i>status quo</i>in respect of certain arrangements to do with healthcare provision, social protection, students and the common travel area.  I welcome all of that.  I also want to acknowledge, on the record of the House, the amount of work that has gone into this Bill and the previous omnibus Bill, which, by and large, remained on the shelf and for which the Minister said he was grateful.  Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tuilte ag an Rialtas agus ag na daoine at&aacute; ag obair air seo nach bhfuil le feice&aacute;il anseo sa D&aacute;il.</p><p>Significantly, it is 100 years since the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was passed, copper-fastening partition, home rule and the division of Ireland, all of which have led to the situation we are in today, when that division persists.  If anything comes out of Brexit, I hope it will be a reunited Ireland by peaceful means.  Brexit means that part of our body has been cut off.  I visited there last year on my way to &oacute;c&aacute;id ag Conradh na Gaeilge.  Ceapaim go raibh an tAire St&aacute;it &eacute; f&eacute;in ann freisin ach n&iacute;l m&eacute; cinnte.  Ar mo bhealach suas, chuaigh m&eacute; trasna na teorann tr&iacute; n&oacute; ceithre huaire.  Chuaigh m&eacute; ar strae uair amh&aacute;in.  Chuir s&eacute; sin in i&uacute;l dom go soil&eacute;ir an easpa teorann agus chomh t&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; s&eacute; nach rachaimid ar ais ar&iacute;s maidir leis an teorainn.  When I travelled to Monaghan and crossed the Border a number of times, it brought home to me the importance of never going back to a hard border and the importance of reuniting that body with our body in a peaceful way.  We will be a much better country for it and I hope that is what comes out of all of this.</p><p>Several speakers referred to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's contribution.  I listened carefully to his speech and went along with some of what he said.  He started an analysis but he did not finish it.  I hope some of the points he made will be the start of a debate.  I certainly do not like polarised politics in any way but the question we really need to ask is how polarisation comes about.  Taking that question on a practical level within the D&aacute;il context, before moving on to a more general consideration, we have a Business Committee that is not quite functioning.  &quot;Tyranny&quot; is a bit too strong a word to use, but it is true to say that the majority has power now and is not as interested any more in hearing the voices of the Opposition in a respectful way.  Now that the three parties in government have their majority - I will call them the three sisters, like the three rivers in the south east, as we learned about them in school - they might exercise magnanimity and recognise the onus that is on them to behave in a different way.  They should heed the message of the last election and the one before it that people want a different type of politics and a variety of voices in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>We all represent our different constituencies as best we can.  I have the greatest of respect for all Deputies and the amount of work they do but the polarisation to which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred does not come about by accident.  It comes about because people feel disconnected from the political system.  When large amounts of public money are put into employing spin doctors to run politics and for the very purpose of spinning, then we are in serious trouble.  That is what causes a disconnect with ordinary people and encourages polarisation.  I would like a debate on this issue and more contributions from Deputies, including Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, but we might use a mirror to reflect our role in the polarisation that exists.  Using it to say that Fianna F&aacute;il takes the middle ground and does not want polarisation will put a kind of a stopgap on any analysis.  It is like starting to open the door but then shutting it tight again and it does not take us any further in examining why polarisation is happening.</p><p>The referendum on Brexit took place on 23 June 2016.  It is easy to forget the date and that it is more than four years since the vote.  I do not agree with the commentary of the vast majority of people in the Conservative Party or that of Nigel Farage.</p> <p>I was concerned then, and have been concerned since, at the failure to analyse why ordinary people on the ground voted in the way they did.  We must remember our intimate connection with England.  It took our people when we did not look after them.  It took people from mother and baby homes and from the industrial schools, including members of my own family.  These were people who had ended up on the streets because this country utterly failed to look after them.  We exported them.  They did the best they could and they did us proud but we let them go.  They left the industrial schools, of which there were two in Galway, one for women and one for men, at 16 years of age with the clothes on their backs and nothing else.  I sometimes hear younger people talking.  I do not like the divide between younger and older people because that is also bad.</p> <p> Ireland was, to a great extent, made by those people.  The remittances they sent back enabled us to go to school, to buy clothes, to go to college and so on.  The economy about which we rave was not built on the back of IT alone, but on the backs of those who went abroad, who did not forget where they came from and who looked after their families left behind.  All of that has been valued in monetary terms.  At one stage, the number of Irish-born people living in England was 1 million.  The latest figure my office could get showed there were 430,000 Irish-born people in the UK.  I thank my staff for all their work.  Perhaps the Minister of State may have a figure for the number of people who have parents or grandparents who were Irish.  There is an integral connection between us and England.  When we demonise a people, we do so at our peril.  They made a democratic decision.  Our efforts should have gone into dealing with that decision in the most positive way possible rather than demonising those people.</p> <p> With regard to America, I do not agree with some of the comments that have been made.  I congratulate Joe Biden.  It is great that Trump will eventually go, although he has not gone yet.  The question must again be asked how millions and millions of people lost faith in the Democratic Party.  That is a serious question.  The analysis of, and response to, that question will not come from demonising these people or from saying that those in the middle states of America are ignorant and illiterate and do not know anything.  It is frightening for me.  I know the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach and I do not always agree on things, but we certainly agree on the importance of facts and debate.  When I speak here, I often cite the fact that I spent an hour or two listening to Science Foundation Ireland lecturing us on the importance of evidence in forming our opinions.  We need to look at the evidence in America to understand why significant millions decided that the better option was Trump rather than Clinton in 2016 or rather than Biden on this occasion.  Therein lies the question for us.  They did not trust the political system, as some here do not.  It was not the case that they thought Trump was better but that they thought he was more in your face and that the other side was not telling the truth.</p> <p> If there is any lesson in this for us, it is that we must stop spinning.  We must stop paying advisers.  Ministers must stand up, say what they believe in and tell us about the very hard work their Departments are doing, which they stand over.  If they later believe it was wrong, they should come back to the House and say so.  We all make mistakes.  The Government should get rid of the advisers and the spin.  That is my advice in this regard. </p> <p> I will mention one last thing before moving on to the Bill.  I really look forward to the day on which we go through an omnibus Bill on the eradication of poverty with a pen, as I have done in respect of the Brexit Bills.  The eradication of poverty is firstly the right thing to do, but our economy will also thrive if poverty is eradicated.  Can the Minister of State imagine if the same effort that has gone into Brexit had gone into that or into eradicating the housing crisis, which is absolutely consequent on failed market policies?  I have no doubt but that those who led the Brexit debate are neoliberals who have absolutely no interest in equality.  When I speak about people being disengaged, I am speaking about ordinary people on the ground who no longer believe those in power.  Therein lies the danger.</p> <p> The spending review to which I referred is particularly worrying.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to have a look at it.  I have praised its authors, Rebecca Ryder and Sharon Barry, because it is important to do so.  The spending review is subtitled "An assessment of the impact of Brexit and Covid-19 on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its client companies".  It is absolutely startling.  It states that "Gaeltacht companies are significantly more exposed to a disorderly Brexit than the Irish economy in general, due to their reliance on the UK as both an export market and a source of raw materials".  The Brexit planning, into which the Government had put its efforts and which was welcome, was displaced by Covid.  One can understand that but the spending review is now saying that it is too late for any more preparation and that it is time to deal with the consequences of Brexit and, post Brexit, to help companies, and smaller ones in particular.</p> <p> Some 85% of Gaeltacht companies have fewer than ten employees.  Another figure that jumps out is that 82% have not availed of any Brexit supports.  I will not use all my time to read out figures but this review is crystal clear, written in plain English and easy for someone who is not good with figures to understand.  It highlights that Brexit will affect some people and some areas disproportionately.  The Gaeltacht is one of the areas at&aacute; th&iacute;os.  T&aacute; s&iacute; buailte go dona &oacute; thaobh an Bhreatimeachta.</p> <p> The review mentions the efforts of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which happened to be before the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community yesterday.  It has done Trojan work, obair na gcapall, agus t&aacute; ionaid Gteic curtha chun cinn aige.  It has found locations for Gteic and so on.  This spending review says that "The lack of broadband and digital infrastructure in Gaeltacht regions is a major barrier to innovation and competitiveness".  Market diversification is absolutely essential and these companies need help with that.  The review also says that, although I may be paraphrasing it incorrectly, the Government has offered a lot of assistance through different packages, but the take-up has been dismally low.  What is now needed is flexibility to refocus those packages.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta could work to repurpose some of the unexpended funds under the Brexit loans scheme, for example, for enhanced bespoke supports.  That is what is needed here.  We must target and look at bespoke solutions for the Gaeltacht.</p> <p> I will go back to the Irish language to conclude.  Mar is eol don Aire St&aacute;it - n&iacute;l aon gh&aacute; le le&aacute;cht uaimse toisc go nglacaim go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it ar an eolas faoi sin - go bhfuil an Ghaeilge thar a bheith goilli&uacute;nach.

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil beirt ar a laghad sa Seomra.  T&aacute; P&aacute;irt&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in ag obair &oacute;n mbaile ag clo&iacute; leis na rialacha a bhaineann leis an ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im sl&aacute;inte.  It is nice to see the Sinn F&eacute;in Party all working from home and I welcome their commitment to the level 5 restrictions, including in D&aacute;il business.  I thank Members, and I include Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies in this, for their many good contributions on this Bill.  There is unity and common purpose demonstrated by all parties in dealing with Brexit and that has been a major asset in co-ordinating the national response.</p>  <p>  The debate has raised a wide range of issues and while I will attempt to deal with as many as I can, many will be more fully dealt with by the relevant line Ministers on Committee Stage.  I understand that we will have Committee Stage as a committee of the whole House.  Each relevant Minister will, at that point, deal with the section or sections pertaining to his or her Department in much more detail than a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs or the Minister for Foreign Affairs can deal with.  In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I have been engaging extensively with citizens and businesses on Brexit readiness.  It is essential that we drive home the need to prepare for the end of the transition period for the many businesses that are not yet ready.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputies Berry and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, we would love for this transition to go on forever but that is not possible.  Britain made the decision not to proceed with an extension so, unfortunately, that ship has already sailed.  There are no options and the European Union, including Ireland, have no choice.  The transition period is coming to an end on 31 December and it is time everybody got ready for that.  There is no second go at this.</p>  <p>  I warn people that there are many uncertainties around Brexit.  Things will happen in the new year that we may not have expected.  Some will possibly be serious and some will be not so serious.  However, there are a number of certainties.  There will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  Included in that and the common travel area arrangements is the freedom to move goods North and South.  The common travel area arrangements allow people to live, work and vote anywhere on the island of Ireland or the island of Britain.  Let there be no doubt about those two points.  It is also certain that major changes are afoot on the trade goods between the islands of Britain and Ireland.  These will not be impacted by whatever happens in the trade deal.  There will be customs and checks.  Britain is leaving the Single Market and the customs union.  That is happening regardless of what happens with an agreement on tariffs or whatever agreement we can have on fish.  That point needs to be repeated time and again.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a central element of our efforts to prepare for the changes that are coming in less than 50 days.  It has been a huge national effort which everybody has got behind.  Some speakers, including my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, doubted our negotiators but I agree with Deputy Harkin's view on that issue.  Any time I have met Michel Barnier or listened to him speak, publicly or privately, the interests of Ireland have always been top of his list.  That is true regardless of whether he is speaking to us, speaking in public or updating all the ministers at the General Affairs Council.  Ministers in other countries tend to ask the Minister and me what is happening on Brexit because we are seen as a lead country that is affected by it.  As I said, the protocol we have for the island of Ireland has nothing to do with what is happening now.</p>  <p>  The United Kingdom Internal Market Bill has rightly been mentioned.  The Government took a strong line on it and I will not give a detailed commentary on the Bill.  The European Parliament has said it will not ratify any trade agreement while that Bill is there and we have adopted a similar position.</p>  <p>  The cross-border treatment directive was raised by a number of Deputies.  The first point to make is that, unfortunately, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.  While we are protecting a number of cross-border healthcare measures, such as providing equivalence for the European health insurance card and the treatment abroad scheme, the cross-border treatment directive is in a different category from those schemes.  The Department of Health is working on this issue but the directive's operation after 1 January 2021 will, as a matter of first principles, cease because the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union.  Its continuance is subject to much greater difficulties than the other measures that are legislated for in the Bill.  We will not be able to do anything about many aspects of the fall-out of Brexit.  The Department of Health is working on that issue but it is proving difficult and people will have to get ready for that.</p>  <p>  A number of genuine issues were raised about transport by, among others, Deputies Verona Murphy and Howlin and my colleague, Deputy O'Connor.  The issue with direct routes is that over the last year or so, as Deputies in maritime constituencies will know, many additional direct services to the United Kingdom have been introduced.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for trade promotion, Deputy Troy, informed me that more direct routes to the Continent will come on stream in the weeks ahead to allow the UK land bridge to be bypassed.  Traders need to contact their shipping companies and ask whether, by January, the companies will be able to get their goods to the Continent in time.  If there are options now, they should consider switching to them now as a trial.  The Irish Maritime Development Office published a report last week, which indicated we have sufficient capacity.  The Government hears what Deputies are saying on this issue and we are committed to working with Deputies, traders, hauliers and ferry companies to ensure no issues arise.  Members raised the issue of applying a public service obligation, PSO, which is a reasonable point to make.  However, the counter argument is that a PSO would be a disincentive for companies that have already put on extra services without the benefit of PSO money.</p>  <p>  Having listened to everybody, including Deputies from all sides of the House, the best assessment the Government has is that there seems to be sufficient capacity on existing direct services to accommodate any displaced land bridge traffic without State intervention.  The Government is keeping this matter under review and we ask everybody to keep engaging and sending in any information they have.  The Minister for Transport will be in the House on Committee Stage and I am sure this matter can be raised with him at that time.</p>  <p>  We need to align capacity with demand.  We will control what we can control, which is the reason we will keep engaging on this issue.  We cannot control what happens in Britain, including whether there are traffic jams in Kent or Holyhead.  These are difficulties.  The matter is being kept under review.  I appreciate that Deputies feel strongly about this.  Feeding in information and making strong points on the issue is part of the national effort.  Having spoken to the Taoiseach on this a number of times, I know he is taking a direct interest in this as well.  We have to be ready.</p>  <p>  Deputies have also raised the impact of a disorderly end to the transition period for the agri-food and fisheries sectors.  That goes without saying.  The Government has been supporting our agri-food sector in diversifying but there is still a significant level of exposure to the UK market as we all know, particularly in dairy and beef.  The issue of fisheries is also outstanding in the negotiations.  If no agreement can be reached on preferential EU access to the UK market, our agri-food trade could be significantly impacted by tariffs.  I assure the House that the Government will stand shoulder to shoulder with the sector.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the EU and the Government together funded the &euro;100 million beef exceptional aid measure to help with the losses incurred as a result of Brexit-related market volatility.  This is one example of what can be done.  I thank the officials in the Department, led by Mr. Gardner, and officials in all the Departments who are working on this legislation.  We are working closely with the European Commission on the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve, which was agreed by the leaders, as Deputies mentioned.  I thank the Taoiseach for his leadership on this issue and note our work with the Belgian Government on this particular fund.</p> <p>This targets the sectors and member states most disproportionately affected by Brexit.  In our ongoing talks with the European Commission, we called on it to ensure that the fund is rapidly activated, because it will be no good to us in two years' time, predictable and flexible to meet the various needs which might arise.  I understand that the Commission is going to come up with a proposal, and there was a question on this aspect, in the next few weeks.  I am confident, however, that the work we are doing at European level will be successful in achieving as much as possible from that fund and in ensuring that it is as flexible and as quick as it can be.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was in touch with me yesterday, and Deputies Howlin, Calleary, Nash and Carey raised the issue of the VAT retail export scheme.  It is fair to say that Ministers have considered that fair points have been raised.  There is a difficulty here.  There were good reasons for what is contained in the legislation, but the Minister for Finance is now considering the matter carefully in light of the various comments made by the Deputies and the genuine points they have raised.  It is, again, just one of these issues that has hit us as a result of Brexit.  That is a fact, and I think that everybody wants to do the best possible job on this aspect.  In that context, I repeat what my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said yesterday.  Deputies who have amendments which they think will improve this Bill should bring them forward and the Government will have an open approach to them.  All Ministers are on board with that approach.  Indeed, during consideration of the last legislation of this type I put forward an amendment and it was accepted.  It was one of the few Opposition amendments accepted by the last Government.  It is important that happens.</p> <p> Deputy O'Reilly asked several technical questions on Parts 4 and 5.  I think the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, has already written to members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment on those issues.  Regarding the specific question from Deputy O'Reilly, which concerned oversight of the securities settlement migration, I confirm that the migration will be carefully monitored by the Irish and EU authorities.  A list of companies whose securities will migrate through the process provided for in the Bill will be displayed on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange.</p> <p> I wrote down several issues which arose, which I will go through.  Deputy Berry raised an interesting question about the timeframe.  The 31 December and 1 January are it.  If we have not reached an agreement and ratified it by then, it is simply not going to happen and we will be into a no-deal Brexit.  No extension and no rabbit can be pulled out of the hat, I assure Deputies of that, unfortunately.  Turning to the ratification process, the Commission is negotiating on our behalf, through Michel Barnier and his team.  If an agreement is reached, it must be brought before the European Council.  When it has been discussing Brexit recently, those European Council discussions were not done online.  Those discussions were done in the most confidential way possible and leaders even left their phones outside the room, as I understand it.</p> <p> It is not generally possible, therefore, to do Brexit discussions during negotiations by video.  It may be possible, however, if an agreement is reached that a written procedure could be done, without having a physical meeting of the European Council.  The European Parliament, though, obviously also has to ratify the agreement and that will take some time.  The European Parliament, composed of our democratically-elected representatives, certainly wants to have its say on this matter and its members are absolutely entitled to do that as our democratically-elected representatives.  That will take some time as well, however.  If an agreement is reached now, that could bring us close enough to Christmas. </p> <p> Deputy Harkin raised several issues, including the issue of the Border region.  The EU budget passed during the summer had the PEACE PLUS programme and I am looking forward to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, providing details of that programme.  I hope that will happen shortly enough, but that depends on the budget being completely signed off on between the European Council and the European Parliament.  The negotiations have concluded, but the Council then has to agree.  This is another example that is contrary to what some Members have said, genuinely, regarding their worries about solidarity.  This, however, is an example of the solidarity which exists.  That programme is in place and will, uniquely, fund the North of Ireland, which technically will not be part of the European Union.  We have worked for that, but our European colleagues have agreed to it as well, and that is important.</p> <p> On healthcare, I mentioned that we are not in a perfect position regarding the cross-border treatment directive.  The treatment abroad scheme, however, is safe in respect of treatment which cannot be done here and must be done abroad.  I also refer to the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC.</p> <p> Turning to several other comments, Deputy Doherty stated that the people of this island did not choose Brexit, and he is absolutely right.  I said certain things will happen and I set them out.  There will also be many uncertainties, however, and many things I suspect will happen in the new year that people may not have realised would happen.  I put out a video recently on online shopping.  People buying from Great Britain will face a problem in that it will not be as smooth a process in the new year.</p> <p> We did not choose this situation, but we are dealing with the consequences of it, as are other European countries and Britain itself.  I strongly encourage the British Government to ramp up its Brexit preparedness and for British companies to do the same.  I say that because one thing we are hearing from traders is that they are generally quite satisfied with the work the Government is doing, with the support of all the Members in the House, but when those traders are dealing with their counterparts in Britain, and we see the newspaper articles almost every day of the week reporting problems, they are finding that they are not quite as into this and not quite as ready, and the British Government certainly does not seem to be.  That is a problem.  All I can do is implore our British friends to ensure that they are as ready as possible and that they ensure their companies are as ready as possible.</p> <p> Deputy O'Connor raised the issue of fresh food and drink and I have addressed that aspect already.  There are major issues in this area.  Deputy O'Connor has a huge cheese industry in his constituency and those issues are absolutely central to the negotiations, as I outlined.  We must ensure the jobs in this area are protected as well as possible and that we can continue trading.  However, that depends on Britain and where it sees its place in the world.  We know what the issues are in the negotiations and they do concern access to the Single Market, a level playing field, how we resolve disputes and the issue of fish.</p> <p> Deputy Richmond raised an important point regarding building a new relationship with the UK.  Other Deputies have asked about the possibility of other trade deals.  I do not think they are on the agenda now, but it is absolutely essential for us to ensure we have the best possible relations with Britain in the new year, after Brexit.  At the moment, however, relations between Britain and Ireland are in a bit of a holding pattern while this all plays out between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  There is much work to be done and the Taoiseach has already started that and everybody has supported it.  The shared island initiative is to ensure we can all live on this island together and work to improve it.  That also involves Britain being on board and there has been a warm reaction from the British Government in that regard.  We hope that warmth can continue into the new year when this is done and dusted, and hopefully in the most positive way in future.  There will not be a fantastic outcome to these negotiations, but if we get the best possible outcome, then we can reset relations in the new year.</p> <p> As I said, individual Ministers will come before the House next week and they will be able to deal with many of the individual issues.  They have all been listening to all points raised and taking them very seriously, because, in fairness, they have been put forward in the most serious, constructive and thoughtful way possible by Deputies.  That is very much appreciated and this is really a good way of doing legislation.  Some of the amendments from Deputies will come into the legislation and improve it.</p> <p> The Bill protects citizens, North and South, consumers and businesses.  It reduces the possibility of serious economic disturbance.  It will facilitate the sound functioning of several key sectors and it will support the common travel area and North-South co-operation.  It will not eliminate the possibilities of serious disruptions, but those disruptions will have been caused by the decision of the people of Britain to leave the European Union.  Unlike most of last year's Brexit Bill, most of which was never commenced, we will be relying on this Bill from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December.  Many of these legal provisions are, therefore, necessary no matter what happens.</p> <p> The UK joined the EU at the same time as Ireland and it has now chosen a different path.  I think it is a sad situation.  I see it that way, and anyone who has been a Minister will know that the British office in the Council building is next to the Irish office.  It is now sitting there empty, with furniture all stacked up.  In previous times, and I am sure the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will agree, there would have been collaboration, discussion and common interests there.  That is now simply gone and it is so sad to see.</p> <p>As I have said repeatedly, we cannot address every single risk that arises from Brexit and we may not know every single risk.  We have done the best possible work to make sure we can identify the risks as best we can.  We cannot entirely eliminate the disruption that the end of the transition period will bring.  Some issues are simply outside of our control.  We cannot deal with traffic issues in Kent that will directly affect our citizens and goods.  We can deal with traffic issues in Dublin, as I have outlined, and we will certainly look at any issues that may need to be dealt with in Wexford and Rosslare.  The issue there is not considers as serious as the issues in Dublin but clearly it is under constant review by the Government, in conjunction with the local authority.  The Government and the D&aacute;il are doing everything possible.  I ask Members to please get the message out to their constituents and the businesses in their constituencies that they should ensure they are ready for Brexit.  With regard to the supports that Deputies indicated are not being taken up to the extent the Government would like, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, has pointed out that they are available.  It is not the case that the Government is not providing them but that sometimes they have not been taken up.</p> <p> Bh&iacute; an Teachta Connolly ag caint maidir leis an nGaeilge.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200038#MM00800"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the D&aacute;il Chamber on the Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2020 following progression of the previous Stages in the Seanad.  This Bill fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future to progress the revision of the investment limited partnership structure and reflects the strategic priority outlined in the international financial services, IFS, 2020 action plan.  In the interest of time, I will refer to investment limited partnerships as ILPs during the course of this debate.</p>  <p>  The changes proposed in this Bill will enable Irish industry to compete for some of the global private equity market which has, to date, chosen other European or global locations to base such investment funds.  The Bill caters for both the modernisation of the existing ILP structure and makes provision for best practice in the area of transparency and anti-money laundering.  It also makes a number of technical amendments to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015 to enhance the efficiency of the ILP structure.  In addition to these changes, the Bill proposes to amend the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to allow the Central Bank to verify PPSN information pertaining to the beneficial ownership registers, which it operates for both ILPs and common contractual funds.</p>  <p>  I will now give an overview of investment limited partnerships.  An ILP is a regulated partnership structure that does not have a separate legal personality.  ILPs are tailored specifically for investment in a collective investment fund, and they are regulated and authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The basic structure of an ILP is made up of general partners and limited partners.  The major difference between these two groupings is that a general partner has responsibility for the running of the partnership and has unlimited liability while a limited partner is a passive investor, with the exception of a limited advisory role, and is liable only for the value of its capital contribution to the partnership.  Limited liability can be lost if a limited partner exceeds its advisory role in the partnership.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides increased clarity on the list of permitted activities that will not cause a loss of limited liability for the limited partner.  This is the white list concept.  It is common to limited partnership regimes in other jurisdictions and is a clarification of the actions permitted while the limited partner acts in an advisory role only.  Simply put, a limited partner taking part in the management of the partnership outside of the permitted activities will lose its limited liability.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the establishment of umbrella funds, which will allow a single ILP structure to operate a range of investment strategies on behalf of investors, while ensuring that each such strategy is not responsible for the liabilities of another within the overall fund.  Each of these sub-funds will be subject to authorisation by the Central Bank.  This will allow for sub-funds with specific investment strategies to be established in an efficient manner and in line with other ILP funds in other jurisdictions along with the other four corporate vehicles used for Irish funds.</p>  <p>  Another noteworthy aspect of this Bill are the amendments being brought forward on beneficial ownership.  These amendments will bring ILPs, along with common contractual funds, CCFs, in line with beneficial ownership obligations that fall within the scope of anti-money laundering directives.  These will ensure that the highest international transparency standards apply to ILPs and CCFs and that it is clear who controls the vehicles as a result of the beneficial ownership register to be maintained by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The amendments will further enhance our reputation as a well regulated financial centre.</p>  <p>  This Bill also makes minor changes to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015, or ICAV Act, including correcting typographical errors and aligning the Act with other company legislation.  An ICAV is a legal structure for the holding of investment schemes established in accordance with the 2015 Act.  The ICAV structure was specifically designed to be distinguishable from a trading company.  As I will set out later, the changes being made to ICAV Act in this Bill are all only technical in nature. </p>  <p>  I will now take the House through the key features of the Bill from the beginning but I hope Deputies will appreciate it is not possible to cover every single section in the detail normally required.  Further detail is, therefore, set out in the explanatory memorandum published with the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill contains five Parts.  Part 1 consists of three sections dealing with the preliminary matters and definitions used in the Bill.</p>  <p>Part 2, which covers sections 4 to 41, deals with amendments to the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994.  These amendments ensure that the same transparency and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing arrangements will apply across all Irish fund vehicles in line with best international practice.  There are also a number of changes to align with EU and domestic funds legislation, some typographical corrections, and corrections of cross-references.<br/><br/>Sections 4 and 5 are technical amendments to the 1994 Act.  Section 6 amends the 1994 Act to track the language in the EU directive on alternative investment fund management and also inserts subsections to permit the establishment of umbrella funds.  Section 7 amends the 1994 Act to permit a limited partner to participate on boards and committees related to an investment limited partnership.  As outlined earlier, this is a clarification of the actions permitted.  A limited partner taking part in the management of the partnership will lose their limited liability.  Section 8 amends the 1994 Act to correct the reference to the fee prescribed under the Central Bank Act 1942, which was merely a typographical error.<br/><br/>Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, establish the use of an alternative foreign name and provide for related matters, and correct cross-references.  Section 12 inserts an amendment to align with the requirements for records in other funds legislation.  Section 13 sets out the requirements for amending a partnership agreement and the calculation of the majority of limited partners.  Section 14 adds two new subsections to the Act of 1994, both related to the admission or replacement of a general partner.  Section 15 relates to the naming requirements of the ILP.  Sections 16 and 17 set out the procedures for correcting errors in the register, as well as the penalties for non-compliance.<br/><br/>Sections 18 to 22, inclusive are technical amendments to the 1994 Act.  Section 23 amends the 1994 Act to allow the ILP to purchase insurance for a general partner or auditor to indemnify him or her against any liability in the event of a case of negligence or default where he or she is found not be negligent or in default.  Section 24 amends the 1994 Act to ensure that if the partnership agreement provides for sanctions where a partner breaches the partnership agreement, the sanctions applicable for the failure of performance or breach will not be unenforceable solely because they are penal in nature.  Section 25 amends the 1994 Act to correct a typographical error.  Section 26 amends the 1994 Act to clarify the subsection being referenced.  Section 27 inserts new sections into the 1994 Act to introduce beneficial ownership to ILPs and align with S.I. No. 110/2019, the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  Section 28 amends the 1994 Act to correct a typographical error and continues to align the beneficial ownership requirements with the previously mentioned regulations.  Section 29 inserts a new section into the 1994 Act covering further beneficial ownership provisions.<br/><br/>Section 30 amends the 1994 Act to remove the requirement for the bank to publish notice of revocation of authorisation in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</i>Section 31 amends the 1994 Act by inserting the words &quot;or depositary&quot; after &quot;proposed new general partner&quot;.  Section 32 amends the 1994 Act to require the general partner to notify the limited partners of a direction from the bank immediately upon receipt.  Section 33 corrects a typographical error in the original Act.  Section 34 clarifies that there must be at least one general partner and also clarifies that the partnership is not immediately dissolved in the case of death.<br/><br/>Sections 35 to 36, inclusive, clarify the liabilities and duties of limited partners and include a typographical amendment to remove the requirement to be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  Section 37 amends the 1994 Act by adding a new section to align indemnification provisions with the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015 and the Companies Act 2014.  Section 38 amends the 1994 Act to provide for a cost recovery system in respect of the bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining the beneficial ownership registers.  Section 39 inserts new sections, sections 46 to 59, inclusive, which relate to beneficial ownership registers including central register and associated procedures, obligations, etc.<br/><br/>Section 40 inserts a new Part into the 1994 Act to govern the migration of investment limited partnerships in and out of Ireland as well as their conditions of solvency.  Section 41 introduces the use of sub-funds in investment limited partnerships.  As outlined earlier, these sub-funds are ILPs and are structured in exactly the same way, including regulation by the Central Bank.  This is line with existing investment fund vehicles, including ICAVs and common contractual funds, CCFs.<br/><br/>The amendments to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Act 2015 are dealt with in Part 3.  Section 42 amends section 2 of the 2015 Act by adding a new definition of category 4 offence to the definitions.  Section 43 adds a new section to the 2015 Act providing supplemental interpretation provisions regarding ordinary and special resolutions.  Section 44 amends the 2015 Act in order that the sole object in an ICAV constitutional document aligns with the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011.  Sections 45 and 46 add new sections to the 2015 Act to provide that capacity is not limited by an ICAV's instrument of incorporation, along with providing that a contract entered into outside the <i>vires</i>of an ICAV is still enforceable.  Sections 47 and 48 amend the 2015 Act to clarify the duties of the Central Bank of Ireland following the change of name of an ICAV.  Sections 49 and 50 clarify the use of a common seal and delete a subsection in order that the director of an ICAV acting on behalf of various ICAVs does not have to sign an agreement multiple times.  Section 51 amends the 2015 Act to align with the Companies Act 2014 and to allow ICAVs to issue power of attorney in a similar manner to that prescribed under the Companies Act 2014.<br/><br/>Section 52 amends the Act of 2015 by inserting a new section to align ICAVs with the Companies Act 2014 in permitting intra-group loans or transactions.  Section 53 adds a new section to the Act of 2015 which provides that an officer of an ICAV, in anticipation of apprehended proceedings, can make an application to the court to be relieved of liability in respect of the wrong concerned.  Section 54 adds a new section to the 2015 Act regarding written resolutions.  This will align the Act with the similar provisions in the Companies Act 2014.  Section 55 amends the 2015 Act by substituting a new subsection clarifying that, where an investment company converts into an ICAV, the priority of pre-existing charges remains unchanged.  Section 56 amends section 140 of the 2015 Act to correct a typographical error.  Sections 57 and 58 amend the 2015 Act by aligning the Act with the provisions of the Companies Act 2014.  Section 59 corrects a typographical error in the 2015 Act.  Section 60 amends the 2015 Act by inserting a new subsection after section 186(3) stating that a person guilty of a category 4 offence under the Act shall be liable to a class A fine.<br/><br/>Part 4 deals with amendments to the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.  These amendments provide for the establishment of a beneficial ownership register for CCFs and will bring the latter into line with the beneficial ownership obligations that apply to companies and corporate entities, as well as other investment vehicles such as unit trusts and ICAVs.  Section 61 amends the 2005 Act to provide for a cost recovery system in respect of the bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining the beneficial ownership registers.  Section 62 amends the 2005 Act to add definitions of new terms.  Section 63 inserts new sections into the 2005 Act introducing beneficial ownership to common contractual funds and aligns with the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.<br/><br/>Part 5 deals with amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 64 amends the 2005 Act to provide for the inclusion of a registrar of beneficial ownership of investment limited partnerships; a registrar of beneficial ownership of Irish collective asset-management vehicles, credit unions and unit trusts; and a registrar of beneficial ownership of common contractual funds in the list of bodies specified in the Schedule.<br/><br/>I hope the detailed outline I have provided will assist Deputies in understanding the technical aspects of this legislation, along with the benefits that will arise from this new Bill.  The economic impact of Covid-19 emphasises the need to progress legislation that promotes investment, job opportunities and Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the international financial services sector.  In addition, the anti-money laundering provisions for both ILPs and CCFs contained in the Bill will give Ireland a best in class beneficial ownership framework.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions on this important Bill, which I commend to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200040#OO00100"><p>The Minister of State will agree this is a highly technical Bill which is pitched towards one industry with its own needs and interests.  He will also agree that those needs and interests are not shared by the majority of our constituents who would benefit much more from solutions to the coming wave of mortgage arrears and increased capacity in our hospitals, rather than arcane legislation that will delight private equity asset managers.  Much has been said in recent days about how time is prioritised in these Houses.  Over a number of weeks, the Government has spent hours in the D&aacute;il and Seanad progressing legislation which is not urgent, which serves a narrow range of interests and which is of benefit to very few of the people.</p>  <p>  The ILP produce was first established under the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994.  It was thought then that the ILP would become a popular investment vehicle for real estate investments and private equity.  This Bill intends to update the existing ILP regime and make Ireland an attractive place for international investors.  Amazingly, it made its way into the programme for Government rather than, for example, any real commitment to affordable housing.  I am not sure if we should be amazed by this.</p>  <p>  The funds industry regrets the fact that this Bill has become embroiled in the appointment of former Fine Gael Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, as CEO of the Irish Association of Investment Managers three months after leaving office.  Unfortunately, this was inevitable.  It was strange that this legislation found its way into the programme for Government at a time of a public health emergency and with so many other pressing social issues, such as those relating to housing, childcare, health and disability services, facing our people.  That this legislation made it to the front of the queue, and given the revolving door between power and industry, questions are obviously raised and impressions made.  That is unfortunate and that is why lobbying legislation must be overhauled, updated and improved.  Deputy Doherty and Sinn F&eacute;in will be introducing legislation to do just that in the coming days.</p>  <p>  This Bill is extensive.  An ILP is a partnership, the primary business of which is investment in financial assets such as property and shares.  It is a collective investment fund consisting of one general partner who assumes unlimited liability, along with limited partners who assume assets and liabilities in proportion only to the capital they each contribute.  The partnership does not have an independent legal status like a normal company.  The profits are owned by the partners with each able to use tax reliefs available in their own jurisdictions.  Unlike a general partner, a limited partner cannot take part in the management of a firm without taking on full liability for the debts and liabilities of the partnership.</p>  <p>  The ILP is established as an alternative investment fund, AIF, and is regulated by the Central Bank.  Given the technicalities of this legislation, as well as the small audience it seeks to please and the more pressing matters that the D&aacute;il faces, it is strange that the Government has given it such priority.  Ireland remains one of the best destinations for AIFs in Europe.  In the past ten years, the number of funds domiciled here has risen by 60%, with the net assets of those funds increasing by 350%.  The value of investment funds currently domiciled and administered here stands at &euro;4.9 trillion - a figure that is almost too big to say.</p>  <p>  This is not an industry in need of help at this critical time.  Instead, we should be talking about industries hammered by Covid-19, such as hospitality and tourism, not the Irish funds industry, which is getting by just fine.  We should be talking about amending legislation to ensure the eligibility of suppliers to the Covid restrictions support scheme, suppliers who are currently locked out.</p>  <p>  Global private equity asset managers have been keen to establish European structures similar to those held in places such as the Cayman Islands for distributing profits to their European investors.  This encouraged the Irish funds industry to lobby both the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to upgrade the legislation relating to limited partnerships and to achieve the Government's aim of making Ireland a global hotspot for private equity funds.  The result is the Bill before us.  Sinn F&eacute;in views this legislation as an unnecessary distraction and a waste of time in light of the crucial issues we face.  However, we will endeavour to give it the scrutiny it deserves as we did before it lapsed in the previous D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Bill, updated from that published last June, proposes several changes to the current regime.  It allows ILPs to be set up as umbrella funds, then allows them to be divided into sub-funds which are treated individually without being liable for the debts of other sub-funds in the umbrella.  This is an arrangement similar to that enjoyed by ICAVs.  It seeks to expand the white list by allowing limited partners to take part on boards and committees without loss of liability.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to incorporate practices from other jurisdictions aligning the ILP structure fully with the alternative investment fund managers directive and other fund structures such as ICAVs.  In addition, we welcome the fact that new provisions have been added to the legislation which were not included in its previous incarnation in June 2019.  Last year, in an earlier iteration of the Bill, Deputy Doherty spoke with the then Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, around issues of beneficial ownership.  We welcome the fact that section 27 will ensure these funds are covered by beneficial ownership legislation.  Sections 29, 39 and 63 are similar in this regard.  Sinn F&eacute;in will further scrutinise these provisions of the legislation as it progresses on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  We recognise that the Irish funds industry employs a significant number of people, a fact that cannot be contested.  However, I would dispute the relevance of this legislation, given the other pressing challenges we face including the not-so-small issue of a global health pandemic.  That the Irish funds industry has bumped itself up the list at the Department of Finance is testament to its determination and the priorities of the Government.  This is a highly technical Bill but that is no reason to let it pass without scrutiny.  We look forward to examining its provisions on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200040#OO00300"><p>I do not plan to detain the House too long.  I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the Minister of State's remarks and to discuss what the Bill seeks to achieve in general terms.  I also appreciate that sections of the Bill have been long overdue, as well as long awaited.  It is not too long ago since the media uncovered the fact that such ILP funds are not covered by European anti-money laundering law which requires the identification and registration of the real owners behind obscure and complex funds.  Likewise, limited partnerships, which are separate but similar to ILPs, continue to elude anti-money laundering requirements for beneficial ownership.  We have seen such funds implicated in several scandals in the UK.</p>  <p>  It is a concern that there has been a trebling of such phantom ILP firms, an abnormality noted by the Companies Registration Office, especially given that these phantom or postbox firms do not register a principle place of business in Ireland, with this abnormality also noted directly by the Companies Registration Office.  Accordingly, I welcome the measure that beneficial owners of funds managed under ILPs will have to be disclosed as part of anti-money laundering safeguarding measures.</p> <p>We must be careful, however, regarding access to the central register of beneficial ownership.  As we have seen time and again in this country, rules are one thing but enforcement is another.  We know only too well where turning a blind eye here and applying a light touch there can bring our society and economy.</p> <p> It is essential that the mechanisms enabling access to the register are truly accessible and comprehensible.  It must not be restricted by price or means to those with an inside knowledge of the industry.  There must be absolute transparency with regard to information pertaining to the ownership of these funds and those who have a beneficial interest.  For the sake of the public interest, such details must be readily accessible, not just to financial regulators but also to the wider public.  Only then can we truly ensure confidence in the nature and activity of these funds, which, to be frank, do not enjoy widespread public understanding.</p> <p> Despite this much-needed and long overdue safeguard, I am still concerned at the way in which some of the murkier financial instruments in this industry operate.  They can be opaque, to say the least.  They are literally designed to be as impenetrable as possible in order to attract little real attention.  It is my understanding that unlike real high street businesses and many of the important international institutions that are big industry names and employ tens of thousands here, many, if not all, of these investment limited partnership funds are under no obligation to publish financial accounts or statements.  Meanwhile their individual partners are taxable in their resident jurisdictions.  Unsurprisingly, many of these are in low-tax jurisdictions.  Again we could stand accused of standing over legal tax avoidance for those who are skilled enough and wealthy enough to afford very creative and skilled accountants and tax advisers.</p> <p> As we saw with last month's sudden drop in corporation tax receipts, which now account for one fifth of all of our tax revenues, we have become over-reliant on a handful of multinational corporations, many of which operate in the financial services sector.  This Bill seeks to intensify the share of employment that is reliant on highly mobile capital and to make Ireland more attractive to new kinds of funds and investments.  We value the investment made in Ireland by firms such as State Street's international fund services company, located in my home town of Drogheda.  The broader financial services sector accounts for tens of thousands of quality jobs held by skilled professionals throughout the country.  The fact that many of these companies are located outside Dublin is important.  They have driven regional jobs growth.  The strategy for the industry worked on several years ago by the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the former Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, was imbued with a focus on attracting financial services firms to invest in the regions and to develop second-site solutions outside Dublin to ensure the growth they bring is shared across our State.</p> <p> The uptick in remote working and the change in attitude and culture against being present in the office will present challenges to IDA Ireland where our future approach to foreign direct investment is concerned.  I know that our financial services sector and the funds management industry generally are susceptible to that issue.  I know that the Minister and IDA Ireland will be very conscious of this when planning strategies. </p> <p> I return briefly to the very many kinds of opaque financial instruments developed in recent times that are used to move billions of euros in and out of states at the push of a button, often attracting little tax liability in this jurisdiction or, indeed, any other.  A very live and important global debate on international tax justice is ongoing.  Christian Aid Ireland and other important development NGOs have led this debate.  We should all note the recent decision of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to examine the impact of Ireland's international tax policy on the ability of countries in the global south to raise revenue, invest in their states and fulfil their basic social and human rights obligations.  Our actions or inaction in this area have implications not just for Ireland but for states and citizens across the globe.  Our policies ought to be mindful of this fact.  Too often we are not and we fall short of the standards to which we should hold ourselves.  I urge the all the Ministers and senior officials in the Department to engage openly and frankly with this review and to ensure that Ireland does the right thing and is not left on the wrong side of history or justice on this front.</p></speech>

I truly welcome the Minister of State's very detailed analysis of this legislation.  Many of us have been waiting quite some time for it to come back before the House.  It is a shame that it fell in the previous Oireachtas, but we have finally got here.  There are a few points I wish to make and a few concerns I would like to raise which are very similar to those raised by my colleague, Deputy Nash.</p>  <p>  I was very taken by the remarks of my dear friend opposite, which were somewhat dismissive of this Bill and the industry to which it pertains.  I must say, I was exceptionally disappointed to see someone I really respect and with whom I work closely read out the script that was given to him.  No Sinn F&eacute;in members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach were prepared to come in, but Deputy Nash has taken potshots at an industry that employs 16,000 people and contributes just short of &euro;1 billion to the Exchequer.  The Deputy may dismiss this legislation, but the gains to the Exchequer and the employment it will create will allow for more affordable housing and more investment in public health.  We should not blacken the people who work in the financial sector with the implication that we should not be discussing legislation like this.  This legislation allows us to align ourselves with what are simply norms throughout the European Union.  We are less than 50 days away from the end of the Brexit transition period.  The economic impact of Brexit will put what we have experienced during this pandemic in the ha'penny place.  In that context, it is the responsibility of this Government and every responsible party in this Parliament to ensure that legislation is provided so we can take every opportunity to protect an Irish economy that will be facing into global decline not of our making.  We must insulate our economy and provide new opportunities and incentives for growing industries.</p>  <p>  Let us not forget that the fund industry the Deputy dismisses is the largest employer in the Irish Financial Services Centre.  What do we say to the people who have those roles, who are paying their mortgages and paying the taxes that pay for so much in our society?  This is legislation that many Members have been awaiting for quite some time.  We never got to examine it in the Upper House during the lifetime of the previous Oireachtas.  It is deeply technical in nature.  We will go through these technicalities with the Ministers in due course in meetings of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, but the technicalities which the Minister has listed in such detail are all quite straightforward.  They will enable us to insulate our economy and our society against the threats that are facing us.  The Bill will update our regulatory standards.  Not only will it make our regulations more robust, it will also enhance the transparency to which Deputy Nash so rightly referred.  The Bill does not include any tax provisions.  It will not change anyone's income tax, but it will ensure that we get increased resources and opportunities.</p>  <p>  Let us go through the numbers again.  This can potentially create 1,400 jobs instantly, as well as a return to the Exchequer of &euro;187 million.  That should not be dismissed or put down the pecking order when it can be done in a very short debate here this evening.  We will come back to it again next week and then address it in the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  In a matter of weeks we will have a very simple piece of legislation that will provide for a sector whose growth will benefit the rest of our society.  I take umbrage with these comments, and I am very disappointed that they come from Deputy Nash of all people, as we are working very closely and warmly on the very many threats that concern the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, which affect so many people who we consider to be so important.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of the Bill and its financial implications, it is important to note that it has been extensively studied and examined as far back as 2015.  We cannot wait any longer or kick it to the back of the legislative queue.  We can move this forward, reap the opportunities and, crucially, implement the reforms.  The Central Bank has examined this Bill alone and with Irish funds and many other bodies.  Some five years of work have gone into this Bill, as have many protections and many years of oversight.  Allowing its passage through this House in due course will ensure that the funds industry and the general financial services industry on which we will be so reliant in the coming years will have those opportunities.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that we are coming towards a sanitation break.  I conclude by thanking the Minister of State, commending the Bill and looking forward to examining it with the Minister of State at the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p></speech>

While I accept the point that this is a technical Bill, it deals with many significant issues.  On beneficial ownership and who will be the ultimate owner, the provisions in this Bill strive to achieve the objectives mentioned.  These amendments will ensure that the highest international transparency standards apply, including the EU anti-money laundering framework and that is why we are insisting on PPS numbers for any Irish resident.  A person who is not from Ireland and wants to be considered for beneficial ownership will have to produce a passport and prove their identify to the satisfaction of the Central Bank.  </p>  <p>  Deputies also asked why we are prioritising this legislation.  It has been on the Statute Book for some time.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach supported the need for the Bill to proceed into the Oireachtas without scrutiny.  In other words, the committee was happy for it to not undergo legislative scrutiny.  Essentially, the Bill seeks to create investment, employment and revenue to the Irish economy, which is good for everybody.</p>  <p>  In the context of the specific issues that have been raised, given the shortage of time, I will be happy to respond to them on Committee Stage.  I again commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Changes to the disability home support packages are causing immense distress and anxiety to many families who avail of these services.  A constituent of mine contacted me last week regarding her daughter, Fran.  Fran is 31 years old and profoundly intellectually disabled.  She has refractory epilepsy.  When unwell, she can have a seizure every five to ten minutes.  She also has epidermal nevus syndrome, a rare skin disorder.  She experiences rapid mood changes and sensory overload when changes to her environment or routine occur.  Fran is normally good-humoured and happy.  She can verbalise with loud shouting sounds when stressed or anxious, but is otherwise unable to express herself or communicate.  Covid has caused Fran's personal routine to go out the window.  This has resulted in her lashing out and a major regression in her personality and mood which, in turn, makes life very difficult for the family.</p>  <p>  Fran's parents are her full-time carers.  Her mother, Paula, was awarded carer of the year last year.  I was present at the award ceremony.  In the same week Paula received the award, she was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  She is currently undergoing treatment and has been further diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, cardiac issues and osteoarthritis.  This family was in turmoil and already had its hands full when this cancer-suffering mother received a phone call from the HSE to inform her that Fran's carer of some ten years would be replaced within 48 hours by the HSE without any prior warning.  The call to tell her that a new carer would take over on Friday came on Wednesday.  It is unbelievably upsetting.  I know the personal circumstances of the family.  I might as well tell the Minister of State that similar calls came in rapidly from my constituents as the week evolved.</p>  <p>  I was contacted by the family of a woman named Mary.  She is 68 years old and has Parkinson's disease and intellectual disabilities.  Mary likes and needs routine.  Her world has been turned upside down already this year with the arrival of Covid, resulting in her not being able to attend her beloved centre every day.  This has affected Mary deeply.  She cannot understand this monumental change in her life.  Mary lives in a predominantly male environment with her 88 year old father, so her carer has been a pivotal part of her life for the past 12 years.  The family just cannot understand how the HSE can expect Mary and the rest of the family to accept such a massive upheaval and have a complete stranger come into their home and lives.  Such a change would be difficult at any time, but it is particularly challenging in the midst of Covid.  </p>  <p>  I will not mention the other cases.  This situation is too upsetting to bear.  It is happening as a result of the HSE realigning home care support services to two sections, namely, disability services and older persons services.  I do not believe that it is as simple as that in terms of the delivery of home support services.  I ask the Minister of State to fully explain the current changes in the south east community healthcare home support packages within disability services.  As I have outlined, the changes are having a grave impact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200043#SS00500"><p>I thank Deputy Murphy for raising this issue.  If she had not raised it, I would not have been aware of it.  I thank her for bringing my attention to the issue, which means my focus and that of my office are on the matter.  She referred to two families that have been directly impacted but it has had a significant impact on many families.  For Fran and Mary and their families listening to these proceedings, I am taking on board what has been said about their situation.  I acknowledge that it is not acceptable or good enough to ring a person on Wednesday to tell them that after ten years their carer will be changed on Friday.</p>  <p>  I will read out my prepared response.  We had to go out and find a little bit of information in order that I could answer the question.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate for people with disabilities.  This is not the first time she has raised such issues with me.  It is not unusual for her to do so.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, responsibility for disabilities is moving from the Department of Health to the reconfigured Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  My hope is that this will ensure a greater focus on disabilities, rather than it being swamped by other issues in the Department of Health.  The move will allow for clearer pathways to be developed and ensure progress is made.  The Oireachtas is well aware that reform of disability services is ultimately based on the value for money and policy review of disability services in Ireland, published in 2012.  It created the strategies that my Department and the HSE are adhering to in the roll-out of these reforms.  This has already ensured that more effective services can be delivered to more people and resources can be better targeted to give better quality of care to the people most in need.  That does not mean we cannot deliver this in a constructive, empathetic, understanding and informative way.  From the cases the Deputy has presented, that does not appear to have happened.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the HSE that following the review of the way in which it delivers home support services in south east community healthcare, a recommendation was made that all home support staff should be aligned to disability services or older persons services, as the Deputy mentioned.  This decision is to ensure the services have clear governance, management and communication and are in line with best practice and national guidelines.  I believe the HSE has already been in contact with the Deputy regarding a representation she raised in respect of a service user who is affected by the change.</p> <p>I understand her concerns about this person and the three others with profound disabilities, and their families, who are seeing this long-standing personal assistant, PA, change.  The HSE has confirmed that it has contacted by telephone and letter each of the affected people and their families.  Each affected person will continue to have the same level of service and there will be a transition period which will involve a shadowing of work for the new PA alongside the existing PA.  That has been progress, as opposed to the call they might have got on the Wednesday about a change on a Friday.  I see the Deputy shake her head, so obviously she will tell me that might not have changed.</p> <p> We also keen to minimise disruption during this time.  However, the HSE has been advised that if the families of the people concerned or the Deputy wish to review the situation, they can contact the head of disability services for the area.  The HSE is committed to working closely with service users and their families, and this relationship helps work towards further enhancing service delivery for the benefit of the people.  It is regrettable that it did not contact the families first before it entered into this process.  To think that we are having a discussion after rolling out the process and bringing about such change at this level is very upsetting and traumatic for people who have been through such a frustrating time.</p></speech>

She can only feel as I do.  There was all of what the Minister of State described to me, but it took a week and I made further inroads.  I will not mention the HSE official's name, but I found somebody who was empathetic, who took charge of the situation and who said it would not happen again.  However, the letters the Minister of State referred to were particularly cold and callous, and I would never like to see them again.  In that regard, I hope I will not be referring back to the Minister of State with anything that was put before me last week.</p>  <p>  While I was researching this, some significant matters were raised with me by individuals who have great experience.  Some of them are retired.  They are particularly concerned that the HSE is not communicating the skills that are required to those delivering the education.  For example, the education and training boards, ETBs, and other organisations are delivering carer courses, but when a job is advertised by the HSE for a carer there is no correlation between the qualification received from the ETB or some of the other organisations and the HSE requirements.  It is no wonder that there is a shortage of carers.  I can understand why it is the case.  What must happen is that the stakeholders must get together and the HSE should make its requirements very clear.  That is what the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, did when it needed drivers.  A driver training programme with the ETB was set up by the IRHA.  The HSE needs to write its own carer's course and have it qualified by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p>  <p>  These are the issues causing the problems and they do not come to the fore in what we do every day.  I ask the Minister of State to take that on board for the families.  They are our most vulnerable people.</p></speech>

He could see that while I read the response, I had to bring heart and empathy to it, for the simple reason that they are lacking.  There is no explanation as to why it has changed, other than it is looking at a report and a strategy from 2012.  In fact, we are in the middle of a pandemic and many of these families have had their services withdrawn during it.  That is particularly so with regard to Mary, who would have been used to attending, possibly, her adult day services.  Perhaps it was the same with Fran.  That service was withdrawn, and then it was decided to change their carers.  We are re-aligning services in the middle of a pandemic as opposed to supporting families.  I will revert to the HSE to get a clear answer and, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will come to the House and correct the record as to why.</p></speech>

Since 2015, Ballyfermot had already experienced over three times the average national suicide rate, but in the summer of last year there was a surge of deaths of a number of young women in very tragic circumstances.  It demanded action and I appealed then for an all-hands-on-deck approach.  The report the HSE has released confirmed what many of us then suspected, which is that many of the suicides in the area and in neighbouring areas such as Clondalkin and Tallaght were related to deprivation, domestic abuse, substance misuse, alcohol, social media, low school completion rates and fear that their children would be put into care by Tusla.</p>  <p>  The report, Rapid Assessment and Community Response to suicide and suspected suicide in Dublin South, contains a number of recommendations and the challenge now is implementation.  I was calling for a co-ordinated response, the beginning of which I believe we are starting to see.  Ballyfermot Star is leading the suicide prevention and community engagement group in Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard.  Its job is to identify clusters of suicide, identify the underlying issues, to start to tackle it and to act.  In some ways, the easier part is done.  We have done the talking, now there must be action.  We have seen many reports and we have definitely seen too many tragic deaths.  It is time to act, to maintain the momentum and to deliver on this report.  I ask the Minister of State to tell us how the report will be implemented in order that the situation in Ballyfermot last year will not be repeated.</p></speech>

The fact that the HSE investigation has linked these deaths to the housing crisis, domestic violence, poverty and recreational drug use is a clear message that the Government must act.  Parts of Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tallaght are traditionally disadvantaged areas with high levels of poverty.  Poverty underpins all the issues I just raised.  As somebody who talks each day to people affected by the housing crisis, I am not surprised to see that this is one of the leading issues in the tragic deaths of these young women.</p>  <p>  Government policies over the years have had detrimental impacts on people's well-being.  Having a safe and secure place to call home is one of the basic needs of human beings.  The HSE produced the report, Rapid Assessment and Community Response to suicide and suspected suicide in Dublin South.   Since 2015, the female suicide rate in these areas is three times the national average, but it took the deaths of eight young women in their 20s and early 30s in a ten-week period to prompt this report.  The Government must have a proactive response to the report and put in place supports, services and policies that will stop clusters of suicides occurring.</p>  <p>  My constituency of Dublin Mid-West has experienced spates of suicides over the years.  In fact, as I mentioned on previous occasions, it was the first area to have a Pieta House and it is the area where Jigsaw started.  That was directly to meet the demand in the area.  However, the Minister of State should be mindful that while both organisations provide very good services, they have gone from being community services to being national services.  They are not the same services that the people went out onto the streets to demand.  The Minister of State should bear that in mind.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, the report contains a number of recommendations.  How and when will they be implemented?</p></speech>

Any loss to suicide is a tragedy and I send my deepest condolences to the families, friends and communities affected.  Each suicide affects the entire community and it is important that strong supports are in place to help the families, friends and the community.  Last year, there were 421 deaths by suicide in Ireland; 317 were male and 104 were female.</p> <p>The devastation that causes to each and every family cannot be even put into words.  Tackling suicide is a Government priority.</p> <p> Connecting for Life, CfL, the national strategy to reduce suicide, takes a whole-of-government approach.  A cross-sectoral steering group, comprising Departments, agencies and NGOs, supports the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in implementing the strategy.  Work is under way to extend the strategy for a further four years, from 2020 to 2024.  A memo will go to the Government in the next week in that regard.</p> <p> NOSP co-ordinates suicide prevention efforts throughout the country and implements Connecting for Life.  NOSP funding has increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current &euro;13 million.  This funds activities including suicide prevention resource officers, local response plans, Connecting for Life actions, suicide prevention training and counselling provided through the HSE and partner agencies.</p> <p> Under Connecting for Life, 17 local CfL plans have been launched, including the Connecting for Life Dublin South Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2018-2020.  Community healthcare organisation, CHO,  Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow works with local communities to respond to suspected suicides.  Responses include supports to families in the aftermath of suicide and needs at community level.  Throughout Dublin south, services promote positive mental health and address people's mental health needs.  These include adult, child and adolescent specialist mental health services, suicide prevention supports and primary care services, including counselling in primary care.</p> <p> In addition, the HSE funds Dublin south partner agencies to provide support and build resilience.  These include: Candle Community Trust, Aware, Belong To, Mental Health Ireland, Pieta, the Samaritans, and Suicide or Survive.  The three local resource officers for suicide prevention in Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow are involved with local mental health promotion and training.  In 2018 to 2019, nearly 4,000 people in the Dublin south area were trained to enhance the community's capacity to respond to suicide and self-harm.</p> <p> In February 2020, NOSP commissioned a rapid assessment of suicides among young women in south and west Dublin in 2019.  Both Deputies referred to it.  The report noted many contributory factors to suicide, including low income, unemployment, housing, domestic violence, social media, substance misuse and underlying trauma.  In response to this report, an interagency group has been formed to develop a work plan to carry out its recommendations.</p> <p> I was really shocked when I learned recently that two thirds of the 421 people who died due to suicide last year were not availing of any mental health supports.  For some reason those people felt they could not reach out for the supports, the supports may not have been made available to them, or they might have fallen between the cracks.  That is something that I am very conscious of.</p> <p> In direct response to the question, &euro;15,000 has been given by HSE mental health for a training programme to support young women's resilience and mental health.  This will be tendered and run as an initial pilot in 2021.  In addition, a community leadership programme in Ballyfermot will train local residents to recognise and support community members who may be experiencing suicidal ideation.  This approach has proved successful in Jobstown, with a significant reduction in suicide.  I again thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I will respond further to their questions.</p></speech>

Anything is welcome.  It is a pilot programme and I wish it every success.  Some of the recommendations cannot be addressed by the suicide prevention and community engagement team, SPACE, programme in Ballyfermot, which was set up specifically to address this report because some of the underlying issues are bigger and deeper and, as the Minister of State outlined, some people did not reach out to the mental health services.  In other cases they did, and the problems persisted.  Housing is one of the key issues.  I am a Deputy for 18 years and in recent years I have seen more adult women and men break down in front of me in floods of tears because of the housing crisis in their lives.  Unless that is addressed we will struggle to address the problem of suicide.  I hope we will never see what I saw last year, which was the fear and anxiety in a community that had seen a number of women die in very harrowing and public circumstances.  That affected entire communities.</p></speech>

The report states that there is a higher risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation such as Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  It also states that there are higher than average rates of self-harm with myriad challenges faced by young women in particular, in addition to the lack of adult mental health staff in the area.  The recommendation is that the HSE and the National Office of Suicide Protection should take steps to ensure the participation of both St. James's Hospital and Tallaght Hospital in the national clinical programme.  I urge that this not be a long-term goal.  It is something that should be implemented very quickly.  These areas are crying out for 24-7 access to emergency mental health supports.  These women would like to have help when and where they need it.  I know I keep saying that.  The Minister of State mentioned figures about people who were not linked into mental health agencies, but many of those people would have turned up to an accident and emergency department and not had their needs met.  They were turned away.  The statistics do not always capture everything.</p>  <p>  I join the Minister of State in extending my heartfelt condolences to all the families of these women who have passed away by suicide and to anybody who has been affected by suicide as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200045#UU00400"><p>This is a very emotive issues.  There is no doubt that we need to continue to build resilience and strengthen all communities to reduce the incidence of suicide.  It is also important to ensure that, where such a tragedy occurs, we have sufficient supports in place to help those who need it.  The Deputies are right to say that we need to have the supports in place before a tragedy occurs.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to SPACE in Ballyfermot.  It includes representatives from the HSE resource office, HSE adult mental health services and HSE addiction services.  The rest of the members are drawn from Tusla, the local authority and local area partnership and community services in Ballyfermot, so we do have the whole community coming together.</p>  <p>  The Deputy touched on the point that the purpose of the new Sharing the Vision policy is that it is cross-departmental.  Mental health does not stop with the Department of Health.  A person's mental health can be affected if he or she has issues with housing, employment or earnings and whether that person has enough money to pay the mortgage.  For that reason, it is so important that Sharing the Vision is cross departmental.  I recently asked Mr. John Saunders of the Mental Health Commission to chair the national implementation and monitoring committee.  I am delighted to say that all the various Departments with responsibility for housing, transport and social protection will be members of the committee.  It is very important that we do have a cross-departmental approach.</p>  <p>  I referred to the &euro;15,000 that has been given by HSE mental health to develop a training programme to support young women's resilience and mental health.  It will be tendered and run as an initial pilot in 2021.  A significant recommendation in the research is to communicate the work of SPACE to Ballyfermot residents and to develop a community leadership programme within the Ballyfermot area.  I know the community has been devastated by the suicides and I am happy to work with both Deputies on the issue.</p></speech>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities granted a 66% increase to the gas installers of Ireland and a 20% increase in their registration fees.  We saw the regulator taking to the airwaves to advise on the safety issues concerning gas, and all of the media outlets highlight and bring to the public concerns about gas.</p> <p>In 2015 the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications made clear recommendations to Government to ensure there was proper regulation and that there was no black market in gas installation.  We have seen the very powerful television advertisements on it.  Now the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is granting a 20% increase on the annual registration fees, as well as the 66% increase in the cost of certificates.  It is completely wrong both on a health and safety front and in the context of the advice during the Covid pandemic about people not entering houses, meaning that people are reluctant to have anybody at all come into their houses.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities should review this.  It granted the increase with immediate effect; normally there is a run-in period.  It shows little regard for the concerns of the gas installers or for health and safety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200046#VV00200"><p>Deputy Michael Moynihan has covered most of the basics on the issue.  I am sure we are all familiar with the television advertisement featuring Daniel O'Donnell warning us to use only registered installers.  While it is a funny advertisement, it has the important message encouraging people to use registered gas installers and not to get untrained or unregistered tradesmen to do these important jobs.  In this House in recent weeks, we have seen the dangers of leaks, but nothing is more serious than a leaky or deficient boiler.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Moynihan said, in 2015 the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications report asked for pricing arrangements or subscriptions to the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGI Ireland, to be reviewed.  It was also recommended that the cost of the certificates issued for servicing appliances be reviewed to ensure they were equitable.  Five years later, RGI Ireland is now increasing the cost of membership of RGI Ireland by 20% and the cost of certificates by 66%.  If a plumber were to issue 50 certificates in a week, which I am told is a conservative estimate, that is an additional cost of &euro;100 a week or &euro;400 a month to that plumber, which is a significant price hike.</p>  <p>  I fear that an increasing number of tradesmen may ignore the certification process leading to more unlicensed providers servicing boilers with the Daniel O'Donnell sketch becoming a reality.  RGI Ireland estimates that approximately 15,000 unlicensed boiler or leak repair jobs are done every year.  The decision by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to increase membership and certification costs to this extent will have the adverse effect of driving increasing numbers of people to unlicensed individuals.  While the Minister may have no role in overturning this decision, some other method of funding needs to be considered to avert this problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200046#VV00300"><p>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, I thank the Deputies for providing the opportunity to discuss the important topic of gas safety.  Both of them articulated how important gas safety is from a health and safety perspective.  We all know the television advertisements, which are very effective.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is Ireland's independent energy regulator and has statutory responsibility for the regulation of gas installers with respect to safety.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications does not have any role or function in the regulation of gas installers or the setting of associated fees.</p>  <p>  The process whereby the Commission for Regulation of Utilities addresses this important aspect of its safety remit is under section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended.  This sets out that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has responsibility to regulate the activities of gas undertakings and gas installers with respect to safety.</p>  <p>  In 2015, having carried out both a consultation process and a public procurement process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities appointed the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, known as the RGII, as the safety supervisory body to carry out this function on its behalf for the seven-year period from 2016 to 2022.  Any person wishing to carry out gas works, as defined under SI 225 of 2009 and SI 299 of 2011 is required by law to register as a registered gas installer with RGII.  It is an offence under the Act for an individual or company to portray itself as a registered gas installer unless they are registered under this scheme.  I take Deputy O'Sullivan's point that unlicensed people are still apparently carrying out this role.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities recently approved an increase of &euro;1.20 for the price of registered gas installer certificate No. 3, effective from 1 October 2020.  This increases the price from &euro;1.80 to &euro;3.  This is the first certificate price rise since the start of the registered gas installer scheme in 2009 and it affects certification No. 3 only.  As I have stated, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications does not have any function in this matter which is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p></speech>

It is important for the Minister of State to highlight to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that a number of Deputies have raised this issue in the House.  It is causing serious concern.</p>  <p>  Following the consultation in 2015, why are the recommendations of the joint committee not being implemented?  Does the Minister accept that making a decision on 9 October and backdating it to 1 October for certificates coming into the winter period, a time when people would be looking for these certificates, is completely unacceptable?  There should have been proper consultation.  I believe the Minister should write to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities and ask it to reverse this charge.  I believe it will cause undue hardship and lead to black market activity.</p></speech>

I encourage the Minister of State to relay back to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that he should contact the regulator in this regard.  An increase from &euro;1.80 to &euro;3 does not sound significant, but to a plumber who might be doing 50 jobs a week, which is a conservative estimate and many plumbers could possibly be doing up to 100, it is a significant cost.  The plumber will either have to bear the cost himself or pass it on to the consumer.  Given the climate we are in, Government policy is about encouraging people to have their houses retrofitted and improving the building energy rating, BER, of their homes, getting boilers fixed is a positive step.  While the carbon tax we are introducing it is unpalatable for many, much of take from that tax will be accrued and directed specifically at those types of projects, which is to be welcomed.  However, this levy on plumbers, insignificant as it may seem to some, further compounds the increase in carbon tax.  In that respect it runs contrary to what Government policy is trying to achieve and moves people towards the unregistered installers that we are trying to prevent.</p>  <p>  RGI Ireland takes in &euro;1 million a year in membership costs alone from all the plumbers in the country and approximately &euro;600,000 from the certification process.  There is a role for Government, whether through a public service obligation or some other route, whereby it should be possible to fund this shortfall.</p></speech>

I reiterate that the Minister has no function in the appointment of the Register of Gas Installers Ireland as the safety supervisory body for gas.  That being said, the Minister is, of course, concerned with anything that could potentially lead to increased costs being passed on to consumers.  However, it is important to ensure consumer protection and safety.</p>  <p>  The scheme is required to operate on a not-for-profit basis and a self-funding model.  The CRU receives no Exchequer funding and is financed through the levy on industry we just discussed.  As I am sure the Deputies are aware, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities is accountable to a joint committee of the Oireachtas which provides an appropriate forum for all Deputies to raise concerns such as this one directly with the regulator. </p> <p>I will also raise the points made by both Deputies with the Minister and ask him whether it comes within his remit to write to the commission about this issue.</p></speech>

They are there when boats go missing, swimmers get lost, climbers fall, walkers go astray and when people on the edge take their own lives.  I pay my respects to the men and women of the State who have lost their lives in the service of search and rescue.  Their names are etched in our national heart and all of them are greatly loved and missed.</p>  <p>  Our Air Corps is an integral part of that service and we are very lucky to have it.  We look up and see the Air Corps top cover in the sky, and we know that help is on the way to someone in danger.  We depend on that cover, just as we value the officers who provide it.  When Air Corps worries were personally relayed to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, he said he could not deal with them due to ethics.  Then he went and leaked a confidential Government document to a personal friend, illustrating Fine Gael's commitment to private service for the few and not public service for all.  That is how the public reads this.</p>  <p>  In contrast, the Air Corps is there for everyone and it works for everyone.  Apart from their expertise, these exemplary public servants put their lives on the line to give hope and confidence when all seems lost.  Now it looks like we could lose them further and lose their service, because the Government is putting the search and rescue service contract out for tender again.</p>  <p>  It is another controversial contract, which is worth more than &euro;60 million a year for ten years, to provide four helicopters and an aircraft.  That amounts to more than &euro;0.5 billion of Irish taxpayers' money, when our Air Corps, for all intents and purposes, could do it for half the sum.  Six private companies are expected to bid, including two, at last count, from abroad.  Therefore, a private foreign company paid by Irish public money could base its search and rescue aircraft not here, where we are paying for it, but in Britain.  Equally, that British private company, paid by Irish public money, could be the very company reported in the Irish media as carrying out clandestine operations for the British Ministry of Defence.</p>  <p>  This tendering of the contract for our search and rescue services could have a serious impacts in the following ways: first, privatising yet another public service and using public money to do it; second, ignoring the worries of Air Corps officers about Irish military intelligence and the lack of control and oversight of data and what happens in British airfields; and third, downgrading the Air Corps, which is a vital part of our long-neglected and undervalued Defence Forces to the point that it could disappear over the Government's privatisation horizon.  To add insult to injury, this is a flagrant breach of the commitments made in the programme for Government.</p>  <p>  We need to know vastly more about the plans for this tendering process and why the Minister for Defence is content to further undermine our Defence Forces.  Why not recognise the expertise that is still in our Air Corps?  Why not invest in our Air Corps and stop further privatisation?  Why would the Minister for Defence even consider a private company, which has been reported in the media as being involved in clandestine operations for the British Ministry of Defence, and why would he do this over the heads of our own outstanding Irish Air Corps and despite the intelligence concerns of its officers?  These are the questions I am being met with in Kildare, and I am interested in the response of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

He has asked me to respond to this matter and to highlight the important role played by the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, in supporting a wide range of public-facing services.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue which is important.  I will park and put aside for one moment the cheap political shots and the usual snide Sinn F&eacute;in remarks made in respect of people.  I will park also my own amusement at a party like Sinn F&eacute;in going on about undermining our Defence Forces, when it had such an involvement in doing so for so long with some colleagues.</p>  <p>  The defence organisation provides a broad range of services in accordance with its primary defence and security role which it also undertakes as a diverse range of non-security related tasks.  The Defence Forces continue to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including providing critical supports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Defence Forces also carry out aid to the civil authority supports to other Departments and agencies.  In particular, the Defence Forces are playing an active and important role in the Covid-19 response through providing a broad range of supports to the HSE.</p>  <p>  Since 2004 the Irish Coast Guard has had overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue domain.  The Irish Coast Guard falls under the remit of the Minister for Transport.  From within the defence organisation, both the Naval Service and the Air Corps provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime search and rescue operations on an "as available"  basis.  A service level agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard, setting out agreed roles and responsibilities in this regard.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware and has alluded to, there is currently work ongoing, under the remit of the Department of Transport, to progress a new marine search and rescue aviation contract for future service provision.  The current contract for the search and rescue helicopter service is between the Minister of Transport and a civil helicopter operator, CHC Ireland.  The contract commenced on 1 July 2012 for a period of ten years, with an option to extend for a further three years.  The existing contract was extended earlier this year, for one year to 2023, to facilitate the lengthy procurement process and ensure compliance with the public spending code.</p>  <p>  A next generation search and rescue aviation steering group has been set up under the auspices of the Department of Transport and led by the Irish Coast Guard to manage the procurement of the next search and rescue aviation service.  Personnel from the Department of Defence and members of the Air Corps are key stakeholders and members of the steering group progressing this contract, and have played an active role in the group&rsquo;s discussions since its inception a number of months ago.</p>  <p>  Given the significant level of investment involved and the wider benefits to be achieved from this investment, a whole-of-government approach is being adopted to the procurement process.  This approach will seek to optimise the potential benefits in meeting existing and anticipated needs for search and rescue in the first instance, and then identify how value for money can be achieved for other ancillary state aviation needs within financial and regulatory parameters.</p>  <p>  I would like to confirm that the defence organisation is supportive of the Department of Transport&rsquo;s programme to put in place the next generation search and rescue contract.  A strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the public service code was agreed by the steering group and brought to Government for information in July.  The preliminary appraisal included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the State assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard aviation branch.  Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons, but notably, the risks to the State and questions around potential affordability and deliverability.</p>  <p>  In terms of the procurement process a prior information notice has been published on eTenders by the Department of Transport to alert the market to the upcoming competition, and engagement with the market is currently taking place.   The next step will be to bring a detailed business case to Government, with an appraisal of the remaining viable options with a recommendation on the way forward to delivering this service and the procurement strategy to achieve it.  Subject to Government approval, it is intended that a request for tender will be published in quarter one of 2021, and the new contract awarded by the end 2021 or early 2022.</p></speech>

These are the people whose first loyalty is to the State and its people - it is not to fund managers, bankers and brokers.  The Air Corps does not want to see any further privatisation of our Defence Forces.  The issue is not just the fact that the State is paying for aircraft that could be based in the UK, or the dismissal of our own loyal Air Corps, its officers and their concerns about military intelligence, in favour of a private company that is loyal to the markets.  I do not understand why the Minister of State cannot see this.  It is the relentless move, by Fine Gael primarily, to privatise a public service, and one that is so important to an Island nation, and to use public funds to enrich a private company and investors.</p> <p> None of what is happening is going down well with personnel in the Air Corps.  It is in breach of the programme for Government, which is still fresh off the block, and it is a perfect example of Fine Gael saying one thing and delivering something else.  I hope the Minister of State will impress on the Minister the need to rethink this matter and provide more clarity.  Unfortunately, I did not even receive a copy of the Minister of State's reply.  The other Ministers of State who came to the Chamber to take Topical Issue matters had the manners to ensure that a copy of their reply was given to the Deputy who raised the matter in question.  The Minister needs to listen to the experts on this issue.  I hope the Minister of State will convey to him my dissatisfaction with the reply I have been given.</p></speech>

I will reiterate a couple of the points I made in my reply, as she may not have taken them on board the first time.  Personnel from the Department of Defence and members of the Air Corps are key stakeholders in the steering group that is progressing this contract.  Contrary to what the Deputy said, it is absolutely the case that members of the Defence Forces and the Air Corps are being listened to in this matter.  The Government is working at all costs to ensure there is a proper procurement process and to deliver a proper service with value for money.  A large amount of taxpayers' money is at stake in any contract of this size and we must ensure the process is done correctly.  I will, of course, bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200048#XX00500"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>It is unacceptable that there is no regulation governing the activities of the personnel who enforce court orders, including orders for eviction.  That lack of regulation is hard to fathom and comprehend.  This legislation came about in response to the shocking scenes we have seen at evictions in recent years.  I instance, in particular, the evictions at North Frederick Street in Dublin city more than two years ago and the eviction that took place in Strokestown, County Roscommon.  There are other examples which may not have come to media attention to the same extent.  It is a fact that the persons involved in enforcing those court-ordered evictions were not subject to oversight and there was no opportunity for the people who were the subject of the evictions to complain.  The personnel involved did not conduct themselves in an acceptable way.  Indeed, their conduct was very heavy-handed and quite scandalous.</p><p>Following the North Frederick Street evictions, I contacted the Private Security Authority to make a complaint regarding my dissatisfaction with the way they were conducted.  I was informed that those involved in the enforcement of court orders, including eviction orders, did not come under the remit of the authority.  I was absolutely amazed at this.  I conveyed my concern to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who confirmed that this was the case.  It is astonishing that we have allowed a situation to develop, whether by oversight or however it came to be, that people who provide security in bars, restaurants and shops are subject to far more oversight and regulation than those responsible for carrying out evictions.  The person working the door of Mothercare is subject to more regulation than a person who has the authority to force somebody out of his or her home.</p><p>Deputy Martin Kenny and I drew up this legislation to fix that very significant loophole, which is not without consequence.  We propose to amend section 2 of the Private Security Services Act 2004 by adding a new category of security personnel within the remit of the Act and the scope of the Private Security Authority, namely, persons involved in the execution and-or enforcement of court orders for repossession.  This would bring them within the remit of the legislation and the authority generally and would also, for example, make the provisions of sections 29 and 30 of the same Act applicable to them.  The Bill makes explicit that all personnel operating within the private security industry must identify themselves and that they will fall within the remit of the legislation.  The authority is responsible, for instance, for the control and supervision of persons providing security, including the granting, suspending and revoking of licences, maintaining a register of licensees, issuing identity cards, specifying qualifications, setting minimum standards of practice and administering a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints.  The latter point, in particular, was one of our main reasons for drawing up these proposals.  As a public representative, I had a way of expressing my dissatisfaction with what happened on North Frederick Street.  In the case of tenants, who are directly affected by such events, there is nowhere for them to take a complaint.  The current lack of regulation means that the people carrying out this role, and the banks and financial institutions employing them to do so, have <i>carte blanche</i>in terms of how they conduct themselves.  Those banks and financial institutions can choose to employ whomever they like, with no need to have them vetted, and send them off to force a family out of their home.  That is completely unacceptable.</p><p>Subsequent to the North Frederick Street evictions, in late 2018, I said to the then Minister for Justice and Equality that if he did not address the matter, we would bring forward legislation.  He said he would do so but no Bill was forthcoming.  We published this legislation in early 2019, at which point the then Minister undertook, yet again, to introduce a Bill.  Once again, he did not do so.  When I looked at the legislative programme of the new Government, I saw no reference to any legislation of this kind.  I am informed that the Government will support our proposals and had intended to bring forward its own Bill.  The tabling of this debate has perhaps pushed the matter up the agenda.  There has been talk of action for two years but no progress, at least publicly, from the Department.  That is not good enough and we absolutely need action at this point.  I welcome the Government's indication that it will support our Bill.  Far too often, the approach has been to vote down good legislative proposals or send them off into the never-never.  My understanding is that this will not happen on this occasion and I hope the same will apply in respect of other useful pieces of legislation.  I am glad that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, recognise the value of this Bill.</p><p>It is important to point out that evictions hit a very raw nerve for people in this country.  What happened during the Famine and the Land War, and everything connected to those events, is seared into our collective memory.  It offends us emotionally to think of people being forced out of their home unjustly, because they cannot afford their rent or mortgage payments or for whatever reason.  Despite that, we have a situation where not only are the people who enforce court orders - the descendants of the bailiffs of old - not regulated, we also have inadequate protections for tenants.  That issue must be resolved urgently.  At this time, the eviction ban the Government has put in place during the current Covid restrictions is due to lapse in a couple of weeks if we move out of level 5.  If it does, an eviction could happen before Christmas or just after Christmas and the same lack of regulations will apply.  The banks can send in whomever they like to do whatever they like, other than what the criminal law prevents them from doing.  As I said, there is an urgency to resolving this issue and it is unacceptable that it has continued for so long.</p><p>We also need to do much more to protect tenants and prevent evictions.  We must ensure that nobody is evicted into homelessness and nobody is evicted on a basis that is unfair and unjust, as happened in our past.  The reality is that such evictions could very well happen because there are people, particularly in the current Covid crisis, who are out of work and under pressure as their bills and debts mount up.  Many people have received a notice to quit, including people in my constituency who have notices from early in the year.  The successive stays of execution have allowed them to hang on until now but they are potentially facing eviction in the future.</p> <p>More broadly, the Covid-related ban on evictions needs to be extended to January and then reviewed.  I say reviewed because it should not necessarily be removed, but the situation should be evaluated at that time.  The Focus Ireland amendment to prevent people being evicted into homelessness should be implemented and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage should move to ensure that tenants can get contracts of indefinite duration.  There has been some talk of reforms in that area which the Department feels would go far enough but my sense of the matter is that they would not.  It is talking about a technical change which will not allow tenants that contract of indefinite duration and the security this would offer.  I urge the Minister of State to engage with the Department to ensure this measure is introduced.</p> <p> The specific Bill before us is a small, practical and sensible Bill which needs to be progressed.  I urge the Minister of State not to allow this to sit on Committee Stage.  We have this evening's debate and there may then be a launch or statement by the Minister at a later stage before the Bill goes off into the never-never and nothing happens with it.  This failure or gap could potentially facilitate heavy-handedness, confrontation, aggravation and violence if it is not legislated for.  We cannot continue to allow banks and financial institutions to employ whoever they like while allowing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na very little scope to do anything about it.  In this situation, the tenants affected can do nothing about it and have nobody to whom to complain.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin maith go leor.  Caithfear &eacute; a r&eacute;iteach.</p> <p> Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh taca&iacute;ocht an Aire St&aacute;it don Bhille at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200049#YY00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who initiated this legislation during the term of the last D&aacute;il.  We are in a totally impractical situation in which court orders can be executed in a very heavy-handed manner.  We have seen this in some evictions and other situations in which court orders were used to repossess property.  It does not always have to be a person's property - it can be vehicles, business premises and so on.</p>  <p>  In very many cases, we see security firms operating in a very heavy-handed way.  Their operatives often wear masks and really bully and intimidate people.  I have spoken to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been present in these situations and they have felt very uncomfortable with what they have seen unfold in front of them but there was little or nothing they could do other than advise that the security personnel were stepping over the mark and needed to give those being evicted a chance.  Very often this advice would be ignored because these so-called security firms recognise that they are one step ahead of the law because they do not come under regulation.</p>  <p>  This legislation will bring them under such regulation and will ensure they will have to comply, register and maintain a certain level of credentials.  They will have to have proper management structures in place and will not be allowed to breach people's dignity as they do.  This has happened very often.  That was certainly seen to happen not far from me in Strokestown just over 18 months ago.  A very heavy-handed firm came in, many of whose operatives were from another jurisdiction, which is another problem as people sometimes come from outside the country to do this kind of work.  This is not the kind of work which many people should be inclined to do.  It is certainly against the grain of everything Irish people stand for.</p>  <p>  Stepping away from the rights and wrongs of the matter, we understand that banks sometimes feel they have to prosecute people in order to recover debt.  In these cases, repossession orders may be issued.  Apart from the rights and wrongs of that, we must consider the wrong of these security firms operating so heavy-handedly when dealing with people, who are sometimes very vulnerable and stressed.  This can often have great implications for these people's mental health.  It is absolutely scandalous.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that both the Minister of State and the senior Minister have indicated that they accept the bona fides of this legislation on the basis that it is trying to do the right thing and move this situation forward.  I understand that the Government is working on other legislation and that this may be incorporated into it.  If we can, we will co-operate and work with the Minister of State on that.  That is certainly what we need to do.  I expect that this legislation will get the support of all sides of the House because this behaviour really affronts people's sense of dignity.  We see big brother coming in and bullying people.  We understand that this is sometimes carried out by very big businesses with very deep pockets and that tenants sometimes have debts they refuse to pay.  There can be quite legitimate reasons for the issuing of court orders.  Other times, however, these court orders are issued in situations in which people are very vulnerable.  Particularly in those situations, the use of these security firms is completely out of hand.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of evictions during the Covid pandemic, an extension of the bar on evictions needs to be closely examined.  That needs to be looked at very seriously because we cannot allow a situation in which people who are already stressed and under pressure are also put in fear of repossession of their properties and of losing their homes under these circumstances.  A lot of work needs to be done in this area.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that it is an area on which many of us in the Houses get representations from constituents.  These are often not from the people who are feeling the brunt of the problem but from people connected to them because these people feel somehow unable to advocate on their own behalf.  Somebody connected to them, perhaps a neighbour or relative, will ask what can be done for these people who are under serious pressure and whose homes are about to be taken from them.  That is a reflection of the situation in Ireland, whereby many people start to blame themselves when they get into such circumstances.  We need to tell people who are in that situation that businesses sometimes fail and that people's circumstances in life sometimes fail, but that people do not fail.  People can recover and can come back from such situations and work through them.</p>  <p>  This legislation is vital to turn these matters around and to make a clear statement to the public that the people who are engaged in executing these court orders have to come under the authority of the State, have to be responsible and have to be regulated.  I welcome the Minister of State's response to the effect that he will support the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-11-12a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111200049#YY00300"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing forward this Bill.  At the outset, let me state that the Government fully understands and appreciates his reasons for bringing it forward and is supportive of the important public policy objectives that underpin it.  For this reason, the Government has decided not to oppose the Second Stage of the Bill.  However, I would like to advise the House that the Government will be bringing forward legislation in this area which will achieve a similar objective to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill and is intended to address some other issues.</p>  <p>  Many of us will recall the removal of persons trespassing and illegally occupying a private property on North Frederick Street in September 2018 on foot of a High Court order.  The persons were removed by a private security firm.  The personnel who attended at the property on behalf of the private security firm are not currently subject to regulation or licensing by the Private Security Authority, PSA, under the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended.  This is because this activity does not fall within the definition of what constitutes a security service under the Act.</p>  <p>  In light of the widespread dissatisfaction with events at the property on North Frederick Street and the inherent risk associated with unregulated persons carrying out such functions - and I note the stress and fear such occurrences can cause for people and that they are an affront to people's sense of what is right - the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, made a commitment to the D&aacute;il in September 2018 that the law governing the area of persons involved in the execution of court orders that are not licensable by the PSA would be examined.  The Minister established an interdepartmental working group chaired by the then Department of Justice and Equality.  It consisted of officials from the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the County Registrars Association, the Revenue Commissioners, the then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the PSA.</p>  <p>  The remit of the working group was to examine the steps necessary to bring the regulation and licensing of security personnel assisting those enforcing court orders for eviction or repossession within the remit of the PSA.  On 9 April 2019, the then Government approved the publication of the working group's report and the drafting of a general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the proposed legislative amendments.</p> <p>Bringing such personnel within the licensing remit of the PSA was the key recommendation of the interdepartmental working group report.  On 22 October 2019, the Government approved the drafting of the private security services (amendment) Bill.  I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that progressing this Government legislation is of high importance to the Government.  Work on the Bill is at an advanced stage and the intention is, subject to the will of the Houses, to have the Bill enacted in the first half of 2021.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill proposes to amend section 2 of the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended, by inserting a new section 2(1)(i) into the Act.  This new provision would add "persons involved in the execution and/or enforcement of Court orders including Orders for Repossession" to the list of private security services to be licensed by the PSA under the 2004 Act.</p> <p> The Government Bill that will be introduced has a similar objective and will amend section 2 to include a new category of enforcement guard in the list of private security services licensed by the PSA under the 2004 Act.  Detailed consideration is being given to this provision beyond that outlined in Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's proposal.  It is proposed to give further definition and clarity in the Government Bill.  As outlined in the general scheme, an enforcement guard will mean a person who as part of his or her duties, is authorised to remove persons from a premises or place, in order to take possession of the premises or place; controls, supervises or restricts entry to a premises or place in order to take possession of the premises or place; or seizes property or goods in lieu of an outstanding debt.  The scope of this definition is being examined in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p> While similar in terms of objectives, the detailed legal consideration that is being undertaken by the Department's officials and the Office of the Attorney General seeks to avoid unintended consequences and legal uncertainty.  In line with the recommendations of the working group, and as outlined in the published general scheme of the Government Bill, the Government legislation will contain proposed amendments to other legislation in this area.  It is proposed to repeal a provision in relation to the display of court messengers' names and places of residence in courthouses, in the interests of the safety of such personnel.  It is also proposed to amend section 33 of the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended, to allow the register of licences to be available on the Internet as well as the PSA's offices.  It is also proposed to amend section 3 of the Act to exempt from licensing those engaged in the enforced collection of Revenue liabilities by a sheriff.  Where, in exceptional circumstances, there might be a need to engage security personnel, existing protocols have been updated in Revenue to include a requirement that such personnel are licensed by the PSA.</p> <p> Detailed and considered work on the Government Bill is at an advanced stage.  The Bill will deal with these issues more substantively and with greater legal certainty.  Further provisions may also be considered as timely additions to this Bill.  Officials from the Department are in constant contact with the PSA.  They welcome contributions from any quarter, including from the Deputy, to ensure the legislative framework for the PSA is fit for purpose.  As I have said, the Government is seized of the importance attaching to this issue.  I hope to be in a position to publish the Government Bill shortly, with a view to its enactment as early as possible in 2021.</p> <p> I share Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's genuine concerns that the law in this area should be comprehensive and that those providing security should operate to the highest standards.  I am pleased that when the necessary amendments to the primary legislation are in place, it will be an offence to operate as an enforcement guard without a PSA licence.  Such individuals will also be subject to the training standards and licensing regime operated by the PSA.  It will also be an offence to represent oneself as an enforcement guard by advertisement or to display any object purporting to indicate that the holder is a licensed enforcement guard.  For both offences, a person may be liable for a class A fine or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both, on summary conviction.  A conviction on indictment can lead to imprisonment up to five years or the imposition of a fine, or both.</p> <p> The PSA is an important independent agency under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  It is charged with introducing, controlling and managing a comprehensive standards-based licensing system for the private security industry.  Private security staff occupy a position of trust, engaging in regular interactions with members of the public.  It is therefore essential that this area is properly regulated in order to protect public safety and confidence.  The PSA has made significant progress in regulating the private security industry since its establishment in 2005.  Confidence in the industry has greatly improved due to the manner in which the PSA carries out its functions, providing clients of private security service providers with assurance that the industry is working to the highest standards possible.  I want to place on record my appreciation of the work of the PSA and its staff in this regard.</p> <p> Last week, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, welcomed the PSA's annual report for 2019.  The mission of the PSA is to regulate the activities of those involved in the private security industry to ensure the interests of consumers are fully protected through the establishment, promotion, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate standards.  With the introduction of these amendments, the PSA can continue to provide its important role in the private security industry and contribute to the protection of our community.</p> <p> I trust that the Government's agreement not to oppose the Deputy's Private Members' Bill on the regulation of private security firms at the end of this Second Stage debate is seen in the co-operative spirit that it is intended.  The House will note that the Bill deals with a reform that will be addressed by the Government in its private security services (amendment) Bill 2020, which includes additional provisions, and the drafting of which is at an advanced stage.  It is hoped to be in a position to publish the Government Bill in the near future.  We look forward to debating it in this House in due course.  In the meantime, I look forward to hearing contributions from other Members of the House on this reform as an input to the Government's finalisation of its proposals.  Once again, I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing forward this Bill.  The current situation is unacceptable.  I assure the Deputy that the Government Bill addressing this matter will be prosecuted with eagerness.  As I said, we will not just publish it but we will seek to have this Bill enacted in early 2021.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister of State well in his new role as this may be the first time I have addressed him in this House.  The Minister of State and I are aware of the case of the Hendrick family in Kilkenny, who are friends of the Minister of State and his father.  They were treated in an appalling way a number of years ago.</p>  <p>  Deputies Nolan, Michael Collins and myself met the CEO of the PSA, Paul Scanlon, in Leinster House.  That meeting happened as a result of what happened on the roadside in Kilkenny and as a result of what happened to the White family under the famed Slievenamon in Charles Kickham country in Tipperary when thugs arrived in the middle of the night, broke into the property, caused untold damage and took away machinery.  They were thugs and there was a Garda car sitting at the gate of the house while this was going on.  This would not happen in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe and that is exactly what it was.</p>  <p>  We saw what happened in Roscommon.  I am not going into the wrongs or rights of it but I am going into the fact that we have mercenaries coming from outside the State from Northern Ireland.  Some are former SAS people and some come from foreign countries.  They are well trained with wearing masks for Covid-19 because they are well used to wearing thick balaclavas.  One would only barely see their eyes.  They also wear gloves with knuckle dusters.  I mention the equipment they had in the context of the injuries they inflicted on a member of the Hendrick family that night.  They nearly kicked him to death and I am sure Deputy Howlin is aware of this too.  Thank God he is a grown young man but his life was nearly lost with the kicking he got.  His lungs could have been punctured when his ribs were broken.  They pulled him off the tractor just because he was trying to take a photo of them while driving his father's tractor down a country road.  It was barbaric.  He waited two hours for a Garda car to come.  That happened under the law because there is no law to deal with it.</p>  <p>  I wish the Minister of State well and I hope he embraces this legislation and deals with this issue.  We met the CEO of the PSA, Mr. Paul Scanlon, to give voice to our serious concerns about the capacity of the State to sanction unlicensed security personnel effectively.  Our group organised that meeting to try to address the apparent lack of sanctions for those who engage in aggressive acts of intimidation while purporting to be linked to licensed security agencies.  We saw in Roscommon case that some of the people who took part in that barbaric act dragged a poor man out of the house by the ear for everyone to see.  They were fined heavily for that but that was all they got.  It was a slap on the wrists.  Heavy fines mean nothing to them because they are after blood money.  They get massive money to do the dirty work for the banks.</p>  <p>  Evictions have massive connotations in this country.  That is why the New Land League was formed.  The president of that organisation, Jerry Beades, attended that meeting with us.  We had a further meeting in the PSA's headquarters in Tipperary but the legislation has not been enacted.  As I said, that meeting was organised as part of the wider issue of having all of the stakeholders, including homeowners and property owners, consulted.  Many of those people have received little protection from the courts because many of them had to go in as lay litigants.  I was there with some of them in some cases.  I was there for one case when a lady was brought from Cork in a prison van.  She was traumatised and she could not stand up.  She was screamed at to stand up by the judge but she was physically unable to do so, nor was she able to speak up either with the trauma of what was going on.</p>  <p>  In the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government went off with a paragraph or two in health legislation to remove the hearsay clause to allow these vultures to hire these criminals.  That is what they are.  Many of them have criminal records.</p> <p>We saw what happened in Balbriggan.  The Minister of State referred to that himself.  The people involved that day parked their vehicles in the Garda station, and that is well known.  It is time that some kind of order was brought to this situation.</p> <p> Overall, we had very constructive engagement with the Private Security Authority in Tipperary and it is doing its best.  Significant details regarding acts of violence carried out by rogue operators, and indeed some licensed operators, were put to the CEO of the PSA.  We then found out that the board of the PSA, which needs reform as well, contains representatives who were appointed by a Garda assistant commissioner, the former Minister for Education and Skills and the former Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is highly unlikely, therefore, that the previous Government was unaware of these problems.  If it was, then is the PSA like more boards and quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, quangos, in that it was not doing its job?  The PSA is not doing what it is there for.  We have boards, more boards and quangos, but are they doing their jobs?</p> <p> I look forward to this legislation being embraced by the Government.  I will be maintaining a vigilant watch to ensure that it does.  I refer to the merciless receivership that is going to happen in this country in 2021 because of the removal of the hearsay clause and any protections for homeowners.  These thugs are waiting for what is going to be unleashed.  They need to be reined in.</p></speech>

Along with Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins, I met the PSA and we dealt with several issues.  What occurred at that meeting was a realisation that the current legislation from 2004 is far too weak and needs to be strengthened.  I support what this Bill is trying to do, because this is exactly what we must do to protect people in repossession cases or where there are court orders.  What has happened in this State is scandalous.  I am aware of a widow, who was very sick, who had her land ploughed up by thugs.  They were acting in the interests of a bank.  In this day and age, it is beyond belief that this type of activity is happening.  We are witnessing people being dragged from their homes.</p>  <p>  In addition to strengthening this Bill to ensure there is regulation and vetting of all security personnel used by banks, we must also ensure that banks are regulated.  Homeowners need protection.  Only last week, I got a call from a distressed mortgage holder who told me that he made an arrangement with a bank after six or seven different people from the bank phoned him.  It was verging on harassment.  He made the arrangement, that was reneged on it, and the bank then sent him a letter for an amount that was &euro;150 higher than what was agreed.  People are still being subjected to harassment, so I feel we need to take preventive measures, as well as the measures contained in this legislation which I welcome wholeheartedly.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that people are treated fairly and with respect.  There is no need for violence, aggression or threats today.  There should be security personnel who are professionals and who are regulated by the PSA.  That will be of benefit in future, but preventive measures must also be taken.  I ask that that aspect be taken on board, because it is a bit high-handed that we have people paying mortgages, and the banks profiteering on the mortgage breaks which we had during this pandemic, and then coming over heavy-handed with people.  We are, unfortunately, going to see more repossessions because of this pandemic.  People need to be treated with respect and with fairness.  We are all responsible for the laws enacted in this country.  We must ensure that they are enacted for our people and that it is done with fairness, equality and respect for all in this land.</p></speech>

As it stands, the enforcement of evictions and court orders is not covered under the Private Security Services Act 2004 and, therefore, do not fall under the remit of the PSA.  Evictions and court orders can be carried out by anyone once a court order is issued.  No licence is needed, force is permitted if it is deemed to be required and there is a complete absence of oversight and accountability.  That is not good enough.  It is not a hypothetical situation; it is a real situation and it is not a recent revelation.  </p>  <p>  There have been some high-profile evictions.  I refer to the one in Roscommon, with the eviction of a family from their home near Strokestown in December 2018.  The eviction was ordered by the High Court because of an unpaid debt to KBC Bank.  KBC hired GS Agencies Limited to enforce the eviction.  GS Agencies Limited is run by a debt collector who is an ex-British soldier, who served with the Royal Irish Regiment, RIR, and the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR.  He contacted former colleagues a month prior to the eviction, requesting them to travel to Roscommon and to name their price.  Much of this was in the media, but it is important to say it here.  The aftermath of the eviction turned violent, with several people injured, vehicles burned and a dog killed.  A former colleague of the agency owner said that he seemed to get the jobs that no other security firm wanted.  There is further subcontracting to get people to do the dirty work.  When good security staff will not take up the job, where will the company turn?  This was the kind of stuff to which reference was made.  </p>  <p>  The security firm was found guilty of six breaches of the Private Security Services Act 2004 due to its occupation of the house after the eviction, but the personnel involved could not be charged for their actions during the eviction.  It was reported in the media that a Garda superintendent ordered both entrances to the house to be closed off during the eviction.  There was also a Garda presence outside the boundaries of the property to observe the eviction taking place.  That does not reflect well on the Garda.  As has already been said, many garda&iacute; do not want to be placed in this kind of situation.  </p>  <p>  Housing activists in 34 North Frederick Street were removed from a vacant building which they had occupied in defiance of a court order as part of the Take Back The City campaign in 2018.  The 15 or 20 men who removed the activists wore balaclavas, refused to show identification and arrived in a van with no registration on the front and UK number plates on the back.  The men were from a private security firm hired by the landlord to enforce the eviction.  The Garda public order unit had a substantial presence on the scene and its members wore face coverings.  The activist group said that physical force was used against several attendees and five activists were arrested.  This was a heavy-handed and confrontational response to a peaceful protest which sought to highlight the extent of the housing crisis.  The conduct of the garda&iacute; drew criticism from the Opposition, Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  </p>  <p>  On 12 August 2020, tenants were evicted from a property on Berkeley Road in Phibsborough.  The tenants had not received a legal eviction notice, but had received a message via Facebook.  That is not that unusual in respect of the kinds of eviction notices people get.  There is a presumption that such messages are sufficient, but strict protocol surrounds eviction notices and I am surprised how often I have seen those kinds of eviction notices issued, particularly to renters.  In this case in Phibsborough, men from a private security firm, wearing masks, hats, scarfs and dark glasses, evicted the tenants and boarded up the property.  Garda&iacute; were called to the property by the tenants, who had called 999 to request assistance.  Garda&iacute; did not intervene as the tenants were physically removed from their home, according to video footage. </p>  <p>  The footage also shows the garda&iacute; telling the tenants that they had no right to be there any more and that it was not the Garda's responsibility if the tenants were homeless.  That may well be true, but it is not how garda&iacute; should be represented in this kind of situation.</p> <p>It draws them in in a way that I believe is not conducive to governing by consent.  The eviction was deemed invalid and the tenants returned to the property.  Severe property damage was done to the home by the private security firm, personal belongings were destroyed, toilets were smashed, the electricity was switched off and doors were pulled from their hinges.  The Policing Authority has questioned the "appropriateness of the Garda presence and of some of the things that appeared to have been said, and about the fact that circumstances were allowed to develop where the impression was conveyed that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had an active role in the event".  The ICCL has said an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be playing a supporting role in private evictions unless it is a necessary and proportionate response to actual or threatened criminal behaviour.</p> <p> The latest figures available from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, indicate that 372 eviction notices were served between March and June 2020, with 131 of these being notified to the RTB between April and June 2020 despite the Government's introduction of an eviction ban and a rent freeze in late March.  The RTB reports an average of six to seven calls per week related to unlawful termination of tenancies since March.  They are the ones that are notified to the RTB.  Many Members are also aware of individual cases.  Threshold has also noticed a worrying increase in the overall cases of illegal evictions in comparison with last year.  Since March, 44 tenants had contacted Threshold after being illegally evicted from their housing, of whom 17 ended up in homeless accommodation or sleeping in their cars.  Once the moratorium on evictions came to an end in August this year, the number of tenants requiring Threshold's assistance with notice of terminations had increased and went back almost to 2019 levels.  This really indicates the importance of seeing the need for a response way beyond the lockdown and well into next year as a minimum of what needs to be done.</p> <p> In the recent Threshold renter's survey, one third reported a reduction in income due to Covid restrictions, and a large number of renters feel less secure in their rental homes since the beginning of the pandemic.  One fifth of those surveyed said they are paying more than 50% of their net income on rent, with 57% paying more than 30% of their net income.  The private rental sector offers a hugely insecure option in terms of housing and rent, where very often people do not have any other options.  I spoke recently to a pensioner who has fairly serious issues with compromised health.  She told me that she is more scared of being evicted from her home than catching Covid.  That says an awful lot.</p> <p> Higher standards are needed from private security firms and the Garda in the enforcement of court orders and evictions.  We need to ensure that security services hired to enforce legal orders act humanely, professionally, and are held to account for their actions if they deviate from that.  By bringing these private security firms under the remit of the Act, anyone who is involved in enforcing court orders would be subject to high standards, oversight, licensing, complaints procedures and would be required to carry identification.  I believe this is a bare minimum of what is needed.  There are a whole lot of other issues around the insecurity of the whole rental sector and the threat of eviction for people who have mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

The Deputy has spotted a requirement to sort a gap in the 2004 Act.  I remember there was a protracted debate about regulating the security industry through the late 1990s and right up to that period.  People understood that there needed to be regulation, proper training and proper identification of everybody involved in the security industry, be they people who provided alarms or safes in houses, or people who worked security standing at doors and who sometimes completely overstepped the bounds.  While there is a schedule to the original 2004 Act, people assume there is a comprehensive list.  Clearly, as time goes on we learn that it needs to be expanded.  This Bill simply adds another category of people to be encompassed by the 2004 Act.  It is not a difficult thing for us to do as a Legislature.</p><p>I will also make a general point, and it is something we worked on very hard in the previous D&aacute;il.  Where the Government did not command a clear majority it allowed people actually to look at gaps in the law and propose legislation.  The Oireachtas itself armed Deputies not to be as passive as they had been for a very long time and to be proactive in producing legislation.  It has taken a long time for the Government actually to get up to pace with that and to accept legislation from the other side.</p><p>I have been around here a long time and I am always wary when people say they are going to set up an interdepartmental working group.  In the Westminster annals, of course, that means sayonara and that it is never to appear again.  That is not to be ungenerous to interdepartmental working groups as I am sure they are very good.  One year on since the announcement by the Minister that they wanted to set up an interdepartmental working group to see whether this category should be included in the auspices of the Act, the Minister tells us today that the main conclusion in the report is that, yes, they should.  This is what the Minister had indicated <i>ab initio </i>in the review.  We still have not seen the legislation.  The Minister has promised legislation next year, which I welcome.  I also welcome the fact while there is a majority in the House, it is not the instinctive reaction to vote it down.</p><p>It would be a good thing simply to enact the Bill as presented.  There is still the notion, and I have a number of pieces of legislation myself, that legislative style is important and so on and there is always a reason it cannot be done, no matter how well crafted a piece of legislation.  This is not complicated.  It is simply adding a new category to the definition section of an existing Act.  If it needs to be superseded when there is another omnibus Bill in the future, then so be it.</p><p>On the meat of the Bill, I will not rehearse what has already been well rehearsed by some of the experiences whereby completely unauthorised people who have no identification and who are not known present themselves to intimidate our citizens.  That is not acceptable.  Sometimes that will lead to a reaction, which is equally unacceptable, where local vigilantes counter that sort of perceived intimidation.  We have to stop that.  The way to do that is to ensure that people respect the courts, the decisions of the courts and the implementation of the courts' decisions.  If a decision of the court is unjust, then the decision must be appealed and the court must be trusted to deal with it.  Where a court's decision is made, it must be implemented, but not in any heavy-handed way, not in an unacceptable way, and not in a way that horrifies our own people.  I am afraid that in some of the instances that have been so ably elucidated before the House this evening, this is the case.</p><p>We need to do this.  I suppose it is with the luck of God that we do not have a catalogue of visible cases.  There are probably a lot of cases that have not been brought to our notice because they are individuals who do not reach out and they just endure that sort of thing.</p> <p>The sooner the better we get this legislation enacted in order that there will be no cases and that anyone involved in the enforcement or execution of court orders for repossession will be licensed, identified, regulated and subject to complaint and proper training.  It should not be a case of just gathering the lads.  That cannot be right.  It is not right and we have to stop it.</p> <p> I want to mention a separate issue, which is security of tenure in any event.  We have a long way to go as a society as regards renting.  It is probably something instinctive.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated that there is something visceral in the Irish psyche when it comes to evictions.  It is because of our folk memory that we are passionate about security of tenure and having a roof over our heads.  People will go without food rather than risk losing their homes.  That is the fact of it.  However, there is a new reality now.  Most people of my generation always wanted to buy their own house but there is a whole generation now that, sometimes because of economic necessity, are required to rent long term or permanently.  Some people choose to rent for life, as is the continental norm.  They rent from their local authority and although there are generous buy-out schemes available, they choose to stay permanently as tenants.  In the private sector, it is the norm across Europe and the United States for people to be in rent-controlled buildings.  They have security of tenure, sometimes intergenerational security of tenure, and there is never any fear of eviction or exorbitant or unrealistic rent hikes being imposed on them.  We need to get into that space and we need to have that debate.</p> <p> The majority of landlords are accidental landlords who own one or two properties.  They often offload their properties to companies that manage them for them.  We need proper long-term security of tenure and long-term leasing possibilities so people can know that as long as they pay their rent, which is regulated and reasonable, they will have a permanent home and a roof over their heads.  The maintenance of the home would also be managed properly, effectively and efficiently by landlords.  That is the normal relationship that exists across the developed world and it has not embedded itself in sufficient form here.  We have all dealt with cases ranging from bad landlords in some instances, who are entirely unreasonable, to bad tenants who do not pay their rent and do not mind the property.  I want to be quite clear about that.  We need a new settlement on this matter in order that there is a reasonable and fair, but not exorbitant, return for those who invest in private property to rent it, as well as absolute security for long-term living for those who want to lease and rent premises.  They should be able to raise their families in those premises if they so choose without any notion that they will be dislodged from their homes, which would in turn dislodge their kids from their schools and so on.  All of that is entirely unacceptable.  That is a debate for a different Department than the Minster of State's.</p> <p> Coming back to this specific legislation, I think Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill would be resoundingly supported by every Member of this House.  Let us get it on the Statute Book.  If a Government Bill comes along to subsume it later, so be it.  The Bill will give the protection everyone in this House wants to afford to people who might face what I have to describe as the thuggery we have seen in the past.  We must protect them from that and ensure people cannot be abused in our State.  Where we have seen that happen, we as legislators have a responsibility to respond.</p></speech>

I support Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill.  This issue was talked about last year and the year before.  I welcome that the Minister of State is accepting the Bill but I note that the Government is talking about bringing in its own legislation on this matter.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, we all knew a year ago or two years ago - probably longer for anyone who has been here that long - that something was required in this area.  I do not know why we put a group of people from all different Departments together to decide on what we knew already.  I do not know whether they were drinking tea or what they were doing for a year.  It would baffle one at times.  We are where we are and we are moving on from that.  Maybe the Government can bring in its own Bill with all the parts of this Bill in it, and the Minister of State said he wants to address other things in it as well.  That is fine but if a Bill is not in the legislative sequence for the spring or whenever it is being done it will be kicked down the road and we never see the end of the road.  That is the one thing we do not want.  When a Bill has gone through Second Stage it should be moved on.  The one thing we should never be is afraid of is accepting a different view or accepting legislation from all parties in this House.  Ultimately, there is fair agreement on this and we are all shooting at the one star trying to do good for people.  It is important that we are big enough at times to say someone was right or that something is good and accept it.  I have huge respect for a person who will do that and I welcome what the Minister of State said.</p>  <p>  This area needs regulation and there have been problems with it around the country where companies have been fined.  The people involved should need identification and be trained in difficult situations.  That is the first thing.  We need people who are properly trained.  We also need a registration system, so that people cannot just load up a few others in a car and away they go and that is it, they are a security company.  All these things are important.  Identification and knowing how to handle situations is fiercely important.  All I can say is well done to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on bringing the Bill forward.  I acknowledge what the Minister of State has said today and what he has done.  I will not take up any more time except to say I support the Bill.</p></speech>

Everyone accepts that it is absolutely necessary.  I also welcome that the Minister of State has said the Government will not be opposing it.  He spoke about this as a sign of an ability or willingness to work across the House.  Hopefully we will see that happen.  Whether we pass this legislation or other Government legislation that deals with this issue and possibly some other matters, the timeline is what matters.  This needs to be addressed as soon as possible, as a number of colleagues have already stated.</p>  <p>  It has already been pointed out by many people that this is a very simple solution to one particular problem but we probably need a suite of solutions across the board.  Many have spoken about the difficulties we have in this State with a huge housing crisis and people paying absolutely extortionate rents.  We do not have sufficient affordable housing projects and there is no proper affordable housing project across this State.  That that locks people out.</p>  <p>  People do not have security of tenure.  I welcome what Deputy Howlin said in that regard.  He spoke about cases of really bad landlords who need to be dealt with.  We probably also have cases of tenants who have not played their part.  Threshold has said that what we need is a professionalisation of the entire sector.  That would provide the protections needed by renters and also give protections to landlords.  We are talking specifically about the landlords who are leaving the sector.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they are being replaced with vulture funds.  These are the sort of outfits that are not sufficiently regulated, for which there are not sufficient protections and which have bought up a large number of loans.  We will need protections across the board in this regard.</p> <p> This legislation is straightforward.  We are talking about people who are involved in the execution or enforcement or both of court orders, including orders for repossessions, and they should fall under the remit of the Private Security Authority.  It is absolutely ludicrous, in that we expect door staff and those doing security work in shops to be subject to this regulation but here there are people involved in what can be incredibly distressing situations for those who are being evicted.  As was said, we require people who are skilled, who are the right fit and who have been through proper vetting to ensure they are the right people for doing this type of work.</p> <p> We should have protections for those being evicted because, as was said and as everyone knows, there have been many examples of thuggery in such instances which is not acceptable in this day and age.</p> <p> This is incredibly simple and needs to happen as soon as possible.  However, we need to ensure we deal with the other underlying problems in the sector.  That means protections for the ordinary person, although not necessarily the protections we have at present, which make it easy for vulture funds and for people who are quite happy to get a posse together, which sounds like something from a Wild West movie, to arrive at somebody&rsquo;s house to carry out an eviction.  As many people have noted, that still resonates with the Irish psyche.  It is a tradition arising from the Famine, the Land War and a time when many Irish people were utterly powerless.  We need to ensure we put the protections in place for those who find themselves in these situations.  It is a simple request and the Government needs to move on it as soon as possible.  I accept it has stated its willingness to work with everybody in the House and with all the stakeholders to ensure protections for people who find themselves in a distressing eviction-type situation.  We need to ensure that those who work in these situations are properly regulated and that controls are in place in order that we do not have a repeat of some of the situations of which we are all aware and which were spoken about tonight.  The Government needs to move as quickly as possible.  We will be more than happy and willing to work with it.</p></speech>

It is important to highlight there is a common and shared objective, namely, to bring persons involved in the execution and enforcement of court orders, including orders for repossession, within the definition of "security service".  It requires licensing under section 2 of the Private Security Services Act.  The Government will not oppose the Bill and is not opposed to the principle underlying it.  The case for bringing legal certainty to this situation is undoubtedly clear.  The Government hopes to be in a position to publish its own Bill shortly with a view to its enactment as early as possible in 2021.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the various concerns expressed by Deputies about matters which we will ensure are considered in the ongoing preparation of the Bill.  Several examples have been given and, like all the Deputies, I am only too familiar with localised examples of where this situation has caused serious distress and concern.  As some Deputies mentioned, it has upset people&rsquo;s dignity and sense of right.</p>  <p>  I agree with the sentiment expressed by Deputy Howlin on style.  When I was practising as barrister, I recall being in court for almost 45 minutes participating in a debate over the meaning that a semicolon gave to the first part of a sentence.</p></speech>

That puts up a serious barrier in law for people to be able to access their rights.  We heard much commentary about the lack of proper eviction notices.  Very often people do not know their rights and when they go to look them up, it is hard for them to understand their actual rights.  We still often see legal doublets in our law such as "null and void" and "without due care and attention".  There is a historical reason for this, in that people spoke French, English and Latin in the past.  Plain English is something that we need to desperately look at for our future law, however.</p>  <p>  There is no question that the current situation in this area is unacceptable and needs to be addressed quickly.  I am happy Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire brought this Bill forward.  We are not opposing it on Second Stage.  The Government's Bill will be brought forward quite quickly.  While the intention is to have it enacted early in the new year, supporting the progress of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill to Committee Stage will keep the pressure on the Government.  Passing legislation in this area as quickly as possible is in the spirit of co-operation.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that the focus in here has very much been on the Executive over the past number of decades, with not enough focus on the Parliament and on using the expertise and the knowledge across the House.  I hope the Government will continue to acknowledge this and will work in a spirit of co-operation.</p></speech>

That is important.  We identified this loophole in September 2018 and called on the then Minister to act on it.  At that point, the then Minister said he would.  In the absence of anything happening, however, we published a Bill in early 2019.  At that point, the then Minister said legislation would be introduced at some point soon.  In the absence of that, we moved the legislation to First Stage.  In the absence of anything else, we then moved it to Second Stage.  It has taken pressure to get to this point.</p>  <p>  I appreciate an interdepartmental committee was working on the issue, which came to the logical conclusion that the area needed to be brought within the remit of existing private security services legislation.  That said, until this afternoon we had no indication it was necessarily happening early next year.  It was not on the legislative programme.  I hope that this has injected a further degree of urgency.</p>  <p>  It should because legislation in this area is urgently needed.  It speaks volumes to the fact of the potential and real abuses of power that can and do take place under this legislation that the word "thuggery" came up on several occasions in this debate, including among Deputies I consider to be judicious, careful and considered in their language.  I like to consider myself as that occasionally too as it is a good trait.  It speaks volumes that several Deputies felt that such language was necessary and warranted because of some of the instances that we have encountered over recent years and more.</p>  <p>  On top of that, there is the potential abuse of power.  We all referred to the emotional and folk response we have to this and to what evictions mean in the Irish psyche.  We spoke about how people in these situations had no power over what was done to them.  The fact remains that if those enforcing a court-ordered eviction come on to a property to remove someone, that person has little or no power.  The person has no complaint mechanism or no right to demand for whom are the enforcers acting.  There is no particular restriction.  It is incredible that those enforcing the order are authorised to use force but we have no sense of what that force might mean or what might be involved.</p> <p>In theory they may be governed by the criminal law, but if we have no way of understanding what force is permitted and what is not, it will be very difficult to bring charges against somebody for the potentially very extreme force used in the enforcement of an eviction.  </p> <p> This is important.  I welcome the Minister of State's attitude.  It stands in contrast to the attitudes we have seen other Ministers take in Private Members' time in recent weeks and months.  Sometimes the tactic of calling for a 12-month or nine-month delay when the principle has been agreed really frustrates me.  Sometimes Ministers have delayed legislation for childish or egotistical reasons.  I am glad that strategy has not been adopted, and that is a credit to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.  I hope we do not see it used today and we can move this legislation on and bring it into force as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and all Deputies for their support.  </p> <p> T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh muid in ann an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a acht&uacute; chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir chun cosaint a thabhairt do thion&oacute;nta&iacute; agus chun a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte de nach bhfuil for&eacute;igean &aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id ina gcoinne i sl&iacute; nach f&eacute;idir glacadh leis.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&eacute;anfaidh an Bille cinnte de go bhfuil an ceart ag tion&oacute;nta&iacute; a bheith socair, go mbeidh maoirseacht agus rialach&aacute;in ar dhaoine a bhfuil p&aacute;irteach sa rud seo agus nach leanfaidh an &eacute;ag&oacute;ir a rinneadh ar roinnt daoine.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus leis an Teach.</p></speech>
