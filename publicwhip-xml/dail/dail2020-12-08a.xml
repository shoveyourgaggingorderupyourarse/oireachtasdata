At 8 o&rsquo;clock this morning Joanna Sloan, a young nurse in Belfast, was the first person in Ireland to receive a vaccine for Covid-19.  A little earlier a 90-year-old Fermanagh woman, Margaret Keenan, was the first person in Britain to receive the jab.  We now await the vaccine roll-out plan for this part of the island.  There is at last light at the end of the tunnel.  Hopefully, this marks a turning of the tide in our fight against this virus and the beginning of the end.</p><p>Last Wednesday, the Government voted against paying student nurses and midwives.  It then justified this decision by saying that they do not get paid because they do not do real work.  It has broken its promises.  Promises made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, his predecessor, Deputy Simon Harris, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il amount to nothing.</p><p>We are standing here today talking about the student nurses working without pay on the same day that the Government will increase pay for super junior Ministers and judges.  These are not normal times.  The ask of student nurses is always incredible but it is extraordinary during a pandemic.</p><p>I will share with the Taoiseach some of the messages I have been sent by student nurses and midwives in reaction to his decision.  Alison writes:</p> <blockquote> 	We start our shifts at 7:30 am. By 8, we are rushing around carrying out observations, helping patients with toileting and washes. This will bring us up to 10:30/11.  Twelve o'clock comes and we do medications, blood sugars, feeds and toileting. After lunch we try and get some documentation done, call doctors, check blood results and other tasks. Teatime comes and we are back assisting with feeds, toileting and medication.<br /><br />It is outrageous that the Government is saying that they don't do real work. </blockquote>  <p>Rebecca says that she lives at home, unable to afford student housing and she comes home every night from work fearful that she has contracted the virus and could pass it to her immunocompromised Dad.  </p><p>Ella says that every student that was on placement was forced to give up their part-time work, the work that pays their bills.  She is immunocompromised and felt in danger.  She was on the ward with the highest number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and she had to isolate.</p> <p>Marie writes:</p><blockquote>	In third year, I dealt with a patient who had a major haemorrhage. The patient went into cardiac arrest. I ran for the crash cart, I alerted the nurses station to call the cardiac team, and I did chest compressions to try and keep that patient alive. The patient died. I drove home in silence and couldn't talk to my mother. </blockquote> <p>Sinead, a student midwife, says:</p><blockquote>	I have sat with women who are crying because their baby has been feeding all night.  We are the ones who hold their hands and tell them everything will be ok.  We are the ones who cry with them. </blockquote> <p>Roisin says:</p><blockquote>	Our college years are spent working thirteen hour shifts in understaffed hospitals where you are counted as a member of staff.  This year is more exceptional. Students now can't work a paid job due to [fear of cross-contamination]. This creates enormous strain when it comes to paying rent, fees, transport and possibly supporting [a family].  </blockquote> <p>These statements illustrate the real work, real lives and real struggles of student nurses and midwives.  The Taoiseach should please tell them they will be paid, and paid properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800004#B00200"><p>Twenty years ago, we moved from an apprenticeship model of nurse education to a degree model.  It was a fundamental shift and transformation in nurse education, sought by the nursing profession, particularly the nurses' unions.  I introduced it myself as Minister for Health and Children.  It was important in giving a higher degree of respect to the nursing profession within the overall health service hierarchy.  This debate has been very much politicised and characterised by short-termism.  It has been designed to put one group of politicians into one corner and another group in another via a simplistic motion that seeks to resolve the issue of public service pay and the critical issue of how best to educate medical and nursing students right across the health area.  Essentially, what the Deputy is saying is that we should return to the apprenticeship model, which I do not think is a good idea.  No student nurse  should be exploited.  First-year students are not meant to be treating Covid patients, and they are not meant to be treating patients, full stop.  Their education in clinical placements should be protected.  If it is not protected, it is unacceptable.  As far as I am concerned, no exploitation of student nurses should or will be accepted by the Government.</p>  <p>  At the heart of this is the question of whether we now want to protect the learning experience of nurses on the degree programme or allow ourselves to drift back to yesteryear, to 20 odd years ago and preceding decades, to the apprenticeship model, which was not ideal at all for student nurses at that particular time and which led to repeated calls for modernisation.  We were asked to bring nurse education into the 21st century.  I have spoken to the heads of nursing in some of the colleges, and I have spoken to the Chief Nursing Officer.  This is an important point.  I have absolutely no issue with reviewing, at a macro level, the question of whether we want to retain or evaluate the nursing degree programme in terms of protecting learning for students into the future.  I am up for that.  I believe we should do so because it is 18 years since the programme was created.  In the interim, fourth-year nursing students get paid for the 36 weeks of their internship.  First, second and third-year students do not; they get allowances and so on.  The Minister has indicated that there is a review whose authors will report by the end of December 2020, which will deal with an increase in allowances for first, second and third-year students.  The fourth-year student wage, which is up to &euro;21,000 or &euro;22,000 per annum, is also up for review.  This is an immediate review with an independent chairperson who will verify the findings.  Negotiations with the INMO have been ongoing, even prior to last week's vote.  Prior to that vote, as the Deputy knows, the Government took a decision that the pandemic unemployment payment would be available to student nurses who could not do the part-time work in which they would have been engaged because of Covid-19 and the fear of cross-contamination and so on.</p> <p>The payment is now available, as agreed between the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  That was decided at last week's Cabinet meeting and is available to student nurses.  </p> <p> One nurse educator, the head of a particular college, said to me that this is critical from our perspective.  Everything we fought for over the past 20 years is now at risk if we go back to thinking it is okay for nurse students to do every type of job in the hospital when they are meant to be learning.  We have advanced nurse education in this country and brought it into the 21st century.  That is the case not only at undergraduate level, but also at postgraduate level.  That is important in terms of the professionalisation of women in the health service and the professionalisation of nursing.  Nursing is no longer a poor relation to other professions within the health arena.  That is ultimately at the core of this debate, if we want to go down a particular road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800005#C00200"><p>Nobody is suggesting that we should drift backwards; far from it.  We are absolutely insisting that students nurses and midwives must be acknowledged and paid for the critical tasks they carry out.  We are insisting in this year and in these times above all other times, as we face into a pandemic, that we recognise and reward the real work of student nurses and midwives.  Those students are among those who have kept our under-resourced and understaffed hospital system afloat.  Those are the facts.</p>  <p>  It is ironic of the Taoiseach to advance as a reason for not paying student nurses and midwives an argument about the professionalisation of nursing.  Professionalisation of nursing cannot result in the pauperisation of student nurses and midwives.  I have read their testimonies to the Taoiseach.  Those are real, lived experiences and cannot simply be ignored, particularly this year, when the Minister for Health and his predecessor, Deputy Simon Harris, made concrete promises that student nurses and midwives would be recognised, rewarded and paid.  That needs to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800005#C00300"><p>The Deputy and everyone else knows that there have been ongoing discussions about this issue between the INMO and the Minister over the past number of weeks.  Those discussions are continuing and will result in a review before the end of December on the allowances applying to student nurses.</p>  <p>  I am trying to say to the Deputy that the days are over for saying it is all right for student nurses to be given the menial tasks, or whatever tasks, while they are supposed to be learning and going through an educational programme.  An expensive infrastructure has been put in place in hospitals across the length and breadth of the country to protect the learning environment.  We need to face up to that.  It needs to be protected and it is wrong to exploit it.  Any nurse who works and is asked to do certain tasks on particular rosters should be paid, but they should not be asked to do it in the first instance.  That is the point.  Why do we have preceptors, clinical nurse placement officers and second level clinical nurse managers, CNM2?  Those management positions were created specifically to look after the degree programme in clinical placement.  That is what I mean by the professionalisation of health education, to move away from where it was.  </p>  <p>  Nurse education and nursing have advanced a lot.  I say again that there should be no exploitation of any student nurse in any hospital setting.  It will not be accepted and that has been made clear to the HSE and to all and sundry.  That is an important point that the Deputy is ignoring.  She is playing politics and that is fine.  I understand what she was at last week by tabling a motion, putting up the dashboard, going on social media and saying that the Government does not want to pay these students but Sinn F&eacute;in does.  That is overly simplistic and the Deputy knows it.  Public service pay and issues relating to education programmes of this kind were never dealt with via one simplistic motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Deputy knows that as well as anybody else and it is time now to be honest about it too, in terms of how it is presented as a story.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800005#C00400"><p>Today is a truly historic day.  Joanna Sloan, 28, from Belfast, a nurse working in her field, and Margaret Keenan, 90, originally from County Fermanagh and now in Coventry, received the first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.  They are obviously not the first people to receive it, but they are the first to receive it post trial.  It is an historic day because science has delivered.</p> <p>Science works.  We now have vaccines.  The scientists have done their work and have delivered.  Now we, as public representatives, need to support the scientists who have delivered these vaccines.  We must be very pro-vaccine.</p> <p> Historically, I and my party have been very pro-vaccine, as the Taoiseach knows.  We pushed in the last D&aacute;il for the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine to be given to boys.  I am delighted that has commenced.  We fought in relation to other vaccines as well.  I attended the global vaccination conference last year in Brussels.  The deputy chief medical officer, CMO, was there as well. </p> <p> I am concerned about utterances by some public representatives in the past and about the impact it is having on our citizens.  I am concerned that many citizens are being fed lies and deliberate misinformation about vaccines at a critical time.  I ask the Taoiseach publicly to deal with it.  We all have a role here.  Today, the Labour Party has written to all Deputies, Senators and MEPs, that is, to every national public representative, and has asked them whether they will sign up to and promote the vaccine and promote the public awareness behind the vaccine and its full roll-out.  We hope it will be 100%.  I ask the Taoiseach to lead and I ask everyone else to sign it and return it within a week.  We need a public awareness campaign now, ahead of the vaccine roll-out, which hopefully will be early in the new year.  </p> <p> I ask the Taoiseach to consider one other factor.  Much of the misinformation is spread on social media platforms.  In this city, we have Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Google and Instagram.  We need to talk to them and deal with misinformation that is deliberately put out on those platforms.  They all changed their algorithms and their rules in respect of the recent US election.  They need to do so again with regard to the roll-out of this vaccine.  It is important for people's lives.  We in Ireland can lead on that if the Taoiseach uses his role to talk to these social media companies, which are now so powerful in relation to how messaging gets out.  Will the Taoiseach consider that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800006#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the vaccine.  It is a historic day and a vindication of science as the ultimate route to follow in dealing with this terrible virus that has wreaked such havoc across the world in terms of lives lost, of people becoming ill with long-term consequences and of economic and social upheaval.  It has changed our way of living.  I applaud the Deputy's initiative and I would have no difficulty in signing such a petition.  We need to be strong and positive in support of vaccination to eliminate a virus which has caused devastation, ill health and death across the world.</p>  <p>  The objective of vaccination, historically, has been to eliminate such diseases and viruses.  The history of vaccination was an extraordinary one in the 20th century, in terms of healthcare and health outcomes.  This is often forgotten as time moves on and that which was horrendous in one era becomes commonplace and of no consequence in the next era because of vaccines and medicines more generally.  We need to make sure fake news does not get prevalence and does not get promoted on the digital platforms the Deputy referred to.  That is a fair point.</p> <p>I can recall all of the issues around the MMR vaccine when I was Minister for Health and Children and the huge damage that was done at the time.  We had to put up with a measles outbreak for two or three years and children became very ill and, in some cases, lost their lives as a result of that campaign.</p> <p> We await the outcome of the European Medicines Agency in respect of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and then the Moderna vaccine on 11 January.  The Government has announced today the provisional vaccine allocation strategy and the groups that will receive the vaccines in sequence, particularly the aged, those in our nursing homes and our healthcare workers as key priority groups.  That is particularly important.</p> <p> I will receive the blueprint from the task force on Friday.  That will be the culmination of a lot of work undertaken by various work streams involving a lot of bodies.  To be fair regarding the vaccine allocation strategy, the national immunisation committee, which has been responsible for many immunisation programmes, made a provisional recommendation, which NPHET has endorsed, in terms of the sequencing.  All I will say is that individual Deputies may have issues around that and may have their own queries but fundamentally, we should allow the public health experts and science inform that as well.  I think that if we allowed a situation where Deputies and Senators were going to decide who got what in sequence, we would be here for quite a long time in itself.</p> <p> I take the Deputy's proposal on board as one that is designed to try to increase participation rates in terms of the vaccines to make sure that we get herd immunity and can eliminate this virus once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800007#E00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his positive response.  I ask that every Deputy, Senator and MEP do the same.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach or another member of the Government spoke to those social media companies.  It would be helpful in Ireland and further afield.</p>  <p>  I have a query about next Friday and the task force, which has a set amount of work to do.  What database will we use to gather the information?  Since I have a background in this area, I think about this matter a great deal.  This country's unique identification code is the personal public service, PPS, number.  How will we gather all of the information relating to people's health, where will it be stored and do we need emergency legislation on this matter before Christmas?  The House addressed many issues with the public services card, as the Ceann Comhairle remembers.  I agreed with some of those issues but not others.  The information on individuals to be stored in this situation will be deep and personal and will relate to their health.  Do we need legislation?  I presume the Government has been in touch with the Data Protection Commission in advance of this issue.  What has it advised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800007#E00300"><p>First, I think we should point out that about 2 million people receive the flu vaccine.  We are not strangers to national immunisation programmes, although this will be of a far greater scale than we have had so far.  There has been a very significant roll-out of the flu vaccination programme in itself.  That worked very well, notwithstanding all of the complaints and criticisms.</p>  <p>  Clearly, one of the task force's work streams is around an IT infrastructure to capture the data on those who have been vaccinated but also in terms of monitoring the vaccine's effectiveness, monitoring the uptake of the vaccination and supporting post-vaccination evaluation.</p>  <p>  The common good has to prevail.  This is a public health initiative designed to help the entire population in terms of the elimination of this virus, which has been so devastating for so many.  Legal advice is ongoing in relation to whether legislation is required or not on a number of fronts but it is our view that as things stand at present, we are in a position to move ahead.  Suffice it to say, the IT infrastructure is a key part of this situation, as are quite a number of other work streams.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800008#F00100"><p>Before asking my question, I take this opportunity to encourage women to use the CervicalCheck cancer screening service.  CervicalCheck saves many lives every year.  On 11 November, I asked the Minister for Health how many legal cases have been issued to date in respect of  CervicalCheck.  He replied that there had been 164 cases as of that date.  That is an incredibly high figure.  Each of those cases represents a woman with cancer and a family forced to fight for justice in an adversarial court system.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked the same question two weeks later and was told that there were 231 cases as of 25 November.  Again, that is a shockingly high figure given the fact that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, promised the D&aacute;il that no woman with cancer would have to go through the courts again.  The T&aacute;naiste promised that a tribunal would bring this to an end.  However, that promise has not been fulfilled.  Either the Department made a mistake regarding these figures or, in the two weeks between those questions being asked, almost 70 women initiated legal cases against the State in the context of CervicalCheck.  This is an incredible figure and, if it is correct, it represents a massive indictment of the Government.</p>  <p>  Patricia Carrick died in November.  God rest her. The High Court found, in the context of the case she took, that in 2016 her smear test was read in a manner which was neglectful.  Patricia was diagnosed with cancer in 2019, a year after the scandal relating to this matter first broke.  I raised her case in the D&aacute;il.  Since then, I received a letter from CervicalCheck that was critical of my contribution.  I took a meeting with the clinical director of CervicalCheck to try to thrash out these issues and better understand the situation.  I was shocked by what was stated at that meeting.  During the course of my engagement with it, CervicalCheck made its position clear.  It disagrees with the decisions of the Supreme Court, with the initial apology of the Government and with the payment of compensation to many of these women.  These are extraordinary statements in the context of a crisis that has gone on for years and with which many individuals have had such difficulty.</p>  <p>  CervicalCheck is an arm of the State.  The Government and the Supreme Court are also arms of the State.  How can so many organs of the State be in direct contradiction of each other?  Does this not put lives in danger?</p></speech>

I will check the position immediately because we must all uphold the decisions of the Supreme Court and of the courts in general.  On the previous Government's decision, those who work for the State can have their views in terms of Government decisions but they must facilitate the execution of those decisions within various services.  That remains the position.</p>  <p>  Since it entered office, this Government has been doing everything possible to facilitate the establishment of the tribunal in order to create a less adversarial forum to give women who have taken cases to the courts a better alternative.  Towards the latter part of the summer, judges were selected and appointed.  This was because the judges who had previously been put in place had either been appointed to different positions or had moved on because of Covid-19.  There was a pause during the first phase of Covid-19 and we were anxious to get the tribunal operational for women who wanted to lodge claims through their legal representatives at the tribunal.  It was important that we got it established.</p>  <p>  There were, obviously, ongoing discussions with the 221+ patient support group.  It is fair to say it was not satisfied that all the issues it had raised with the Government were resolved, particularly that relating to recurrence and the Statute of Limitations.  The Government took a decision a fortnight ago on the Statute of Limitations which, I believe, will ultimately enable that issue to be resolved.  Obviously, in the first instance, it will be a matter for the tribunal to decide on any case with which it feels it has difficulty because of the Statute of Limitations.  Due to the fact that the tribunal commenced its work later than the women would have expected, there was an obvious delay in terms of their being in a position to lodge their claims.</p> <p> The issue of recurrence was well-debated in the House during the passage of the legislation.  The legal issues raised by the then Minister are the same legal issues that have not enabled the Government to deal with that in the context of the tribunal.  There are wide-ranging implications arising from the recurring issue, beyond CervicalCheck.  The Government is very committed to seeing through the work of the tribunal and facilitating a less adversarial and confrontational, and more suitable, environment for the resolution of these issues where the laboratories would be joined as third parties, not as core defendants, because negligence has to be established, as the Deputy will be aware.  The tribunal follows the work that was initiated by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan.  He recommended the framework and then followed through on the Act that was passed by all parties in the House last year.  We genuinely believe that the tribunal offers a better, less confrontational alternative to the courts.</p></speech>

The Patricia Carrick case struck me in a number of ways.  How could a Government fight her in the courts, practically up to the end of her life?  It was incredible.  She was not the only person who has been in that situation.  It also struck me that she had taken a number of smear tests before her diagnosis, yet her tests were never part of any review.  The reviews commissioned by the Department and the HSE focus only on slides of women who had been diagnosed with cancer.  Patricia's slide was not re-examined until it was too late.</p>  <p>  It struck me that we are re-examining slides only if the woman has developed cancer, and in many cases, when it is too late.  Given the incredibly high number of women who are going through the court system, doctors are saying in some of these cases that the smear tests, when first read, should have been seen in flashing red lights.  Given the tragic loss of life to date, does it not now make sense to review a sample of the slides of the asymptomatic women to see if we can catch these cancers while we can still treat them?</p></speech>

That is very important, and in some respects, the original cervical screening programme gave a sense that if one had come through the screening programme, one was okay, whereas we know that is not the case.  All screening programmes are general population screening programmes-----</p></speech>

Even though Kerry County Council grants permission, this person appeals it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it always seems to happen that the planning permission is refused then.  In Tomies, the late Se&aacute;n Sweeney - I will name him because he went on television and went public about it - fought tooth and nail to get planning permission for his son.  It was granted by Kerry County Council on two or three occasions and it was objected to and refused.  That man has not yet got planning.  A man from Muckross got permission from Kerry County Council and this serial objector objected.  He was working 6 km away in Liebherr's and he made that objection.  He lost his planning permission.</p> <p> Another McCarthy family in Lauragh Upper had 365 acres, all in special areas of conservation, SAC, but Kerry County Council, in its wisdom, granted permission.  An Taisce, someone 72 miles away, appealed this decision, the decision was lost and they never got permission.  The young fellow, who wanted to live beside his mother after his father dying, was denied that right.  Lauragh school is in trouble.  Does the Taoiseach see that this rural settlement policy is denying several people?  For a couple from Glencar - they are only 2 miles from Killorglin and 2 miles from Beaufort - it was a massive struggle to get permission in Beaufort even though they were only 2 miles away from there.</p> <p> The Government tells us to build in the villages and the towns but with places like Kilcummin, there is no sewage treatment plan.  You will not get permission in Glenbeigh, Abbeydorney or Brosna and yet the places are practically desolated.  Curra was promised in 1986.  For former Deputy Tom Fleming and me, Scartaglin was number three on the list; now it is on no list.  Half of the massive town of Castleisland is on septic tanks.  However, to say that people should move into towns is wrong too because the State does not have the infrastructure there.</p> <p> We must appreciate young couples who go to the trouble of building a house for themselves as we know the cost and the trouble it takes to build social houses for people who cannot afford to build a house for themselves.  In many instances, the trouble is to get planning.  We must do something about it.</p></speech>

At one level, I can understand the Deputy's point in terms of rural life, rural populations and young people on their own land not being in a position to get permission.  At that level, one can empathise, particularly given the cost of housing today, that they are finding it very difficult to secure planning permissions.  On the other hand, the advice to locate in villages is sound advice too.  It is sound advice because it is close to services.</p></speech>

Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's point is valid that where towns do not have sewage treatment facilities, that presents an additional difficulty.</p>  <p>  We considered the EPA report yesterday, for example, at the climate change Cabinet sub-committee.  We are down to approximately 20 clean rivers in the country.  That is not the fault of housing.  That could be the intensification of agriculture or whatever.  However, we have gone from 500 rivers in pristine condition to 20.  We all need to reflect on that as we all seek exemptions, changes etc.  It is a very serious situation in terms of our groundwater and of the quality of our rivers.  When one looks at the thousands of septic tanks all over the country, one begins to see that we have a lot of work to do to clean up our rivers and to improve significantly the quality of our waters.</p> <p> The Government intends to further increase the allocation of funding to Irish Water to make sure, as priority, that where any town is discharging raw sewage into rivers or harbours, we will work to ensure they have a sewage treatment plant in place.  There are approximately 35 such locations at the moment.  That should be an immediate priority.  This will enable us to ensure that people find it easier to live in villages and towns across rural Ireland.  That is something I am very committed to doing because we cannot hang around too much longer with raw sewage being discharged into rivers and harbours.  This is a very challenging and serious issue.  I take the Deputy's point, in some instances, but we have a real problem in terms of pollution, the environment more generally and the quality of our water supplies.</p></speech>

In a case in Belgium seven or eight years ago, the judge decided it was wrong to have designations blocking people from getting planning permission.  That judgment is there and it will be contested at some stage by someone.  The Government is leaving itself open to that.  There is a problem in weaker rural areas.  In the case of my own road from Loo Bridge to Morley's Bridge, which is 4 or 5 miles long, there were 16 or 17 families living there but now one cannot get permission to build.  In the case of one of those families, there were 16 reared in a cottage on an acre.  That is the gospel truth.  One cannot get permission to build along that road now because it is part of a designated disadvantaged area, whereas the other side of the road is stronger.  It is in the Government guidelines that the designated disadvantaged areas have to be taken together.  That is what is wrong.  There are another couple of townlands up the Shandrum Road where there were 24 families living.  People cannot get planning permission in those places and no one can come in and build there.  A lot of people are being told that they can work from home but it is not possible to get planning permission for sites in those places.</p></speech>

I often wonder why a dilapidated house was not retained.  Someone should take those houses over, even if it is the county council, and get them back into a reasonable state for somebody to live in.  I am into practical solutions but the highest environmental standards have to be attached.  I am not, by nature, in favour of serial objectors.  I do not like that trend and phenomenon.  We have seen in forestry, for example, how it has led to terrible damage to an important industry and endangered jobs and construction output.  However, I have to be honest and state that I favour the idea of concentrating development in villages and towns.</p></speech>

The necessity for a debate on Brexit preparedness is a fair point.  We must be honest too.  We did have a good debate in the context of the Brexit omnibus Bill that went through the House two weeks ago.  Various Ministers took that Bill in respect of their various areas of responsibility in terms of preparations and decisions we have taken for Brexit.</p>  <p>  Even in the event of a deal, we are still facing a significant degree of disruption.  One is going from 1.5 million customs declarations per annum prior to Brexit to 20 million per annum, even in the context of a trade deal.  The enormity of this cannot be understated.  Notwithstanding the fact that approximately 72,000 companies have registered with Revenue, representing 97% of the value of our exports, quite a significant number of SMEs have not registered and are not prepared.  There has been a low take-up of the &euro;9,000 grant to facilitate companies to employ someone to help them with their customs issues.</p>  <p>  Whether we could do it next week might be a problem.  I have to go on Wednesday afternoon for the Council meeting on Thursday and Friday.  I must alert the House to the fact that we could be very well discussing preparations for a no-deal Brexit.  The situation is serious in terms of where we are now.  This is not about choreography, as some people might think.  There is a very serious issue with respect to the level playing field that will be difficult to resolve.  Unfortunately, we are facing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit if something does not break that over the next day or two.  That is why I have no difficulty in accepting the request.</p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the British Government to pull back and withdraw the offending clauses of the internal market Bill, as well as not to proceed with the offending clauses in the taxation Bill later this week.  That paves the way for the operation of the protocol and the withdrawal agreement which the European Commissioner, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, and Michael Gove have been negotiating for quite some time.</p> <p>Those negotiations went smoothly over the past two weeks and a lot of difficulties have been ironed out.  On that front and in that strand of the talks, it is positive in terms of the all-island economy and the Border issue.  However, of great significance, as Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, are the implications of the UK-EU future trading relationship, which will be a major challenge for us and which will have implications for fisheries, for the agrifood business, in particular, for the west of Ireland and for the Border counties if we end up in the next week or so with no deal.</p></speech>

On Monday on national radio, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage stated that no one has been turned away from emergency accommodation.  This is not the case.  I have asked for time to be set aside to debate the issue of homelessness in the Chamber.  The Chief Whip has indicated that this can be done.  I seek time to discuss this as a matter of urgency because people slept rough in tents and doorways last night and will do so again tonight and on an ongoing basis.  These people are being refused access to emergency accommodation.  This matter needs to be addressed.  There seems to be confusion in government in respect of this matter, particularly on the basis of the comments made by the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste.

I have had instances in Cork where people have been turned away although they have declared themselves homeless.  This was because they travelled from outside the county.

There is no confusion on the Minister's part.  He is very well up to speed on the homelessness issue and is in constant contact with all of the non-governmental organisations involved in the area of homelessness.

Ahead of that, I reread some of the life stories shared with me as part of our campaign to highlight the issue of household debt.  In one case, a person said the children were suffering.  That person cannot sleep and the children are not let out to play for fear someone will come to knock on the door about a debt.  Another person states those in the household are on the State pension and their electricity and fuel consumption increased due to illness and being at home all of the time.  This person said they were better off dead than facing another winter in lockdown.  They cannot get loans from banks and are reliant on moneylenders who charge ridiculous rates.  These are two examples of the more than 300 people who shared their stories with me.</p>  <p>  In 2018, a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill passed Second Stage in the House to cap the interest rates charged by moneylenders, some of whom charge up to 288% interest.</p> <p>They are lending to families who are living below the poverty line, families who are forced to choose between food and fuel or meeting their payments.</p> <p> I am asking the Taoiseach, as we face into what will be the toughest Christmas for so many families, to listen to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and to lone-parent organisations such as SPARK and One Family, which are at the coal face, calling for the Government to take action on growing household debts.  Will he consider these proposals?  Will he ensure this legislation to cap interest rates for moneylenders is progressed very quickly in the new year?</p></speech>

We do this also through some of the initiatives that were brought in in the recent budget, through social protection in respect of school meals, for example, enhancing supports for lone parents, particularly in support of their children, and in terms of child dependent allowances.  Very targeted measures were taken in the budget with a view to supporting the families most in need.  In my view, all State institutions and agencies, and the mechanisms at their disposal, should be used to eliminate this need.  We have the firepower to do that, as a State.</p></speech>

In other words, it will be done by public bodies and while they can bring in private bodies to help them, it will all be under the auspices of the State, and there will not be, in tandem, the possibility whereby private organisations that can afford to do so could vaccinate separate from a national programme.  Can he confirm we are in a position, as regards procurement in this State, to roll out the vaccine once we get it or, in other words, that we will have all the facilities and raw materials?</p></speech>

More than 900 children died while in the care of nuns at Bessborough and the burial place of more than 800 of those children is still unknown.  The proposed development is to be built on an area that has been documented as a children's burial ground.  Needless to say, this simply cannot go ahead.  The State has a history of facilitating the worst kinds of abuse and a very recent history of unnecessarily compounding the suffering caused by that abuse.  The Cork Survivors and Supporters Alliance wants the planning applications withdrawn pending further investigation.  Will the Taoiseach intervene immediately to ensure this?</p></speech>

I have been talking to survivors and supporters who are very concerned there will be no proper investigation and that nothing will commence now.  They are not against the development but it is a fact they have not been given a spare chance on this.  They are asking whether An Bord Plean&aacute;la can defer the application.  I welcome that the Minister has committed to publishing the sixth and final report on the week of 11 January next year.  Could this be suspended until we see what is actually in the final report?

I met with the survivors as well and the campaign group around Bessborough prior to this planning application going in, and my office has been in contact with them subsequent to the planning application going in.  Obviously, it is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to decide on the application.</p> <p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>However, it seems to me that the application is close to, if not on, the burial site itself, which is unacceptable.  One cannot be building on a burial site.  Initially, the survivors were anxious that it would be preserved as a burial site, which to me was a reasonable position to put forward.  This relates to the Bessborough mother and baby home.  There are other issues also.  Given the low-lying nature of the land and its proximity to the shore, I am not clear that it is ideal territory for housing in any event but in terms of the sensitivity of the issue and the degree to which the survivors have approached this in a measured way from the very beginning of our engagement with them, I do not believe this is acceptable at all.</p></speech>

Related to that is the fact that SOLAS, under the Department of Education, has farmed out the Safe Pass course to independent commercial entities.  Since March 2020 and the start of the Covid-19 crisis, the cost of that course has more than doubled from &euro;80 to get a Safe Pass to work on a building site to &euro;160 and then to &euro;200 to do that course.  If one does it through a third language, the cost can be as high as &euro;250.  That is price-gouging at its best.  What does the Taoiseach intend to do about that?  It is inhibiting young workers from getting access to jobs on building sites.  These would be considered essential workers but as well as that, in the longer term, it is outrageous that the course is farmed out to companies that will use the opportunity to price-gouge.  Will the Government take the Safe Pass course back into the Department of Education through the education and training boards, ETBs and SOLAS?</p></speech>

The Government has decided to introduce indemnity for the five vaccine companies that are coming forward with a Covid-19 vaccine.  I ask the Taoiseach when we will see a no-fault compensation scheme introduced here.  We are one of the few countries in Europe now where children and families have to go to court and prove beyond reasonable doubt that the vaccine they took has had an impact on them, yet we still will not introduce a compensation scheme here.  If we are going to give medical indemnity to the vaccine companies, why are we forcing families to go to the courts to get their rights and the compensation that they need?</p></speech>

I know of people in my constituency, as I am sure do other Members, if they are honest, who have been affected by vaccines.  I know that many young children in constituencies were affected by the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine and they had to fight all the way through the courts to get compensation.  Why will the Taoiseach not give them some kind of indemnity or supports?  We will have a debate about this Covid-19 vaccine but people are frightened for their lives because they have seen what happened in terms of a list of vaccines over the years and the damage and trauma caused to families, as well as the cost.  They were pushed aside by the State while the big pharmaceutical companies walked off into the sunset.  Why do those companies have to be indemnified?  They have the money and the power.  The families do not have the money, power or the wherewithal but they have a very sick child or other family member as a result of taking a vaccine and they have tried to prove that at a huge cost.  Why will the Taoiseach not indemnify those families?</p></speech>

The first point is that we are dealing with a virus that has killed people all over the world, and it continues to kill people.</p> <p>Approximately 1.5 million people have died globally as a result of Covid-19.  Governments themselves do not produce vaccines or medicines.  There are no state pharmaceutical factories anywhere that I am aware of.  Some states may have them but there may be dubious issues around that too.  In this case, there has been a strong collaboration between Governments, whether the United States Government or the European Union, collectively, working with pharmaceutical companies with a view to researching, producing and developing a vaccine quickly relative to what would have happened in the past.  It uses existing technologies developed over the years in many instances but parts of that package include pre-purchasing, to enable the financial wherewithal to fund the upfront costs of developing a vaccine, as well as the indemnity, which was important in making sure that we could go all-out to get this vaccine developed and procured.  That is the context.  On Deputy Naughten's point, the Government is working on a no-fault compensation scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, a working group had been established for that.  We are committed to bringing one in.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was to get back to me about that and nothing has happened.  I do not know if the Government has appealed that decision.  If it has not, what steps are being taken?  As we speak, the trawlers are in Galway Bay, taking sprat.  An important part of the policy was a transition phase for sprat to phase out the fishing over two years, because it is not sustainable to continue fishing sprat in the manner that these big trawlers are doing it.  If the Government is going ahead with an appeal, what is the position regarding the policy where the Government introduced a certain tonnage over a two-year transition period?  I do not expect the Taoiseach to have all the answers but it is an important issue and it is unsustainable.

These licences are now up for renewal.  There is chaos trying to get a date to renew these appointments, as they are booked in advance.  Elderly drivers and those with underlying health conditions would prefer not to have to travel to the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, centres from places such as Cahirsiveen and Lauragh all the way to Tralee to renew their licence.  There was previously an option to renew by post but this is now posing a difficulty because people are being advised to go online.  Many of these people do not have a public services card and are not able to use the Internet.  Since they have underlying problems, they ask that they be allowed to post in their applications.  Moreover, there needs to be enough people there to deal with them.</p></speech>

I fully understand the need for visiting restrictions to keep this elderly sector of our community safe during Covid but many residents have suffered psychologically.  I welcome the new position where nursing home and community hospital residents can have one visit per week but it is far less than many residents would normally have.  Nursing Homes Ireland has asked that when the Covid vaccine is rolled out, nursing home residents and staff should be prioritised for vaccination.  They have also requested that one visitor for each resident should receive a priority vaccination to increase the number of safe visits to nursing home residents.  Will the Government consider including one visitor per patient for priority vaccination?</p></speech>

It is clear that residents of nursing homes will be first to be vaccinated, along with the healthcare workers.  That is the sequence which we propose to follow.  As I said earlier in the House, there will be many different proposals from different Deputies as to who should be accommodated before somebody else.  We need to go with the public health advice on this and with those who have been involved in previous immunisation campaigns to get this right for the entire population.

Third year nursing and midwifery students in the Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, brought this to my attention.

Consequently, we have lengthy waiting periods for children who need access to a service through the public system.  It is my understanding that there is little or no ENT service locally in Cavan and Monaghan.  Children, therefore, suffering with problems are totally dependent on consultants within Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital.  Even at that, there are currently only two full-time and two half-time paediatric ENT consultants in Temple Street hospital and those consultants are having their times split between the Mater hospital and Temple Street, as they deal with complex needs and very sick children.  I ask the Taoiseach today whether he, together with the Minister for Health, will ensure that we redouble our efforts to get an increase of consultants within the service to reduce the waiting times for these very sick children.</p></speech>

It makes complete sense and it is good for everybody.  The GAA was given this exemption following contact it made with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and this exemption should be extended to soccer because the under-19 League of Ireland leads to progression to the UEFA youth league.  It is very unfair on the soccer community, who are being treated like second-class citizens.  There appears to be one door to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media for the GAA and one door for all the other sports.  Can the Taoiseach ensure that all codes of sport are treated equally and that under-age soccer is allowed to go ahead?</p></speech>

This restriction is completely unfair because, as has been pointed out, it is not affecting the GAA.  I support all sports and believe this restriction should be lifted.

This is a Bill to provide for the possibility of remote voting for Members of these Houses.  As present, only Members of the Oireachtas who are physically present may vote in D&aacute;il and Seanad proceedings, which is appropriate in all normal times and circumstances.  Being a Member of Parliament is a significant privilege and turning up and voting is the most basic part of that.  This pandemic and other events have shone light on the restrictive nature of that constitutional requirement to be physically present for every vote.</p><p>There are at least three foreseeable situations in which the option of having remote or proxy voting by these Houses would be desirable in the public interest.  The first is the provision for the operation of the Houses during emergencies such as the pandemic that we have had or any other foreseeable emergency.  Provision should also be made for Members who either are or who become ill or immunocompromised in order to ensure that they can continue to participate in parliamentary proceedings.  Provision should finally be made for Members who have recently had or have adopted a baby.  We have heard much talk of maternity or parental leave for politicians over the years and I am aware of and want to pay tribute to other Members before me who have introduced legislation, particularly Deputy Niamh Smyth in 2017, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte for their work on this.  I am aware that others are working on ideas and I also pay tribute to Deputy Cairns for her work-in-progress on this.</p><p>This Bill today is only part of and a contribution to that conversation.  There is clearly more work to be done by us all in collaboration.  We should not be prescriptive as to how women or men take leave or adapt their work to spend more time with their young children or give support to their partner who may be a primary carer.  It is horribly paternalistic for us to continue to tell women how to organise their time.  Maternity leave might look very different for different people.  Some might choose to take an extended period of time off and some may choose to continue working as much as possible while at home.  Others may wish to continue working in their office.  Nobody can really prepare for maternity leave.  As a person does not know how she will be or how her baby will be, it is therefore impossible to predict that and it is certainly impossible for other people to predict and make plans for that person.  Whatever such leave might look like for any Member, I suggest that the introduction of remote voting might play a part in whatever arrangements we ultimately come to.</p><p>This is just as relevant for the fathers of babies who should also have the option of voting remotely.  They too are needed at home more during this phase, either to be with their child or to provide support for the partner.  I am very glad to have the support of my party but particularly those members of my party who have all recently had babies such as Deputies Dillon and Richmond and the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to whom a degree of flexibility should be acknowledged at least as an option.</p><p>We cannot change a culture that leaves women continually behind without approaching everything equally.  Parenting is not a gendered issue, nor is work.  A key part of the work equal agenda is addressing a cultural shift which recognises that people and parents have babies; it is not just women who have babies.</p><p>It is not my intention by introducing the this Bill to be in any way prescriptive.  The Bill simply attempts to remove a constitutional block in allowing politicians, male or female, to approach their work in different ways, whether because of parental responsibilities or for other reasons.</p> <p>All workers who are parents with young children, including, as a subset, Oireachtas Members, should be allowed discretion to organise their own time.  How to spend the weeks and months following the birth or adoption of a baby should be the parents' choice.  It should not be a case of me, or anybody else, attempting to be prescriptive.</p> <p> I focus today on the remote voting issue as a parenting issue because, in some ways, it is so obviously a live issue.  However, it is just as important an issue for Members who are or who may become immunocompromised through illness, which could happen to any of us who might need to go through chemotherapy or another such procedure.  It is also an important issue for those who would like to seek election to this House but who are immunocompromised.  We can do more to be inclusive.  Although I hope we will never need this provision, it may be important for the operation of our Parliament in a future emergency.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce the Bill.  I appreciate that it is a constitutional Bill, which means it might arise again very far into the future, on a referendum day.  It is an effort to contribute to the debate on how we organise our time in this Parliament and on the approach to parenting, in particular, not as a gendered issue but as a work issue.</p></speech>

This would open the last large unpublished historical data sets of a very turbulent period of Irish history, illustrating to historians, genealogists, family members, the diaspora, statisticians, planners, etc., the 15 years before the fledgling Free State's first census.  The census records would show the full effects of, for instance, the 1918 flu pandemic, which cost the lives of 25,000 in Ireland.  The records capture information reflecting the societal effects of a very turbulent time from the Lockout of 1913; the founding of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan; the enlistment in the British Army of hundreds of thousands of Irishmen for the First World War, from 1914 to 1918, and the deaths of approximately 50,000 Irishmen in that war; the Easter Rising in 1916; internment; the release of prisoners; and the revival and rebirth of Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA that paved the way for the 1918 general election victories and the extension of the franchise, including, for the first time, to women.  The digitisation of census records thus far by the National Archives has provided a wonderful, freely available national heritage resource that has also greatly increased the interest among Ireland's diaspora in their ancestral links to Ireland.  Many of their forefathers left Ireland's shores in this era. </p><p>&Aacute;fach, t&aacute; srian ar rochtain phoibl&iacute; ar thortha&iacute; na ndaon&aacute;ireamh a rinneadh &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t in ainneoin gur seoid eolais faoi bhlianta luath an St&aacute;it iad.

The release of the 1926 census would provide a very significant boost to Irish historical research, genealogy and family history research, and, indeed, Irish tourism generally.  The addition of the 1926 census results to the online resources made available to date by the State, including the indices to the records of the General Register Office, the births, marriages and deaths records on , the military archive records and the military service pensions records, and the uploading of the microfilm copies of the Roman Catholic Church parish registers held at the National Library of Ireland to that library's website, clearly demonstrate the importance of this type of genealogical heritage to our people at home and to the many millions of people of Irish ancestry overseas.</p><p>T&aacute;im ag tn&uacute;th le cead a fh&aacute;il don Dara Ch&eacute;im den Bhille.

It last met on 8 October 2020 in advance of the meetings of the European Council on 15 October and 16 October, when it discussed the agenda for that meeting, including climate action and the EU's relationship with Africa.  I also used the meeting to brief colleagues on the visit to Dublin earlier that day of President of the European Council, Mr. Charles Michel.  My discussions with him included the state of play in the Brexit negotiations, EU co-ordination in response to Covid-19, climate action and EU relations with Africa.</p> <p> The next meeting of the Cabinet committee on Europe is scheduled to take place later today in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels this Thursday and Friday, 10 and 11 December.  The agenda for that meeting includes: further discussion on Covid-19, including the roll-out of vaccines and travel; climate action and the question of increased ambition in the European Union target for 2030; terrorism, in light of recent events in France and Austria; European Union relations with our southern neighbours; relations with Turkey; and European Union-US relations.</p> <p> There is also likely to be discussion of the multi-annual financial framework and recovery package with the Germany Presidency continuing to lead discussions aimed at reaching agreement on rule of law conditionality in this context.  While not on the agenda at this point, we will take stock of the current state of play in the European Union-UK negotiations.  We may also discuss other current external relations issues.</p></reply>

The Irish Federation of University Women, through the University Women of Europe, lodged a complaint within the framework of the collective complaints procedure with the ECSR as the monitoring body of the European Social Charter.</p>  <p>  Ireland was one of 15 EU member states against which complaints were made.  In its complaint against Ireland, the University Women of Europe argued that the gender pay gap for women here persists despite the State's international and domestic obligations.  The committee found that Ireland is in violation of the European Social Charter on three separate counts.  It was found that pay transparency is not guaranteed in practice and that the absence of gender pay gap reporting is a major obstacle for victims of pay discrimination as their rights cannot be effectively enforced.  It was also found that there is an absence of indicators showing measurable progress in promoting equal opportunities between men and women in respect of equal pay.  The committee noted that the previous Government was unable to provide gender pay gap statistics for the previous five years in its submission.  It was found that Ireland has made insufficient progress in ensuring a balanced representation of women in decision-making positions in private companies.  Ireland's breaches of the European Social Charter are even more disappointing when we consider that addressing the gender pay gap was a key commitment in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.  Can the Taoiseach please confirm when the Bill will be released from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for Report Stage and also the specific actions the Government has taken to address all three violations of the European Social Charter?</p></speech>

The programme has been in place since September 2019 and runs to August 2022.  Among the participants on this programme is the Israeli Ministry of Public Security, which oversees the Israeli prison service, police, border control and so on.  It has been involved and implicated in repeated, terrible human rights abuses of Palestinians, including many children, administrative detention, detention of children without trial and many other human rights abuses that have recently been documented by, among others, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign in a report it produced in August.  The latter has written to the Minister for Justice.  I submitted a parliamentary question that was ruled out of order asking what on earth the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing.  The Garda has, as part of its code of ethics, specific and clear commitments to human rights and yet is partnering with an Israeli body that is deeply implicated in human rights abuses.</p>  <p>  I put to the Taoiseach that we should have no hand or part in a project involving the Israeli Ministry of Public Security.  Indeed, we should be suggesting that the EU, which is supposed to respect human rights, should have nothing whatsoever to do with such a project if the Israeli Ministry of Public Security is involved.</p></speech>

However, in the event that things go the other direction, what contingencies are in place for a no-deal Brexit as regards financial supports that were mooted last week?  When would they came into place if, unfortunately, we end up in that scenario?  Has anything changed with regard to what the Taoiseach has told this Chamber about potential shortages of food, medicines or goods?  Has he had any discussions with President Macron, the Dutch Prime Minister or Chancellor Merkel in the past week on what specific measures they are potentially ready to compromise?</p></speech>

There will be a meeting of the Euro Summit which is expected to take stock of recent developments at Eurogroup on banking union and capital markets.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will attend the Euro Summit in his capacity as president of the Eurogroup and a report on last week's agreement on finalising reform of the European Stability Mechanism is an important step in strengthening the resilience and crisis resolution capabilities of the euro area.  The Cabinet committee on Europe will then continue to meet as appropriate, including to discuss issues on the agenda of the European Council.  I pay tribute to the Minister, in his capacity as president of the Eurogroup, for the important work he did there in advancing and finalising reform of the European Stability Mechanism.</p>  <p>  Some of the questions that Deputies raised are not directly applicable to the work but I will take the question about the gender pay gap, the insufficient progress in addressing it and, indeed, the number of women in senior positions in the private and public sectors.  The Government is committed to dealing with and progressing those issues and will work with Europe to advance and progress them.  I will talk to the Minister concerned about when he will be in a position to bring the legislation to Committee Stage.  I will come back to the Deputy on that point.  Generally speaking, we know the situation regarding gender pay.  The gender pay gap is not acceptable and needs to be rectified.  It needs to be dealt with in a progressive and timelined way.  The Government and I are committed to doing that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to a joint European Union research group, as I understand it, to combat organised crime.  I commend the European Union for organising a group to deal with organised crime across Europe because crime is now international and knows no borders.  It is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a participant in any European Union project that will subsequently enhance its intelligence and insights into how organised crime works globally and how analytics can be used to combat organised crime.  The question is should the Israeli police force be a part of that European initiative.  That is the more relevant question to ask, rather than saying that the Garda should not be a part of a European consortium that is working on advanced mechanisms to defeat organised crime.  My view is that the defeating of organised crime is critical for us in Europe.  When one looks at what is happening in South America, for example-----</p></speech>

Europe will continue to be supportive of Palestinians' human rights and of enabling them to build a state apparatus for themselves.  That will continue.  There is a balancing act in terms of the approach to these issues.</p>  <p>  Different member states have different perspectives.  They do not all share our views on the Middle East.  There are 27 EU member states so we cannot dictate every issue or the composition of every committee or consortium.  We are not in a position to do that.  Neither do I want to be in a position where we take the Garda out of important consortiums that could be of use to the force and to this country in the context of combating organised crime.  We should not underestimate the devastation that organised crime wreaks on societies and people across Europe and in this country.  We have to work with others to combat it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly asked for assurances on fisheries and access to UK waters.  I cannot give such assurances right now, particularly if we are heading towards a no-deal scenario.  I caution that we should not over-interpret welcome moves from the UK Government in respect of the protocol and the withdrawal agreement, in so far as they have withdrawn the offending clauses of the Internal Market Bill and, I understand, similar clauses that would have ended up in a taxation bill.  That is positive and to be welcomed.  This is a strand of the talks relating to the Border, which is important, and the seamless interaction of people, services and goods on the island of Ireland.  It is to the credit of Commissioner &Scaron;efčovič and, on the British side, Michael Gove and his team of negotiators that they were able to iron out many difficulties regarding the operation of the protocol.</p>  <p>  The situation in respect of the future trading relationship is much more difficult and will be hard to resolve.  It should be resolved in the interests of all the citizens of Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland.  We will all lose if there is no deal.  The absence of a deal would bring unacceptable disruption to ordinary people, workers and businesses.  I have said this to all who would listen to me, including European negotiators, who are anxious to avoid a no-deal scenario, and the UK Prime Minister, when I have spoken to him.  He knows my view that common sense should prevail.  It is in everybody's interests that we avoid a no-deal situation and get a deal that facilitates workers and gives clarity and certainty to businesses.</p>  <p>  On medicines, I have checked with the Department of Health, which is not sounding any alarm bells as yet regarding access to and procurement of medicines, particularly in the first six months after Brexit.  There will be disruption on some scale, even if we achieve a trading deal, because of the fact that Britain is outside of the customs union and the Single Market.  Being outside the customs union means a lot of checking and documentation.</p></speech>

Furthermore, there is ongoing engagement on Covid-19 between the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Robin Swann; between the Chief Medical Officers, North and South; and between the two health services.  I have discussed Covid with the First Minister and deputy First Minister by phone and by videoconference on a number of occasions, including Friday, 16 October; Monday, 15 October, and Thursday, 24 September.  I have spoken by phone separately with the First Minister on two occasions, 7 November and 8 October.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement at official level on a wide range of matters, including Covid.  There has been particularly close contact between Irish and Northern Ireland officials in recent weeks in the context of respective restrictions and other measures as a consequence of Covid.  While we each have our own medical and scientific advisers and decision-making processes, there is good co-ordination between us.  I am pleased to note that there is a high level of commonality in our current overall approach, including in respect of the ongoing public health advice and to the lifting of restrictions as we approach the Christmas period.</p></reply>

I raise this issue, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has, in order to look at a couple of areas.  The end of a period of restrictions is, supposedly, approaching in Northern Ireland and most of us in this jurisdiction have been enjoying in the past week or so being back at level 3 restrictions.  We hope to stay there or go down to level 2 or 1 in due course.  It should be noted that the restrictions are still sterner and the impact of the virus is much more worrying in Northern Ireland.  We see reports of capacity issues at a number of Northern Irish hospitals.  Of particular concern is the situation at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which services much of Donegal as well.</p><p>Looking at the co-ordination between the Taoiseach and the First Minister and deputy First Minister, we need not only to discuss restrictions and the potential lifting of them but also the co-ordination needed in that regard.  Two weeks ago, I raised with the T&aacute;naiste my serious concerns regarding the issue of bus tours being organised by Northern Irish companies to bring shoppers down to the Republic, be it to somewhere like Dundrum Town Centre in my constituency or to the city centre.  Those were flagrant breaches of the restrictions and, when the matter was taken up with the operator, there was a sheer lack of understanding that crossing any county boundary should even be considered.</p><p>I raise the serious issue of co-ordination of the vaccine roll-out.  Every one of us was cheered by the scenes in Coventry, featuring a Fermanagh native, and in Belfast, when individuals were given the first vaccines.  We look forward to seeing that coming into the Republic.  We need to be aware that many people, going through the strands of priority that the Government has laid out for vaccines, may be working in the Republic and living in the North or <i>vice versa</i>, be they in an at-risk group or not.  There is much more co-ordination to be done.  I hope the Taoiseach will continue his conversations with the First Minister and deputy First Minister throughout this important period.</p></speech>

There is an interesting all-Ireland dimension to the hypocrisy around treatment of our front-line workers, such as student nurses and midwives.  The following is from an elected representative on this island:</p> <blockquote> 	It&rsquo;s only fair and right that our student nurses are properly recognised and recompensed for the service to our communities during this pandemic.  Right across the city we have Covid patients being tended to by NHS staff and their student nurse colleagues.  The Health Minister must recognise their efforts at the most challenging of times with fair and proper wages. </blockquote>  <p>That is a quote from a Green Party councillor, who would have voted in the election for the Greens to enter Government down here and in the party's leadership election.  That is stunning hypocrisy.  A party with which the Taoiseach is allied marched into the D&aacute;il last week and voted against paying student nurses and midwives; the same party, in the North, is calling for their payment and saying it is due recognition for the work they have done on the Covid front line.  What does the Taoiseach think about that?  Even people who are aligned to the Government call for the payment of student nurses and midwives in the North.  Yet the Taoiseach comes out with lame, dishonest and unacceptable excuses for doing the exact opposite down here and covering over the disgraceful decision not to pay student nurses and midwives.  We will rebut these excuses one by one in the next question in this session.</p></speech>

There needs to be the tightest possible contact between the Northern Executive and the Government.  That will be critical in the roll-out of the vaccine, particularly in Border counties.  I welcome the level of co-ordination that the Taoiseach has stated remains in place between him and the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  We need to see how the vaccine will be rolled out.  We must also ensure that there are proper staffing levels and proper consultation with GPs so that, when the vaccine is ready, we are prepared to roll it out.</p></speech>

To Deputy Richmond, the first overall point I will make is that we have made every effort to try to align our positions, North and South, on Covid-19.  Early on, there was the memorandum of understanding between the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, in the Republic and the CMO of Northern Ireland.  There have been sensitivities and differences of opinion within the North and the Northern Ireland Executive.  In advance of some of the restrictions that were introduced, we could see transparently those sensitivities playing out as well as the difficulties and challenges in terms of getting agreement in the multi-party Executive.  It is an Executive that is made up of quite a number of parties.  That has proved challenging.</p><p>We have engaged and we have made suggestions from the summer onwards.  Unfortunately, there have been periods when our period of severe restrictions under level 5 did not align with Northern Ireland, which was at a lesser level, and when we emerged from level 5, Northern Ireland went to a more severe level.  That said, I draw some comfort from the fact that numbers have been going down in both jurisdictions, although I think they are still relatively high in the North, worryingly so.  We are coming out of level 5 in the Republic at a level that we must be careful about because it is far higher than when we eased restrictions in the summertime.  There is a real need for vigilance in terms of stopping the spread of the virus.</p><p>In the Border counties, there is an ongoing need for co-ordination on a range of fronts such as those the Deputy has suggested in terms of shopping trips down.  For example, in the Republic right now, there is a restriction on going outside one's county.  That applies to all of our Border counties.  It should be enforced and will have to be monitored.  Likewise, Northern Ireland should monitor its regulations and enforce them as well so that we have the minimum risk to the general public in terms of the spread of the virus.</p><p>Regarding co-ordination on the vaccine, people living in the Republic but working in the health service in Northern Ireland will get the vaccine in Northern Ireland.  We look forward to ongoing co-operation on the island of Ireland in terms of the roll-out of the vaccine.  Both jurisdictions have similar prioritisations in terms of the groups that will get the vaccine first.  In my view, that is the way it should be.  I think there will be close co-ordination and co-operation from the respective CMOs and, indeed, public health specialists of both sides.  Regarding hospitals, in case there are requirements for us to provide support or <i>vice versa</i>where a particular hospital is over capacity or there are pressures on a hospital at a given time because of the level of ICU or bed occupancy by Covid patients, particularly over the Christmas period and into January, we are mindful of that situation and will monitor it very carefully.</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett raised an issue - he described my presentation as &quot;lame, dishonest and unacceptable&quot; - with the normal high-pitched melodrama.  I have to say in response that we are committed to student nurses.  The countermotion last week from the Government facilitated the payment of the pandemic unemployment payment to student nurses, who cannot work part time.  Fourth year nursing students are paid - I think the Deputy will acknowledge that - as part of the 36-week placement.  First year students, second year students and third year students are on clinical placements.  I do not believe they should be working during their clinical placements because those clinical placements are meant to be protected under the nursing degree programme by the hospitals.  People are being paid by the HSE to be in the hospitals with the express purpose of protecting the learning environment and protecting the degree programme for the students.  There should be no exploitation of students in that regard and none should be tolerated.  I mean that.</p><p>I have spoken to the heads of a number of colleges and to the Chief Nursing Officer, who are concerned that we are now moving back to an apprenticeship model.  What the Deputy seems to be advocating, whether he means it or not, is to go back to the apprenticeship model, which would be a retrograde step and an undermining of nursing ultimately.  The whole idea of moving to the degree programme was to modernise, transform and professionalise nursing education and to give students the opportunity to go to third level to study a nursing degree programme like other students in medicine, pharmacology, physiotherapy or occupational therapy.  Why should student nurses be any different?  Why should they not have been in a position a long time ago to participate in a degree programme?  That was the whole motivation behind the degree programme.  It seems to me that that model is now being challenged.  I am open to debate on that and I believe there should be a more fundamental review of the degree programme now in light of this debate.  We should make up our minds once again about what we actually want for the future of nursing as a key part of our healthcare service.  The whole idea was to advance nursing in the hospital hierarchy.  In pay claims and so on, the advancement of the nursing degree was often used as a rationale.</p><p>This is a very core issue.  I was involved in bringing in the nursing degree programme - I know what I am talking about.  Heads of colleges have received stories of people being exploited or allegations of exploitation.  That should not occur.  The HSE is saying that that is not happening.  We need to verify that.  I do not think that any first year student on a clinical placement for six weeks should be treating a Covid patient.  I do not think anyone in this House would suggest that should be the case.  It should not be the case.  The student should be there to learn.</p></speech>

In my view, we need to deal with that core issue.  I have said to the Minister and others that there should now be an overarching review of nursing education in general.  Australia, which often gets mentioned, has the two models running in parallel - a nursing degree model where the students do not get paid and an apprenticeship model.  That is my understanding.  They are two different models entirely.</p>  <p>  It is far too simplistic to come forward with a Private Members' motion and say "They are all against us" or "They are all for us" because they voted for a motion.  A motion achieves nothing in terms of public service pay.  It achieves nothing in terms of a degree programme.  It is about political manoeuvring.  That is what it is about in essence.  The Deputy knows that as well I as know that.</p></speech>

Part of that is the suggestion they are not really doing work.  I will outline a few examples from a student midwife:</p> <blockquote> 	I've dressed and laid out babies who have passed away to be shown to their parents for the first time.  I've cried with women who have been told that their baby has died while they are alone in hospitals with the current restrictions.  I have taken a caseload of 12 women and babies recently to cover for staff who are out sick without having time to use the bathroom, and only half an hour break. </blockquote>  <p>I could go on.  When those student nurses listened to the radio this morning and heard the Government had agreed a pay increase, it rubbed salt in their wound because the pay increase agreed by the Government is not for them.  The Taoiseach is going to continue to refuse them.  Instead, it is for the judges.  Across the board, therefore, there are pay increases for the judges of 2%.  For Supreme Court judges, which includes Mr. Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe, that is worth &euro;4,000 per year.  It is quite a substantial Christmas present for them and a lump of coal for student nurses.</p><p>We are talking about a small group of approximately 4,000 student nurses helping to keep our health service running during this crisis.  We can afford to pay them a living wage but refuse to do that.  Even the fourth-year students are on less than the minimum at wage, a fact the Taoiseach does not talk about.  He must backtrack now.  He should agree to pay them.</p></speech>

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has also called on the Government to ratify the International Labour Organisation, ILO, convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work.</p>  <p>  Article 18 of the accompanying recommendation details measures Governments should take to mitigate the impacts of domestic violence at work, which includes leave for the victims of domestic violence, flexible work arrangements and the inclusion of domestic violence in workplace risk assessments.  ICTU has also called on employers to work with trade unions to develop workplace policies to ensure appropriate supports are in place. </p>  <p>  We know the emotional and psychological cost of domestic and gender-based violence is devastating.  There is, however, also a significant economic cost, which includes the cost of services such as health and justice as well as lost productivity and absenteeism.</p>  <p>  There is also a need to mainstream workplace awareness of domestic violence.  Managers need guidance on how to recognise the signs of domestic abuse and how to respond to a staff member's disclosure.  Workplace policies can assist co-workers to support their colleagues, and most critically, work can provide a safe and supportive environment for victims of abuse.</p>  <p>  Will the Government parties support Sinn F&eacute;in's domestic violence paid leave legislation to Committee Stage?  What consideration has the Taoiseach given to the ILO convention No. 190?  Will the Taoiseach come back regarding the review of the programme for Government and whether that will be published in the new year?  I missed that.</p></speech>

It was, therefore, their words, not ours.  When the Taoiseach insults the motion they effectively wrote, he is insulting them.  He is also insulting their intelligence when he plays politics because the following are his words to me on 20 October in terms of:</p> <blockquote> 	... student nurses working on the wards in the current context.  As they were earlier, they should be paid in accordance with the agreement arrived at earlier in the year.  I will follow up on that. </blockquote>  <p>That was just six weeks ago.  As for the nonsense that their education is being protected, Melissa said:</p> <blockquote> 	Seeing as I am regularly moved away from my preceptor to another nurse in a different section of the ward because the second nurse in that section has called in sick, do you think my education is the priority in that decision?  Do you think I am doing real work? </blockquote>  <p>That is directly to the Taoiseach.  R&oacute;is&iacute;n has worked four nights in a row on a ward so understaffed she had a patient load of seven and there was no shadowing or supervision.  When one of the seven patients became aggressive towards her with their dinner knife, she was told it was &quot;her responsibility to call security and the doctor as they were her patient&quot;.  Will the Taoiseach admit that this is work and commit to paying her for this work?  I could go on.  He is invited to the next meeting with those student nurses if he wants to talk directly to them.</p></speech>

This morning, he said that he does not believe they should be working, or perhaps, it is the other way around.  He has, however, said they should be paid if they are working and he does not believe they should be working.  He must verify it.  I am shocked that he has not verified it because the HSE is telling him that is not the case.  He has not, however, verified it; we have.</p>  <p>  We have spoken to hundreds of people like Zara, a second-year student nurse who does a 13-hour shift with a one-hour break.  She does everything from emptying bedpans to washing patients, taking their vitals to comforting them.</p>  <p>  Linda is second-year student on placement.  Her preceptor was a ward manager, which meant that as ward manager, her preceptor was in meetings all day.  She was left unsupervised.  She started at 7.30 a.m. and finished at 8.30 p.m..  She washed and recorded observation of ten patients daily.  I call that work.  I do not know what the Taoiseach calls it but I call that physical, stressful, vital and important work.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach seems to be taking this debate about their education out of the context of a severe shortage of staffing in our hospitals in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis.  The Covid-19 crisis has not gone away.  The hospitals are short-staffed.  In fact, in Linda's case, they were told later that one of the nurses had rung in sick and the response of the ward manager was to say they were not going to get cover because they had a student nurse.  That is what is going on.  Will the Taoiseach verify that, please? </p></speech>

It is an even different perspective on it, which will give the Taoiseach a new opportunity to do what is right.  We all know what is right.  The Taoiseach, however, will have an opportunity again next week.</p>  <p>  With regard to the programme for Government, basically, a range of different deadlines have been missed.  I particularly want to ask the Taoiseach about three different ones.  Can we get some detail on where we are as regards the retrofitting of homes?  We all know the climate change Bill is being delayed with regard to climate change targets, many of which have been missed despite the Green Party being in government.</p>  <p>  Where is the Government at on the promise to prioritise early diagnosis interventions for those with disabilities?  I have raised this issue numerous times previously.  Where is the Government at on commitments to look at non-statutory sick pay?</p></speech>

Clearly, a retail jobs massacre is under way in this country.  I believe that the Government should intervene to save jobs.  If it does not, Mandate, the shop workers' union, needs to consider a one-day national strike to put pressure on the Government on this issue.</p>  <p>  There is also a broader issue in society.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, where we heard from representatives of banking workers that 6,000 jobs in the banking sector are potentially on the line.  There should be, and could be, a debate and a discussion in the trade union movement in this country at Irish Congress of Trade Unions level about a one-day national strike of all workers to put pressure on the Government on the issues of jobs and workers' rights.</p>  <p>  There is also the question of decent redundancy.  There must be no more workers cheated out of their redundancy rights in the way that there has been an attempt to so do with the Debenhams workers.  The programme for Government states that it will aim to improve workers' rights in respect of liquidations.  The Taoiseach gave me an update on that recently but there is fresh urgency with the latest round of redundancies and I am looking for an update on the position.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable in any shape or form.  Particularly the case that Deputy Murphy spoke about, which presumably was in the maternity wards, should not happen.

If we allow that to happen, we will undermine the whole basis of the degree programme - that is the point.  We should not allow lazy or wrong practices by those who are meant to supervise and be in charge in our hospitals.

The Act was commenced on 31 October 2019 and the fund was subsequently seeded with a &euro;1.5 billion transfer from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on 15 November 2019.  I am seeking the D&aacute;il's endorsement for a motion not to transfer the &euro;500 million contribution for 2020 into the national surplus reserve fund.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that, under section 5(2) of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019, the Minister for Finance is required to make a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;500 million to the rainy day fund every year from 2019 to 2023.  The Act also provides, under section 6, that in any given year, the Minister for Finance may make a proposal to the D&aacute;il not to transfer that contribution into the fund.  This proposal can be made that the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that by reason of the existence of exceptional circumstances the making of the payment of the prescribed amount into the fund would place an undue burden on our public finances.</p><p>This year, we have indeed seen challenges to the State that are unprecedented in their nature.  We have met those challenges with great determination, with resolve and with the use of more resources than ever before in our history.  This has been made possible as a result of the careful management of our public finances over recent years which saw our economy grow during that period.  It is also important to acknowledge that our preparedness for these more challenging times was also made possible through the support and solidarity of the European Union, particularly the leadership and work of the European Central Bank, and most importantly, through the hard work, dedication and resilience of the Irish people.</p><p>Following approval by Cabinet on Tuesday, 23 November, that I, as Minister, would not transfer &euro;500 million into the rainy day fund in 2020, I am proposing this motion.  I am satisfied that by reason of the exceptional circumstances posed by the pandemic and the needed public expenditure undertaken to remedy and mitigate the impact of this virus on our society, the making of the payment of the prescribed amount would place an undue burden on our public finances.  The unforeseen impact of this disease has had a major impact on the level of public expenditure in areas such as employment supports, social welfare and public health.  The Government has been able to respond swiftly and assertively during 2020.  We were able to do this because we had the financial resources and the creditworthiness resulting from the budget strategy proposed and pursued over a number of recent budgets.</p><p>As a result of last year's budget, we entered 2020 with a surplus of &euro;1.3 billion.  Entering the year with a budgetary surplus also reaffirmed our reputation with the international bond markets as we needed to borrow further to deal with the employment and economic impacts of the pandemic.  To date, the total value of support measures amounts to over &euro;25 billion, mostly in the form of direct taxation and expenditure measures.  Indirect measures such as credit guarantees have also formed part of the policies that we have used.  Given the continuing presence of the pandemic and the economic disruption it continues to cause, the Government is committed to maintaining these supports for as long as they are required.</p> <p> Accordingly, budget 2021 provided further stabilisation measures amounting to just under &euro;12.5 billion.  The measures can be seen working throughout the economy in supporting employment and businesses through the crisis.  The &euro;25 billion mentioned is in the order of eight times' last year's budgetary plans.  We have never experienced a challenge like this in modern times.  Equally, Ireland has never delivered such a strong response to a challenge.  The scale of budgetary support in 2020 has been unprecedented and is among the highest in the EU and OECD.</p> <p> Given the likely impact of Covid-19 on our public finances, it was clear from earlier this year that the making of the planned &euro;500 million annual contribution was unlikely.  This was signalled in the April 2020 stability programme update.  This motion follows closely on the Cabinet decision on Tuesday, 6 October and the subsequent budget motion to withdraw the full &euro;1.5 billion value of the fund to remedy and mitigate the occurrence of the exceptional circumstances for the State arising from Covid-19, in accordance with section 9 of the 2019 Act.</p> <p> I want to reflect on the rationale for establishing the fund.  The effects of the economic and financial crisis that began in 2008 were gruelling.  Although we have made significant progress, there is no doubt at all that those effects are still felt today.  The rainy day fund which the previous Government committed to creating in A Programme for a Partnership Government was an important plank of the policies that put our national finances on a sound and sustainable footing and built our resilience to external shocks.  The rainy day fund was an economic buffer and support available for drawdown in the event of a sharp economic downturn.  It allows the Government to mitigate the effects of the downturn we are experiencing at this time.  In particular, it will allow investment by the Government to continue even if there is a sharp reduction in tax receipts.</p> <p> We have experience of the great financial crisis of 2008 where, because we had no available resources, current expenditure was cut back severely and capital programmes came to a near complete halt as a consequence of that crisis.  The result was severe in terms of the impact on Government programmes for many of our citizens and in terms of underinvestment.  Our aim in establishing the rainy day fund was that, in the event of a future economic or budgetary shock, we could maintain our investment programmes, particularly our capital investment programme.  The latter delivers the infrastructure that is required by society and the economy.  Maintaining capital expenditure is also likely to support employment and help us to escape the recessionary cycle caused by sudden economic shocks.  Expenditure on core capital programmes is to increase by &euro;1.6 billion next year to &euro;10.1 billion.  This is the largest amount that has ever been allocated to investment in schools, homes and public transport.  It is exactly the type of increased investment and expenditure that we were not in a position to make a decade ago.</p> <p> The rationale behind establishing this fund, which enjoyed broad support across the political system, was to accumulate funding that could be deployed in the event of an adverse shock to the economy.  That decision has been proven correct and we have seen the value of the fund.  No one knew that the time of the fund's use would come so quickly.  Nobody imagined the circumstances in which it would be deployed.  The Government continues the work started under the two previous Governments to put in place policies to protect our public finances while continuing to invest in the infrastructure and services that are so important to our people.  This approach helped to achieve a balanced budget and sustainable tax base before the advent of the pandemic.  All of those steps put us in a much-improved position to plan for the medium and longer term.</p> <p> I will conclude by reflecting on the decision to draw down the fund.  From earlier this year, given the impact of the pandemic on the economy, I considered that the requirements of the fund had been met and that it was appropriate to draw down those resources.  Due to a number of successful debt issuances by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, earlier in the year, there was no immediate need for drawdown of the fund during the early months of the pandemic.  Under the European system of accounts, the funds drawdown will not be counted as general government revenue and it will not improve the general government balance.  Equally, when the money was transferred into the rainy day fund, it did not count as general government expenditure.  The drawdown receipt by the Exchequer was used to offset funding requirements arising from budget 2021 and the need to support the increase in Covid-related expenditure.  It was important that the fund was in existence to provide support for this expenditure.  Similar to returns to the Exchequer from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, using the rainy day fund meant the State has been able to provide for additional and much-needed support during this time without having to borrow more, thereby reducing the burden of repayment or refinancing costs on future generations.</p> <p> The motion, which proposes not to pay the annual &euro;500 million contribution to the rainy day fund is, of course, not preferable, but it is necessary.  It is the right decision in order that Exchequer funds are available when they are most needed to respond to the crisis with which we are dealing.  I want to be in a position again to build up resources in the fund to deal with potential future economic shocks, but doing so during the course of this unprecedented pandemic-driven economic crisis is not sensible.  The issue of resourcing the fund will be a matter for Government to decide in the future, when it is appropriate.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

Tuigimid ar fad gur in amanta&iacute; eisceacht&uacute;la a t&aacute;imid mar gheall ar an bpaind&eacute;im.  Bh&iacute; dea-sc&eacute;al mar gheall ar an bpaind&eacute;im inniu le daoine ag f&aacute;il an vacsa&iacute;n don ch&eacute;ad uair.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn ar fad go gciall&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin go mbeidh deireadh ag am &eacute;igin leis an bpaind&eacute;im seo.</p>  <p>  This motion authorises the Minister for Finance, in accordance with section 6(1) of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019, not to pay the prescribed amount of &euro;500 million into the national surplus reserve fund for 2020.  This relates to the much-vaunted rainy day fund that was established by Fine Gael to burnish its image as a prudent manager of the public finances.  It was also championed by Fianna F&aacute;il in an attempt to restore trust in its ability to manage the public finances after it torpedoed the economy a decade ago.  Despite being established in June 2019, three years after it was promised in the programme for Government, it still has not got off the ground and no money has been transferred from the Exchequer to the fund since it was established.  Indeed, this same motion was brought before the D&aacute;il on 17 December last year.</p>  <p>  The only resource that has been transferred to the fund is the &euro;1.5 billion, as the Minister indicated, that was transferred from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  This was a case of simply reshuffling resources from one account into another.  That &euro;1.5 billion has since been drawn down in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which was the right thing to do.  The motion before us proposing not to transfer &euro;500 million to the national surplus reserve fund is also the right thing to do.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion.</p> <p>Over the past year, the Covid crisis has brought unprecedented challenges to our health service, to our economy, as well as to the jobs and incomes of our people.  It hardly goes without saying that 2020 will go down as an exceptional year in the history books.  Not since the Spanish flu has the world been gripped by a global pandemic of this kind.  It is only right and proper that the State brings all financial resources to bear as we combat this virus, attempt to regrow the economy, assist those who have been left without work since March, along with those businesses struggling as a result of this pandemic.</p> <p> Today we glimpsed the light at the end of the tunnel with the roll-out of the vaccine in the North.  It is a day of great hope and relief to see vaccines being rolled out.  Today, Irishwoman Margaret Keenan, a grandmother of 90 years who lives in Coventry, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 jab following its clinical approval.  I certainly am looking forward to the opportunity to take the vaccine and to return to normal life, hopefully, as soon as possible.  I hope we see the timely, efficient and equitable roll-out of the vaccines with appropriate staffing levels in the centres for dispersing them.  I also hope these centres will be accessible for both rural and urban dwellers alike.  We must continue, however, to put resources into contact tracing if problems were to arise.  It is important we ensure all information about the vaccine is conveyed to the public in as a clear, concise and comprehensive way as possible.</p> <p> Since the beginning of this crisis, Sinn F&eacute;in has said the Government must act fast and do whatever it takes to save lives, protect incomes and support our economy.  Only by taking radical action can any long-term damage to our economy be avoided.  Sinn F&eacute;in took issue with the provisions of the legislation which established the national surplus reserve fund.  Section 9 of the legislation allowed for the fund to be used to transfer Exchequer resources to the banking sector, a provision we opposed at the time.  We submitted amendments to ensure the fund would be invested in infrastructure, housing and capital infrastructure in our health service.  Those amendments were rejected at the time.</p> <p> The Minister referred to the importance of capital investment in these times.  Today, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, referred to the importance of capital investment in order for us to build our way out of this crisis.  This crisis has really laid bare the weaknesses in our health system, our childcare sector and our social safety net.  The best response to crisis is a preventive response, ensuring resilience in order that our economy and society are well placed to respond to challenges when they arise.  For Sinn F&eacute;in, our resilience is undermined by the deficiency in our health service and the serious failures of our housing system.  These failures have been exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19.  These challenges must be addressed to enhance the resilience of economy and society, ach, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; ag an t&uacute;s, t&aacute;imid chun tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n seo.  Tuigimid go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh aon airgead at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don St&aacute;t in &uacute;s&aacute;id chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an bpaind&eacute;im seo agus chun cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh taca&iacute;ocht ag gn&oacute;lachta&iacute; agus ag daoine ar fud fad na t&iacute;re.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800026#Z00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Last year, the Government took the opportunity not to pay &euro;500 million into the rainy day fund due to the threat we faced of a no-trade deal Brexit.  We are conscious that this threat is still with us.  To a degree that partly informs the Minister's consideration of the approach that we are taking with the rainy day fund this year and the motion before us.</p>  <p>  My party's concerns over the concept of the fund, how and why it was established and the fact that seed funding for it was obtained from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, at a time when, in our view, that funding might have been better deployed in investment in public housing and public infrastructure, have been well rehearsed.  The Minister will recall those points being made by our then finance spokesperson, Joan Burton, when the enabling legislation was brought to the House several years ago.  We shared the concerns expressed by Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues opposite about the potential for moneys in the rainy day fund being allocated to the banking sector in the context of any difficulties that may arise on that front.</p>  <p>  Nobody could have predicted that the world would stop turning in 2020 as a result of a global pandemic.  Nobody could have foreseen the scale and the nature of the international response with the massive investment of borrowed, cheap money to keep businesses alive, services open and people out of penury, as well as to keep people safe.  Everything has changed.  The debates which took place here just a year ago may as well have taken place 20 years ago, such is the immense scale of change and uncertainty over the past ten months.</p>  <p>  Today at the budgetary oversight committee, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council welcomed the fact that some of the economic strain of Covid-19 will be taken up by contingency and recovery funds.  The council is concerned, as am I, that up to &euro;8.5 billion of Covid spending, if one includes non-Exchequer funding this year, may end up in the base to be repeated year on year with no indication as to how the Government plans to foot the bill.  Additional spending on health, for example, is required because the pandemic has certainly exposed and indeed exacerbated some of the existing deficiencies in our public health system.  Sl&aacute;intecare will also need to be paid for.</p>  <p>  It is all well and good speaking of rainy day funds.  However, when those who are charged with critiquing fiscal policy express their alarm at the transparency in government spending and how we pay for the kinds of services most of us in this House want to see evolve in the coming years, we should all take note.  The over-reliance on volatile corporation tax receipts is extremely problematic.  The Government needs to plan for how we meet this challenge on how we diversify our tax base.</p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council reminded the budgetary oversight committee this morning that the programme for Government commits to service improvements, while, at the same time, ruling out any changes to income taxes.  That is a third of the total tax system, in terms of value, ruled out of financing our recovery and development in the coming years.  We know economic growth will do some of the heavy lifting but not enough to deliver even on the existing service delivery commitments in health, education and so on that the Government has agreed, let alone any future commitments that might arise over the next couple of years.</p>  <p>  A grown-up conversation needs to be had on tax and PRSI.  Even organisations like IBEC, the primary representative of employers and business, is up for that debate.  This is a debate, however, that the Government is incapable of having and certainly unwilling to have.  Refusal to take this on, along with the question of designing effective wealth and asset taxes, will come back to haunt this country.  It will also lead to questions over the sustainability of the Government's own plans for economic management and social investment going forward.</p></speech>

It is appropriate and I fully support the concept that the rainy day fund should be used this year to deal with the significant crisis created by Covid.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Economic stabilisation is really important.  However, while we are focused now on the urgency of dealing with Covid, we must also create space for embarking on what is a phase of truly transformative change that will happen in Ireland over the next ten years.  In that time, we are going to have to halve our greenhouse gas emissions, which will involve truly massive changes in the way we live.  We will have to accommodate the ageing of our population, which will result in the number of workers per retired person go from 2.5 to fewer than 1.5, on its way down to well below one in the years after that.  Our cities outside of Dublin will have to grow at twice the rate of Dublin.  We are going to have to cope with Brexit, Covid, and digital change.  This is massive infrastructural change on a scale we have not seen.  There will be massive policy change and massive behavioural change.  This requires that we now prepare to be able to undertake this change on an unprecedented scale.  We have an opportunity with the review of the &euro;120 billion national development plan, the new national economic plan and the &euro;5 billion contingency the Government has set aside over the coming 12 months.  We must use this opportunity now to design new policy tools that are adequate for the scale of the challenge we are embarking upon.  At the end of this decade, we must have a resilient enterprise sector and a resilient public service that can meet much higher expectations in the midst of this massive change.  We must enjoy a higher standard of living for our people, having made the change.</p> <p> What will be at a premium is our capacity to adapt very rapidly in policy terms.  We need to speed up if we are to achieve this.  We have seen many cases where needed change has been delayed unnecessarily.  We have not always been able to seize the early mover advantage.  We have done so in many key enterprise sectors but not generally in some of the more traditional sectors and in the public service itself.</p> <p> We have to deliver a number of critical factors now if we are going to be able to undertake change in a much more rapid manner.  There is the issue of legitimacy and at the heart of the next decade of transformation, we need a new social contract.  It has been articulated in the programme for Government and it must be given new life.  The type of threats people will encounter during this period of rapid transformation will be very different.  Ageing throws up particular difficulties.  Dealing with greenhouse gas and changing behaviour throw up particular difficulties and they will focus on particular communities.  The concept of consultation will have to be strengthened.  Our planning process gets bogged down in endless delays, even for infrastructure that is recognised as very needed.  We have to find a way of breaking the logjam that has become a feature of our system.  Some of the elements are there.  Our success with the Citizens' Assembly in climate and many other areas shows us the way.  Climate dialogue shows us the way.  We need to move to a planning system that can embrace more negotiated portfolios of developments for our cities, sectors and land use throughout our community so there are community gains that can easily give capacity to deliver big projects.  Our present system is far too adversarial and we need to think about how this will be changed.</p> <p> We also need new capacity in the public service to deliver at scale and at pace.  This is something we have found difficult to do, most notably in areas such as housing and health.  We are beginning to see the seeds of the new approach.  The Land Development Agency is a new groundbreaking approach, whereby the State will take the role of shaping the nature of development in our country.  The national broadband plan points a new way to how public and private can co-operate to scale ambitious objectives and deliver them in a timely way.  There are other large capital projects for which we must now mobilise.  For example, the State needs to lead the way in offshore renewable energy and commit now to building a platform for this, which we have not yet done.  We must undertake to have the capacity to do land use planning in a more strategic and long-term way than we have done in the past.</p> <p> I am disappointed that the preventative unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been wound down.  Never has it been more important that we start to think about long-term preventative policies.  The closing down of the unit is a mistake.  We need to invest massively in leadership at every level in the private sector and, most particularly, in the public sector, building the capacity to lead, and have honest conversations about what we are trying to achieve and how to bring about improvement.  This is something we have not been good at and we need to make the time available for it.</p> <p> We need boldness in action to match the boldness of the ambition we are undertaking in terms of transformative change.  Shakespeare described Macbeth as being not without ambition but without the illness that should attend it.  We have a problem in that we are very strong on ambition in this country but without some of the capacity to undertake the changes that are necessary to deliver it.</p> <p> Another area where we need to plan for massive change is regulatory infrastructure.  There will be significant changes in the expectations of the financial system as it starts to invest in long-term green technologies.  This needs to be built into the regulatory environment.  Our managing of data and how they are used needs a new regulatory infrastructure.  Our capacity to protect citizens at this time of difficult transition needs strengthening.</p> <p> The Minister is handling in an extraordinarily competent way the challenges we are facing.  Ireland has been fortunate to have had the steady hand we have seen at the tiller in the Department of Finance.  Now the challenge is to plan, and to find the space to do the planning for the long-term future in this period of transformative change.  Space has to be created in the public service to do this long-term planning in a way I do not think we are now equipped to do.  These are changes in the way we manage assets in this country, the way invest in them at scale, the way we mobilise private investment and the way we regulate and deliver the sort of community we want to build.  These need considerable thought, time and effort in our public service.  People are working hugely and urgently to deliver in the short term and we need to find space to do important thinking for the future.  I would like structures to be put in place that can allow this thinking and make sure we are ahead of many of these challenges that are coming on us at a very fast pace.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this important matter.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the establishment of the rainy day fund because we believe that when the country is in the middle of a housing crisis with a healthcare service on its knees, schools crying out for funding, people scared to leave their homes because of a lack of garda&iacute; and roads that are not safe, we do not need to put money away for a rainy day because we are in the middle of a rainy day.  We need to invest in housing, healthcare, schools, garda&iacute;, childcare and roads.</p>  <p>  Ever since the rainy day fund was established, the Government has proved it is simply only good optics.  No money has been transferred from the Exchequer into the fund.  This is because even Fine Gael knows money is better spent elsewhere.  We fundamentally disagree on where the money should be spent.  While Fine Gael focuses on vulture funds, bankers and big business, I believe we should invest in people and services.  We want to come out the other side of this pandemic and get back on our feet again.  When we do so, we want the establishment of a united Ireland for everyone.  With the launch of Sinn F&eacute;in's document on the economic benefits of a united Ireland, of which I have a copy if anyone would like to read it, we see it is the best way forward for our country.</p> <p>Ending partition and uniting Ireland would open doors and create opportunities for all the people on this island, especially ordinary people.  A united Ireland would be an Ireland for everyone.  That is why I think we should put an end to the optics and to the rainy day funds that mean nothing, and that we cannot put money into anyway.  Let us focus instead on creating a shared Ireland that works for the people.  Instead of dismissing this idea, the Minister should read the document and he will see for himself that there is merit in our arguments, and that the best way forward for this country and this island is unity.</p> <p> I heard Deputy Bruton describe financial matters and how the Minister is doing a great job.  I represent the people of Cork North-Central.  For 20 years, we were promised another hospital.  This was a promise made on medical advice and based on the medical requirements and needs of Cork city, but we still do not have it - we have no hospital on the north side of Cork city.  We have no northern ring road.  We have no infrastructure to bring jobs to Cork North-Central.  We cannot even get traffic calming measures.  We have a huge waiting list with regard to children waiting for assessment of needs.  We are looking for money.  If we are going to have extra money and if we are going to invest, we have to invest in ordinary people to make a difference to their quality of life.  I want to work with the Minister.  I hope the Minister will take this document into consideration.</p></speech>

It simply would not make sense to do otherwise or for the Government to consider transferring a huge amount of money into this fund.  We welcome the clear decision in this regard.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that we are in a situation where unprecedented spending is required.  I support the Government in what it has done to date in regard to the response to Covid, both in terms of the health response but also, of course, the response in respect of providing income support for the many thousands of people who have lost their jobs or have lost hours and work as a result of Covid, and also the substantial funding that has been provided to support the business community in this extremely challenging time.  We support the Government in the action it is taking in regard to this decision and, indeed, the decision last year also not to transfer &euro;500 million on the basis of the challenges faced by the country in the context of Brexit.  Those two decisions are absolutely right.</p>  <p>  The twin challenges that face the country with the unimaginable perfect storm that now exists regarding both Covid and Brexit are certainly unprecedented and pose the most enormous and unbelievable challenges for us.  At this stage, there needs to be a rethink on previous decisions that were taken in respect of this fund and it is good that is happening.  However, the fact that we are discussing this and that, for the second year in a row, the decision has been taken not to support the rainy day fund gives rise to significant questions about the existence of the fund in the first place.</p>  <p>  I would like to raise the question of the decision made by Government to draw down the existing &euro;1.5 billion which was in the fund for the purposes of budget 2021.  On the face of it, it looks as if this is exactly the kind of unexpected occurrence for which the fund was intended.  That is the case, in theory at least, but we need a lot more information regarding how that decision actually stacks up.  The Minister referred to having access to that substantial amount of money and not needing to borrow &euro;1.5 billion as a result of that drawdown.  However, there are other questions in respect of which it would be helpful if we got some more information.  As we know, the NTMA had invested that money and it was getting a return on it, so it would be interesting to hear exactly what that return was.  In the context of a situation where money can now be borrowed very cheaply - at zero interest rates, or to some extent at negative interest rates - it would be very interesting to know whether a cost-benefit analysis was done on that decision.  It would be helpful if, in his wrap-up speech, the Minister provided information as to how that stacks up in the context of what interest was being achieved on the fund, and what could have been done if a decision had been made to leave the fund there and borrow at those very low interest rates.  I would be interested to hear the answers to some of those questions.  That kind of detail was not provided to us at the time the decision was taken.</p>  <p>  Apart from that, this debate raises questions about the rainy day fund itself.  Given the very constrained grounds on which the fund can be spent, does it make sense to put money aside for situations which are unprecedented, although I absolutely accept those unprecedented circumstances have arisen this year?  However, we have to ask would we be better off putting money aside for what is the generally accepted rainy day situation, where unexpected funds coming from corporation taxes are put aside for counter-cyclical measures to be put in place at a time when we have a dip in the economy.  Would it make more sense to put that kind of money aside in the context of an infrastructure fund?  The Minister has not actually said what his intention is for the future of the fund, which would be interesting to hear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800028#BB00300"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of this motion and, indeed, in support of this concept.  For everyone in Ireland, 2020 has been an unprecedented year.  After years of preparing our businesses and the economy for the threat of Brexit, we also faced a new challenge in Covid-19 and the economic ramifications that followed.  These twin threats have had an immense impact on every aspect of all our lives - our businesses, our finances, our mental health and our families.  When the Covid crisis hit Ireland, it became clear that extraordinary actions would be required to protect our citizens.  The Government took the necessary action to shut down large sections of our economy, when necessary, in order to save lives and protect our health service and our front-line workers.  It did so effectively and, as a result, we are now in the position of having one of the lowest - if not the lowest - rates of Covid-19 in Europe.</p>  <p>  While this was the correct decision, it came at a great cost to our economy.  Of course, the main goal of these restrictions is to save lives and protect the health service.  Many thousands lost their jobs or saw their income decline.  Many businesses closed permanently and the damage was felt around the country, with no corner untouched.  GDP fell by 6.7% in the first and second quarters of the year, although this was less severe than the decline seen in the rest of the eurozone, in the UK and in the US.  While these restrictions have saved lives, they have had a serious cost to the economy, so measures have been put in place to limit such damage as much as possible.  We have certainly been supported by our colleagues in the European Union through this crisis but much of the support is down to our own fiscal prudence in recent years.  Indeed, the Government has committed to keeping supports in place for as long as they are required.</p>  <p>  We must remember that the reason we have been able to respond to the pandemic so quickly and without hesitation is because we had the financial resources in place which allowed us to do so.  We started 2020 with a surplus of &euro;1.9 billion and a rainy day fund of &euro;1.5 billion.  The economy was healthy and growing steadily.  There were many challenges but we were able to put the health of our citizens at the forefront of our crisis response.  It was because of this that we did not immediately need to draw down on the rainy day fund during the first months of the pandemic.  When it became clear that more restrictions were required, the decision was made to utilise these funds for budget 2021.  By using these funds, we do not have to borrow more on the market.  Although Ireland has a high credit rating on the market which means we can borrow at an affordable rate, we always have to be cognisant of burdening future generations with excess debt.</p> <p>It is available to us but we should not take advantage of it.</p> <p> As we look towards the end of the Brexit transition period in a number of weeks, although we still do not know whether a deal will be agreed between the EU and the UK, this rainy day fund will become even more important.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, deemed it appropriate to draw down the rainy day fund for budget 2021 to ensure that the needs of people, businesses and the economy can be met.  Budget 2021 has been designed to protect Ireland from the twin burdens of a no-deal Brexit and Covid-19.  It is the largest budget in the history of the State with more than half of spending going on Covid supports to see the economy through this crisis.  A recovery fund worth &euro;3.4 billion was included to allow the Government to react swiftly to the challenges that may arise from Brexit and the continuing challenges of Covid-19.</p> <p> With January fast approaching and many details of Brexit still largely unknown, this fund will be of huge value to businesses, employers and, crucially, the individuals involved therein.  Customs charges, tariffs and fees will possibly be a new reality for all Irish businesses and although the vast majority have prepared for those changes to the best of their abilities, issues will appear over time because it is impossible to be fully prepared for Brexit, particularly when we still do not know the exact form it will take.  However, we are now able to reach these issues as they arise and without hesitation and, in doing so, we were able to support our businesses as best as possible.</p> <p> We have the ability in this country to react to a constantly changing world and ensure that our citizens are not left behind and are supported at each step.  When the rainy day fund was established in October 2019, Covid-19 did not exist and Brexit was still some time off.  Little did we know just how valuable this fund would be to Ireland.  The prudence shown by this Minister has been vitally important.  All those who received the pandemic unemployment payment, Brexit supports or training or who availed of the employment wage subsidy scheme did so with the support of this fund.</p> <p> Although we are not in a position to contribute to the rainy day fund this year, it is because of this fiscal responsibility that we have protected our economy.  When we are past these crises and are in a position to build up the fund, we will once again be able to put our economy in safe hands.  I have to stress that.  I have reacted to comments from some people who say they object to the process of a rainy day fund but in the past few months, we have seen the importance of it.  I fully accept that while we are not in a position nor should we aspire to contribute to the fund at the moment, it is of vital interest to the country that we continue to prepare the next phase of the rainy day fund as soon as possible.  We have seen how important it is to every single individual in this State and how much more important it will be as we move forward.  </p> <p> Fiscal responsibility and careful management to ensure that we always have a life jacket when we need it is always important.  There will always be challenges in an economy in every sector.  There will always be decisions to be made by responsible finance and public expenditure Ministers but at the heart of that must be a commitment to a rainy day fund that provides that protection, that life vest, so to speak, at difficult times when we need it.  We have very much needed it in the past few years and we cannot put any future eventuality or difficulty solely into the hands of the global economy.  The markets are favourable now but they may not be in the future.  We have continuing European solidarity but Covid-19 has hit all of Europe and those resources might not be available if something as drastic as a pandemic, albeit one like this has not been seen in a century, occurs.  We never know what the next challenge will be and ensuring that we have that level of security and decent, common sense is vital.  If we were running a business or a household we would always have a little extra put aside in case a rainy day occurred.  If it is good enough for every household and every decent business in the country, it is the responsibility of any Government to ensure that we can meet any potential difficulties in the future.  In that regard, I implore the Minister to reinvest in a rainy day fund when the opportunity arises.</p></speech>

I have to put it on the record that when this rainy day fund was first announced and we were on the opposite side of the House, we were not in agreement with it because it was more of a rainy day fund for the banks rather than health, infrastructure or housing.  However, it is amazing how matters have changed in less than 12 months.</p>  <p>  I listened to many Deputies who spoke in the debate.  In terms of the Minister's contribution, I commend him on how this time, he has taken on board the issues of all the Irish people.  Towards the end of his contribution, he stated "Similar to returns to the Exchequer from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, using the rainy day fund meant the State has been able to provide for additional and much-needed support during this time without having to borrow more, thereby reducing the burden of repayment or refinancing costs on future generations."  That is an important sentence because we know what happened with the bank bailouts a number of years ago.  It is us, all the people of the island, who are suffering.</p>  <p>  I want to throw around a new idea because this is a worldwide pandemic and we are all in it together.  I am veering slightly from the motion but has anybody ever mentioned a European or a world debt write-down on this because we are all in it together?  We have to acknowledge the fact that this is a great deal of money.  The gross spending for 2020 that was voted on was approximately &euro;70 billion.  As that has now increased to approximately &euro;86.5 billion, there will be much flipping and flopping with the figures on the Minister's side to try to balance those books.</p>  <p>  To get back to the reserve fund, all of us seem to agree on it and are supporting it in the House.  However, I believe the reserve fund needs to be re-examined and tweaked, whether by way of amendments or whatever, to ensure that it will be a specific emergency fund.  We should be putting money into it for when an emergency arises in health, housing or whatever.  There are other ways of being prudent.  Some people might say that the Minister got lucky with the way this fell but I do not believe that is the best way to describe it.</p>  <p>  We welcome the fact that this fund lessens the burden on the people of this country.  We welcome the fact also that we have come to an agreement in the House and shown that things can be done without having to shout across the floor at one another and that we can communicate with one another because all of us were elected here to work for the people we represent.  However, when this pandemic is over, I urge the Minister to look at this rainy day fund again because we have to have two choices.  We must acknowledge that even before this rainy day fund was set up, we had, and still have, emergencies in housing, health and across many other structures, whether it is mental health, infrastructure, jobs or issues with schools.  If we can come into this House and agree on measures now and plan for the future, even on this specific fund, I believe we will be here again saying that we will agree on that.</p></speech>

The way it put it was that hard choices were coming, not immediately but in the medium term.  I think we all know what hard choices means.  Hard choices means austerity or raising taxes.  That means we have to really think about those consequences and decide which way we will address that problem.  The choice the Minister has made for now is to borrow.  As I said, we agree with the decision.  In fact, in terms of the increases in capital and current expenditure, we would have gone further.</p> <p>We did not need Covid as an excuse to do some of the things that we have now had to do, particularly having to increase the capacity of our health service, invest more in housing and so on.  Nonetheless, we agree with the countercyclical, emergency approach to dealing with this crisis.  How do we finance it in the medium to long term?  How do we make those hard choices?  The approach that the Government has taken is borrowing.</p> <p> The alternative that we have argued for and that we have seen put into practice, with a tax that is almost a cut and paste from People Before Profit's pre-budget submissions for the last few years, has now being imposed in Argentina, and not by a radical left Government.  A Covid solidarity wealth tax has been introduced, which is on wealth and assets in excess of &pound;1.8 million sterling, which is quite a high threshold, on the richest 12,000 people in Argentina.  They expect that it will raise 300 billion pesos.  That money will be spent on health, relief for small and medium enterprises, social developments and so on.  There will be slightly higher taxes for people who have wealth and assets kept outside the country.  It is a fairly middle of the road regime adopting a policy that the Government regularly dismisses as being off-the-wall left-wing economics.  That should give the Minister pause for thought.  While the Fiscal Advisory Council does not pronounce on specific measures, when I asked it directly if we need to look at these options and if it is legitimate to look at wealth taxes as a choice to deal with the debt situation that is developing, it said that we need to start to look at these things.</p> <p> I will put it simply.  If one borrows, one is borrowing from people who have much surplus money, with interest.  If one introduces wealth taxes, one takes the surplus money off them.  Which is better value for us, borrowing from very rich people with surplus wealth who make more money from having surplus wealth, or taking it from them with taxes to equalise the distribution of wealth and to fund needed social services, infrastructure and so on?  I put it to the Minister that it is the latter and the decisions that he has had to make here are indicative of a fundamental change away from austerity economics and debt-financed spending towards redistributive wealth taxes.</p></speech>

Although I do not think the Minister needed to have it pointed out, they have also put on the record that we were not necessarily supportive of it previously, in the sense that we saw deficiencies in infrastructure and housing, which are major issues that need to be dealt with.  The fact is that it is a rainy day fund and it would be madness to put money into a rainy day fund at this point when we are in the middle of a flood and need a financial ark.  The supports are all necessary to ensure that we maintain businesses, people and society as we understand it.  Beyond that, we will need to look at stimulus because there will be fallout.  We know the pain that people have had, both individually and collectively, over this period.  We need to ensure, first and foremost, that we get through this gap as healthily as possible and when we are in a safer, better place, following the major roll-out of vaccines, that we can stimulate the economy and ensure that we do not enter into an unnecessary recession.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Government's action plan regarding insurance.  It is fair to say that the insurance sector was impacting negatively on businesses, community organisations and so on long before the pandemic.  I welcome what the Government has said about it.  It is talking about bringing down the costs for consumers and businesses, introducing more competition into the market, preventing fraud and reducing the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations.  Many businesses, voluntary organisations and community centres have been priced out of operating by public liability insurance.  We need all the solutions that are offered and we need to ensure that the Government follows through on everything, whether that is replacing the book of quantum with the new guidelines with appropriate levels of personal injuries awards or enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  There are a number of positive actions to be taken.  The Government will look at the disgrace that is dual-pricing.  This is all necessary.</p>  <p>  We are dealing with this issue at the same time as the pandemic and while we are unsure what Brexit will look like.  It depends on which news cycle one sees.  There have been some positive sounds from the British Government but we do not know exactly what we will deal with.  Even in the best case, we have no certainty about matters such as vaccines being delivered via the landbridge.  We have heard about the difficulties for hauliers with regard to contingency plans in Britain.  We have difficulties here, with the port companies talking about possibly using Dublin Port Tunnel and other infrastructure as parking bays.  We need to see a full audit of all contingencies, accepting that we do not know for certain what will happen, and we need all necessary supports for these three issues.</p></speech>

One can be fiscally responsible and socially responsible at the same time.  It is possible for a country to provide for housing, health, education, transport, communications and the environment and yet be fiscally responsible.  This simply means that key resources are provided consistently and fairly.  It also means that expenditure is carried out in the most efficient and effective way.  If one looks at the history of this State and the history of the parties that expound the most the idea of fiscal responsibility, one is actually looking at the political parties that have crashed the country financially.  Looking at expenditure, the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan are examples of decisions and deliveries which are not fiscally responsible.  They are fiscally irresponsible in a gross fashion in that they went substantially over budget.</p>  <p>  In the 2000s, Fianna F&aacute;il dressed itself up as the party of economic and fiscal expertise, while at the same time it drove the country off an economic cliff.  Fine Gael also dressed itself in the clothes of fiscal responsibility.  However, it continued to bail out the banks even after the EU stated that bail-ins were the logical thing to do.  When the EU said that the Cypriot bank bail-in was the right thing to do, Fine Gael continued to deliver the old system of a bail-out with a significant cost that we are still paying today.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael allowed for significant fiscal exposures to continue too.  We have a substantial dependency on foreign direct investment.  Foreign direct investment is positive and we welcome it, but our country is far too heavily dependent on foreign direct investment and indigenous sectors have never been developed to the extent that they should be.  In most countries, foreign direct investment is considered an interim strategy to get the domestic economy to a level at which one can depend on economic activity being mostly produced by indigenous enterprises.  This Government has also allowed us to become dependent on corporation tax from ten different companies.</p> <p>The chief financial officers, CFOs, of ten individual companies could radically determine whether or not we have a big hole in our budget on an annual basis or policy in the United States could change radically.  We have a big fiscal financial exposure also in that level of Government policy.</p> <p> I will give another example.  In the past number of days, I have learned of the indemnification of the vaccine.  Hopefully, he vaccine will be the key to getting our country back to normality.  It may well be the case that the Government will logically indemnify that process given the massive costs if it does not.  However, nobody knows in this Chamber who is indemnified, how much they are indemnified for and the potential cost to the State.  This particular issue has never been discussed.  It is incredible that the media and political space is consumed on the issue of tweets at the moment, yet what could be hundreds of millions of euro of potential costs to the State has never been discussed properly in this Chamber.</p> <p> Deputies have been kept like mushrooms, in the dark and covered, unfortunately, with manure.</p></speech>

The Government, in fiscal terms, took the wrong decision in the level of stringency it pursued on the lockdown.  This country was the sixth most strictly locked down country on the planet.  Some 96% of all countries on the planet decided to have a less stringent strategy.  This was despite the fact that we had the second lowest level of Covid-19 in Europe.  One will say, correctly, that those two things are dependent upon each other.  We have the second lowest level because of those stringent restrictions.  That would be wonderful had there not been a massive cost in health, finance and society terms.  Very few people are discussing this issue.  Given the history of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, I have no doubt we are heading towards a 2011, 2012, and 2013 situation here.  There is no doubt there will be significant cutbacks in expenditure over the next number of years to achieve balanced budgets and to make some effort at ordering the runaway debt that this country has entered into over the next while.  When one measures that, it does not lead to a view that this Government has been fiscally responsible.</p>  <p>  This is called a rainy day fund.  It is raining on many people already.  Some 56 homeless people have already died in this State this year.  This is much more than last year or the year before because we have not built the homes for them.  Some 844,000 people are on our healthcare waiting lists.  There are 612,000 people on outpatient waiting lists.  We are talking about cancer, heart disease, stroke and mental health.  If the Government is willing to put that money into a rainy day fund and willing to allow that level of ill-health, that means that the Government is actually making a financial statement.  It is saying that it tolerates this level of homelessness and ill-health because it has the money but is going to put it into a rainy day fund.  It is lashing rain on hundreds of thousands of people in this State and we need to ensure that we focus these moneys as soon as we can towards ameliorating their existence.</p></speech>

Some &euro;9 billion is being made available from the European Central Bank, ECB, through the pillar banks as a stimulus to businesses in the economy.  Where is the money going?  The ECB has given this to the Irish banks.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the Irish Government loan guarantee scheme launched in September 2020.  Some &euro;2 billion of this was administered by the pillar banks and it is due to expire in December.  The total amount withdrawn from this is &euro;60 million.  The pillar banks have only given out 3.5%.  The available money that was borrowed at 0% should be used.  There was never a better time to put money into the Irish Infrastructure Fund.  Take a leaf out of Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s book where he purchased aircraft during the biggest slump that ever hit the aviation sector.  Spain has borrowed &euro;890 million to fund a 282 km high-speed train connection, creating 17,000 jobs.  Ireland is lagging behind.</p>  <p>  We are in exceptional circumstances as other Deputies have rightly said and it is raining down on the whole world.  We need to have people who will invest in our infrastructure so that our infrastructure can invest in us.  Covid-19 has shown the lack of amenities in Ireland in broadband services, infrastructure and earlier on today we heard an Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, speaking about bringing people into the towns and villages where there is infrastructure.  We do not have infrastructure in Limerick.  Askeaton is waiting 30 years for a sewage system and Oola is waiting 20 years for one.  The Government is trying to encourage people into towns and villages where there is no infrastructure.  I ask for investment to be made in Limerick and in the future of our country and the country will invest in you.  This comes from a business background.  I am in business all my life and if I do not invest, there is no future for me.  I ask the Government to invest in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Certainly, we cannot invest the &euro;500 million at this time to be used in the rainy day fund.  It is foggy tonight but it is raining every day.  I think the Minister is in the fog and is hiding behind his mask because he has handled this economy appallingly with his Thatcherite policies by allowing the banks to run away and do what they like, like a runaway train.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue has just outlined what they have done.  They are not giving out the money and should not have been given or have got their greasy paws on the funding that we got from the European Central Bank because they have failed the people.  They are fleecing them.  There are evictions and every type of bullying and intimidation being carried on in our systems.  The children&rsquo;s hospital will be some monument to the Government, if it ever gets built.  If the whole Government fitted inside it a time capsule could be put over it and see how it goes.  The national broadband is a fiasco and it is fiasco after fiasco.</p>  <p>  On Minister's pay, it costs over &euro;1 million a year to keep the Minister in his job, between himself and his advisers.  Can he not think or talk for himself without having so many advisers?  I question the whole lot of ye: ye have plundered this country and economy.  The Cabinet yet again today signed off for judges and even for party Whips to get a bigger allowance but it turned down and would not pay the nurses last week.  It clapped for them but would not pay them.  History will not be kind to this Government in the way it has the building houses as if it was building sand castles on the strand at the seaside.  If one builds them there they will at least wash away in the tide but the Government is not even building them to get washed away in whatever kind of rain is going.  If it was raining money the Government would be out with its umbrella turned upside down to see would it send it away.  This is the kind of economics the Government is operating on.  None of ye ever ran a business in your life; they know nothing about running an economy or a business.</p>  <p>  That is the sad part about it but the saddest part of all is that they know it all.  They do not take advice from anybody else; they are superior people.  They clung on to power this time and said that they did not want to be in government but they are back in government to keep Deputy Martin in place just because he wanted his shot at the top job and the T&aacute;naiste then gets back in the next time.  History will not be kind to this Government when one considers all the people who are homeless and are sick on waiting lists.  The way the Government handled the Covid-19 pandemic is nothing short of a disgrace.  It thinks that it has money to fire away for everything.  It will indemnify all the big pharma companies and to hell with anyone who will have an issue with or is injured by a vaccine.  The Government will give them nothing but will look after the big people and to hell with na daoine beaga.  I would say something that may be unnecessary and I will not say it but it starts with a &ldquo;b&rdquo; and ends with &ldquo;l&rdquo;.  That is the way it is.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

The rainy day fund of &euro;1.5 billion was already drawn down for budget 2021.  The initial plan to set aside &euro;1 billion per year has already been reduced down to &euro;500 million per year due to the exceptional circumstances of Brexit.  Now we have the further exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic.  We had to have this motion not to pay the prescribed amount put before us.</p> <p>Many of us in opposition argued at the time that the &euro;1.55 billion and subsequent annual amounts would be better spent on much-needed infrastructure.  We asked for housing, schools and actions to address poverty.  This year, we have seen that the underinvestment in housing has exacerbated the spread of Covid because so many live in cramped and overcrowded accommodation.  We hear about schools thinking about taking more time off over the winter because they do not have proper ventilation systems to keep teachers and students warm and safe.<br/><br/>In January 2019, during the Second Stage debate on the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act, Fianna F&aacute;il claimed it had the rainy day fund idea in 2015.  In that debate, the now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, said to the current Minister for Finance, &quot;I am sure the Minister will take the advice of the NTMA, which will have delegated authority in this matter, that at least some of the fund could be put on longer term notice so there may be some return available for the fund to be delivered.&quot;  I am sure the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is now glad the Minister for Finance did not take his advice.  We would not even have access to these needed funds if he had.<br/><br/>For decades, majority Governments of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have misspent public money.  There is plenty of money in the country but their priorities are all wrong.  Recently, in our lacklustre efforts to address climate change, we agreed to pay &euro;50 million to Estonia and Denmark to make up for us missing our target.  The statistical transfer of 3,500 GWh of renewable electricity had to be paid for.  What other fines will we have to pay the EU for missing our agreed targets?<br/><br/>I said in other speeches during the term of this D&aacute;il that the Covid-19 pandemic has already highlighted the inequalities in our society.  The normal social protection payment of &euro;203 per week &mdash; for the disability allowance, for example &mdash; was deemed far too low for those who were temporarily laid off.  They were to get &euro;350 per week.  I am not saying that the pandemic unemployment payment should have been lower; I am saying our basic protection payments should be higher.  Our student nurses and midwives could be paid as well.<br/><br/>This week saw the publication of the results of the Fundamental Rights Agency's survey on the lives and conditions of Travellers and Roma in six EU member states, namely, Ireland, France, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium.  The survey found that 31% of Irish Traveller households are living in acute poverty.  Of the six countries, Ireland's poverty rate was the highest.  Surely that is an embarrassment for us all.<br/><br/>In September 2020, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's online conference on tackling child poverty before and after Covid-19 highlighted the level of food poverty and hunger in single-parent households, calling it tragic.  At the conference, the CEO of One Family, Ms Karen Kiernan, stated her organisation had never dealt with so many food and hunger issues.  She said:</p><blockquote>	Everywhere people with children were talking about families being hungry.  They have had bigger food bills because the children were at home. <br /><br />Before Covid, many schools had breakfast clubs and school meals, but these safety nets fell away when schoolchildren were staying at home. </blockquote> <p>On that point, the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality is meeting online and continuing its important work.  On Saturday last, 5 December, it met to discuss the following topics: identify and dismantle economic and salary norms that result in gender inequalities, reassess the economic value placed on work traditionally held by women; and scrutinise the structural pay inequalities that result in women being disproportionately represented in low-pay sectors.  The assembly is doing important work in exposing the gendered aspects of our policy decisions.  The presentation showed that because our tax and social welfare systems are based on the male-breadwinner model, they are more likely to leave women in poverty when they reach pension age.  Dr. Adele Whelan of the Economic and Social Research Institute presented research showing men have an average weekly pension income of &euro;433, compared with just &euro;280 for women.<br/><br/>At the beginning of October, the ESRI's quarterly report highlighted the disparities between the domestic economy and the export economy, showing that exports held up quite well during the Covid pandemic.  The author, Dr. Conor O'Toole, stated:</p><blockquote>	[In] 2021, we are facing the perfect economic storm of a no-deal Brexit coupled with ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.  While a rebound could be expected next year even with public health restrictions, any recovery would be stopped in its tracks by a no-deal Brexit. </blockquote> <p>The first day of January is fast approaching.  The perfect economic storm is not of our making and we will have to brace ourselves for it, but, as usual, it will be the most vulnerable, the many, who are left out in the rain.  The rainy day fund of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party was only ever meant for the few with the big golf umbrellas.</p></speech>

The contributions of the Opposition Deputies caused me to reflect on where we stand now regarding the challenges we face and how we have equipped ourselves to be ready for them.  Opposition Deputies and my Government colleagues focused on the challenges we are currently dealing with, namely, the prospect of a no-trade-deal Brexit and the ongoing challenge we face in keeping our country safe from Covid, but while these are the challenges that are uppermost in our minds, there are, as Deputy Bruton noted in his contribution, so many other challenges approaching that will be great in scale and will require change in our society and economy but that will also create opportunities and prospects for our country that we must seek to pursue.  Those challenges are great.  They concern climate change, the use of technology, the changing nature of trade, and the potential for future change in respect of corporate taxation, for example, and international taxation.  However, what struck me so strongly when listening to the contributions of most Opposition Deputies was that we are now in a position to borrow huge amounts of money at interest rates that are among the lowest in the European Union.  There are two reasons for this, the first concerning the role of the European Central Bank and the different approach it has taken to how this crisis needs to be managed.  The second concerns the creditworthiness that our country has regained because of how it managed its public finances in recent months and years.  On listening to most Opposition Deputies, I noted that the very approach that has helped us in recent years to borrow at such low interest rates continues to be rejected by the Opposition today.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gould referred to representing the people in his constituency and to their needs.  I represent people in Dublin Central who have exactly the same needs.  It is the case that we have been better able to protect the most vulnerable at a time of such great challenge because we entered the crisis with our public finances in strong condition and with a regained perception that Ireland is a country that is creditworthy.  That has mattered in facing this challenge.  As I heard the debate unfold this afternoon, it appeared to me that there were a couple of dividing lines.  The first concerns those who believe the great challenge of Covid, which has caused so much death and difficulty and such harm to so many, has exposed all the weaknesses in our public services.  There is little doubt but that there were many challenges within our public services to which we had to respond quickly as a result of dealing with Covid-19 but, on the other hand, we saw our garda&iacute;, hospitals and schools all respond to the huge challenge.  Even in our darkest days of Covid-19, earlier in the year, our public health services and those who work in them responded with success in helping our country to contain the terrible disease and minimise the number of people who were getting sick from it and losing their lives.  Every life lost was a life lost too many, and every person who got sick due to Covid-19 was a person too many, but our public services responded in a way to help us, as a country, deal with the disease that I contend showed their strengths.  </p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The Opposition contends it was a demonstration of weakness and of what more needed to be done.<br/><br/>The other side of the argument regards the future of our economy.  Speaker after speaker said, broadly, that they disagree with the rainy day fund being set up and are glad that I am not putting a deposit into it at the moment. </p></speech>

Of course it is and I am not disregarding it as a point of view.  However, it is reflective of the fact that in response to budget after budget and during the general election campaign, Sinn F&eacute;in stated clearly that it disagrees with the policy I was pursuing to balance our books and have a surplus.  It is precisely the approach that we have taken in recent years that has now been of great help to Ireland as we have needed to borrow billions of euro quickly.  The approach that I took is one of the reasons why the interest rate we are paying on our debt and the new debt we are incurring is low in comparison to many other European Union countries.  The Sinn F&eacute;in response to that will refer to the role of the European Central Bank.  I acknowledged the role of the European Central bank earlier in my speech.  It is not an institution that Sinn F&eacute;in has had much good to say about either.</p><p>A debate will ensue regarding where we go after the decision we make on the rainy day fund.  The decision that we are making now is the right decision.  It is the right decision not to be depositing in the rainy day fund this year.  It is also right to ensure that if we do make deposits in the years to come, they have to take place at a time when our deficit is declining and our tax revenues and employment are increasing.  I believe that is the right point for those deposits to begin again in the future.</p><p>There are those who take a different view and say that we need to continue with massive borrowing.  That again poses the contradiction that I believe is at the heart of that approach.  Those who tend to advocate higher and higher borrowing tend also to be those who warn about the dangers of the financial markets.  The more one borrows, the more reliant one becomes on the financial markets.  It is also the case that if I put forward any measures to use tax as a way of reducing our need to borrow, the same people are opposed.  In the most recent Finance Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the carbon tax.  In the debate on the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in made it clear that it wants to oppose the local property tax.  I have no doubt at all that if any other measures are brought forward in the future, they will be opposed.  The hypocrisy of it.  Sinn F&eacute;in stands in front of the people and tells them that it wants to tackle climate change because it recognises there is a climate crisis and yet it opposes the single form of taxation that scientists and experts on climate change say we need to implement.  This is the debate that is to come.</p><p>I believe that we will have an economy that will be able to recover.  I believe that recovering economy will be able to deal with many of the funding challenges that we will have and many of the needs that are there.  Our country has shown its ability to respond to a crisis of this scale by carefully looking after our financial affairs.  We will have to make choices in the future regarding how we ensure our national finances become safe again.  Those will be choices and debates that we will contest and debate in this House.  </p><p>Deputy Bruton quoted <i>Macbeth</i>in his earlier contribution.  Perhaps it is appropriate for me to quote what Shakespeare wrote in <i>Julius Caesar</i>when noting that:</p> <blockquote> 	There is a tide in the affairs of men<br /><br />Which, taken at flood, leads on to fortune. </blockquote>  <p>He also noted:</p> <blockquote> 	And we must take the current when it serves,<br /><br />Or lose our ventures. </blockquote>  <p>We have seen a great sea change in the environment within which our country has to look after its people in 2020.  While there has been suffering, harm and loss of life due to this pandemic, I believe that the way we have run our economy in recent years has allowed our country to respond in a way that has no precedent in its economic history.  The question is whether we want to rebuild our ability to do that again in the future.  I believe we should and while I note and appreciate the Opposition's support for the motion we will pass later this week, it is also clear to me where the debate will lie.</p></speech>

Whatever the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, significant changes will take place from 1 January 2021.  These will have considerable implications for the agri-food and fisheries sector and will require considerable adjustment, particularly for businesses trading with Great Britain.  The focus of my Department has been on getting all sectors as ready as possible for all Brexit scenarios, with a key focus on protecting primary producers.  For example, the work that has been done on infrastructure in ports and airports, increasing staffing resources, developing robust IT support systems and communications with stakeholders has been to ensure that we support the continuation of trade post transition and, by doing so, that we support farmers and the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that financial and other support measures have been put in place over successive budgets to support farmers and the agri-food sector to deal with Brexit. </p> <p> In addition, I secured in budget 2021 a total of &euro;62 million for Brexit-related agri-food measures, and a new recovery fund of &euro;3.4 billion will be available as required across all sectors of the economy to deal was the twin challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.  Furthermore, the EU budget agreement reached in July by Heads of State and Government includes a &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve for those member states and sectors most affected by Brexit.  We are working with colleagues across government to secure significant allocations from this fund.  I am fully committed to protecting our farming and fishery sectors regardless of the outcome of Brexit and these sectors have done, and continue to do, a great deal for our economy.  All my efforts are looking to protect our food producers in the time ahead.</p> <p> We are working with our European colleagues and hoping that there will be a successful conclusion to the Brexit negotiations in the days ahead but we are prepared in regard funding and contingencies to support our farming and fisheries sectors, regardless of the outcome to those negotiations.</p></speech>

There are many varying and competing concerns for the agriculture sector in the event of a no-deal Brexit or a less than perfect Brexit deal.  The biggest of those will be access to the British market.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister about the exploration of other markets and, particularly, the importance of the land bridge and what will be put in place.  There is a huge difficulty with regard to direct shipping and air transport to the rest of the EU.  Air freight has increased dramatically in price recently and shipping capacity is also an issue.  There are only approximately eight roll-on, roll-off sailings per week.  Roll-on, roll-off is the preferred method of shipping transport for most businesses, including agri-food businesses.  I would be interested in the Minister's outlining how he will support getting Irish food into the wider EU market post-Brexit.</p></speech>

For every company that exports to Britain, that will mean additional customs checks and, for the agri-food sector more than any other sector, there will be sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks as well, which will add additional administration and challenges to the logistics of exporting to Britain.  Companies must prepare for that in the time ahead</p>  <p>  On the land bridge, we have been engaging with the European Commission and Britain in every way we can in preparing for that.  The fact that a deal has not been done yet poses a challenge in bringing final certainty to it but between now and 1 January we will continue to work with companies, our European colleagues and Britain to try to smooth those preparations.</p></speech>

At a meeting of Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine an hour or so ago we learned that Ireland is the only significant exporter at EU level that does not provide export credit insurance.  Is the Minister working with his counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that minimum step is taken?  I would also like to hear of the Minister's work with Revenue to ensure customs formalities are loosened and additional supports are provided to small agri-food businesses that need to get their product into Britain post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  There is an issue of financial guarantees that have to come from third-party insurance or a bank.  Many businesses, including some small agri-food businesses, do not have time to organise this for January.  Some of them are not even aware of it.

We have been looking at what contingencies will be required in the eventuality of a deal or no deal.  We hope it will be a deal.

The current issues in forestry licencing arise for various reasons, not least EU and national court judgments, which required a significant change to our licencing system.  I have made forestry a key priority within my portfolio and my Department has been, and is working, urgently to accelerate the pace at which licences are issued to ensure a robust system is in place for licencing that meets all of the legal and environmental requirements.  Together with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, I have met with many stakeholders and continue to meet with them on this and to engage intensively with all parties as we try to resolve this.</p>  <p>  We have undertaken a number of urgent and significant steps to resolve matters in recent months.  We implemented a detailed project management plan for dealing with the files and recruited a project manager to oversee this.  We have invested and continue to invest in new resources.  We now have 16 full-time equivalent ecologists working on forestry licencing.   We continue to recruit ecologists and will be adding to this team very soon.  We have increased the number on the forestry inspectorate team dealing with licences.  We recruited ten new permanent forestry inspectors and they will join the Department's team very shortly, with four of them starting this week.  They have been supplemented by four temporary forestry inspectors and all are immediately allocated to working on licencing.  Finally, additional administration staff have been assigned to licencing to help and I am keeping all of these resources under review.</p>  <p>  This investment is already resulting in significantly improved output.  October and November were the highest months this year for licence output, with almost 600 new licences issued in those months.  Licencing for felling with a volume of some 1.4 million tonnes were issued in that time.  This is almost as much as the previous five months combined.  I anticipate these positive trends to continue into December and beyond.</p></speech>

The advice I imagine the constituent has been given is that supplying a Natura impact statement would expedite the licence application.  I accept that there is a cost associated with that.  I do not know the constituent's details.  If the area is small, the cost of supplying a statement could be prohibitive.  If it is a large area, however, the constituent might be able to it.</p>  <p>  In light of the advice the Deputy outlined, I imagine the person's licence application is in the backlog in the ecology section.  Thanks to resources, we are seeing a large increase in that section's output.  We will continue to work on that.</p></speech>

He did so for all the right reasons.  The programme for Government rowed back on that and committed to a review of the deal.  Anyone who has examined the agreement from an environmental or Irish agricultural viewpoint knows that it could be devastating.  Will the Minister update the House on his Department's work on the deal in the interests of Irish farmers?</p></reply>

As was stated at the time of last year's EU-Mercosur political agreement, Ireland was disappointed with the inclusion of a 99,000-tonne tariff-rate quota for beef from Mercosur countries.  If ratified, this quota would be phased in under the agreement in six equal tranches over five years.  Of the quota, 55% is for fresh high-quality beef, with the remainder being frozen.</p>  <p>  The former Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, announced at the time that a whole-of-government review of the agreement's economic and sustainability impacts on Ireland would be undertaken.  This research is being led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has overall responsibility for trade policy, with specialist input and assistance from my Department.  Implement Consulting Group was requested to carry out this work and the report is due to be completed shortly.  It will help to inform Ireland's approach to the ratification process, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2021 during the Portuguese EU Presidency.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the review, I am concerned about the impacts that such a trade deal could have on our livestock sector.  There are potential positives, but we should be concerned about the possibility of beef produced less efficiently coming into the EU.  The EU needs to look on the trade agreement in that light.  There must be equivalence between reductions within the EU and what we expect of imports entering the Union.  This is particularly the case from the points of view of sustainability and the environment.  The 99,000 tonnes of beef that are referred to in the deal should be considered in that regard.  The tariff-rate quota's potential impact on European beef production, and Irish beef production in particular, is concerning.</p></speech>

He did not accept the exact same speech when it was read to him by his Fine Gael predecessor when he was in opposition.  Last week, we learned that 11,088 sq. km of forest had been destroyed in Brazil between the start of August 2019 and the end of July 2020 to make way for beef ranches.  That beef is being produced at a very low cost because of the mechanism Brazil uses and it is being exported to the EU.  Substantial quantities of Brazilian beef are already being sold in EU markets.  The Mercosur deal will simply allow a further 100,000 tonnes of it to be imported tariff-free.  This will be devastating and run counter to every assertion about the environment.</p>  <p>  The Minister suggested that there were some benefits to Ireland from the deal.  I would love it if he outlined what they were.  How could a report of any description tell him that they would outweigh the deal's devastating impact, particularly in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>

Wider trade agreements have a benefit for Ireland, including our agrifood industry.  We export 90% of all of our agricultural produce.  As such, being able to trade internationally is important.</p>  <p>  The part of the Mercosur agreement that I am concerned about is the tariff-rate quota of 99,000 tonnes, particularly in terms of how it is produced in Mercosur countries.  There must be an equivalence of standards with those we apply to the sustainability of our produce, especially in terms of the carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  Completing the review of the impacts is an appropriate way of considering this issue and informing us as we proceed.  As I have outlined clearly at all times, however, the 99,000-tonne quota is something that I remain concerned about.  It will be the matter on which I approach this deal as Minister.</p></speech>

He also knows what the deal's benefits are.  They accrue to the German car manufacturing sector.  That is why the Irish Government will not stand up and say that the deal needs to be rejected.  I believe the Government's position is that environmental concerns primarily will lead to such a public outcry that the EU will eventually have to abandon the deal.  The Government will ensure that the deal is rejected without ever having to stand up for the Irish people and Irish farmers.  I find that a cowardly approach.  The Minister should stand up on behalf of the Government and say that this deal and deals like it are not in the interests of consumers, the environment or food production in the long term and should be rejected.  The signal we are sending by refusing to reject this outright tells countries such as Brazil that they can continue destroying the environment in the name of food production.  That is shameful and I call on the Minister to change tack in a way his predecessor would not.</p></speech>

I am sure he will tell me about the leadership the task force is providing, the agreement in principle to support the protected geographical indication, PGI, application and the Bord Bia market price index.  The reality, however, is the task force is a talking shop.  It is unclear exactly how PGI will benefit farmers and there are significant ongoing low prices.  Farmers, therefore, are not seeing any benefits during one of the hardest years ever and Brexit is around the corner.  What does the Minister say to criticisms from farming organisations on the task force's slow pace and lack of meaningful engagement with farmers?</p></reply>

I am disappointed at the outset to see the negative approach the Deputy is taking to the development of a PGI application for grass-fed Irish beef.  I do not believe it reflects the positive dimensions of that initiative and what it can mean in terms of being able to try to promote our beef more abroad and, ultimately, try to add value to it.</p>  <p>The beef task force, which the Deputy referenced, was established to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector.  The task force provides a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the beef sector agreement of 15 September 2019 last year, and it has timelines and includes strong stakeholder engagement.  To be clear, the majority of the membership of the task force are farmer representative bodies.  They are there to reflect and represent farmers' interests and do so robustly.</p>  <p>  There have been six meetings of the task force to date and the next meeting is scheduled to be held later this month.  I note that work has continued steadily towards fulfilling all the actions of the agreement, despite the Covid-19 crisis, which added a further layer of complexity and a significantly challenging working environment for the task force.  Full details of the actions, progressive updates and meeting minutes are available on the website of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  As part of the agreement, three specific consultancy studies, all of which relate broadly to market transparency, were commissioned.  While these reports are behind schedule due to the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, my understanding is that they are progressing well.  Two of the studies, one on competition law and the other on market and customer requirements, will be discussed at the next task force meeting. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to have the opportunity to address the task force in September.  At that meeting, I emphasised that constructive and meaningful engagement across this group is essential to maintaining and developing the sector in a sustainable way, which adds value at all stages of the supply chain, but particularly and importantly for the primary producer.</p>  <p>  I believe the sector can rise to the many challenges facing it and that the task force has an important role to play.  I look forward to seeing continuous strong engagement from the task force as its work progresses. </p></speech>

It is not regarding the bigger picture the Minister is painting.  I believe the broad reaction is that this is about them.  The reason we can get a PGI is because of their practices but it is not benefiting them.  That is where the negativity lies.  It is important to point that out.</p>  <p>   Regarding the task force, farmers feel they are again being sidelined in the process.  Just two weeks ago, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association wrote to the chairman of the beef task force demanding more urgency and expressed its frustration at a lack of engagement on Brexit.  Farmers are consistently pointing out low prices and have in the past protested about the prices they are getting compared to UK prices.  They are raising concerns that the processors are not holding up their end of the beef sector agreement and are waiting for a response from the Minister's Department.  </p>  <p>  The task force has been in place for over a year now and practices like the four-movement and 30-months rules and insurance deductions still have not been addressed.  Fair prices are in the national interest.  We should be protecting those interests, not those of beef barons.  Fair prices would keep people on the land, offer the next generation the opportunity to stay on the land and support a rural and social economy.  We need a significant change in our response to this.</p></speech>

Of these, 20 have now been completed, six are in progress and one still is to be commenced, while ten are ongoing actions that are continuing.</p>  <p>  I will go back to the initial point I made that the task force is primarily composed of farmer representative organisations and they have got fully behind, for example, the PGI grass-fed application, which I recently submitted to Europe.  It was agreed with consensus and with the full support of the beef task force.  The reason the farmer representatives signed up to that is because they see the merit in going down that route and, of course, we must push, advocate and market it in a way that, hopefully, after it is successful, delivers for farmers on the ground and in terms of beef prices.  Certainly, it is a strong forum in terms of representing beef farmers going forward and I will continue to work closely with it to ensure it is effective.</p></speech>

I believe it is important.  My point was to ask how does it benefit farmers.  We still have not realised how that will happen.  The core issue remains the industry is out to get as much profit as possible and continues to give low prices to farmers and treat workers poorly.  This is facilitated by Government after Government and we have an opportunity to change now that we have new Ministers.</p>  <p>  The scale of Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants illustrated existing underlying issues in the sector before the pandemic.  We were all aware of the unsustainably low prices and now we have a clearer picture of the horrendous conditions in which people are working.  These two things are intrinsically linked and speak to how the industry treats people, both workers and farmers.</p>  <p>  During the summer, the German agriculture minister pointed out that low prices do not fit with sustainability.  She linked low prices with pressures on animal welfare, working conditions in meat processing plants and farmers' incomes.  It is obvious there are clear parallels to be drawn here and they need to be addressed.  To resolve the many issues and injustices in this sector, the Minister needs to tackle the power and privilege given to the meat processing sector and he needs to do it now.</p></speech>

That is why I worked strongly with the beef task force and the farming organisations to move the PGI forward.  That is obviously something we must get approval for at European level and then ensure, in time, that we work to have it benefit farmers.</p>  <p>  It is also why for the first time, through that beef task force, I have also secured and allocated &euro;6 million, specifically, to develop a suckler beef brand, which I believe is important in trying to better promote our suckler beef sector.  I also point the Deputy to the most recent budget where I secured an 11% increase over last year's budget, specifically to go towards farmers and to support schemes which underpin their income.  That was significant and widely welcomed for them as well.</p>  <p>  Another key initiative I have as Minister is to introduce a food ombudsman to try to bring more price transparency into the food supply chain to ensure a mechanism is in place where we can trace what is happening in international markets where our produce is being sold to try to ensure the price is being delivered back to farmers at farm gate level. </p></speech>

As he will be aware, under the Common Fisheries Policy, EU fishing fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas.</p>  <p>  Irrespective of size, fishing vessels must comply with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, which includes rules regarding access and catch limits or quota.  With regard to access to Ireland's coastal waters by foreign vessels, I will point out that on the north-west coast, all foreign fishing vessels are excluded from Ireland's 12-mile fishing zone, other than for transit or shelter purposes.  All foreign pelagic fishing vessels are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12-mile fishing zone on the west coast.  Irish fishing vessels greater than or equal to 36.58 m in length are also precluded from fishing in Ireland's 12-mile zone.  </p>  <p>  Changes to fisheries policy involving access or restriction to fishing opportunities or fishing areas come within the sole competence of the European Union.  Member states are permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures within the 12-mile zone, subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in the Common Fisheries Policy.</p> <p> As an EU common policy, a proposal must, in the first instance, be made by the European Commission.  Any proposal of this nature would be expected to have broad application in the context of EU waters and to apply to all fishing vessels of a particular size or using identified non-sustainable fishing gear.  It appears that the Deputy's query relates to large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring.  As he will be aware, the Irish fleet includes such fishing vessels.  In respect of Ireland's position on any such proposal from the European Commission, it would be essential to have regard for the potential impacts on our fleet.  Ireland's control authorities, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service, are responsible for the monitoring and control of fishing vessels, including large fishing vessels targeting pelagic stocks, in our exclusive economic zone to ensure compliance with the rules of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.</p></speech>

One was a super-trawler and the other was a factory ship.  One was 470 ft long and the other was 414 ft long.  They hoovered up fish.  There are widespread concerns about sustainability.  How can the Minister talk about sustainability of fisheries when vessels of this size are hoovering up fish?  There are major concerns about discards going back into the sea.  There is a lack of CCTV, observers or accountability to ensure that these vessels are catching what they are supposed to.  It is difficult to take when we have given up 80% of the 1.2 million tonnes that are caught in Irish waters every year.  We have given up 80% of the fish in that entire zone.  The Minister needs to fight for Ireland's interests and seek to put an end to this practice.</p></speech>

That has never been more the case than at the moment in the context of the Brexit negotiations and the very solid and forthright campaign we have mounted working with our European maritime nation partners to try to ensure a good outcome from Brexit in terms of access to British waters and of maintaining our quota share.</p>  <p>  The specific issue the Deputy raised, as I pointed out to him, concerns a European competence.  If there are to be changes, they will have to be at European level and to apply to all European waters, not just outside of the Irish 12-mile zone.  These vessels are precluded from entering the Irish 12-mile zone and that will continue into the future.  As for developing the proposal further as part of the next Common Fisheries Policy, the Deputy will have to give thought to whether he proposes that this would apply to Irish vessels of similar catching capacity, of which there are many in our domestic fleet.</p></speech>

The exclusive economic zone of our country comprises 200 miles, not 12 miles.  There are immense resources of fisheries outside the 12-mile limit and we have given up 80% of those.</p>  <p>  In regard to the size of the ships, Australia has banned vessels of more than 120 m in length.  I do not think there is any vessel of that size in the Irish fleet, although there was the infamous Atlantic Dawn a number of years ago.  We need to be serious about sustainability.  If we are telling our mid-sized fleet that fishes under producer organisations around our coast about sustainability and the need to protect the six-mile limit, how can we allow super trawlers of more than 120 m - some of the largest in the world - to hoover all species of fish out of the sea, with considerable quantities of discards?  We know this is an appalling practice that undermines everything else we do.  Will the Minister start the battle and the process of change among his European colleagues?</p></speech>

While it provides good income for our fishermen today, we must ensure that the stocks will be there for the years ahead.  The way that is done at European level is through a quota system, although it is highly contested at all times.  There is a quota system that puts a limit on what can be fished from the sea by any vessel, irrespective of its size.  Whether small or large, a vessel is restricted by its quota, which is set to ensure sustainability and that the quantity of fish taken out of the sea does not exceed the quota.</p>  <p>  There is a distinction between the six-mile, 12-mile and 200-mile zones.  Within the 12-mile zone, none of these vessels is allowed to fish.  Outside the zone, the standard European rules apply.  Our national competence agencies, the SFPA and the Naval Service, are charged with ensuring that there is oversight and implementation of the rules.  It is particularly important for large vessels that there is strong oversight, as with all our fishing sector.  That has to be applied to all vessels.  To respond to the Deputy's wider point, sustainability is dictated by the quota share.  I do not detract from the fact that this issue certainly brings out a great deal of emotion in people, and understandably so.</p></speech>

This has grown increasingly important as we deal with the challenges presented by both the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit.  While trade missions will continue to play a key role here, our traditional in-person method of developing trade with customers is not currently feasible.</p>  <p>  To that end, the Minister and I, in conjunction with Bord Bia, recently held a series of virtual trade missions with customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.  These interactive engagements spanned five dates in November and December and included Irish industry and existing and potential customers overseas.  We have also engaged in a series of virtual meetings with key international customers from Germany, the UK, Japan, China, the United Arab Emirates and south-east Asia.  In these uncertain times, meaningful and continued engagement with Ireland&rsquo;s growing customer base throughout the world is more important than ever.  This innovative approach of bringing trade missions online creates an opportunity to further deepen trading relationships between Ireland and key customers in these regions.  These virtual events also remind our key customers that Ireland remains committed to them and is able to supply foods in which their consumers can have confidence.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to new market development was further illustrated by my appointment earlier this year as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task.  The Department has also placed four additional agriculture attach&eacute;s in the Irish embassy network in recent years, in Berlin, Tokyo and Mexico city in 2019, and in Seoul, South Korea, in 2020.  In addition, the Department's international trade activities are being reorganised and further developed to deal with the challenges of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are doing everything we can to be agile and responsive to the challenges that Covid is presenting.  In the context of the challenges that Brexit poses, we are not letting our foot off the gas and are continuing to drive on with accessing and developing new markets.  We are also ensuring that we grow the markets we have.</p></speech>

Agrifood is a very significant part of our export economy and our national economy.  It has developed and it is great to see the momentum.  It is clear from the Department and from listening to the Minister's and the Minister of State's responses today how much emphasis there is for dairy and beef, which is appropriate, but I might also flag the innovation-led businesses that are not on that side, such as in dry goods and other products.  I am thinking of early start-ups in my constituency such as Homespun Foods and others that are purely innovation led.  They draw from global sources and really need the help of State agencies to access emerging markets in the same way as dairy and beef producers.  There are extraordinary food producers of all different types in Ireland and we have an extraordinary reputation for the quality of the food we produce, which we do in a clever and sustainable way.  Support to enable those small producers to access newer and larger markets, particularly as we face into these difficult weeks and the difficulty of next year, would be so welcome.</p></speech>

With any new start-up, whether innovative or otherwise, there are challenges of scale and of ramping up all of the competences within that company quickly enough for it to be able to put its best foot forward.  From the political perspective, the Minister and I use our good offices to open those opportunities.  Working closely with the State agencies, we try and open the door for businesses which have key market opportunities in these areas.  We deal closely with the likes of Bord Bia in terms of the research it provides as to where the big opportunities are, but I am happy to engage with some of the smaller innovative companies in the Deputy's constituency to which she referred and with which she is familiar in order to hear their first-hand experience of challenges they might have and how we can work to help them adapt.  From Bord Bia through to all the other State agencies and ourselves in the Department, we are there to open up those opportunities and to allow the businesses to put their best foot forward.  I would be interested to hear about some of the challenges that the smaller companies have in trying to do that.</p></speech>

That is so welcome.  One of the challenges for small businesses is that they have been able to take some of their own steps where there has not been a language barrier but the United Kingdom leaving the European Union makes it much more difficult.  Indeed, the agencies are very supportive.  I suppose some of the smaller businesses feel that there is this emphasis on dairy and beef and it is just to make sure that we are still investing in that innovation-led food enterprises to give them the support that they need.  I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to link them with him.  It is always great to hear practical examples from businesses on the ground in any walk of life and agrifood is no different.  I really appreciate the Minister of State's support for those businesses.  I thank him for his answer.</p></speech>

Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy network, we have increased significantly the footprint of Irish diplomats and supports all across the world.  The Bord Bia team is phenomenal.  In my short time in the Department and in this role, I have been impressed by the young dynamic talent we have all over the world in terms of opening those doors.  Therefore, there should be no barrier to small innovative companies, which are looking for those niche markets and which are look for support in areas, because it is not only a matter of language.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to point to the fact that Brexit provides us with this opportunity when we become the only English-speaking nation in the EU but there are also cultural challenges.  In different areas there are different cultural emphasis that are important for a company to be aware of for their customers and that is the type of insight that our agricultural attach&eacute;s, our diplomatic team and agencies such as Bord Bia can provide.  I am happy to link any small companies looking to break into new markets with those support services.</p></speech>

Statutory responsibility for health and safety in the workplace rests with the HSA.  In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  My Department's statutory responsibility is to ensure that food business operators within these premises operate in compliance with the EU's food hygiene legislation, animal and plant health, and animal welfare standards.  However, in the current circumstances, in addition to this statutory role, the Department is continuing to provide any support required to the HSE and the HSA at local and national level in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant guidance in Department-approved food plants.  As at 27 November, the Department had completed 575 inspections on behalf of the HSA, including unannounced inspections, in Department-approved food premises, and these inspections are ongoing.  To be clear, this is in addition to the inspections carried out by the HSA itself, and in addition to the 49 premises where the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a permanent presence.</p>  <p>  In ongoing engagement with the meat industry since the start of the pandemic, my officials have emphasised that the health and safety of workers must be the absolute priority.  In September 2020 Meat Industry Ireland and SIPTU agreed a code of practice for the safe management of staff in the primary meat processing sector during the pandemic.  I welcome such initiatives as very positive steps in ensuring a safer working environment for employees in the meat slaughter and processing sector.  If employees or their representatives have any specific concerns about employment conditions they should contact the relevant statutory agencies, that is, the HSA, the Workplace Relations Commission or the Department of Social Protection, as appropriate.</p></speech>

They referred to a number of inspections by the HSA on meat factories that had not been released to the public at the time.  The reports were damning - face-coverings not being used, the potential for cross-contamination, the minimal level of acceptable personal protective equipment, PPE, being in place, staff working at close quarters, and inadequate health and safety signage being in place.  These concerns were all voiced by us at a time when cases started emerging in meat factories.  Can the Minister indicate whether the inspections in question took place in the early days of the Covid crisis, at the height of the crisis or later?  Given the poor working conditions does it mean that the Department and the HSA did not act early enough to ensure that the protective measures had been put in place?  How were these conditions allowed to emerge at these facilities?  Can the Minister tell the public how a decision was made not to release them and why was the Right To Know group offered the redacted versions of the reports and not the full versions?</p></speech>

As I pointed out, I do not have the details here that the HSA would have because the authority comes under another Department's remit.  I outlined the assessments and the checks that my Department has carried out on the authority's behalf to supplement that work.  At all times we have been clear about the absolute importance of safety across all working environments, particularly those in the meat industry.  Activity in this industry was designated as essential during Covid.  It has continued throughout the period and the risk has been more significant as a result.  We have always highlighted the absolute importance of ensuring that possible precaution is taken and that this is done consistently.  Certainly, I have ensured, as have other Government colleagues, that this message has been put out there consistently.  In terms of the sector, those involved are very much aware of that too because, ultimately, the health and welfare of employees is more important to them than it is to anyone else.  It is essential that that is at the centre of everything we do.</p></speech>

We ourselves found out that they had stopped testing in some places.  The report also reveals serious health and safety problems that were not Covid related.  They contained repeated concerns about bandsaws without emergency stop buttons, open effluent treatment tanks with no edge protection and, in one case, asbestos roofing being visible throughout the site.  These are health and safety issues that pose serious risks to the employees regardless of Covid-19.  How were these issues allowed to go on?  Are these factories not being inspected enough or was it a case of looking the other way because those who own them are friends or buddies of the Government?  If the factories were not inspected for compliance with Covid-19 guidelines, would we not even know about these breaches of health and safety that are putting employees' welfare at risk?  Finally, if Sinn F&eacute;in's request to make Covid-19 an identifiable workplace illness was adopted in the early days of the outbreak, would these issues have been spotted earlier?</p></speech>

The fact that responses to requests for freedom of information are being so heavily redacted sends out all the wrong signals.  These are matters that should not embarrass anybody.  Certainly, the factories should be eager that these reports are published to give the public the knowledge.</p>  <p>  My question follows on from Deputy Browne's.  At present, there are some intensive activities taking place, for example, in turkey factories.  Turkey factories play an important role in many local economies, including my own, but they also at this time of year incorporate many new staff, many of whom work part-time or in some instances include large numbers of migrant labour.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Is the Department paying any particular attention to those factories at this time of year?  In my view, what happened in the meat plants during the summer played a much larger part than has been attributed to them in bringing about a second wave of infections.  We do not want to see a third wave as a result of a lack of scrutiny in this area.</p></speech>

The health, welfare and safety of workers must be absolutely central to everything we do, particularly in environments where essential work is continuing.  That is the clear message we are putting out to all sectors, particularly the meat processing sector.  My Department has worked to assist the HSA in this regard, including in the carrying out of more than 500 inspections, alongside the ongoing work we do in this area.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Carthy's point regarding turkey farm operations, my Department has an engagement in terms of veterinary oversight but the HSA is the authority with responsibility for liaising in those situations.  Regardless of the setting, the advice has been very clear to everyone.  Ultimately, the onus is on employers and operators to ensure the health and safety of their staff is central to all that they do.  There is also a strong onus on staff to ensure they work with their employer and call out any issues that arise.  If there are any instances where people's safety is not being properly catered for, they must be brought to the attention of the HSA, which will move immediately to ensure the correct conditions are put in place and to hold to account anyone who is not following the guidelines.</p></speech>

The plan has guided our key research priorities over recent years in respect of the competitive funding programmes we operate.</p>  <p>  My Department, as part of its agri-food strategy to 2030 will, in due course, develop a new research and innovation agenda as a successor to SHARP.  This will reflect the key focus on innovation in both Food Wise 2025 and its anticipated focus in the agri-food strategy to 2030.  The preparations for this new research and innovation agenda will commence once the overarching agri-food strategy to 2030 and the successor to Innovation 2020, the current national strategy for research and development, science and technology, are completed.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new research and innovation agenda will most likely take the form of an overarching framework that aims to provide for a coherent approach to the competitive funding and conduct of research and innovation in future years.  The new research and innovation agenda will also be guided by high-level EU policy developments such as the European Green Deal and its related strategies, as well as specific EU research and innovation strategies such as Food 2030, its bioeconomy strategy and its research and innovation plan for agriculture and rural development.   </p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for research and development in agriculture, I was pleased to announce an additional &euro;3 million allocation to the Department for research, bringing the total investment allocation to &euro;18 million for next year.  This is a sign of the prioritisation the Minister, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I place on research and development.  There is huge potential in areas like the bioeconomy and we are mindful of the pressures coming down the line in terms of innovation and sustainability around everything we do, including food production and increasing our output, and the challenges we face in this regard.  I very much welcome this important increase in funding in this area for the year ahead.</p></speech>

Will he outline the degree to which he intends to shift emphasis, given the challenges that are coming down the track?  Will he indicate the degree to which he and his Department have evaluated those challenges and, as a result, made decisions in terms of a particular shift in policy in order to obviate any negative impact?</p></speech>

The then Government established an independent group of mainly external experts to identify priority areas for research funding under competitively operated programmes based on set criteria.  Two of those areas were smart, sustainable food production and processing and food for health.  Just as was done on that occasion, we, too, will look at the present set of circumstances.</p>  <p>  The successor to Food Wise 2025, which is our ten-year agricultural programme, will be published early in the new year.  It will be key that our research plan mirrors the targets and objectives set out in that programme.  We must also be aware of the challenges facing us in the coming years, many of which are already set out.  There are opportunities as well as challenges in terms of the European Green Deal and the farm to fork strategy, and at the heart of those opportunities is sustainability.  The Deputy can take it as given that while innovation will continue to be absolutely key, sustainability will be at the heart of our efforts in that regard, as it will be at the heart of our food strategy into the future.  It is an area in which we in Ireland have real strength in terms of the story we can tell around our food production and our food and drink exports.</p></speech>

The Department and I are absolutely determined to identify new opportunities for our premier producers to improve and supplement their income.  There are huge opportunities in a number of areas.  When we talk about environmental elements, it tends to be with a fairly negative approach insofar as they may impact on agriculture, primary producers and farmers.  However, if one looks at the bioeconomy, for example, there is potential for us to identify areas where, in the past, certain products were seen as waste elements within the food production process.  There is scope to identify the value and added value such products may have.  For instance, the &euro;20 million Glanbia plant in Lisheen is taking what was a waste product and identifying potential out of it.  The European Innovation Partnership, EIP, model in west Cork is making a range of uses out of the grass-fed dairy produce system, with really innovative outcomes.  All of that is feeding into what our new research programme will look like, and we must ensure that marries with our 2025 agri-food strategy.  It is an ongoing process and one we continue to monitor very closely.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800039#NN01200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question, which has been raised with me on many occasions by fishermen.  Bluefin tuna is a highly migratory large pelagic species which spawns in the Mediterranean and then migrates over a wide area of the north-east Atlantic to feed.  This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200-mile zone for part of the year, as we discussed previously.  At the time we see the fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain all the way up to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200-mile zone may be determined.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for bluefin tuna, as the Deputy indicated.  The available bluefin tuna quota is allocated each year to member states on the basis of relative stability, as established in the late 1990s.  At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for bluefin tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  A small bluefin tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important northern Albacore tuna fishery and Celtic Sea herring fishery, where there can be bluefin tuna by-catches.</p> <p> In 2018, Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data.  A catch-tag-release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place since 2019.  It supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of bluefin tuna in Irish waters.</p> <p> The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU.  The EU percentage share of the international total allowable catch is set down.  There is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU.  This means that EU member states with a national quota would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland.</p> <p> The European Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process when there is clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  It is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry and member states.  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.</p></speech>

Since 2016, the European Union share of that international quota has increased by 73% - some 8,000 tonnes - from 11,200 tonnes to 19,360 tonnes.  Ireland, however, has not got one of those tonnes.  Irish fishermen, right around the coast, are reporting to me as Sinn F&eacute;in's fisheries spokesperson that they are looking at this lucrative and predatory fish getting fattened up on a range of fish species in our waters, which then goes out and gets caught by an array of international vessels.  These vessels are making a fortune from fish fattened in our waters.  It is an absolute mortal sin that we have not got one tonne of that additional quota in recent years.  The Minister will have to fight harder.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows from talking to fishermen the challenge of changing quota allocations every year.  He will also know how, whether it is mackerel, herring, haddock or whiting, we hold on protectively to our total allowable catches and how we would like to get more.  If the total allowable catch increases in a year, we look to ensure that we hold the percentage we have of that species.  We would not give away a single fish of it and would like to have more.</p>  <p>  That is the dynamic in the context of bluefin tuna.  Other member states would have a track record that we do not have.  Accordingly, they have a percentage of the total allowable catch.  As that has increased in recent years, they have held their percentages of it.  I am committed to doing all I can, particularly under the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, to address that.  I do not underestimate the challenge as everybody looks to hold on to their quotas.  I certainly will be doing all I can within the Common Fisheries Policy review to fight on behalf our fishermen.</p></speech>

In the Japanese sushi and sashimi markets, it is an incredibly lucrative fish.  More than 8,000 additional tonnes in the past four years were secured by the European Union for this fish but we get nothing.  As the Minister knows from wearing his agriculture hat, we are looking at the Common Agricultural Policy, the single farm payment, the historical relationship in that regard and how it can be unjust.  This fisheries situation is profoundly unjust.  It is a mortal sin that we have this healthy lucrative fishery that our fishermen are allowed to go out on a chartered vessel, catch the fish and release it again, only for it to go out fattened from our waters and to make a fortune of money for vessels from other countries.  This is madness.  The Minister is an intelligent man and a Donegal man.  He knows it is madness.  He has to stand up and fight for Irish interests.  We cannot put up with this any longer.  It is absolutely sickening to see the amount of money lost.  It could be used for our inshore fleet.  The Minister could control the way it is fished to make a nice income for boats all around our coast.</p></speech>

As the Deputy well knows, the challenge in that regard should not be underestimated.  I will certainly step up and do all I can to fight in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy knows the background, which I have well explained, of traditional catch records which went to inform how various quotas were allocated and how protectively every member state, including ourselves, holds on to them and tries to increase them.</p>  <p>  We have to ensure that we fish in a way which is sustainable into the future.  We must ensure we do not overfish and thereby undermine stocks.  This means there is a ceiling on the total allowable catch which is dictated by the health of fish stocks.  The move in 2019 in terms of a scientific catch-and-release scheme will, hopefully, give us some evidence to work with concerning the health of the bluefin tuna stocks in Irish waters.  It will allow us to push hard at European level for that.  I can assure all fishermen that I will not be found wanting.  I will do all I can to make progress in that regard.</p></speech>

Teagasc colleges and other such outlets provide an important output to train our next generation of farmers to meet the challenges they will face.  They need to get the same support as all other students, however.  How does the Minister plan to bring that about?</p></reply>

Crucial to that are our educational providers.  Teagasc plays a strong and crucial role in that regard.  I am committed to ensuring agricultural college students are treated fairly and the same as all other students.</p>  <p>  My Department and Teagasc are working together ensuring that supports will be put in place to reflect the additional challenges on students as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A Covid payment is being made available to ease the financial burden on full-time students in the colleges.  Students who qualify for the Teagasc maintenance grant will receive a top-up payment of &euro;250.  Students not in receipt of the grant will receive a fee rebate of &euro;100 if they have paid the annual contribution charge of &euro;990 for Teagasc level 5 and level 6 full-time courses.  Overall, the foregoing is expected to benefit approximately 1,000 learners at a cost of over &euro;200,000.  I am confident that this package of measures will greatly assist Teagasc learners to adjust to the impact of Covid-19 in a manner no different to learners in the wider education sector supported through the Department of higher education.</p>  <p>  I made this a priority in recent weeks and have worked closely with Macra na Feirme on it.  I acknowledge its campaigning and advocacy on this particular issue with me to find a solution.  Macra na Feirme has welcomed this warmly.  I recognise the central role it played advocating on behalf of these students, many of whom members of it.</p></reply>

The Minister knows I am an incredibly positive person and always welcome positive developments.  I did so last week when it was announced that additional supports would be made available.  I actually commended the Minister on his role in that.  I expected he would play some role in the funding of it, however.</p> <p>Only subsequently did I learn that the funding the Minister outlined is coming from Teagasc's existing budget so there was no additional funding provided by his Department or any other.  This is not to say that the scheme, as it stands, is not welcome.  What it says to me is that we can go further.  We can ensure that every student who attends an agricultural college course can receive the same level of supports, recognising they are all going through the same difficulties as a result of Covid-19.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would outline whether he will endeavour to make sure that this will happen.</p></speech>

I assure him that the funding did come from the Government and, ultimately, from the taxpayer.  Teagasc plays a very valuable role, which I strongly support and certainly, as Minister, it is one I prioritise.  I ensured that it received an additional &euro;4 million in the budget this year in order to support it.  As the Deputy knows, that &euro;4 million came as part of an 11% increase I secured for the farming sector in the budget over and above last year in order to try to ensure we underpin farm incomes and try to support farmers throughout the country.  I recognise the tremendous effort Teagasc has gone to, working with me and the Department, taking on board the efforts of Macra na Feirme and representations from the students to ensure those students would be treated fairly and proportionately in the same way as other third level students have been.  This was very important and I recognise the work of Teagasc in that.  I will continue to support Teagasc in the very important work it does by means of funding from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

We need to have a holistic view of agricultural education.  At present, there are disparities.  It is not that there are too many agencies involved, it is that they do not appear to be working together.  The Minister for Education has simply dismissed concerns of the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association, which has raised genuine concerns.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science apparently just washed his hands entirely when the issue of disenfranchised students attending agricultural colleges was raised with him.  He fobbed it off to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Now we have a situation whereby Teagasc is being asked to provide finance to students out of its existing funds.  For all other students it is coming out of the Department of Education funds.  Will the Minister outline to the House whether he has proposals to have a full overview of the agricultural educational system as it stands to ensure it is robust and fit to meet the challenges we know will face Irish agriculture in future?</p></speech>

I can reassure him, and he will be glad to hear, there was no hand washing on agricultural or Teagasc students.  I certainly stepped up to the plate and worked with Teagasc to ensure that they would be supported.  I also ensured that Teagasc would continue to be supported in the important work it carries out in the recent budget.  The fact this funding was in place has been very welcome.  I should point out it is alongside some funding for laptop provision for students at agricultural colleges, which is also something on which Teagasc worked with me.  I commend Teagasc on how it has worked with students in this regard.  It does exceptional work in a very hands-on practical manner in training our farmers and providing very high quality certified courses to ensure we have a very strong and fully educated young farmer base coming into renew our agricultural workforce.  I assure Deputy Carthy I will continue to work with Teagasc to support those students in the important educational remit it has in the time ahead.</p></speech>

There is a small typo in the question and I think I made the mistake when I submitted it.  It should refer to the years 2021 and 2022.  I believe it will be 2023 before the new CAP, comes into force, and perhaps the Minister will confirm this.  What are the transitional arrangements going to be for 2021 and 2022?  What progress has been made in the greater scheme of things for the CAP from 2021 to 2027, in other words, the full CAP that will come into force sometime in the coming years?

The legislation is expected to be approved shortly, by mid-December, and published shortly afterwards, subject to agreement on the EU budget.  In this regard, the proposals incorporate EU recovery instrument funding, of which &euro;190 million is earmarked for Ireland.  This will be programmed through the rural development programme in the two-year transitional period in 2021 and 2022.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has made preparations for the transitional period within the parameters of the current rules, and in anticipation of the finalised EU transitional rules being forthcoming.  In October, I announced my intention to extend schemes under the rural development programme into 2021, and I provided the necessary funding of &euro;628 million in the budget.</p>  <p>  The extension of existing rural development programme schemes required approval from the EU.  I am pleased to advise the House that approval was received last week for the extension of contracts under GLAS, the beef data genomics programme, the Burren programme and the organic farming  scheme.  My Department will be in contact shortly with farmers whose contracts are due to end this year, to advise them how to opt in if they wish to extend their contracts.  Support for other annual schemes is expected to continue, including the sheep welfare scheme and the areas of natural constraints scheme.  I have provided for &euro;80 million for TAMS in 2021 to meet existing commitments, and decisions on other tranches will be made when there is more certainty around the transitional rules.  I will continue to consult with stakeholders on the options for the transitional period over the coming weeks as we have more certainty around the rules and funding.</p>  <p>  The European CAP national strategic plan is being finalised.  Over the course of the coming months, it is something that will have to be considerably fleshed out in terms of our national plan that will decide how we structure the seven-year programme at national level, obviously being compliant with the overall European programme.</p></speech>

How widespread will it be?  How available will it be to people who have left the agri-environment options scheme and did not get into GLAS or who have never been on a scheme, such as young farmers?  Will the Minister flesh out what he now knows about the alternative environmental scheme to GLAS for those who are not in it at present?  It is a matter of concern because people depend on these environmental payments to put bread on the table.  Will he confirm the current schemes and I will come back in on the longer period schemes.</p></speech>

The basic payment scheme is 100% funded by the Commission and it will continue as a basic payment directly from it.  The multi-annual financial framework will run for seven years alongside the seven-year CAP.  There will be a two-year transition period, although I am not sure whether the second year has been formally signed off at European level.  The full expectation is that it will be a two-year transition period.  While the full CAP will not get going until January 2023, in every likelihood the new basic payment scheme and the seven-year multi-annual financial framework will have already started.</p>  <p>  The domestic budget I introduced in October was very important with regard to the rural development schemes, which will continue next year.  Next year's budget will be important to ensure they are in place for the year 2022.  The rollover will happen next year so people will be able to continue with it.</p> <p>I will come back to the Deputy in respect of the new scheme in my further response.</p></speech>

My understanding is that after 2021, whatever replaces the basic payment scheme and greening could be different, even radically different, from what we have.  The scheme relating to areas of natural constraint could also be different, as could all the rural development schemes.  Have we any idea, from preliminary papers that are probably floating around the system, of the post-2022 shape of the schemes and the changes, particularly their impact on farmers and farmers&rsquo; incomes, because that is obviously going to become a concern over the next two years.  Is it going to be radically different and are there going to be a lot of conditions that might make it difficult for some farmers to access these schemes and keep their payments going?  The Minister might give some indication of how these schemes are beginning to take shape in Europe.  No doubt there are discussion papers floating around the system, as there always are, and my experience was that 90% of what they produce at the beginning is implemented at the end.  The Minister might give us some insight into that.</p></speech>

It will be spent in a variety of ways.  A fair proportion of that will be open to all farmers - those currently in GLAS and those not - and there is also going to be a pilot environmental scheme for those who are not currently in GLAS, for whom this is being rolled over.  That is something I will be consulting on shortly with farming organisations, perhaps into the start of the year, and we will then have it up and running early in the year.</p>  <p>  On the framework and how the next CAP will look, there is going to be a change in regard to pillar 1 because we are going to have the eco scheme as part of that.  That is going to have to set a baseline of conditionality that will then be built upon in regard to pillar 2.  I will be consulting very widely with farming organisations and farmers, and within the political system as well, in regard to how we structure that and what schemes we put in place.  Obviously, they will have to meet the general requirements at EU level but we will have a lot of discretion at national level.  I will consult widely on that to ensure it is practical and will deliver as well as possible for farmers.</p></speech>

Primary responsibility for ensuring that the obligations set out in Union legislation are met rests with operators.  The official controls regulation is clear that the responsibility to enforce Union agrifood chain legislation lies with member states, whose competent authorities monitor and verify, through the implementation of official controls, that relevant Union requirements are effectively complied with and enforced.</p>  <p>  My Department is one such competent authority and other Departments and State agencies also have a role in this regard.  My Department will continue to meet its obligations in respect of the official controls regulation, irrespective of Brexit.  From 1 January 2021, obligations to carry out official controls will continue to apply equally across all EU member states, including in respect of the need to carry out sanitary and phytosanitary checks on imports of animals and goods from all third countries, including Great Britain.  In this regard, my Department has invested significantly in staffing, IT and infrastructure to ensure that it is able to continue to efficiently carry out the official controls on goods entering Ireland from Great Britain after the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  In simple terms, animal health, animal husbandry and processing standards are applicable throughout the country and the EU, and they will continue in full after Brexit.  Our requirements do not change.  What changes is the fact Britain becomes a third country, so the amount of those checks and balances we have to put in place will be greatly enhanced because of our very significant trade with Great Britain.  It makes it all the more important to, hopefully, get a trade deal over the line in the next couple of days.  While we would prefer it was not so late, we have all of our preparations in place to account for every eventuality.  Irrespective of what happens in the coming days and weeks, there will be disruption and change on 1 January in terms of the role Great Britain will play as a trading partner.</p></reply>

Will this be rigorously enforced to ensure that there will be no undermining of the standards that apply here and no undermining of the Irish producers in the context of what they are competing with?</p></speech>

At the end of the day, we control what we control on the EU side, and we have to presume that what the final set of agreements is would have reciprocal approaches on both sides.  What we have always wanted, both in Ireland and as part of the EU, is as close a working relationship as possible with Great Britain.  A huge amount of our trade, particularly in the agrifood sector, goes both ways across the Irish Sea.  Anything other than a close working relationship makes no sense for either of us.  One would definitely hope that common sense prevails in that regard.</p>  <p>  In the context of what we can control, we control our own measures.  Irrespective of what is going to happen in terms of a trade deal and whether that can be struck in the coming days, the fact is that circumstances will change after 1 January.  My Department, through the State agencies, is working closely with the Irish agrifood business and processors to make sure they are prepared for those changes in dealing with Britain as a third country.</p></speech>

Any breaches of the rules that go unchallenged would have a serious knock-on effect.  Can the Minister of State be assured, and in turn reassure the House, that any breaches to introduce product into third countries and, subsequently, into EU countries will be vigorously contested and pursued?</p></speech>

We see our place as being at the heart of Europe.  We see the benefits for the Irish people, the Irish agrifood business, farmers and food producers to be at the heart of a European Union that is a trading bloc of 500 million people.  As a very active member of that European Union, we will not allow the Single Market to be undermined and we will vigorously uphold that market.  That is why the EU cannot accept proposals which impact on the integrity of the Single Market or that damage the long-term political or economic interests of the Union, of which we are an integral part.  I assure the Deputy of that.</p>  <p>  At the same time, we would like to see as close a working relationship with the UK as possible, and we are doing everything on our side to try to make that happen.  For any deal to happen, there has to be agreement on both sides.  We have always been extremely clear within the EU as to what our goals are around the level playing field and similarity of standards.  We will continue to uphold them into the future.</p></speech>

I feel very privileged to bring forward this very important legislation which seeks to deliver a much-needed support for victims and survivors of domestic abuse, a statutory entitlement to domestic violence paid leave.  Today, let us not forget, is the final day of the 16 Days of Activism campaign.  Quite simply, the Bill seeks to provide for a period of paid leave for people who are the victims of domestic abuse.  I welcome that the Government is not opposing this legislation and look forward to working with it to bring the Bill through all Stages.  I thank the staff in the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, and my colleague, Sin&eacute;ad N&iacute; Bhroin, for their work to date on this legislation.  I advise the Government that this legislation will not require much by way of amendment.  It is ready to go.  We have already consulted widely with the sector, which had a major input into the Bill.  We are all agreed that it is necessary.  We all want to do the right thing so let us do so without delay.</p>  <p>  The provision of a statutory entitlement to paid leave is an acknowledgement by legislators of the challenges that workers face when trying to escape an abusive relationship.  If we are to end the epidemic of domestic abuse in this State, we need a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects victims.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's legislation provides for up to ten days paid domestic leave for people who are the victims of domestic violence, whatever their gender.  Importantly, workers do not have to provide proof of their abuse or documentary evidence for the leave needed as to do so would potentially act as a barrier to victims seeking the support they need.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the clock is not on.</p></speech>

The provisions in this Bill will enable victims to take the necessary time off work to seek support, find accommodation and attend court in a structured and a supportive environment.</p><p>I will read the words of a survivor of domestic abuse about the difference this Bill would have made and how important it is that we get it through all Stages as quickly as possible.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	As a domestic violence survivor and someone who has gone through the court process, I can honestly say that 10 days paid leave is going to help so many women, it will take away a fear from potentially losing their job to go to court with their perpetrator, this will empower women and I hope encourage employers to support their staff in their court process as it is an extremely difficult process to go through.  Having 10 days will help women so much and relieve some stress for the woman.  This is a huge step forward into making the woman's journey somewhat smoother and less traumatic. </blockquote>  <p>New Zealand, Australia and provinces in Canada have already introduced forms of paid leave.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, recently called on the Government to ratify the International Labour Organization, ILO, Convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work.  Article 18 of the accompanying recommendation identifies the provision of paid leave for the victims of domestic violence, flexible work arrangements and awareness-raising about the effects of domestic violence as appropriate measures to mitigate the impacts of it in the workplace.</p><p>This legislation is an important addition to existing workplace rights.  It is a workers' rights issue.  It is an issue that affects women at work.  It is one that I have seen in the course of my work as a trade union organiser.  It is almost impossible to deal with it without this legislation.  I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing this Bill.  We have legislation on which we have consulted and I want to work with the Minister to get it through the D&aacute;il and Seanad as quickly as possible and make it a reality for the men and women who really need it.  This is important workers' rights legislation.  We do not want to see it deflected or kicked down the road.  A great deal of work has been done on it.  We need to pick up from where we are now and move forward together.</p></speech>

He pulled me down a flight of stairs in front of a waiting room full of patients, told me he had a blade.  He assaulted me in the car park but I managed to get away and call the garda&iacute;.  The following day, my boss called me into her office.  She knew about the assault.  She was upset that I had left the clinic unattended.  She asked me if I wanted to take unpaid or annual leave for my absence from work.  I told her that she could decide and shortly after, I handed in my notice.  I was employed by a hospital with an emergency department, a social work department and access to meaningful intervention.  Instead of being supported I was shamed. </blockquote>  <p>We have to face up to the fact that we have a real problem with domestic and gender-based violence in Ireland and we must do everything we can to support the victims.  When a person is subjected to domestic violence they are robbed of their dignity, confidence and sense of safety.  The trauma seeps into every aspect of their lives, and that includes the victim's working life.  Those who suffer domestic abuse are our colleagues and often our friends.  Some carry the physical and emotional impact of the violence with them into the workplace.  They do so because they fear losing out on badly-needed pay or do not want to run the risk of disruption to their careers.  Many cannot face going to work, some because of physical injuries - the all-too-visible bruises, black eyes and cuts - others because of the deep mental scarring.  As a result they lose income and face aspersions about their reliability.  Others are painfully aware of and understandably sensitive to the stigma that comes with being abused and victimised, especially when it happens at home in the place they should feel safest.</p><p>No victim of domestic violence should have to face such pressures, make such decisions or feel that they have to go to work in the immediate aftermath of being assaulted.  Victims need space.  They need time.  They need understanding so that they can seek medical treatment and psychological help and recover in any way they can from the violence they experience.  Often, they need space and time to make arrangements to escape from the abusive and violent environment in which they find themselves to get away from the beatings and mental abuse.  They should be provided with these supports without having to worry about work, loss of income or damage to their professional reputation.</p><p>The perpetrator of the violence should not be allowed to take any more from the victim.  Nor should it be that a victim's only option is to take annual or unpaid leave.  The last thing a victim of domestic violence needs is the stress of a phone call from their boss, a light pay cheque or even the prospect of losing their job.  They also need privacy and confidentiality.  Being pressured or coerced back into the workplace before they are ready only adds to the distress.  God knows they have enough to worry about, process, deal with and overcome.</p><p>This Bill, which we first moved a year ago, entitles victims of domestic violence to ten days' paid leave.  It is comprehensive and thorough legislation, prepared in consultation with the domestic violence sectors and providing protections for employers in line with those contained in paternity leave legislation.  It is legislation which I am very pleased the Government is supporting.  We wish to engage constructively with the Minister to deliver this vital support for the victims of domestic violence and I sincerely hope that this is what happens.</p></speech>

I have worked for many years in the area of family support.  I was also a member of the Dublin 15 domestic violence subgroup and I have worked with many women who experience domestic violence on a daily basis.  I have seen at first hand the stress and distress of many victims of domestic violence with regard to their jobs.  The fear that if they take another day off, their jobs will be at risk or if they take a sick day, which many are forced to do, they will lose a day's pay that they desperately need to pay rent, put food on the table, pay the mortgage or meet the costs of items they need for Christmas or a confirmation, school clothes for their children and the many other demands faced by families, particularly women, during these times.</p>  <p>  The effects of domestic violence and sexual assault do not stop when the victim leaves the family home to go to work.</p> <p>It affects the victim 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p> <p> I was reading a report today from a service which informs us all about the daily effects of domestic violence.  It states that as a domestic abuse support service, it has listened to many clients who have disclosed how they have experienced domestic violence in their workplace, including stalking, excessive phone calls, threats and being dragged from their desks when working, leaving work early due to a crisis at home and absenteeism due injury or stress.  It also states that victims have left their homes at night with only the clothes on their backs, stayed in a refuge that may be miles away from their support network, and have had multiple court visits to seek specific domestic violence orders.</p> <p> The introduction of a mandatory ten days of statutory paid leave will show the people of the State that we recognise the need to support victims of domestic abuse in the workplace.  The person experiencing abuse will be able to take time out from work without having to worry about losing wages or being forced to take annual leave or sick leave, and it will hopefully end the fear of them losing their jobs.</p></speech>

It proposes to allow for ten days of domestic violence leave.  It is badly needed as the mental, physical and sexual abuse endured by women in particular cannot be overstated and is truly shocking.  Conservative estimates indicate that at least one in four women in Ireland will encounter violence at some stage in her life from a current or former partner.  Domestic violence and coercive control are global problems.  The unprecedented levels of gender-based violence transcend all borders, age groups and socioeconomic groupings.  Gender-based violence causes untold heartache and hardship for families from all walks of life.  There are examples of good practice in other countries, including New Zealand and parts of Australia and Canada, which have introduced paid leave for those who have endured domestic abuse.</p>  <p>  Many women who live with domestic abuse often see their workplace as a safe place.  It is a place where they can get away from a distressing home life.  It can be a vital support in enabling women to leave their abusive partners.  Women who do not work outside the home often find themselves compelled to continue to live in an abusive and controlling situation.  Women are more likely to be working in part-time or precarious work, putting them at greater risk of job and income insecurity if they have to take time off because of their circumstances.  It has been shown that increased absenteeism often results from distressing home situations.  This could be a result of injury, stress or court appearances.  People affected should not have to worry about losing a day's pay and having to take annual leave or risk losing their job as a result of absenteeism in order to deal with intolerable home conditions.</p>  <p>  It is important that employers and managers learn about the signs of domestic violence and how to support employees.  Employers have a duty of care to their employees.  The HSE, in conjunction with a number of domestic violence services, has developed a handbook of guidelines for employers on domestic abuse.  That needs to be made available to all employers to enable them to respond and support employees who are, unfortunately, living in these awful circumstances.  They need to try to make workplaces safe and supportive for those experiencing abusive home situations.</p></speech>

In most cases, we know that women and children are the victims of domestic violence, but sometimes it can be men.  In general, however, it involves women.  They are most vulnerable in these circumstances and find themselves in a catastrophic situation when their only place of refuge is often their workplace.  If they have to take time off work to deal with a terrible situation and there is no support available to them, that is terrible for a modern society.  This Bill goes some distance towards showing that the State recognises and understands that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's support for the Bill and I understand the Government will support it.  I hope it will pass both Houses of the Oireachtas speedily and the legislation will be in place soon.  I respect that the Minister will accept that this is only the start and much more needs to be done in this context.</p>  <p>  Having dealt with people in our constituencies and elsewhere who have been the victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse, we all understand that there is a significant gap in services.  Many services are provided by voluntary and charitable organisations which are struggling to provide a service.  More funding is needed, especially for the refuges which women must go to and which continuously turn people away.  As we approach Christmas, we are conscious that it is a time of year when refuges are under particular pressure.  At this time of year, it would be appropriate for the Minister to consider what assistance he can give to those refuges to ensure they do not have to turn anyone away, especially when we have Covid and there is significant pressure on women and children to try to cope with domestic violence, coercion and the control that abusive people can hold over their lives.  This legislation goes some distance towards doing that.</p>  <p>  We are aware that many of women are in precarious employment and difficult circumstances.  Their job may be the only area of their lives they have any control over.  We need to ensure the workplace is a place of refuge where they feel secure and also that if they have to take time off, they will get some compensation for doing so.  This is sometimes necessary because of physical injury or to try to cope with their situation.  It is welcome that the Minister is supporting this Bill, but much more needs to be done.  As we move into the Christmas period, it is good that we are doing something for this vulnerable group in society.</p></speech>

D&aacute; n-acht&oacute;fa&iacute; an Bille seo, thabharfadh s&eacute; ceart reacht&uacute;il ar shaoire oibrithe maidir le foir&eacute;igean baile agus t&aacute; sin f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach.  I thank my colleagues, Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly, for tabling this important Bill.  I am delighted to see that the Government will support it.</p>  <p>  This is an issue that we can all say has reached pandemic proportions in Ireland.  According to Safe Ireland, one in four women has experienced physical or sexual abuse by a partner or non-partner since the age of 15.  We also know that abused women are twice as likely to experience chronic physical health conditions as non-abused women.  Victims also report higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress disorders, eating disorders and self-harm, and the list goes on.  This shows how essential this legislation will be.</p>  <p>  I can speak about my constituency, Galway West.  The local domestic abuse support services have been vocal about the fact that they are still open.  We need to make it known that they are still open.  People are concerned about this given the pandemic but it should be clear that these services are available to provide support.  We learned at a joint policing committee meeting this week that there has been an increase in the number of barring orders.  The Garda has made it clear that it is willing to help.</p>  <p>  This legislation is extremely important because it will enable victims to take time off work when they need to do so to seek support, find accommodation or attend court.  We have seen similar measures introduced internationally, for example, in New Zealand, Australia and certain parts of Canada.  It is high time that we did it too.  It is upsetting that at a time when we are all asked to stay at home, home for some people, unfortunately, is not a safe place.  We need to ensure we provide all the supports we can and send a strong message from the House tonight that we are all on the side of the victims of domestic abuse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="20:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800044#UU00500"><p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward their proposals for additional support for victims of domestic violence, which allows us an opportunity to debate and discuss this important issue.  In the programme for Government agreed in June, the three Government parties called out the fact that in Ireland, we are experiencing an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  In recent months, it has been incredibly positive to see the focus on the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including the substantive debates that we have had in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and more generally across society, with the support across communities and towns for local domestic violence refuges.</p> <p>The impact of domestic violence on victims and their families can be devastating physically and emotionally and a range of supports is required to help them move away from abusive situations and rebuild their lives.  I have met with many stakeholders and front-line services in the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, sector since taking on my current role as Minister, and have expressed my own personal commitment to doing all that I can to address domestic violence and its effects on families, on victims and on wider society. </p> <p> The economic impact of domestic violence is not always to the forefront of people's minds when they consider the effect on victims but experiencing domestic violence can be a contributing factor to women experiencing homelessness and poverty.  Lack of economic independence can also be a major factor in preventing a victim from leaving an abusive situation.  Support for victims who are working, in the form of paid leave, could be crucial in ensuring that they retain their employment and have the economic capacity to escape an abusive relationship. </p> <p> Among the extensive list of policies contained in the programme for Government that this Government will pursue, is a commitment to investigate the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence.  For this reason, the Government has agreed not to oppose this Private Members' Bill. </p> <p> However there are a number of difficulties, both legal and practical, with the proposals as set out and there are other issues for consideration around how best to make this leave available.  The principles behind the Private Members' Bill are sound, but it is the Government's view that the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is not the best vehicle for such a scheme.  The role of the Workplace Relations Commission would also require close examination.  There are other issues which arise, such as concerns for the privacy of victims who could be obliged to reveal information in order to access the scheme.  Everyone will agree that it is paramount that any leave scheme protects the privacy of victims. </p> <p> Bearing in mind that we must act promptly, I am proposing today that the Government will undertake an examination of paid domestic violence leave and social protection support as we have committed to do in the programme for Government.  This will include a consultation and an examination of the concerns outlined above as well as a review of international best practices referred to by a number of Deputies.  The process will begin immediately and will conclude within six months and I will publish a report setting out the findings.  This will allow us the necessary time to consult widely with victims, with NGOs, with employers and social partners and across Departments to ensure that the proposals coming forward are victim-centred, robust and will work to genuinely help victims while preserving confidentiality. </p> <p> Following on from this examination and based on the findings, I will bring forward legislative proposals for the establishment of a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave.  This legislative proposal will be brought to Government within a further four months of having received the consultation report.  This will represent the delivery of a key element of our programme for Government commitments on DSGBV.  </p> <p> Progress continues on other DSGBV actions.  Responsibility for this issue is shared by a range of Departments and agencies.  The programme for Government commits to an audit of how responsibility for policy, services and other matters related to DSGBV is currently fragmented, with a view to the development of proposals on what infrastructure is needed to ensure that the issue is dealt with as effectively as possible.  The audit will be completed early next year and following it, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I will bring forward an action plan to implement its findings.</p> <p> Tusla is under the remit of my Department and has statutory responsibility for the care of victims of DSGBV.  It supports some 60 organisations nationwide that operate a range of services.  In 2020, my Department provided Tusla with &euro;25.3 million in funding for the provision of DSGBV services.  Two weeks ago, I was pleased to be able to confirm an increase in Tusla's DSGBV allocation in 2021 to a total of &euro;30 million.  This includes &euro;28 million in core funding, which is an increase of &euro;2.7 million and &euro;2 million for Covid-19 contingency supports. </p> <p>Tusla is undertaking a review of emergency accommodation nationwide which will assess current and required distribution of safe emergency accommodation in Ireland.  The findings of the review will inform Tusla's future decisions with regard to the priority areas for investment and the development of services.  This report will be published in April next year and I look forward to acting on its recommendations.  </p> <p> As I mentioned earlier, I have had the opportunity to meet a number of the key NGOs working in the DSGBV sector, and have more meetings scheduled in the new year.  Last Friday, I was privileged to launch the Sonas Annual Report 2019, in its refuge in my own village of Blanchardstown.  As part of this, I had the opportunity to sit down with one of the organisation's clients.  She took me through her personal journey - the coercive control her partner exercised over her; the rare, but still devastating physical abuse; the little steps she took to discover how she could get out; the day she finally left; the level of support offered to her by the NGO; the continuing barriers she faced; the complexity of the legal system; the struggle for money; and the difficulty of locating safe and long-term housing for herself and her family.  This woman's struggle is mirrored everyday in towns and communities all over our country and for far too long, our society turned a blind eye to this.  We are, however, seeing a sea-change in how this issue is approached by our society.</p> <p> This Government will not turn a blind eye to the issue of domestic, sexual and gender- based violence.  In the six months since taking office, we have acted swiftly.  We have significantly increasing funding for domestic violence services; we are conducting an audit of policy responsibility to ensure the best possible response for victims; we are undertaking a review of emergency accommodation capacity, so we can properly target resources; we will pass within the next few weeks legislation to criminalise image-based abuse, legislation that was proposed by an Opposition Deputy; and we are undertaking implementation of the O'Malley report, to support victims of sexual violence both when they are reporting those crimes and through the court system.  All of this represents a strong start, but I know that we have much more to do.  </p> <p> I will conclude now by thanking Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill today, and I look forward to working with Deputies on all sides of the House to ensure anyone at risk of domestic abuse feels safe, secure, and supported.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>

It is obvious and clear that victims need to be given the time to assess their situation and to determine a plan in their own best interests and those of their children.  They may need to move house or schools and, if they are going to stay where they are, they need to develop a safety plan.  They may need to take steps to improve supports around them because not every partner leaves.  Some people choose to stay and we also have to respect that but we need to provide support for them.</p>  <p>  We are beginning to see some cultural change on this as well as some change in our courts and legal proceedings in convictions and assessments.  We have had two convictions for coercive control, one in Donegal and one in Dublin, and a five-year barring order for coercive control in Clare.  Within my own constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire one of my constituents asked me to put on the record that she has received a no access recommendation from a section 47 assessor in a family law case, where the issues of control were at the core of the case.  This was something that I honestly wondered if I would ever see when I made my maiden speech in the D&aacute;il.  It is an extraordinary change and will give confidence to other people who are looking for that type of recommendation in a very controlling situation.  I am not the only person surprised.  Caitriona Gleeson from SAFE Ireland expressed her surprise at a recent Law Society family law conference, as she also wondered if she would ever see a conviction for coercive control in her lifetime and now we have had two. </p>  <p>  The next thing that we really need to watch especially over the Christmas period is the use by perpetrators of welfare checks to continue to exert control.  That occurs in a situation where the victim has left the partner but the partner continues to use the offices of an Garda to check on the welfare of the child, causing enormous distress and disruption to the family.  This can often happen during the Christmas period and indeed on Christmas Day.  This needs to be watched carefully.</p>  <p>  We keep focusing, correctly, on the response of the State, in bringing in this legislation, with multi-annual funding, and with the family law that I have mentioned, all of which we need to do.  At the end of the day this is about perpetrators at home beating the bejesus out of their partners, whether physically or emotionally.  We have to call it out and it simply has to stop.  The State can only do so much and we must get across on a cultural basis that one cannot exert oneself in a controlling or physical way on any other person.  The only way to address this on an intergenerational is through relationship and sexual education.  I drop my son to school and I do not want to be like other parents looking around and wondering who in the next generation are going to be the abused and who are going to be the abusers.</p></speech>

I want to first of all thank my own colleagues, Deputies O&rsquo;Reilly and McDonald, for bringing this Bill forward.  I welcome the fact that we are here and are able to say that this Bill is not being opposed.  That is a good move and step on the topic of domestic violence.  This Bill is about creating opportunities for those who are experiencing domestic violence to address the dangerous situation they are in and to further reduce the stigma that some victims feel.</p> <p>Domestic violence robs people of their dignity and often their health, both physical and mental.  These issues hide in darkness until we, as a society, create opportunities to bring them into the light.  I acknowledge that men experience domestic violence but it is primarily women who are affected.  It obviously has a very serious knock-on effect on children.  One of the main reasons women do not leave a violent partner is because they have nowhere to go and no economic independence.  In some cases, they cannot find a safe environment in which to plan their escape.  Some people experiencing domestic violence can find it hard to hold down a job because of the need to take time off work.  Steady employment plays a vital role in helping because it provides people with economic independence, a support network and the self-esteem derived from performing a valued role and being appreciated.  Therefore, it is crucial that women have an opportunity to hold on to their employment.  It is very difficult to talk about experiencing domestic violence and to leave the domestic setting but it is a matter of having an opportunity to do so.</p> <p>  It is important to state the proposed leave is only one step, but it is important that victims have access to it.  It might even be a helpful first step in addressing the difficulty in that it might be a victim's chance to open up and speak to somebody about what is happening.</p> <p> I support this Bill as a way of helping victims, in a supportive space, to deal with the impact of violence in the home and as a practical mechanism for them to access, during the working day, supports that may not be accessible outside work hours.  We must strive to have a workplace culture so employees will not be afraid or embarrassed to tell human resources about domestic violence concerns and so they will be provided with flexibility do deal with the issues.</p></speech>

I welcome the Government's decision not to oppose it tonight.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to standing up for people who need us and who need this legislation.</p>  <p>  I would like to mention all the individuals and organisations that offer support, including my club, St. Vincent's Camogie Club, and Mr. Liam Cotter from Cork, who is running 100 miles per week for 12 consecutive weeks to raise money for Mn&aacute; Feasa.  Groups and individuals have stepped in to support victims and organisations that support victims where the Government has failed and is not providing enough funding to support them.</p>  <p>  In budget 2021, an allocation of &euro;175,000 was pledged for initiatives for victims of domestic violence and the LGBTI community.  This shows exactly what the Government thinks of the most vulnerable in society.  The LGBTI community and victims of domestic violence should not be lumped together.  These are separate groups in need of separate funds, particularly at a time when the Garda has informed us domestic violence is on the increase.  I know this from attending the policing committees in Cork.  The budgetary measure is an insult to both groups, despite repeated calls for further allocations.</p>  <p>  It is all well and good coming in here and not opposing this Bill tonight but we need Government support.  Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald have stated we want to work with all Deputies, of all parties and none, to get this Bill across the line because it is about supporting victims.  I was contacted by a person who told me they did not go into work, or phoned in sick, because they had marks on their face.  The person was ashamed of going to work.  This legislation will give such a person an opportunity to have the time she or he needs.</p></speech>

Domestic violence services are being put under considerable pressure to meet the demand of people seeking to engage with them.  That is very concerning to all of us.  The failure to invest in these services in recent years and the cuts from a decade ago are still being felt across the sector, and they are being felt by many who need their help.</p>  <p>  Victims presenting to services are being told there are no beds for them, as the Government still fails to meet its commitments under the Istanbul Convention.  This Sinn F&eacute;in legislation provides for an entitlement to annual leave of up to ten days for domestic violence.  This allows victims to take the time off work needed to seek support, find accommodation or attend court in a structured, supportive environment.  It also addresses absenteeism and reduced productivity for employers.  It may sound small but it will go some way towards supporting victims.  In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to exploring the idea of paid leave for victims of domestic violence.  I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing the Bill this evening.</p>  <p>  There is a stigma attached to domestic violence, and this has prevented many from speaking out and seeking help when they are stuck in an abusive relationship.  We need to be having these conversations, and we need to be having them in our workplaces.  Employers need to be more aware of how they can support employees who find themselves in desperate circumstances.</p>  <p>  Along with this legislation, there should be additional steps to ensure victims are given the support and safe environment they need to rebuild their lives and take back control.</p></speech>

According to Women's Aid, one in four women has been abused by a current or former partner.  In 2019 alone, Women's Aid received more than 19,000 disclosures of domestic violence, ranging from emotional abuse to rape.  Domestic violence has a huge impact on the mental health and well-being of the victim, in addition to other family members.  It is not just a matter of the violence because living under the constant threat of violence is emotionally draining and stressful.</p>  <p>  Regular conflict at home destroys and destabilises families, and it can cause severe emotional harm to the children.  The stress and anxiety of living in abusive relationships has caused many victims of domestic violence to turn to alcohol and other drugs as a coping mechanism.  It is not unusual for many victims of domestic violence who have fled the home to end up homeless.</p>  <p>  The effects on children living in this dysfunctional environment can lead to lifelong mental and emotional issues, resulting in depression, anxiety, aggression towards others and an inability to form positive relationships.  It is clear that domestic violence has an impact on a victim's work and concentration in the workplace, affecting both productivity and performance levels.  It can also result in increased absenteeism because of stress or physical injury from the abuse.  This is why this legislation is so important.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation enables Ireland to catch up with those countries that have already introduced paid leave for victims of domestic violence, such as Australia and New Zealand.  It is important that we, too, implement such legislation.  Victims of domestic violence need a period of paid leave to give them breathing space to get out of the toxic environment they are in.  It would allow them time to get the necessary supports they require without having to worry about the pressures of work.  This legislation is not just about the economic cost of domestic violence but it is also about caring for the individual.</p></speech>

We have a progressive piece of legislation from Sinn F&eacute;in in the names of Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald that was first moved a year ago.  It today comes to the House for a Second Reading and the Minister gave a generous response to the legislation and has received sanction from the Cabinet to move on the measures within the Bill.  There may be a small level of disagreement as to how best to proceed but politics works best when the Government shows a level of generosity towards a piece of legislation from the Opposition.  I know that the Minster for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working well with my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill.  We can work collaboratively to improve the lives of the people who sent us here to work for them.<br/><br/>I will refer to a study that issued on 25 November from Women's Aid.  It contains a national survey that gives a picture of the seriousness of the issue that has already been outlined by many Deputies this evening.  Ms Sarah Benson of Women's Aid said:</p><blockquote>	The findings of this national survey show us that we have particularly alarming levels of intimate relationship abuse experienced by young women in this country.  One fifth of young women said they experienced abuse which included emotional abuse, physical violence and sexual assault, stalking and harassment.  Based on our 2016 CSO data this is as many as 44,540 young women (18-25) which is shocking.  Even more troubling is the fact that 51% of young women who had suffered abuse said that it began before their 18th birthday, with just 18 years old being the average age at which the abuse began. </blockquote> <p>Often when Opposition spokespersons stand up, they speak of a lack of movement from Government parties on an issue.  That cannot be said in this case because the Domestic Violence Act 2018 has proved quite successful.  From what I have heard from the agencies to whom I have spoken and the people involved in this sector, there is not really a call to fill legislative gaps, this legislation aside.  Rather, there are issues within the system, including the courts system.  Court issues remain such as the fact that a different judge in family law courts often presides over a particular issue within a case.  Funding and resources can be patchy from county to county, as the Minister will appreciate.  There is potential there for us to work better.<br/><br/>This is an issue of power.  It is a gendered issue and I think it is fair to say that men are the majority of the problem here.  I listened with great interest to what Deputy Carroll MacNeill had to say about the cultural background to the issue.  She mentioned how it can feel to drop one's children to school and hope that there will be some element of education within the school building to challenge this type of dynamic and power imbalance.  All of us have to challenge some of the norms that we have inherited in this country and see if they stand up to scrutiny.  <br/><br/>I have touched on the following issue before and there does not seem to be much of an appetite to change what I am about to speak to.  We should be serious about eliminating all the elements in our society that lead to gender inequality and situations where there can be a warped sense of power, particularly within men.  That has not been confined to history and anybody who speaks on an issue that predominantly affects women will be contacted by men of all generations who have a warped sense of their role in society.  We have a disproportionate number of schools in Ireland that are segregated on a gender basis.  Some 17% of Irish primary school children attend single-gender primary schools.  That is not a huge amount but it is completely out of kilter with the European norm.  One third of our second level schools are single gender.  Nobody can convince me that part of the problem is not the fact that we disproportionately separate children on the basis of their gender in the education system.  The Department has not given sanction to a new single-gender school since 1998.  It is not Department policy to give any new school that status and it has not happened for more than 20 years.  However, one third of young people attend second level schools that are either all-male or all-female.  <br/><br/>What people say to me when they try to defend the system is that girls do better in all-girl settings.  That, at least, is the accepted, passed-down understanding of why they should be supported.  I think that assumption is open to challenge because what happens with all-male and all-female second level school settings is that these issues of domestic violence, power, sexual assault and image-based sexual assault among young people cannot be challenged when students are being taught in two different buildings and not learning in the same space.  A toxic masculinity can grow in a single-gender male school.  I am not in any way suggesting that every school is like this, or that it is not called out in all-male second level schools, or that considerable efforts are not being made in all our educational facilities to stamp out this type of toxic viewpoint or attitude.  However, when compared with progressive countries in Europe and around the world, the idea of unquestioningly pursuing this accepted norm of separating children on the basis of gender does not stand up to scrutiny.  It leads to a society that is very gendered and views the other gender with a slight level of curiosity or insecurity.  It leaves people lacking an ability to interact properly.  Within that can arise a situation where power and dominance are sought.  An entire school that is built around a dressing room culture of what boys say to boys and young men say to young men has to be challenged.<br/><br/>I do not say this in order to be provocative or destructive.  I say it because it is worthy of us to always drill down into the root causes of toxic masculinity and explore why the issue appears to be getting worse in Ireland.  Women's Aid has illustrated that many young women are suffering.  People born since the year 2000 are going through this so it is not an old phenomenon that we are still dealing with from old attitudes.  I have no idea how much time I have left.</p></speech>

It is incredibly refreshing to be here this evening and witnessing what is being achieved by the Government and the Opposition together.  What the Minister is doing with legislation around image-based sexual assault and the various different issues around that is refreshing.  We hope it will be called "Coco's law".  More of this is needed.  It is worthy of us to better drill down into the State-sponsored segregation of genders in our school system, to challenge it and try to find ways to overcome it.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of a consultation which will lead to the establishment of domestic violence leave.  This is one of the issues that we are all in agreement with so I hope we can move this Bill forward quickly and to coincide with the Minister&rsquo;s consultation process to reach the best outcome for victims and survivors.</p>  <p>  Domestic violence and abuse continues to be a horrific issue in Irish society.  Safe Ireland has referred to it as the shadow pandemic.  During the first six months of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in people fleeing domestic violence, with 3,450 women and 589 children contacting domestic violence services for the first time.  West Cork Women against Domestic Violence, which provides vital services for victims in my area, saw a 35% increase in calls.  This legislation represents the type of practical support that people fleeing violence and abuse need.</p> <p>For too long, domestic violence has been treated as a private matter which does not impact on work life.  That is obviously untrue.  Domestic abuse and violence results in unimaginable physical and psychological impacts which affect all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives.   It also recognises that financial abuse is a very real, but under-reported, feature of domestic abuse.  The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland highlights that 94% of survivors experience financial abuse, while employment sabotage is experienced by 78% of survivors.  </p> <p> Recognition by the State of these particular forms of abuse is essential to address this epidemic.  The International Labour Organization highlights the need for leave that addresses economic dependence on the perpetrator, which makes the victims more vulnerable helps people attend court hearings, seek counselling and obtain medical help, and assists in moving people to a safe environment.  Providing leave ensures that victims do not find themselves in the situation of having to choose between leaving their abuser and keeping their job.</p> <p> The legislation before us provides for these supports with a statutory entitlement of up to ten days' domestic violence paid leave, as well as granting time to find accommodation or attend court as required.  Several jurisdictions have comparable leave structures which we can learn from.  A briefing paper the Oireachtas Library and Research Service provided for me outlines the range of entitlements in Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand and the Philippines.  We can learn from their schemes to introduce the type of victim-centred supports we need.  For example, Australia&rsquo;s provisions are open to all employees, including part-time and casual employees.  Newfoundland in Canada legally recognises the broad range of harmful and abusive acts which make up domestic violence, while in Alberta, Canada, leave is possible if employees, their dependants or a vulnerable adult in their care experiences domestic violence.  </p> <p> While we have agreement on this issue, there are many other challenges that need addressing and I will use my remaining time to focus on some of them.  First, the principle underlying this Bill and the Minister's announcement is that victims need specialised supports.  This means we need more flexibility in State services than is currently provided.  We know financial abuse is an issue, which means social welfare payments that are primarily given to one partner or are means tested on both people do not consider the complexities of financial abuse.   The unnecessary requirement for a public services card or proof of address implies the victim has access to these and fails to consider a controlling and abusive family member.  Regrettably, public services can be a hostile environment for vulnerable people and this puts them at greater risk to forms of domestic abuse.  People with disabilities or elderly people could be dependent on their abusers for transport, mobility or even care.  Undocumented migrants or those with little English are also especially vulnerable and are often hesitant to come forward to police and other State services for fear of deportation.  We desperately need firewalls separating immigration authorities and health and social services from the Garda.  </p> <p> Second, these specialised services need to be properly resourced and trained.  Many workers in housing departments, public health settings and even members of the Garda do not have adequate training to properly interact with and understand the needs of victims of domestic abuse and violence.  Local authorities need multidisciplinary teams to respond to the need of individuals presenting as, or showing signs of, domestic abuse.  There needs to be more specialised garda&iacute; in each division who are trained to respond to people who are the victims of these horrific crimes.  </p> <p> Third, we need to greatly increase our funding for support organisations.  The Council of Europe&rsquo;s standards on this outline that the majority of the support services should be provided by specialist women&rsquo;s NGOs, which have provided the most responsive and effective services enabling women to realise their rights, to live free from violence and to overcome its debilitating effects.  I have spoken to a number of organisations dealing with victims of domestic violence who tell me that they receive no multiannual funding.  The year-to-year nature of the funding on which their very existence depends makes medium- or long-term strategic planning impossible.  Everything is focused on immediate service provision and short-term survival.  These organisations have also spoken to me about how difficult it is to retain staff when many have not even received a cost of living increase in the last ten years.  They need strategic and consistent support.  They are the experts with the skills and networks to help victims and vulnerable people.  </p> <p> Under the Istanbul convention, we are meant to provide one refuge space for victims of domestic violence per 10,000 people.  Ireland instead provides one space per 10,000 women.  Needless to say this means we provide 50% fewer spaces than recommended and we are the only country in Europe that interprets the recommendations in this way.  This needs to be addressed immediately.</p> <p> I will make two closing points on the consultation process.  First, it has to be as inclusive as possible.  The Department will have to engage with groups and organisations proactively.  We cannot rely solely on overstretched services and survivors writing long submissions.  We have to go to them and meet them where they are.  It needs an innovative and empathetic process that can give groups and victims confidence that they are being supported.  Second, we need to look at having interim emergency payments in the meantime.  We have all outlined horrific aspects of domestic violence.  We all know it is happening and we know it is happening tonight.  If we recognise the need for domestic violence leave, we also need to work with the Minister for Social Protection to immediately put in place a temporary measure.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for putting this Bill down and it is very good news that the Government will not oppose it.  That is welcome.  We have talked about this subject frequently in the recent past, notably in relation to Covid and the huge spike in domestic violence incidents, and people and families seeking refuge in difficult circumstances.  We also talked about it in relation to the abuse images we saw recently and which we will deal with next week when the Bill goes to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  This Bill is different, insofar as it is a workers' rights issue.  That is important because of all the aspects of, in particular, women's lives that a violent relationship seeks to control, whether it concerns who they see, who their friends are, when they see their family, what they eat, what they wear or how they spend their time.  A huge amount of coercive control and questioning goes on around when they leave the home to go to work.  The workplace should be a place where they are guaranteed they can be safe and I heard Deputy McDonald's illustration of that lack of safety.  It is also a place where she - I use the word "she" rather than "them" because it is overwhelmingly women and their children who are affected by this - gets economic independence from an abusive or violent relationship.  That economic independence is paramount and to lose that will drive the individual further into depression, anxiety and a sense of lack of self-worth.  Her job would be under threat if she took leave due to domestic violence.  The Bill is very important in that sense.  It protects the rights of workers to have leave to deal with the fallout from a traumatic experience in life.</p>  <p>  The other aspect of the trauma that this House needs to address urgently is the question of housing and alternative safe accommodation for families who have to leave a violent situation.  As it stands, homeless services do not recognise domestic abuse as an emergency and a family is not entitled to immediate choices of alternative accommodation because there is a violent issue in the background.  I had a good friend who retired early from servicing the courts with women who had to seek barring orders precisely because she felt desperate that each day she was driving victims back into the arms of their abusers because there was no alternative accommodation for them.  We need to address that urgently.</p>  <p>  As has been said, there is a wider issue in our society about how women are regarded and why violence against women is so prevalent, often leading to murder and very serious consequences.  That wider national campaign around domestic violence and gender equality has to begin.  We have a huge duty in this House to make sure that it happens and that we educate future generations around the issues of control, violence and, in particular, consent and rape.  Here the House has an obligation.  In January, we will come to the second anniversary of the implementation of the Bill as a consequence of repealing the eighth amendment.  There were two particular recommendations in that.  One was to work towards the availability of free contraception.  Probably even more important was the question of having non-ethos-based sex education in our schools.  Deputy Paul Murphy will speak to that because he had a Bill before the House on that issue.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We need to move towards non-ethos-based sex education urgently.  Otherwise, we will have no impact on a toxic culture in which a whole cohort of our population believe they have permission to abuse and be violent towards women.<br/><br/>This is an important Bill on workers' rights.  We welcome it and will support it all the way.</p></speech>

It is vital that the State provides paid leave from work for those victims of domestic violence who need it.  This is the case in New Zealand and a number of other countries around the world.  There are many reasons for which those suffering from such abuse would need time off work - to move house, get legal or mental health supports, and continue being financially independent.  It is unfortunate that, too often, survivors of domestic violence lose their jobs due to the abuse they suffer.  Research conducted in the state of Maine in the US found that an incredible 60% of survivors reported losing their jobs due to the abuse, with many being fired by their bosses.  This is why it is a workers' rights issue.  The current situation is not acceptable.  It is about time we supported victims of domestic violence.  Providing paid leave for the time they need off work is the least that can be done.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss a provision in the Bill.  We can deal with it on Committee Stage, which I hope we will reach as soon as possible, but there is an issue with how it is presented whereby employees should give notice "as soon as is reasonably practicable" and that notification to the employer shall "contain a statement of the facts entitling the employee to domestic violence leave."  This is problematic.  While I will support the Bill on Second Stage, this matter must be addressed.  It would place a significant obligation on workers to hand over confidential and sensitive information to their employers.  The Bill makes it an offence for an employer not to maintain that confidentiality, but there are no penalties specified as far as I can see.  It would be better to have a system based on the idea that we trust victims and workers - a system based on self-certification - rather than on forcing workers to hand over sensitive information to bosses where there is already an uneven power imbalance.  That set-up could be abused.  The Bill could propose that disputes be dealt with by the Workplace Relations Commission like other disputes.</p>  <p>  We have probably discussed domestic violence more over the past six months than we have in any previous six-month period.  That is a reflection of the unfortunate increase in domestic violence during the pandemic as well as the increase in political attention being paid to the issue.  It is essential that this issue be brought into the light and discussed fully.  For too long, it was brushed under the carpet.  Everyone knew it happened, but people understated the horror of it and there was an absence of will to tackle it.  We know that almost one in six women and one in 16 men in Ireland has experienced severe domestic violence from a partner.  The figures are even higher when all physical and sexual violence is included.  It is a crisis and it demands an urgent response.</p>  <p>  The Government's response has been lacking.  We have one third the number of refuge spaces recommended by the Council of Europe.  Saoirse Women's Refuge in my area is forced to undertake its own fundraising to get the funds it needs to carry out its work.  This is not acceptable and should not be happening.  Women's Aid reports that, of the people who called its helpline looking for refuge spaces, half were unable to find a space.  There is no question that Ireland is a rich country.  It is the fifth richest in the world per GDP, but the Government is more concerned about protecting billionaires from taxes than it is in investing in and supporting victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  I started the clock when Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith started, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

I will finish with a point referenced by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  The outpouring of anger through movements like #MeToo, #SueMePaddy and #IBelieveHer shows that people are not willing to accept the injustice and oppression of the past.  There is a fight for change in the law and a challenging of the patriarchal culture that gives confidence to sexism and violence against women.  A crucial part of this will be objective sex education.  I understand that a new curriculum will be proposed in the next month or so, but the fundamental problem that is the barrier of ethos is not being addressed.

Not only must they deal with the abuse as it is occurring, which must be a devastating experience, but they must also get the help they require, which is far easier said than done.  While doing some research on the topic, I was alarmed by the prevalence of domestic abuse and violence that was reported in 2019.  I was even more alarmed to learn that the figures were much higher in 2020.  In fact, the recently published Safe Ireland report shows that calls to its helpline increased steadily and daily over the course of the Covid-19 restrictions.  According to the Women's Aid 2019 annual report, there were 19,258 disclosures of domestic violence against women and 20,763 contacts with Women's Aid's direct services.  There were 12,742 incidents of emotional abuse, 3,873 incidents of physical abuse and 2,034 incidents of financial abuse disclosed.  In the same year, 609 incidents of sexual abuse were disclosed, including 288 rapes.</p>  <p>  Domestic abuse can take many different forms.  My mind is immediately drawn to the physical violence, but domestic abuse can also include threats, intimidation, manipulation, neglect, financial control, domineering behaviour and other threatening and controlling behaviours.</p>  <p>  The National Crime Council found that one in seven women had experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some point in her life.  Its survey estimated that 213,000 women had been severely abused by a partner.  These figures display the extent of the problem.  Unfortunately, studies show that domestic violence is usually not a one-off event.  It often involves a sustained pattern of abuse and manipulative behaviour that many victims can find difficult to escape.  While the evidence shows that women are more likely to be the victims of domestic abuse, we must not forget that there are men who find themselves victims of domestic abuse.  Almost 6% of men experience domestic abuse while the figure for women is 15%.  These are worrying numbers.  It is clear that this issue affects men and women.  Therefore, we need to ensure that the support systems are for both.</p>  <p>  We must remember the significant impact of domestic violence on children.  Unfortunately, they can also be the victims of such abuse.  Even in cases where they are not the direct targets of the abuse, they experience the consequences, which can affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>  <p>  The Wexford Women's Refuge provides 24-hour crisis accommodation for women and children experiencing domestic abuse in their homes.  On admission, many families present with little or no personal belongings.  The recommended period for a woman and her family to stay in the refuge is eight to ten weeks.  However, the refuge only has two rooms available currently.  During the Covid pandemic, the demand for beds has risen, but the number of bed spaces has reduced.  Any reduction in the supply of beds for victims of domestic violence is disastrous.</p> <p>According to a report in <i>The Wexford People </i>in June, the Wexford Women's Refuge had to reduce its accommodation capacity from five families to one family due to the communal toilets and bathrooms.  I understand its capacity is now for two families.<br/><br/>We need more services for people in these situations.  Those involved in providing the service and working in the women's refuge in County Wexford do Trojan work but they need to be supported and they need the resources to meet the demand.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reported a 36% increase in the number of domestic abuse cases in County Wexford over the past year.  I have often mentioned in speeches and interviews the second-line effects of Covid-19 restrictions.  Domestic abuse and domestic violence are areas where the consequences of restrictions are worrying.  The Safe Ireland report finds that Covid-19 restrictions led to a number of barriers to victims trying to escape abusive situations.  Problems were reported, particularly with regard to travel restrictions, accommodation issues and social isolation.<br/><br/>I would, therefore, like to see increased supports for the sector and see victims being able to avail of supports as soon as they need them.  More important, however, we need to ensure that this sector is safeguarded from the negative effects of any further Covid-19 restrictions.  I will discuss this in greater detail tomorrow along with the mental health aspects but this is a good opportunity to remind the Government that we need to take a holistic approach to dealing with many of these problems because, in most cases, they are linked.  We do not want this problem to get worse as it can often lead to a cycle of other issues for the victims, including substance misuse, psychological damage and trust issues for both the victims and any children involved.<br/><br/>We must also remember the abusers need support and rehabilitation.  They may have an underlying issue, for example, a substance misuse issue.  They may need medical intervention, psychological intervention, behavioural therapy and education with a view to trying to prevent them from reoffending.  I am, therefore, calling on this problem to be looked at from all angles.<br/><br/>Finally, a message to those who may be currently experiencing domestic abuse is seek help in any way they can from the garda&iacute;, local support services, a trusted friend or family member.  Do not suffer in silence.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe one in three women in Ireland is affected by domestic violence.  It is not confined to class, age, race, sexuality, religion or disability.</p>  <p>  Reading again through speeches given by Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald in debates in November, I have learned the legislation brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in is for ten days of domestic violence paid leave.  This enables the victims to take the time they need to seek support, find accommodation or attend court.  This can be a traumatic time for victims who are often vulnerable.  When a person has a supportive employer, he or she should feel he or she is more cared for in the community.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the debate is being opened up by creating workplace awareness of domestic abuse.  I welcome also the three Rs approach for employers, that is, recognise, respond and refer.  This is certainly a useful template with which to start.  I have listened to all the debates this evening and all I have heard is employer-employee.  Domestic violence does not stop with the employer and employee.  Domestic violence can be one parent working in the home.</p>  <p>  I commend this Bill but it does not go far enough.  People who are self-employed or who are in a one-income family suffer from domestic violence.  Housewives and househusbands are suffering from domestic violence.  Therefore, if we must have legislation, it must cover everybody, whether working or self-employed, a househusband or housewife or whatever a person works at.  There must be a system where no matter what, people can avail of a service that can help them and their families and protect them and their lives.  That is what we need.  I would, therefore, propose an amendment to cover all people, no matter what employment they are in or even if they are not employed.</p>  <p>  I come from a rural background.  For many years, a housewife could be at home depending on an income coming in, whether from a farm or from whatever business the family is in.  We must, therefore, get this right so it covers people who are not even in employment, or who are employed within their own homes caring for their children and have made the selfless act to do so.  We must make sure everyone who is vulnerable and suffering from domestic violence, even if he or she is not an employee or is self-employed or unemployed, can avail of the services.  I would like to see the Government get this right.  We must have supports for every single person who is suffering domestic violence.  There must be a gender balance.  No matter what situation a person is in, this must include everyone to make sure people know they can make that call, whether it is to a helpline, to get to where they need to go or to have an income to support them while they are going through this traumatic experience.  I am, therefore, asking the Government to make sure amendments are made so that this covers everyone.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, as it is definitely a step in the right direction, but we must make sure everyone who suffers from domestic violence is covered, regardless of whether he or she is an employee, an employer or otherwise.</p></speech>

I am especially pleased the Government will not oppose the proposal.  This Bill will be warmly welcomed by victims of domestic violence who work outside the home.  The figures on domestic violence in Ireland are shocking.  We have heard them quoted several times tonight.  Approximately 15% of women and 6% of men have suffered severe domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Of course, as we are all aware, it is even more shocking that during the Covid-19 lockdown those numbers increased significantly.  I believe the number of extra calls to Women's Aid and other groups increased by something like 25%.  It is worthwhile saying that during the lockdown, real efforts were made by garda&iacute; and advocacy groups and by the Government with the extension of the temporary rent supplement to victims of domestic violence, to allow people to escape the terror of their homes.</p>  <p>  While it is not the issue in question here, the fact that many counties, including my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal and, in fact, whole swathes of this country, do not have dedicated refuges is a disgrace.  I know the Minister is determined to do something about this but we need to do something as quickly as possible.</p> <p>As I said, I am pleased that the Government will work with the Opposition and stakeholders to put legislation in place to ensure two weeks' paid leave for victims of domestic violence.  This will give a small window of opportunity to victims to try to manage their lives.</p> <p> Very often, the income that domestic violence victims have is their only opportunity to exert any control over their lives and those of their families.  The loss of any income because victims are unable to work simply adds to the cruelty and awfulness of their circumstances.  It is also important to remember that many victims may be in precarious employment and, therefore, any absence or inability to work or to deal with on-demand or shift work, split hours and so on may compound their situation.  The terror that many victims experience at home is just exacerbated by their fear that they might lose their jobs, and, unfortunately, some do.  Sometimes victims of domestic abuse are too ashamed to go to work because of the visible signs of abuse.  Sometimes they need time to see their solicitor, go to court or just get a little support from family members and friends.  It just gives them breathing space.</p> <p> When we implement the measures in the Bill, we will be stepping up to the mark in regard to some of the recommendations from ILO Convention No. 190.  It calls for, among other measures, paid leave for victims of domestic violence, flexible work arrangements and protection for victims, temporary protection against dismissal, and the inclusion of domestic violence in workplace risk assessments.  Perhaps when we examine the Bill, we will examine some of the points I raised and consider including them as amendments.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Sinn F&eacute;in as ucht an mBille seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur ina choinne.  Is maith an rud &eacute; sin agus is c&eacute;im chun cinn dearfach &iacute;.  &Aacute;fach, seo an dara uair laistigh de tr&iacute; sheachtain go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi fhor&eacute;igean baile.  Cuireann s&eacute; olc orm go bhfuilimid f&oacute;s ag caint faoi gan beart a dh&eacute;anamh agus gan dul i ngleic leis an bhfadhb seo.  Ag eascair as an bhfadhb seo, t&aacute; impleachta&iacute; tromch&uacute;iseacha do na mn&aacute;, do na p&aacute;ist&iacute;, do na clainne agus don gheilleagar i gcoitinne.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go mion minic agam, taobh amuigh den chostas &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; s&iacute;ceola&iacute;ochta agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte, t&aacute; costas i gceist don gheilleagar de &euro;2.5 billi&uacute;n in aghaidh na bliana gach bliain.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate and thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.  It concerns one aspect of a subject that we need to tackle because of the damage it does.  It is insidious on every level to women - primarily, they are women - children, families and the economy.  The figure I mention repeatedly, of &euro;2.5 billion every year, has a staggering impact on the economy.  This is our second debate on domestic violence in three weeks.  On the previous occasion, there were statements, including from the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and she gave us a written copy of her contribution, and now we are debating the Bill.  Nevertheless, we are still talking about it and we do not have enough basic refuge spaces.  The most basic thing, if we are serious about tackling domestic violence, is to have to enough safe places, because that is one of the major hindrances to dealing with domestic violence.  The second is economic dependence and Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill deals partly with that, which I welcome.  I acknowledge the bona fides of both Ministers but those bona fides will be sorely tested if they do not act.</p>  <p>  Three audits have been promised, one of which will be conducted by Tusla, although I am not sure why it is necessary because we know there is a shortage of spaces.  I am not sure why it will take a few months for the agency to do it but I welcome the fact that it is going to examine what spaces are necessary.  There will also be reviews of the Bill and of the fragmentation of the services, which the Minister indicated will be completed in March.  I welcome all that as long as it is done with a view to urgent action and to dealing with domestic violence.  It must make clear that we will not put up with this, that it is simply not acceptable and that we will take the necessary steps to deal with it.</p>  <p>  The UN Secretary General has talked about the surge in domestic violence, and for me, his words caught the way that we have treated domestic violence.  He called for a ceasefire, as if that would be helpful or as if those words would appeal to any man's ears.  On the other hand, he called for urgent action.  It captures for me the constant contradiction in every government's approach to domestic violence.  I hope the Minister will make a difference and I acknowledge she has put it at the top of her list.  I will work with her, monitor her and force her to deal with domestic violence.  We have to deal with it because we cannot even begin to talk about gender equality or an economy that is thriving when that level of violence is going on.</p>  <p>  We were told at the previous meeting of the joint policing committee in Galway that there has been a 37% increase in the number of domestic incidents the county.  I wish they would stop using words such as "domestic incidents".  They minimise what we are talking about.  There was no follow-up, not because the Garda was at fault but because there was nothing it could do.  Part of that problem is that there is no place for the women to go to.  There is a complete shortage of spaces.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, Claire Loftus, stated there has been an 87% increase thus far this year in the number of files submitted to her office.  Some 3,500 women contacted a domestic violence service for the first time during the initial lockdown.  We have all these figures.</p>  <p>  I do not like repetition but I reiterate that I really want to see action after the release of the three various reports.  The most basic thing would be to roll out enough refuge spaces as the most minimum requirement.</p></speech>

Christmas is fast approaching, and for all of us, it will be a different kind of Christmas for the reasons we know.  While it may be different, for the vast majority of us it will still be a joyous occasion.  I, along with all Deputies, am acutely aware that for many people, this can be a time of additional fear and dread.  The domestic violence services anticipate a surge in demand in the run-up to Christmas.  While we may be thinking about how we can hide our presents for our loved ones, many people are hiding emotional, physical, psychological and financial abuse at the very hands of those who are supposed to be their loved ones.  They are completely isolated from their family, friends or abusive partner.</p>  <p>  It is this type of abuse and violence that we want to prevent by providing supports for victims, something I have personally prioritised.  I want to do more and to work with every Member of the House, including the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and other colleagues, to do that.  We are committed to working collaboratively, not just with colleagues in government but throughout the community and voluntary sector and with partners, to ensure that our response is based on prevention and support and that it is underpinned by a robust legal system that supports victims.</p> <p>This Government is determined to deliver on all elements of support, be it practical, physical, emotional or legal.  At the same time we have to ensure the perpetrators know that we will not stop until they are brought to justice.  We have made a number of commitments, and we intend to keep to them, in the programme for Government around the provision of paid leave, providing that financial support for those who cannot work because of domestic violence.  I welcome the Minister's response this evening.  There are commitments around social protection supports, some of which Deputy Cairns has outlined already.</p> <p> The programme for Government commits to an independent audit of how services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are segmented across the Government agencies.  It is important that we do this.  This audit will, I hope, help us to build a more comprehensive and more efficient system for ensuring that anyone facing domestic abuse can access that high-quality support.  The audit will be completed next March and I can assure Deputies that we will collectively act on it.  Our third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will also be developed before the end of 2021, and we are conducting a review of the implementation of the second strategy so far to make sure that nothing is left behind.</p> <p> Education and awareness are also key, both to ensuring victims know where and how to access supports and to changing societal needs.  My Department is running a number of campaigns and we are also working on a national consent campaign to be launched next year.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in talked about women's aid and Ms Sarah Benson talking about a particular piece of research recently, the launch of which I attended.  It is frightening to see the statistics, particularly among our younger people, and the amount of violence that is already there in some of the younger relationships.  It is important that we focus on consent and that we talk to younger people at a much earlier age.</p> <p> Raising awareness through campaigns, such as Still Here and No Excuses, leads to increased calls for support services, but when an individual, be it a woman or a man, takes the brave step to seek help, we need to be there.  We need to make sure the services and the supports are there for them.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's commitment in this regard this evening in the area of domestic violence leave.</p> <p> Ensuring a high standard of support services for victims of crime throughout the State is provided for in Supporting a Victim's Journey, the plan that I recently published to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases.  As part of this plan we also will map a victim's journey and examine how we can broaden our grants system.  The implementation of the plan is a decisive step forward in ensuring the criminal and justice systems are victim centred.  We have work to do but we have implementation meetings happening this week with all the agencies and with the community and voluntary sector to make sure that this work is done, that we do not merely publish reports and that we actually implement the recommendations.  When implemented, I hope that they will also encourage victims to come forward, reassured in the knowledge that they will be supported, listened to, informed and treated respectfully throughout the entire process.  Supporting a Victim's Journey also provides for specific training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Judiciary and lawyers so that they can better understand a victim's perspective but, most importantly, their needs.</p> <p> Next week we hope to pass the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, which I intend to refer to as "Coco's law".  Many of us are very much aware of the tragic case of the late Ms Nicole Fox Fenlon and the tireless work of her mother.  Jackie has campaigned for years to honour her daughter's memory to strengthen the law so that others can be safer.  The Bill would prevent the sharing of intimate images without consent regardless of the motivation for doing so.  This is abuse.  It should be stopped.  I thank all Deputies for their co-operation in the assistance of passing this through the House as quickly as possible.</p> <p> I truly believe that this Government will put in place the systems and structures needed to deliver on our commitment to stamp out the scourge of domestic violence.  We are working on many policies in this area.  I look forward to working with all Deputies in this House and in the Seanad to bring about much-needed change and reform in this area.</p></speech>

It is clear that we all share concerns around domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The impacts this can have on victims cannot be underestimated, whether physical or emotional and often economic.  It is important to consider, too, the impact domestic violence has on children who may be witnessing the abuse.  They can often be forgotten victims.  As UNICEF stated in its recent report, Behind Closed Doors, &quot;Some of the biggest victims of domestic violence are the smallest.&quot;  It undoubtedly has an emotional impact on children and can have a devastating impact on their childhood.  As the same UNICEF report states:</p> <blockquote> 	... children who are exposed to violence in the home may suffer a range of severe and lasting effects.  Children who grow up in a violent home are more likely to be victims of child abuse. </blockquote>  <p>As the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, set out in his remarks, the Government is committed to undertaking &quot;an examination of paid domestic violence leave and social protection support&quot;.  This is part of the programme for Government.  As part of this process, there will be a consultation process to take on board the views and experiences of victims, their families and organisations which provide support and services.  We will also examine how other countries have addressed this serious issue and how best to address the practical concerns around introducing this kind of leave.  A report will be published which will outline the findings of the examination and which will point the way to the next steps.  Subsequent to this, legislative proposals will be brought to Government on the establishment of a statutory entitlement to paid domestic violence leave.</p><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this Bill and for generating the discussion.  I hope the victims of abuse and their families will be able to access the support they need in the future and I invite them to share their experiences and views with any consultations.  We need to hear from those most affected to develop a system which can address their needs for them and their families.  It cannot be a system without their input.</p></speech>

We have had mother and baby homes, industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and the hush-hush trips to England.  Domestic violence is one of the last unmentionable secrets.</p>  <p>  Men get hammered too, but for them it is usually even more secret.  It is mostly women who get and take their beatings, and the threats, the kicks, the punches, the burning, the taunting and the raping.  As I stated here last month, women lie on the floor grateful that if himself is laying into them, he is leaving the children alone, but of course, he is not.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, alluded to it there a minute ago.  Children bear the invisible scars that show themselves in worry, anxiety and sadness, and, sadly, it is stored up for the future in which it will express itself.</p>  <p>  We have all known the particular purple of a fist against an eye, the blue of a blow to a jaw, the hand prints around the neck and the branding of a woman.  Women and men need leave to recover from that physical violence.  They need domestic violence leave so that their injuries are not the social semaphore of their humiliation, their endangerment and their suffering.  Above all, they need domestic violence leave to start healing the invisible injuries they carry inside - the terror, the disgust and, for some, a misplaced shame.  That shame does not belong to the victim.  That shame is wholly owned by the perpetrator.</p>  <p>  The tenderest and the life-changing injuries inflicted on a victim of relationship violence are often psychological.  I commend my comrades, Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly, on bringing forward this Bill and on bringing this subject into the light.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, stated that it has been discussed, and it certainly has since I was elected.  That is good to see because the silence is how shame keeps living on.  Let us not delay giving our citizens who have suffered violence in their relationships domestic violence paid leave and help give them the privacy and dignity that they need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800052#CCC00500"><p>Last December, with my party leader, Deputy McDonald, I was proud to introduce the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2019.  Today, we can progress this issue much further.  I strongly believe we must advance this much further.  Therefore, I very much welcome Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy McDonald's Bill.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has cruelly exposed the issue of domestic abuse as a real problem that needs addressing.  Domestic violence is a problem that has always been with us.  It is not a problem for one socioeconomic group or ethnicity.  It affects many people across our society.</p>  <p>  Safe Ireland issued a report in November regarding domestic violence in Covid times.  It showed that 1,970 women and 411 children were receiving help from a domestic violence service each month during the period of March to August.  The same report indicated that there was a 25% increase in calls to the service's helpline when measured against 2018.</p>  <p>  The first lockdown was hard for all of us, but imagine being trapped in a home without reprieve with somebody who is violent towards the person?  All the services in Limerick tell me that domestic abuse has increased exponentially during Covid-19.  As of November this year, there were 273 reports of domestic violence in Limerick, of which 80% of the victims were women.</p> <p>In 2016, the figure for the whole year stood at 213 incidents.</p> <p> The provision of statutory entitlement to paid leave is an acknowledgement by legislators of the challenges faced by workers in trying to escape an abusive relationship.  If we are to end this epidemic of violence, we need a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects victims.  The Bill, which I am glad the Government proposes to support, will allow for time off from work in order that victims can get the support they need, find alternative accommodation if they have nowhere to stay and attend court appointments.  The challenges facing victims are massive when the violence they experience takes place in their own home and they have the additional pressures of worrying about attending work while trying to pursue all that is necessary to remove themselves from an unsafe environment.  This Bill will add to existing work-based rights and give victims time to seek the support they need in the confidence that their employment is secure.</p> <p> Coercive control, as recognised under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, can lead to abusers focusing their efforts on a partner's workplace for the purpose of ending his or her employment.  I have met people in that situation.  Legislators and employers have a responsibility to respond to this avenue of abuse by putting in place the necessary workplace and employment rights and protections for victims.  I very much welcome the Bill and commend it to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="21:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800053#DDD00200"><p>This has been a very important debate.  The people watching it may include some who are experiencing domestic abuse.  They are more likely to be women.  They will see a unanimity of purpose from their political representatives on this issue, given that the Government is not opposing our proposals in this legislation.  That is really important.  However, I would prefer if the Government were supporting the Bill rather than simply not opposing it.  I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this not a motion or a proposal; it is legislation.  It was written in consultation with the OPLA, advocacy groups, survivors and workers' representatives.  That is how legislation must be devised.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is right about the need for consultation, but I put it to him that we have already engaged in a huge amount of consultation.  To reiterate, we have spoken to survivors, advocacy groups, legal experts and workers' representatives.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that the principles of the legislation are sound, for which I thank him, but he added that "the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is not the best vehicle for such a scheme".  I was very alarmed to hear his colleague express the view that "The State can only do so much".  In fact, the State has a responsibility for the granting and maintenance of statutory entitlements to leave, which is what this Bill is proposing, and the Organisation of Working Time Act is exactly the place for it to be done.  As someone who practised industrial relations - some might say that if I had ever practised it, I would have got good at it - I understand how the world of employment works and how domestic abuse and domestic violence can impact on an worker.  This Bill is not intended to be a panacea.  The Government holds the purse strings and has the money to fund shelters properly and ensure women and men are not turned away.  This Bill is intended to address domestic abuse as a workers' rights issue, which it is.</p>  <p>  Anybody who has worked alongside someone experiencing domestic abuse or has been in that situation himself or herself knows that when one has to go into work with an injury, is afraid to go home or is worried that one's abuser will turn up at work, having access to statutory leave is really important.  People who work alongside someone in that situation or are approached, as a workplace representative, to assist such an individual, do not necessarily know what to do.  Everybody wants to help but there is no process cast in stone to which one can point.  In some instances, there might be somebody in human resources who has a particular understanding of the issue, in which case one could advise the person experiencing domestic abuse to approach that individual.  If there is nobody like that in a workplace, there is no concrete procedure towards which people can be pointed.  There must be provision for statutory leave for people in that situation and that is why we located our legislative proposals in reference to the Organisation of Working Time Act.  We did so following intensive consultation and engagement, as I outlined, with advocacy groups, workers' representatives and survivors.</p>  <p>  It is our intention to move the Bill to Committee Stage and, in so doing, we hope we will enjoy the same non-opposition or support, whatever way one wants to put it, from the Government.  I welcome that the Government is conducting a consultation on the issues.  However, my fear is that it will add ten months to the process of getting these provisions into law.  We had statements on this issue in the House in recent weeks, during which many speakers talked about the need for action to be taken.  Consultation is important but, as I have outlined, we have already engaged in that consultation.  We are happy to share all the information we have with the Government.  This legislation is not something we just dreamt up.  It is not a proposal but a piece of very well-crafted legislation and it was drawn up following the process of consultation I described.  I urge the Government, rather than just not opposing the Bill, to support it and work with us, as we have committed to working with the Government, to ensure we make a real and meaningful difference in the lives of the people affected.  The men and women in a situation of domestic abuse and watching the debate this evening need to know that they have some concrete support and a statutory entitlement to leave.  They might need that support now or very soon and they should not have to wait many months for it.</p></speech>

The figures had been going down.  The Minister stated yesterday morning that 4,400 people were moved to permanent accommodation during the pandemic period.  We know this is because of the volume of surplus Airbnb accommodation that came on board.  As I said, however, the numbers remain high.  The first problem is that we have a revolving door such that for each family housed, another family becomes homeless.  Second, housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies do not provide permanent accommodation, it being at the whim of landlords whether they remove tenants from the tenancy because they are moving family members in or selling the home.  As a consequence, the homeless figure has been stubbornly high throughout the recent period.</p>  <p>  The new data show that 4,495 single adults were classified as homeless countrywide, including 3,051 in Dublin.  In the corresponding week in September, 4,452 adults were registered homeless, 2,994 of them in Dublin.  The figures climbed steadily in the capital for five months, with the previous high being 2,906 in March.  Over the period of the pandemic, the number of single people becoming homeless has increased significantly.</p> <p>This is due to the Covid pandemic and family problems with overcrowding.  Last month's figures were 93% higher than they were in December 2015.  The Minister has claimed Housing First will solve this problem.  Housing First has been in operation for the past five years but it has not solved the problem.</p> <p> There is also the case of those sleeping rough.  I heard the Minister yesterday say that no one would be denied safe and secure accommodation, even if they are not habitually living in the area in which they are seeking accommodation.  Last night, however, three men were refused accommodation of shelter because they were not living habitually in the Dublin area.  One of the men in question, who was from Galway, had come to Dublin and was sleeping in the Phoenix Park.  He had got his social welfare transferred to Dublin.  When Mendicity rang looking for accommodation for him, the organisation was told that as the individual in question was not on the Dublin city housing list, he was not able to access homeless services.  Three people were told last night to sleep on the streets.  That is horrendous.  I heard today that this has changed.  However, I would like to hear from the horse's mouth as to how this has changed given that last night the Lord Mayor of Dublin would not allow an emergency motion on the agenda dealing with this, claiming it was a legislative problem not a question of bureaucracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="21:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800054#EEE00200"><p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for raising these important issues.  I am deeply sorry to hear of those particular incidents which she raised.</p>  <p>  It is a matter the Government is taking seriously.  In addressing homelessness, our approach is to prevent it, where possible, and to provide support services for those who need them, invest in housing and move people out of homelessness.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of deaths in recent months of people who had been sleeping rough or accessing emergency homeless accommodation.  Each of these deaths is a tragedy.  I extend my sympathies to the families and friends of those concerned.  It is important that the people affected are treated with dignity and respect.  All Members will be mindful of such sensitivities.</p>  <p>  In order to provide a better understanding, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and the HSE have jointly commissioned a detailed review of recent deaths in homeless services.  It is important that we establish the facts and that we base our response, as policymakers and elected representatives, on the best knowledge and evidence available.  This review will build on previous research conducted in this area, including a study published in January 2019 on the mortality of homeless people in the Dublin region.</p>  <p>  Separate to this work, the Department of Health has commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a one-year feasibility study to collect data on deaths among people who were homeless.  I have been advised that the research will apply the methodology used to compile the national drug-related deaths index, which is a census of drug-related deaths, including deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to an increase in homelessness in putting forward this matter for debate.  There was an increase of 81 persons who are homeless in the most recent published figures, which are for the month of October.  However, it is important to acknowledge the progress being made.  The total number of homeless individuals in October 2020 was recorded as 8,737.  This is a decrease of 1,777 people on the total recorded in October 2019.</p>  <p>  While these homeless figures are still too high, they are down year-on-year by 17%.  The most recent data show that family homelessness continued to fall in the past month and is at the lowest level seen since June 2016.  It is still vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported into permanent housing solutions while those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need.</p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is also essential.  This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of emergency accommodation.  Critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.  The DRHE outreach team works 365 days per year up to 1 a.m. in supporting rough sleepers to access emergency accommodation.  In undertaking this task, the clear and unambiguous approach taken is to work with the individuals to assess their immediate needs and work with them to cease their rough sleeping.</p>  <p>  As we move further into the winter months, cold weather arrangements are in place nationally.  In the Dublin region, the DRHE, which has responsibility for over 70% of all homeless persons nationally, has assured the Minister that sufficient capacity exists in services to ensure no person should sleep outside for the need of an emergency bed.</p>  <p>  I want also to take the opportunity to place on record my gratitude to the staff of our local authorities and to our service delivery partners in the NGO sector.  Their work during a difficult operational year, as we have also dealt with Covid-19, has been extraordinary.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, the programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs.  It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, to ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided.  Housing First is now supporting over 450 former rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation in their own homes.  Research is currently under way to support the expansion of the targets for this programme.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has established a high level homelessness task force, which is feeding into the implementation of the programme for Government.  The recent deaths in homeless services were specifically discussed at the most recent meeting of the task force in November.</p>  <p>  Key to addressing homelessness is an increase in supply.  The Government has committed to the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes.  We will increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000 with an emphasis on new builds.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Collins and others in the House of the work being done collectively and collaboratively to address the homelessness issue.</p></speech>

I listened to him yesterday morning on the radio making the point that 4,400 families were homed permanently over the last period of the pandemic and it will be 6,000 next year.  That 4,400 families were found homes during the pandemic was precisely because of the number of former Airbnb properties that came into the system on foot of the fall in travelling and tourism.  We will not have that next year.</p>  <p>  Where is the Minister going to get 6,000 homes to move people from homelessness into homes?  If they are rented homes, they are not permanent as the landlords can remove people from those homes if they need to.</p>  <p>  The whole question of the eviction ban during the pandemic should be looked at.  In August, when it finished, 13 families in Dublin became homeless for the first time in the private rental market.  We will see more of this happening if we do not put an eviction ban in place.  Will the Minister seriously consider this?</p>  <p>  Three people were told last night by homeless services in Dublin city that they were not entitled to accommodation when beds were available.  They had to sleep rough last night in Baltic weather.  That was just absolutely horrendous.  We cannot allow this to happen.  We had the same situation five years ago when Jonathan Corrie died across the road from here, while many others have died in between.  We have always raised our voices in horror and concern but it still happens.  Last year, it was 36 people.  This year already it is 59 people and we have not really hit the winter season.  I am expecting the Minister to step up to the plate now.  His honeymoon period is over and he must show how he will deal with this question.  Shelters are not just for winter or for Christmas.  Accommodation is for life.</p></speech>

It is right that homelessness, along with the challenges we face in addressing it, are discussed here today.  The death of any person accessing homeless services is a matter of deep concern to us all.  I want to express my sympathies again to the families and friends of loved ones who have found themselves in such tragic circumstances.  I also want to recognise the work being done on the ground by local authorities, service providers and NGOs.</p>  <p>  We need to know more about the deaths of the people availing of homeless services.  It is right that the review is being undertaken.  I want to reiterate that addressing homelessness is a priority for the Government.  We are investing in additional resources.  Significant numbers of households continue to exit homelessness and to own a home each month.  We will continue to build on the good work already being done in this area.  I recognise that behind all statistics and figures are human beings or real people.  We must not forget this.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and our Department is taking this matter seriously.  I take on board the Deputy's point on the eviction ban.  It has been an effective emergency measure.  We will certainly give consideration to the matters raised about Airbnb properties.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We are making every effort with our partners, local government and the NGOs to ensure we reduce homelessness and eliminate it if possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1557" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800055#FFF00800"><p>I will begin my remarks by acknowledging and thanking the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for his announcement this morning of &euro;2.5 million for swimming pools throughout the country.  Bailieborough leisure centre and swimming pool and Cavan leisure centre were recipients of this and we know how desperately they need this funding.</p>  <p>  On a more pressing matter, I have to begin by commiserating with the Galway players and management team who found themselves in a most difficult situation on Sunday.  Before the all-Ireland semi-final commenced, they were seriously disadvantaged by having no warm-up time, which is an essential for any team's pre-match preparations.  Everything was rushed for Galway, which did not allow for proper mental or physical preparation before that defining match.  The teams were not on a level playing field.  I must acknowledge that the Galway players trained and prepared all year for last Sunday's all-Ireland semi-final only to be let down by circumstances that could have been prevented.  They were the real losers this weekend and my heart goes out to them.  There are no second chances for this group of talented sportswomen.</p>  <p>  Why was the game moved to Dublin when Limerick became unavailable?  Semple Stadium had been made available as an alternative venue.  Surely Thurles was nearer for both teams and the decision to bring the game to Parnell Park needs an explanation.  For me this is a core part of the problem.  Last year, as the Minister of State is well aware, 56,000 people attended the final in lashing rain.  However, this weekend, because of the sudden change, TG4, which does tremendous work to promote peil na mban so strongly, was unable to televise it.  Viewers and supporters were also let down and I can only imagine how the families of these players must have felt, given their disappointment at not being able to watch the game.  The image of the ladies' game has been tarnished by questionable decision making in the lead-up to the game.  The GAA, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association need to work together for the betterment of their players.</p>  <p>  The original change to this match was caused by five Cork dual players being unable to play due to a clash between camogie and ladies football the previous weekend.  Communication is an important part of all of this.  Perhaps considering the curtailed and condensed season this year, an issue was likely to occur.  However, a recurrence cannot be countenanced as it threatens the image and perception of the game.  At the heart of sport is equality and this needs to be central in how women's football and women's sport in general are catered for.  I intend to pursue further the imbalance that exists in expenses for male and female GAA players but that is for another day.  It is something I hope to do with the Oireachtas committee.</p>  <p>  The organisations under the GAA umbrella that govern men's football, ladies' football and camogie need to work together to prevent issues such as this happening again.  It brings into sharp focus the larger question, which is funding for ladies GAA games.  The GAA does tremendous work and was at the forefront during the pandemic, and we have evidence of this throughout the country, with regard to how its members got into their vans and brought food to people living in more isolated areas in the community.  The GAA came together and was to the forefront in helping to support many less well-off and more vulnerable people in our communities.  We know the GAA men's games attract funding of more than &euro;3 million, which is wonderful.  The Ladies Gaelic Football Association, by comparison, receives &euro;700 million and, of course, the ladies have a lot to do with regard to their own travel and physio-----</p></speech>

What she said about sport being about equality is everything we have sought to negotiate in the programme for Government.  Our overall vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential, while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  With specific regard to the ladies games, there has been commentary recently on State funding disparity and the events last weekend surrounding the ladies football semi-final between Cork and Galway.</p>  <p>  In relation to the semi-final, it goes without saying that the situation that arose was both disappointing and regrettable.  Clearly, the State has no role or involvement in venue and fixture arrangements for any sport, but serious lessons need to be learned from what the Deputy has outlined and to prevent a recurrence.  Sporting organisations are operating in specific difficulties and this has to be taken into account.  As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I agree with what the Deputy has said.  We need to encourage closer collaboration and co-operation between all of the associations in the Gaelic games family and what happened on Sunday should not happen again.</p>  <p>  In relation to State funding, I am committed to narrowing and eliminating the current funding gap between the Women's Gaelic Players Association and the Gaelic Players Association.  Future Government decisions regarding these player support schemes will also be informed by the outcome of an independent review of these schemes commissioned by Sport Ireland that is under way.  There is, in my view, a strong case for the development of a common funding approach and framework to guide an equitable distribution of such funding in the future.  I have already discussed this matter with Sport Ireland and I am committed to ensuring that it is progressed in the short term in tandem with the review.  We have to have equality, as the Deputy referenced.</p>  <p>  A fundamental aim of the Government's National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups, including women and girls.  Addressing women's participation at all levels in sport is a key element of the national sports policy.  A lot of work is happening and good progress is being made, not just in terms of increasing participation by women and girls but in the important areas of leadership and management roles in sport.  It is imperative to make quick progress towards a much greater gender balance on the boards of national governing bodies, for example, and this is not happening quickly enough.  We need to put everything on the table, including, for example, the possibility of gender quotas.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work that is being done by the national governing bodies and the network of local sports partnerships in developing programmes and contributing to the increase in the number of women and girls taking part in sport.  The number of women participating in sport in Ireland is continuing to grow and, at 3.4%, the gender gap in sports participation is narrower now than at any point over the past ten years.  This is progress and the Government is determined to see that gap eliminated altogether.</p>  <p>  The women in sport programme was established in 2005 and to date more than &euro;20 million has been invested through the national governing bodies of sport and the network of local sports partnerships around the country.  A key aim of the women in sport investment programme is to have equal participation between males and females in sport.  As part of Sport Ireland's new women in sport policy, which was launched last year, a revised women in sport investment programme was put in place, involving the provision of funding to national governing bodies on a multiannual basis.  A total of &euro;3 million was invested over 2019 and 2020, doubling the previous funding for the women in sport programme.  A further &euro;265,000 was invested in the local sports partnerships under the women in sport programme.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland will reopen applications under the programme in 2021 with the intention of issuing a second cycle of multiannual funding.  All national governing bodies will have an opportunity to apply for funding under the women in sport programme.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned, Sport Ireland launched its policy in 2019.  It is the express commitment of Sport Ireland and the Government that we build on the work that has been undertaken and address the funding challenges referenced by the Deputy, and the organisational challenges in Gaelic games and what the Deputy has outlined. </p></speech>

Players and management listening in will be heartened by what he has said.</p> <p>I have to acknowledge the work of Justin McCarthy of RT&Eacute;, who did much research and interviewed many of the players.  We have heard them talking very publicly and very honestly about their own experience.  Of course, many of them are working and studying in cities like Dublin, Galway and Cork but are from more rural counties, like my own county of Cavan, and are perhaps travelling two or three nights a week.  It is not acceptable that men&rsquo;s GAA would be remunerated for any expenses the men incur for that commitment and dedication, and the women are not given equal respect in terms of the expense that is incurred by them.  We also heard players say that when they have an injury or have physio, that comes out of their own pocket, unlike the guidelines that are in place for men in the GAA, for whom that is all taken care of and looked after.</p> <p> There is a big onus on us, as a Government, to ensure there is a level playing field.  Given the big disparity that exists, we need to close that gap and create a level playing field for women and men.</p> <p> Players make huge sacrifices.  I would also make the point that many of them have families and small children and they make huge commitment to their team.  They do it for their team, their community, their club and their county.  It is a passion and a vocation.  They should be valued in the same as men in the GAA.  I do not in any way suggest that men should not get what they get, of course they should, but women who demonstrate the same dedication to our national game should be valued in the same way.</p> <p> It would be remiss of me not to mention Aisling Sheridan from Mullahoran, County Cavan, who is about to fly back to Australia.  She is a member of the Cavan Ladies Gaelic Football Association but she also plays Australian rules for Collingwood football club and she heads back to Australia tomorrow.  That kind of dedication is exemplary and needs to be encouraged.</p></speech>

I admire players like Aisling Sheridan for their dedication to their county, and we have had many across the codes who have been on both sides of the world.</p>  <p>  I agree we need a level playing field when it comes to this issue.  That is why we are trying to pursue a common framework in the context of the review by Sport Ireland.  We want to see the issue around governance and leadership at board level addressed by many of the national governing bodies, NGBs.  Some NGBs have below 10% on their boards, which is not sustainable and is not something we, as a Government, can support if they continue with that position.  That has to be part of the conversation as well.</p>  <p>  In terms of the broader Gaelic games associations, we need better co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration across fixtures and across how games are organised.  I have been involved with my local Gaelic games club from a young age.  In my club, it is one club across camogie, ladies football, men&rsquo;s football and handball.  Everyone operates collectively, with equality at the heart of it, and promoting all of the games equally.  We would not have seen happen what manifested nationally in recent days in many of our local clubs.</p>  <p>  That is why we need to see greater co-operation across the associations and it is why we have already discussed this.  When I met Sport Ireland, I raised this as a key issue in terms of the funding approach.  The current position certainly sends the wrong signal to women, girls and people who want to see and play our national games.  There should be a common funding approach.  That is something we are committed to as part of the review and, hopefully, we will work with Deputy Smyth&rsquo;s Oireachtas committee to achieve that collective aim.  We want to see the current gap dealt with properly.  That is a core objective of our national sports policy and something I am committed to pursuing in a proper way.  We have engaged on this with the women in sport committee of Sport Ireland, which has looked at this in a really forensic way.  We support it and the 20x20 campaign, which is a key objective for Government.</p></speech>

People are going to be understandably impatient and they are going to want as much information as possible.  How and when they are going to get it will be crucial if we want to keep people with us as we roll out this vaccine.</p>  <p>  It is simply extraordinary what science has managed to achieve in discovering the new RNA vaccine technology and that it has been able to develop this within the period since the beginning of this year.  While it is absolutely unprecedented in terms of scientific achievement, we now have an equal challenge in terms of the logistics of the delivery of the vaccine.  It is a logistical challenge like none of us has ever seen before, a logistical challenge that is only comparable to the effort around the Second World War.  The volume, the scale and the urgency of the roll-out of this vaccine is unprecedented.  I urge the Government to be as transparent as possible at the earliest stage in regard to how people are going to get it.</p></speech>

It is important that we acknowledge the work of everyone involved in this matter, in particular the National Immunisation Advisory Committee for its recommendations.</p>  <p>  I agree with my colleague about transparency.  This is going to be quite a complex roll-out because it is not just one round of vaccinations.  There will be a second round, as I understand it.  It is important, therefore, that records are kept and that they are carefully structured.  I have not seen yet how this is going to be managed during the roll-out to make sure records are carefully kept of who has received the vaccine before the second round occurs.  It is important there is clarification on that.</p>  <p>  I note we are talking about people who are vulnerable, especially people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, who are the No. 1 priority.  There are also those working in the healthcare sector.  That includes everyone in the healthcare sector, the doctors, nurses and care assistants, but also the people who are on the ground in healthcare facilities.  They also need to be prioritised because they provide a major contribution in making sure healthcare is delivered, whether that is porters, cleaning staff or administrative staff.  It is extremely important they are included when we talk about healthcare workers in all of that area.</p>  <p>  To conclude, we need clarification in regard to the record keeping and how that is going to be monitored as we roll out this vaccine.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to the roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccination programme as soon as suitable products have been authorised and supplies are available.  In this regard, a high-level task force has recently been established, under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith, to support and oversee the development and implementation of the programme.  The task force is working on a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan, and aims to submit this by Friday, 11 December.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will then bring the output of the task force's work to Government for consideration, and subject to the outcome of this discussion, it is the intention that the vaccination strategy and implementation plan will be published.</p>  <p>  Today, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, announced the allocation strategy for Covid-19 vaccines, following sign-off from Cabinet.  The allocation process that should apply to the vaccination of the population is based on the advice of national experts on immunisation and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  The Covid-19 vaccine allocation strategy is based on a Department of Health and National Immunisation Advisory Committee paper.  It sets out a provisional priority list of groups for vaccination once a safe and effective vaccine has received authorisation from the European Medicines Agency.  This paper was endorsed by NPHET on 3 December.</p> <p> In terms of procurement of vaccines, Ireland is taking part in a procurement exercise being operated by the European Commission on behalf of member states to procure suitable, safe and effective vaccines, in sufficient quantities, to combat Covid-19.  Although Ireland has secured large numbers of doses of candidate vaccines, the initial availability will be limited if authorised for use.  Therefore, a prioritisation strategy had to be developed.</p> <p> So far, Ireland has opted into five advance purchase agreements, APA, with pharmaceutical companies and a process is in place to opt into a sixth APA.  Covid-19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation.  No vaccine will be used until market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p> <p> Ireland, similar to all other member states, is awaiting conditional market authorisation by the EMA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and other vaccine candidates such as Moderna and AstraZeneca.  It has been agreed at EU level that this is the most appropriate process regarding those new and rapidly-developed vaccines.</p> <p> The EMA has stated that it wishes to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is assured and matches EU standards.</p></speech>

I believe in people's minds that has already happened and they are planning when access to the vaccine might happen for them.  In that sense what I am saying about the how and the when becomes important.  There may be ways in which we can use the technology we have, such as the Covid tracker app, for people to be able to register an interest, select their location and get a sense of where the centres will be located.  Are we going to rely on existing architecture with pharmacists, GPs or hospitals, or create additional architecture that enables us to get through this logistical challenge much more quickly?  Those are all the questions people will have and we could get to a point mid-way through next year where we end up with some unrest if we have not provided real clarity on the how and the when for people at every stage.  Ultimately, the vaccine will not be truly successful until enough people have got it to stop the spread of the virus and prevent serious illness and death.  I thank the Minister of State for all his work on it.</p></speech>

I again raise the issue of the record keeping and how that will be completed.  It is important that clarification on that is given at a very early stage.  Whether people do or do not have medical cards, across the board we need to have careful records kept of who is getting the vaccine and who must get it the second time around, if that is the procedure that will be adopted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.451" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800057#HHH00400"><p>We all agree that recent news from the vaccine developers is a beacon of hope after a very difficult year.  Vaccination is a hugely effective intervention for saving lives and promoting good health.  The safety and effectiveness of vaccines is our absolute priority and any Covid-19 vaccine administered in Ireland will have to be authorised by the European Medicines Agency.</p>  <p>  While we await news on whether these vaccines comply with all the EMA's requirement of quality, safety and efficacy, the Government had been working ahead on plans for the roll-out of vaccines.  A key part of the roll-out will be ensuring that those most vulnerable to Covid-19 will receive vaccinations first.  Given the country's experience with Covid-19 to date and the risk that vulnerable people and those in front-line roles in health and social care services continue to face, it is only right that they are prioritised in the allocation of the vaccine.  The Government has followed the advice from our leading medical experts to guide us through this process.</p></speech>

The denial of basic shelter and hygiene facilities, and for the avoidance of any doubt that is access to a toilet, for these workers is nothing short of a disgrace.  They are left waiting out in the freezing cold and the rain while their students take the test in the instructor's car.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, will not let them use these basic facilities in the course of their work.  I will quote what some of the workers are saying in their own words.  One worker called Laura, who works on the north side of Dublin, stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It is a daily stress and humiliation to have to revolve my work schedule around how often I can travel home to use a toilet - especially at certain times of the month.  I find I&rsquo;m constantly dehydrated too because I&rsquo;m trying not to consume liquids in case, I can&rsquo;t find a toilet in an emergency, depending where I am on any given day.  As a result of all this, I have had to reduce the number of students I can teach per day, which in turn has had a very negative impact on my finances.  It&rsquo;s not fair to have this added stress in work during a pandemic, especially coming up to Christmas. </blockquote>  <p>Another worker, Dominic, in Dublin, summed it up when he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Why has the department of transport classified driving instructor's as essential workers and then made their profession, health and dignity nonessential.  When is the Minister going to take the RSA in hand and insist that they find a solution to this easily fixed problem?  Why is the RSA controlled service of NCT'S different to driving test centres?  Can the Minister explain how test applicants without private cars should sit their tests, if the Minister insists that instructors are not required at test centres? </blockquote>  <p>I have been writing to the senior Minister for months and every single time they kick it back to the RSA and every single time the RSA does nothing.  It is absolutely Baltic outside at the moment but even if it was not, they would still need to use the toilet.</p></speech>

The response to date has been totally inadequate.  Driving instructors have been treated with contempt.  Simple, low-cost and no-cost solutions are available but they have not been availed of.  When I put this matter to the chair of the RSA, Liz O'Donnell, last week, she said that driving instructors were not allowed access to test centres but neither were mammies and daddies.  That reflects the type of contempt I am talking about.  I pointed out to Ms O'Donnell that driving instructors are not mammies and daddies.  It is not once or twice in a lifetime that they need to cross the threshold of a testing centre.  It is every day, if they were allowed to do it.</p>  <p>  Driving instructors are essential workers who have worked through the pandemic with considerably less social distancing than many other workers are afforded and they deserve dignity and respect.  To be locked out of centres where they cannot access toilet or hygiene facilities is unacceptable and a ridiculously strict interpretation of the rules.  I do not believe any of us would be happy to have to stand outside the door of Leinster House in the freezing wind and rain between debates here or knock on doors on Merrion Square asking people to let us in to use their toilets because they are banned from using the ones here.  No one would put up with that.  The Minister of State would not put up with it but she expects driving instructors to put up with it.  That is unacceptable.  I ask her to outline what has been done on this issue since the last time I raised it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-12-08a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800057#HHH00700"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising the matter in regard to access to hygiene and health facilities for approved driving instructors at driver test centres.</p>  <p>  Both the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority are aware that driving instructors disagree with the decision by the RSA to close washing facilities and waiting rooms in driver test centres to ensure compliance with public and occupational health requirements during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority that prior to the current pandemic, some test centres across the country offered toilet facilities and, in some cases, indoor waiting rooms where instructors could choose to wait while their students were out undergoing their test.  To be clear, some test centres around the country do not and have never had large waiting rooms or toilet facilities available for instructors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, driver testing is continuing under the current level 3 restrictions.  The Road Safety Authority has been presented with the challenge of facilitating tests while at the same time safeguarding the safety of its staff and the public, minimising the risk of spreading the virus.</p> <p>The safety of staff and test candidates is of paramount importance and this is highlighted by the range of steps taken to prevent virus transmission in the driver testing service.  Some 60,000 tests have been conducted since tests resumed and no known case of virus transmission has been reported.</p> <p> I understand that, at present, toilet facilities at test centres are only available to the learner driver who is undertaking his or her driving test.  There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the test centres for either the learner or the instructor.  The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester where the identity of the learner driver is established and preliminary test questions are concluded.  Following this, the practical examination takes place.  The test concludes back in the testing centre where the driver tester delivers the results and provides feedback to the candidate.</p> <p> The case being made by the approved driving instructors is that they should have access to public areas of the test centre.  This would have the effect of introducing third parties into the test centre without the robust controls in place for test candidates being undertaken.  Twenty of the current 53 driving test centres are in shared premises over which the RSA does not control right of access.  There are other instances where the RSA controls access, such as the Finglas test centre.  This is one of the largest test centres, and up to 14 driver testers work there daily.  There is no service officer on duty to control access to the centre so if access were to be granted to approved driving instructors and accompanying drivers, any member of the public would be able to walk in, thus breaching the public safety measures in place.</p> <p> In this House on 12 November, I made a commitment that I would contact the RSA on this matter.  I can now confirm that I have received a comprehensive reply from the authority, outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures.  The decision to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities, where previously available, has been taken by the RSA in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans.  It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF.</p> <p> I assure the Deputies that this is not a decision that has been taken lightly.  I am sure that they will agree that the health and safety of workers, such as those in driving test centres, should be our priority.  The RSA is committed to ensuring that once the levels of risk are diminished to the extent that would allow ADIs and others to access test centres, this will be facilitated.  The situation is continually monitored by the RSA and reviewed subject to any change to current Government guidance.</p></speech>

I like the bit where the Minister of State describes taking a driving test.  I think we all know how that happens.  The Minister of State talks about the need to protect the building and the health and safety of the workers.  We are not seeking to put anyone's health and safety at risk.  We are talking about the health and safety of the men and women who are assisted driving instructors.</p>  <p>  If the Minister of State is not prepared to accept the word of the workers so that they can access and egress safely, will she consider the installation of welfare hubs as has been done in Britain to provide these facilities?  That would protect the people inside the building and also provide a health and safety and welfare place for these people.  If one contemplates what it would be like to have to stand outside in current temperatures for an hour, much less being unable to use the toilet, one would conclude that workers should be entitled to take access to a toilet for granted in the course of their work.  It is a little embarrassing for the Minister of State and Government that this is not the only case where Opposition Deputies have had to come in to make a plea on behalf of workers who did not have access to a toilet.</p></speech>

I'm always in and around the test centre so I relied on the facilities </blockquote>  <p>Darragh in Dublin stated: &quot;From my experience I don't expect the RSA to care about me as a driving instructor.&quot;  I echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly.  I think the Minister of State has asked the RSA the wrong question.  The RSA should have been asked to tell the Minister of State how it will deliver on the basic requirement of providing facilities for drivers, not if it has them within the existing constraints.  There should be a mandate from the Government to deliver on those basic requirements, not for the RSA to tell the Government that it does not exist within what it has or to outline and detail the constraints that it has to live with.  It should be obliged to provide these facilities.  There are ways to deliver it which are low-cost.  They are basic conditions.  Every building site in Ireland, for example, would deliver the type of welfare facility that Deputy O'Reilly has mentioned.  It is a basic facility and should be delivered.</p></speech>

Covid-19 has been disruptive to a number of settings.  This is an operational matter for the RSA and driving instructors operate as independent businesses.  They are not employed by either the Department of Transport or the Road Safety Authority.  Driver testers are direct employees of the Road Safety Authority and, like any employer, the Road Safety Authority has a duty of care to those employees.  That is why it has had to develop protocols to allow testers to carry out their job in as safe a manner as possible.  The decision to close waiting rooms and restrict access to washing facilities has been taken by the RSA to safeguard staff and public alike in line with these protocols.  It follows the approach taken by many organisations where access traditionally granted to members of the public to use staff facilities has been withdrawn for the protection of public health.  While the authority recognises that this may be inconvenient for partners, family members and indeed driving instructors who accompany learner drivers to their tests, the fact is that if more people enter a building, there is a greater risk of Covid spreading.  The safety of staff and the public in general must remain the Road Safety Authority's number one priority at this time.</p></speech>
